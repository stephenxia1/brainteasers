Grandmas and Trolls,"You are on your way to visit your Grandma, who lives at the end of the valley. It's her birthday, and you want to give her the cakes you've made.
Between your house and her house, you have to cross 7 bridges, and as it goes in the land of make believe, there is a troll under every bridge! Each troll, quite rightly, insists that you pay a troll toll. Before you can cross their bridge, you have to give them half of the cakes you are carrying, but as they are kind trolls, they each give you back a single cake.
How many cakes do you have to leave home with to make sure that you arrive at Grandma's with exactly 2 cakes?","2: At each bridge you are required to give half of your cakes, and you receive one back. Which leaves you with 2 cakes after every bridge.",,3.22,1.39
The Troll Bridge 3,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A judge named Oscar came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote 26 equations on a rock: A=1, B=2, and so on until Z=26.
""Today's password is the name of a woman,"" said the troll. ""The woman's name has the same 'product' as the word JUDGE, that is, 10*21*4*7*5. It also has the same number of letters as JUDGE. However it has no letters in common with JUDGE.""
""When the first and second letters in the woman's name are switched around, the letters are in alphabetical order.""
""Finally,"" said the troll, ""the woman's name does not contain the letter C because I despise the number 3.""
So, what is the password? And why couldn't the troll use similar rules to create a password using the name OSCAR rather than the word JUDGE?","The password is FANNY.
The woman's name cannot contain G or U, so since 14 is the only other multiple of 7 to be less than or equal to 26, the name must contain two N's. Dividing by 14 twice, we get 10*3*5.
Since two of these numbers are divisible by 5, the name must contain either two letters divisible by 5 or one letter divisible by 25. It obviously cannot contain E or J. It cannot contain T because 10*3*5 is not divisible by 20. It cannot contain O because dividing 10*3*5 by 15 gives us 10, which would mean that E or J is in the name. So it must contain Y. Dividing by 25 gives us 2*3.
2*3 is one of only two pairs of numbers that multiplies to give us 6, the other being 1*6. So the remaining two letters must be either B and C or A and F. But since C is not in the password, the remaining two letters must be A and F.
Putting the five letters in order, we get AFNNY. Switching around the first two letters, we get FANNY.
The reason why the troll couldn't use similar rules to create a password using the name OSCAR is because S is the 19th letter of the alphabet, and 19 is a prime number and the only number less than or equal to 26 to be a multiple of 19.","1. It is unnecessary, and even inconvenient, to multiply 10*21*4*7*5.

Different Equals,"Can you share 1/4 of a pie, 1/3 of a pie, 1/2 of a pie, 2/3 of a pie, 3/4 of a pie, and a whole pie so that two people have the same amount of pie without making any cuts?
If so, how?","Yes; 1/3 + 2/3 + 1/4 + 1/2 = 1 + 3/4

The Length of the Train,"Al and Ben are standing back to back next to a railroad track. When the front of a train passes them, Al starts to walk in the opposite direction of the train, while Ben starts to walk in the same direction as the train. Each stops walking when the back of the train passes him. If the two of them walk at the same speed, and Al walks exactly 30 feet, and Ben walks exactly 45 feet, how long is the train?","The train is 180 feet long.
When the back of the train passes Al, he and Ben have both walked 30 feet, meaning Ben will walk 15 feet more when the train passes him. 30 feet that Al walks plus 45 feet that Ben walks makes 75 feet that the back of the train travels in the same time that Ben walks 15 feet, meaning the train is 5 times as fast as Al and Ben.
In the time it takes Al to walk 30 feet, the front of the train moves 150 feet. This distance plus the 30 feet that Al has walked equals 180 feet.",,3.18,3.0

Aunt's Ol' Jalopy,"After visiting my Great Aunt Annie, I travelled home in her old jalopy. The car was old and battered, it had a leak from the petrol tank, and I was stuck in second gear.
This meant that I could only travel along at a steady 30 miles per hour and managed a paltry 20 miles per gallon of fuel.
At the start of the journey I had placed exactly 10 gallons of fuel into the tank. I knew though, that the fuel tank lost fuel at the rate of half a gallon per hour.
Just as I arrived home, the car stopped because it had run out of fuel and I had only just made it.
How far was it from my Great Aunt's to my home?","150 miles.
I was travelling at 30mph at a rate of 20mpg, so I was using 1.5 gallons every hour for the driving itself.  I was also losing 0.5 gallon every hour, so in total, I was using 2 gallons every hour.  Therefore to use all of the 10 gallons I started with, I travelled for 5 hours.
5 hours at 30mph is 150 miles.",,3.13,1.68
Party Handshakes,"There are a large number of people at a party. As there naturally are a lot of people who haven't met each other before, numerous handshakes occur. Assume that each individual handshake occurs between exactly two people.
Are there an even or odd number of people at the party who shook hands with an odd number of people?","There must be an EVEN number of people who shook hands with an odd number of people. For convenience I will refer to that number as X and the number of people any individual person has shaken hands with as their handshake number.
Begin with nobody having shaken hands with each other. X is equal to zero and is therefore even. (Everyone's handshake number is zero, which is even.) There are now three cases to consider when any two people shake hands.
A: Both of their handshake numbers are odd.
X decreases by two as both people no longer have an odd handshake number.
B: Both of their handshake numbers are even.
X increases by two as both people now have an odd handshake number.
C: One handshake number is odd and the other is even.
X does not change.
As X starts as an even number and can only increase or decrease by an even number, it will always be even.",,3.12,2.23
The Froopaloop Island Ferry,"Every two hours, a ferry leaves Froopaloop Island and heads due east to the mainland, taking exactly one hour. Then it leaves the mainland and heads due west back to the island, again taking exactly one hour. Then it repeats.
Instead of taking the ferry to Froopaloop Island, Heather prefers to do something very risky: she dons her gorgeous white bikini and swims to the island. (The inhabitants of the island don't know what she looks like with clothes on.)
One day, Heather left the mainland terminal at exactly the same time the ferry left the island terminal. Exactly 50 minutes later, the ferry passed her.
Assuming both Heather and the ferry travel at a constant speed, and ignoring the time the ferry spends at the mainland terminal, how much time passed between the ferry passing Heather in the opposite direction and passing her in the same direction?","Twenty-five minutes passed.
When the ferry first passes Heather, it still has 10 minutes to reach the mainland, which means it can travel the same distance in 10 minutes that Heather can in 50 minutes, and therefore is 5 times as fast.
If the distance between the two terminals is x, and the distance Heather has travelled when the ferry passes her the second time is y, then the distance the ferry would have travelled at that time is x+y. Therefore, x+y=5x, which means that y=4x. Since x takes 60 minutes for the ferry, y must take 15 minutes, and x+y must take 75 minutes.
Therefore, the time between Heather leaving the mainland and the ferry passing her for the second time is 75 minutes, and the time between the first and second times the ferry passed her is 75-50, or 25, minutes.","Fifty minutes after leaving the island terminal, the ferry will go in the opposite direction of Heather.",3.09,2.09
Sum-day Soon,"Some people believe that January 1, 2000 is the first day of the 21st century. Other people believe that the honor belongs to January 1, 2001. But everyone should agree that January 1, 2002 is the first ""sum-day"" of the new century- when you write out that date in standard notation, it becomes 01/01/02, and 1+1=2. More generally, a sum-day is a date in which the day and month add up to the year. With that in mind:
A) What is the last sum-day of the 21st century?
B) How many sum-days are there in the 21st century?","A) The last sum-day of the 21st century is December 31, 2043, because 12+31=43, and both the month and day are as big as possible.
B) This one is much easier than you might think. The correct answer is 365, because every day in a standard (non-leap) year is part of a sum-day for some year. For example, November 26 is a sum-day for the year 2037, because 11+26=37. The only date for which this principle doesn't work is the leap day, February 29. That's because 2+29=31, but 2031 is not a leap year.",,3.03,2.23

Number Tricks,"Ms. Arroyo asked the class to see if they could find the sum of the first 50 odd numbers. As everyone settled down to their addition, Terry ran to her and said, ""The sum is 2,500."" Ms. Arroyo thought, ""Lucky guess,"" and gave him the task of finding the sum of the first 75 odd numbers. Within 20 seconds, Terry was back with the correct answer of 5,625.
How does Terry find the sum so quickly?","The following pattern holds: The sum is equal to n x n, when n is the number of consecutive odd numbers, starting with 1. For example, the sum of the first 3 odd numbers is equal to 3 x 3, or 9; the sum of the first 4 odd numbers is equal to 4 x 4, or 16; the sum of the first 5 odd numbers is equal to 5 x 5, or 25; and so on.","Consecutive odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7....

The Father of Algebra,"Diophantus was a Greek mathematician who lived in the third century.  He was one of the first mathematicians to use algebraic symbols.
Most of what is known about Diophantus's life comes from an algebraic riddle from around the early sixth century.  The riddle states:
Diophantus's youth lasted one sixth of his life.  He grew a beard after one twelfth more.  After one seventh more of his life, he married.  5 years later, he and his wife had a son.  The son lived exactly one half as long as his father, and Diophantus died four years after his son.
How many years did Diophantus live?","The riddle, the ""facts"" of which may or may not be true, results in the following equation:
x/6 + x/12 + x/7 + 5 + x/2 + 4 = x
where x is Diophantus's age at the time of his death.
Therefore, Diophantus lived exactly 84 years.",,2.98,1.99

Can you tell me the number I teach?  Here's a clue:
More than 20; below 32!","27
Solution:
The number of boys must be a multiple of 3 (3, 6, 9...) so that it can be split in the ratio of 2:1 (no watch:watch).
The number of girls is double the no. of boys (6, 12, 18...)

The Dishonest Grocer,"Quinn, Ralph, and Steve work at a grocery store that sells apples, bananas, and oranges. Quinn says, ""Seven apples and five bananas cost the same as six oranges."" Ralph says, ""Four apples and nine oranges cost the same as five bananas."" Steve says, ""Six oranges and three bananas cost the same as four apples."" Only one is lying...but who?","Quinn is lying.
Let a equal the price of apples, b equal the price of bananas, and o equal the price of oranges. Quinn is saying that 7a + 5b = 6o. Ralph is saying that 4a + 9o = 5b. Steve is saying that 6o + 3b = 4a.
Combining Quinn's and Ralph's statements, we get 11a = -3o. This is impossible.
Combining Ralph's and Steve's statements, we get 15o = 2b. This is possible.
Combining Quinn's and Steve's statements, we get 8b = -3a. This is impossible.
This means that either Quinn is lying, or Ralph and Steve are both lying. But there only can be one liar: obviously Quinn.","The three values equivalents must be considered in pairs.

Missing Price,"When I went to the store, I purchased four items. The following shows the cost of three of the items:
$1.50
$3.00
$4.00
The line to the checkout was pretty long, so to quench my boredom I started playing with my pocket calculator while waiting.
I found out, to my surprise, that the four prices of the four items I purchased added to the same number as I got when I multiplied the four prices together.
What was the price of the fourth item?","The three prices add to 1.50 + 3.00 + 4.00 = $8.50.
The three prices multiply to 1.50 x 3.00 x 4.00 = $18.00.
You might be able to see that adding another $0.50 will take the total to $9.00, and multiplying by another $0.50 will take the product to $9.00 also, but the answer can also be found using algebra. Let's call the unknown price P:
1.50 + 3.00 + 4.00 + P = 1.50 x 3.00 x 4.00 x P
8.50 + P = 18.00 x P

100 Closed Lockers,"Suppose you're in a hallway lined with 100 closed lockers.
You begin by opening every locker. Then you close every second locker. Then you go to every third locker and open it (if it's closed) or close it (if it's open).  Let's call this action toggling a locker. Continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n.  After 100 passes, where you toggle only locker #100, how many lockers are open?","Answer: 10 lockers are left open:
Lockers #1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.
Each of these numbers are perfect squares. This problem is based on the factors of the locker number.
Each locker is toggled by each factor; for example, locker #40 is toggled on pass number 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40.  That's eight toggles: open-closed-open-closed-open-closed-open-closed.
The only way a locker could be left open is if it is toggled an odd number of times. The only numbers with an odd number of factors are the perfect
squares. Thus, the perfect squares are left open.
For example, locker #25 is toggled on pass number 1, 5, and 25 (three toggles): open-closed-open.",,2.85,2.83
Parakeet Basketball,"Your favorite college basketball team, the Fighting Parakeets, is playing against a rival, but you haven't been able to see any of the game yet because you have been busy.  However, your brother was in a nearby room watching it.  Your brother sees a statistics display during the halftime break and decides to give you a trick math test.  You come into the room as the second half is beginning and see that your team is winning 32-29.  Your brother says, ""The Fighting Parakeets have scored on 18 shots.  They have made at least twice as many 2-point shots as free throws.  How many free throws, 2-pointers, and 3-pointers have they made?""  He thinks you will become confused in your figuring because he has not given you quite enough information to find the solution.  However, you could hear bits and pieces of the game from the next room while you were busy, and you happened to hear that your favorite Fighting Parakeets player nailed a long 3-point shot.  What is the answer to your brother's question?","5 free throws, 12 2-point shots, and 1 3-point shot.
Let x be the number of free throws made,
y be the number of 2-pointers made,
and z be the number of 3-pointers made.
From the score, you know (A): x + 2y + 3z = 32
From the quote, you know (B): x + y + z = 18
Multiply (B) by 3 to get (C): 3x + 3y + 3x = 54
Subtract (A) from (C) to get: 2x + y = 22, or (D): y = 22 - 2x
From the quote, you also know (E): 2x <= y
Substituting (D) into (E) gives: 2x <= 22 - 2x, or (F): x <= 5.5
If x=5, then from (D) you get y=12, and from (A) you get z=1.
If x=4, then y=14, and z=0.
If x=3, then y=16, and z=-1.  This is not possible because z cannot be negative.  If you continue decrementing x, then z will continue to decrease too.
So, you have two options that fit the criteria given by your brother:
5 free throws, 12 2-point shots, 1 3-point shot, or
4 free throws, 14 2-point shots, 0 3-point shots.

How old is Mimi?","Mimi is 15 (and Dad is 35).
This one is probably easiest to guess and check. There are lots of little clues that help narrow down the options to guess. You might like to write some of these in the comments section.
e.g. Dad's age must have been a multiple of 6 five years ago. His age was triple Mimi's and ten years later it would be a multiple of two. So it was a multiple of both 3 and 2.
Or you could use algebra:
Let m and d represent Mimi's and Dad's ages now.
1. d-5 = 3x(m-5)
2. d+5 = 2x(m+5)
d-5 = 3m-15   ... *1*
d+5 = 2m+10 ... *2*

1. From line 2: Total number of sailors is <100.
2. From lines 3 & 4: Let number of sailors sleeping in bunker 1 be X, then number of sailors sleeping in bunker 2 is 2X and in bunker 3 is 4X,
i.e. Total number of sailors = X+2X+4X = 7X and thus it is a multiple of 7.
3. From line 6: dancing in groups of fives means the total number is a product of 5.
4. From lines 7 & 8: 12 of the sailors drowned in the sea, leaving more than two third of the sailors alive, so the total number is > 36 (3 * 12).
Summing up all the above given information, the total number of sailors is <100 and >36, it divides by 7 and 5, which adds up to the total number of 70 sailors.

Slow and Stupid Wins the Race?,"Hare and Tortoise had to take a make-up class in math over the summer, a two-month, self-paced course with a test at the end of each of 12 chapters. The course requires a 70% grade to pass.
In the first month, they both had difficulties with the concepts. Hare averaged 60% on his exams; Tortoise averaged 50%. Owl, the supervisor, spent three days of the next week helping them with their difficulties.
It worked. In the second month, Hare averaged 90% on his exams; Tortoise averaged 80%.
However, Tortoise got a passing grade of 75% in the class; Hare failed with 65%. When Hare protested to Owl that he'd outscored Tortoise in both months, Owl made Hare do the math on the board -- and sign up for another make-up class, after school in the fall.
How did Tortoise pass while Hare flunked?","In the first month, Hare took 10 chapter tests; Tortoise took only 2. In the second month, Hare took his remaining 2 exams and Tortoise took the 10 he needed to finish.
Hare's average = (10*60 + 2*90) / 12 = 780/12 = 65

Being a thoughtful son, I chose a ring that would have sentimental value. As my mother called her children Ellen, David, Richard and Andy, I have chosen a ring with one of each stone, to represent her children's names.
How much will my ring containing 1 emerald, 1 diamond, 1 ruby and 1 amethyst cost me?","The three rings can be expressed as:
0E + 0A + 2R + 1D = £3,000
0E + 4A + 0R + 1D = £2,000

If we multiply the first line by 1.5 and divide the second line by 2, then total all three rings we get:
0E + 0A + 3R + 1.5D = £4,500
0E + 2A + 0R + .5D = £1,000
3E + 1A + 0R + 1D = £1,400

Bay State Basement   $70
CD Corner   $90
Don's Deli   $65

Gorgeous Candy Boutique   $25
Explanation:
Since the mean of all gift certificates is $80, and there are 7 stores, the total of all gift certificates is $560.
The values of the gift certificates range from $25 to $125, therefore the gift certificate from Athlete's Alley is $125 and the gift certificate from Gorgeous Candy Boutique is $25.
This leaves $410 in gift certificates from the other 5 stores.
The gift certificates from CD Corner, Don's Deli  and  Fancy Footwear Shop  total $270.  The mean of this group is $90, which is value of the certificate from the CD shop.
This leaves $180 for Don's Deli and Fancy Footwear.  Because Fancy Footwear is worth $50 more, the certificate from Don's Deli is half of $130, or $65 dollars, and the certificate from Fancy Footwear is $115.
This leaves the certificates from Bay State Basement and Elk's Software, totalling $140.  There's only way to meet the requirement that the median and mode of the 7 values is $70.  Both remaining certificates must be valued at $70.",,2.74,2.15

How Far Can You Go?,"Your assignment is to make a delivery from the depot to your base camp, 1600 miles away. The trip begins normally, but unfortunately, halfway to base camp, your supply truck breaks down. You have no way to call for help. Luckily, in addition to medical supplies, the truck is carrying a Desert Patrol Vehicle (DPV) and two barrels of fuel.
The DPV has a full 10 gallon tank, but to make room for the medical supplies, it can only carry one of the 45 gallon barrels at a time. While you can't transfer fuel between barrels, you can refill the tank from the barrels. Assume the DPV can get 12 miles per gallon, regardless of the load it carries.
How far can you go? Is it far enough to deliver the medical supplies and the DPV to your base camp?","You can travel 840 miles from the broken supply truck. Since your base camp is 800 miles away (half of 1600 miles), you can easily complete the delivery. Here's how:
Although you can only carry one barrel at a time, you need to transport both of them until one barrel is empty. F is the barrel used first, and L is the barrel used last.
Use half of a tank (5 gallons) to carry L 5*12=60 miles, and then return for F (uses another 5 gallons). Refill the tank from F and carry it to where you left L (also uses 5 gallons). Refill the tank again from F and switch barrels. Now you are 60 miles from the broken truck, the tank and L are full, but F is down to 30 gallons (45-5-5-5=30). Repeat this procedure two times.
Now you are 60*3=180 miles from the broken truck. The tank and L are still full, but F is empty. Leave F behind and make a run for it, carrying L. Refill the tank from L as needed. There are 55 gallons of fuel left so you can travel an additional 55*12=660 miles, for a maximum of (180+660) 840 miles.

""Well, when we met, the square of your age contained the same three digits as the square of my age, just in a different order,"" Professor Gebra continued.
""This will really blow your socks off then, Al! If you take the square of the sum of our ages when we met and split it into two 2-digit numbers, you'd have my age then and your age now!"" Professor Culus exclaimed.

""I thought you were much younger than that, Professor Gebra,"" Theo said.
Said Professor Gebra, ""And just how old am I then, young fellow?""","""Well, you're 81, sir,"" Theo replied.
""Right you are! And how did you figure that out so quickly?"" Professor Gebra asked.
""You said the square of your ages when you and Professor Culus met had only three digits, so the oldest you could have been was 31. That means that there were only a few possible ages the two of you could have been. Those being (with the associated squares):

Swap Time,"This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?","A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12

Tie the Knots,"Joe needed a rope 75 feet long.  He went to a local hardware store, but found that they did not have ropes nearly that long.  They had only 3', 5', 12', and 20' segments of rope.  Joe would have bought only 20' segments, as they were the cheapest per foot; unfortunately, they had such a limited quantity of segments (though none were out of stock) that he had to buy all of the 20', 12', and 5' segments available, and 3' segments for the remainder.  In fact, he bought a greater quantity of each length than the next longer length (i.e., more 3' segments than 5' segments, more 5' segments than 12' segments, and more 12' segments than 20' segments).  Just to be sure he had some margin for error, he bought a total of 90 feet, even though he needed only 75 feet.  When he got home, he was glad he had decided to buy a little extra, because only then did he realize that he was going to lose some length as he tied the segments together to make the full rope.  He tied two pieces together to check how much length he would lose, and found it to be 6 inches lost from each of the two segments that were tied together.  Does Joe have enough to make his 75-foot rope?","Yes.  He will have a 76-foot rope.
The only combination that fits the statements in the puzzle is:
1 20' segment
2 12' segments
5 5' segments
7 3' segments
This is a total of 15 segments, which will require 14 knots to tie together.  Each knot takes 6 inches off of two segments, or 1 foot total; therefore, of his 90 feet of rope, he will lose 14 feet in the knots, making a 76-foot rope.","Is it possible for Joe to have bought more than 1 20-foot segment, with the total adding up to 90 feet?  Is it possible for him to have bought more than 2 12-foot segments?",2.73,2.16
Word Triangles,"A word triangle is created by taking a word, putting the first letter on the first line, putting two of the second letter on the next line, three of the third letter on the third line, et cetera. Given the word TEASER, the word triangle would look like this:
T
EE
AAA
SSSS
EEEEE
RRRRRR
If you begin at the top and start spelling TEASER by either moving to the letter directly below the letter you are currently on or by moving to the letter that is immediately to the right of the letter below the letter you are currently on, you could use several different paths to spell the word. For instance, if your path takes you to the third 'A' you could either go to the third 'S' or the fourth 'S', but not to the first or second 'S'.
Can you determine how many possible paths there are for this word triangle? How about for word triangles with words of different lengths?","2^5 = 32
For any word of given length, L, the number of paths, P, can be found by P = 2^(L-1).
This is essentially Pascal's Triangle.  Usually, these are seen as more of a pyramid shape, but since spacing can't be done consistently, the teaser had to limit the paths to either the letter below the current letter or the letter below and to the right of the current letter.",This relates to the work of a famous theologian and mathematician.,2.73,2.52

Bag 3 = 19 marbles
Bag 4 = 23 marbles
Bag 5 = 38 marbles

To work this out, since there are 150 marbles, and the scales are level, both sides of the scales must have 75 marbles. If Bag 1 + Bag 2 = 56 marbles then Bag 3 = (75-56) 19 marbles. So Bag 1 = 35 marbles and Bag 2 = 21 marbles. The same is done with Bags 4,5, and 6. Bag 4 + Bag 5 = 61 marbles. So Bag 6 = (75-61) 14 marbles.

Everything costs as follows:
Mineral water: 110QEM
Crisps: 43QEM
Sandwiches: 304QEM
Fizzy juice: 104QEM
You will notice that the difference in cost between Skid Mark and Birth Mark is 608QEM. This is because they both bought a bottle of mineral water and a bag of crisps, but Skid Mark bought 2 sandwiches so sandwiches cost (608/2=304QEM). Since Book Mark paid 938 for what she bought, 608QEM was used to buy 2 sandwiches, the rest of her money would be used to buy 3 bottles of mineral water, so one bottle costs (330/3=110QEM).

Tiny Little Stairs,"Jimbo Gulliver was planning an intergalactic space trip to the planet Lilliputinyweesmallminutania which had a very tiny moon named Tinylittliddybiddy...  well never mind what it was called. Here dwelt the smallest people in the universe.
In order to give them access to his space ship doorway, which was 3 metres off the ground, he decided to build a set of stairs that measured 4 metres long by 3 metres high.
Just as he was about to leave, the first officer on the ship, Lieutenant Sarogahtyp said ""Jimbo, when we get there are we going to give them the red carpet treatment?""
""Good idea"", declared Jimbo.
Now Jimbo had the latest autocarpetachometer thingy that could fasten a carpet to a staircase without wasting any carpet whatsoever on the corners and bends. ""I wonder how much red carpet I'll need?"" enquired Jimbo.
""Look"", said first officer Sarogahtyp, ""There are thousands and thousands of steps. The steps are so tiny and close together that it almost looks like a ramp. Why it's almost a 3:4:5 triangle. Take 6 metres and you'll have some left over.
Jimbo Gulliver took his first Lieutenants advice but alas, when he got there, there was not enough carpet to carpet the stairs! Why?","It will take exactly seven metres to carpet the stairs no matter how many there are. The horizontal steps must add up to 4 metres and the vertical risers must add up to 3 metres.

Tick Tock Bad Clock,"Your friend gave you a clock for your birthday, but unfortunately, it's very unreliable. This one gains exactly 12 minutes every hour.
It is now showing 10pm and you know that it was correct at midnight, when you set it.
If the clock stopped four hours ago, what is the correct time now?","Since the clock gains 12 minutes every hour, for every real hour that has passed 72 minutes will pass on the clock.  It has been 22 fake hours from midnight to the time the clock stopped, so in order to find the number of real hours we must first find the number of fake minutes, then divide the number of fake minutes by the number of minutes that pass by in an hour for the clock (72) to find the number of real hours that have passed from midnight to when the clock stopped. The following shows arithmetic work:
22 x 60 = 1320 (clock minutes that have passed from midnight to when the clock stopped)
1320 / 72 = 18.333333... (real hours that have passed from midnight to when the clock stopped)

We first start with clue number 1. We figure out A is less than 100. Next we look at clue number 2. We figure out that A is bigger than 30. So we now know that A has to be between 31 and 99.
The third clue tells us that it has to be a multiple of 6. So you write down all the multiples of six between 31 and 99. The multiples are 36, 42, 48 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, and 96.
Next, we find out that the sum of A's digits is 9, so we can cross out 42, 48, 60, 66, 78, 84, and 96. Next, we find out that the number in the tens place is larger than the number in the ones place so we can cross out 36. The last clue tells us that the difference between A's digits is 1.

1 sheep - 1 goat = 2 dogs
A sheep is 10 dinars, but what does a goat cost?
The money they received for their camels is a square. And the digit in the tens-place of this square is odd (total money / 10 dinars), because they could not divide the sheep equally.
Now the interesting thing is that all squares with an odd tens-place end with a 6. (16^2 = 256, 24^2 = 576). So a goat must cost 6 dinars.

IT + TAKES + A + LITTLE = EFFORT
The numbers 0-9 are used and the teacher had already told them that A = 9 and E = 7.  Little Johnny's brother could not figure it out, so he knew that he'd be safe.
Ten minutes later, Little Johnny's mother was watching while his big brother grudgingly gave up his cars for a week.

A Bird's Eye View,"Jack sat in his father's office, atop a bookcase by the wide, floor-to-ceiling window. His father's employer had built this skyscraper right on the shoreline of the lake, directly across which stood the tallest tree in the state. Jack's view was spectacular, and, as he looked across the 866 ft. wide lake, he noticed something which he found interesting. When he gazed at the highest point on the tree, his line of sight was at a 30 degree incline above horizontal. When looking at the base of the tree, where it met the water at the far edge of the lake, he was looking at a 30 degree declination.
How tall is the tree?
Bonus: Later, after querying his father, he found out that the first floor of the office building was at ground level, and every subsequent floor was exactly 12 ft. above the one below. What floor is his father's office on?","The tree is 1000 ft. tall.
Start by picturing a triangle formed by Jack's line of sight to the base of the tree, the lake's surface, and the building. Since the tree and building are at the lake's edge, they're level with each other and the triangle is a right triangle. The angle at the base of the tree is 30 degrees. Using trigonometric functions, we can find the unknown lengths of the triangle. The line of sight is the hypotenuse of the triangle. The height of the building where Jack sits is the side opposite the 30 degree angle. The length across the lake, 866 ft., is the adjacent side.
Cosine = adjacent/hypotenuse
Tangent = opposite/adjacent
Thus:
Cos(30)= 0.8660 = 866/hypotenuse Jack's line of sight is 1000 ft.
Tan(30)= 0.5774 = opposite/866 -> Jack's height is 500 ft.
Now, we turn our attention to the triangle formed by the tree and both of Jack's lines of sight. We can see that it's an equilateral triangle, consisting of three 60 degree angles, and therefore all sides are equal. Thus the tree is 1000 ft. high.
Bonus: Jack's height was 500 ft. The largest whole multiples of twelve to divide evenly into that is 492(41x12), placing the office on the 42nd floor (41 above the first floor). Jack's perch atop the bookcase put his eyes eight feet above the floor, rounding out 500 ft.","Draw a triangle from Jack's eyes, to both the base and the peak of the tree. Make a second triangle from the tree base to the bottom of the building, then up to Jack again.",2.71,2.56

"No-Fat Frankfurters, Partition Deux","Kurt & Rod were hanging around the window at school munching the last of their Rnkfurers hoard.  They spotted their neighbor lounging in the enclosed courtyard, looking hungry.
""Patty O'Furniture!  Good to see you!  Want a Rnkfurter?""
""A what?""
Kurt handed her the last he had.  She bit in, and her face lit up like a newly-coined metaphor.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""Rod and I were about to go order some more.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""  Patty's blank look bade him explain.  ""In our first batch, we got a total of 25 -- 20 for me, and 5 for Rod.  I had 20, and he had 20% of the total.""
""And you think you can do that for three people?  You get my percentage, and I get Rod's?  I don't think we can do it.""
Rod had been thinking about it, and rattled off three numbers to her.
""Those aren't right.  The last one isn't the right percentage; there's an added fraction.""
""So?  My mom says they're the same on her old phonograph speeds.""
Patty looked at Kurt, each waiting for the other to give an opinion.  Finally, she gestured at the empty wrapper in his hand.
""I'll round off a little for a week's supply of these.  Let's go!""
Since Rnkfurters come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, they had to leave 10 with the storekeeper to make the numbers work, but they got their munchies.
How many did each student get this time?","27 for Kurt, 30 for Patty, and 33 for Rod.
That's 30% for Kurt and 33-1/3% for Patty.
Method:
Let K, P, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, K+P+R.
Now, since Kurt's percentage equals Patty's quantity, we get
100*K/T = P.
Similarly,
100*P/T = R plus a fraction.  Now, look at the common factor, 100/T.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
K*F = P and P*F = R (plus a fraction),
and K*F^2 = R (plus a fraction).
The clue about the phonograph leaves us looking for a triple with 33 Rnkfurters for Rod, with Patty getting 33-1/3% (one-third) of the total.
P = T/3
P = (K+P+33)/3 -- remember, R=33
Now, combine this with 100*K/T = P, and a bit of algebra gives us the required answer.
-------------
Alternately, there are 11 triples that fit the factor requirement (courtesy of a short computer program), ranging from (19, 25, 32) to (2376, 96, 3).  The ones that total 10 less than a multiple of 25 are
27, 30, 33
63, 45, 32
891, 90, 9

Pearls and Girls,"Once an old man died, and in his Will he stated that all the pearls he kept in a little bag were to be distributed among his daughters. To make things fair, the distribution must be done in the following way:
The older girl should receive one pearl, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""
And so it was.
How many pearls were there in the bag?
How many daughters did the old man have?
How many pearls did each girl get?","There were 36 pearls.
There were 6 daughters.
Each daughter got 6 pearls.
The girl number x will have x pearls and a seventh of the rest. Since the last girl leaves no pearls in the bag, then when she takes her pearls the rest in the bag is zero (a seventh of nothing is nothing).
Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).
That is, k+1 = 7 and then k = 6.
So, the number of pearls is 6*6 = 36, and there were 6 girls.","If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?",2.7,2.7

Assume the trip to Boston is 60 miles:
Glenn:  40 miles there and 10 miles back for 50 miles total.
Steve:  20 miles there and 50 miles back for 70 miles total.

2. When the digits of the mystery number are reversed, another 2-digit prime number is formed.
3. When the original number is added to the next highest prime number, the sum forms a square number.
4. When the mystery number is added to the 2nd prime number after it, the sum is evenly divisible by 4.
What is the mystery number?""
Can you help Carlos solve Arnold's problem?","17.
Clue #1 - All of the 2-digit numbers are 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.
After Clue #1 we have 21 possibilities.
Clue #2 - When every number is reversed, the numbers are 11, 31, 71, 91, 32, 92, 13, 73, 14, 34, 74, 35, 95, 16, 76, 17, 37, 97, 38, 98, and 79. Of these, only 31, 71, 13, 73, 17, 37, 97, and 79 are different prime numbers (11 reversed is still 11).
After Clue #2 we have 8 possibilities: 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.
Clue#3 - Add the next prime number to form a perfect square. So, using our list from Clue #2, we know our ten base numbers. We must add 13 and 17, 17 and 19, 31 and 37, 37 and 41, 71 and 73, 73 and 79, 79 and 83,  97 and 101. These sums are 30, 36, 68, 78, 144, 152, 162, and 198 respectively. Of these sums-only 36 (which was formed using 17) and 144 (formed using 71) are perfect squares.
After Clue #3, we have 2 possibilities: 17 and 71.
Clue #4 - Add the 2nd prime number after to make a number evenly divisible by 4. This would mean we add 23 to 17, and 79 to 71. These sums are 40 and 150. Only 40 is evenly divisible by 4. So, only 17 fits.

Furthermore, from conditions 3 and 7 we know that CD is divisible by 4 and GH is divisible by 8 (because FGH is divisible by 8 and F is even). Because C and G are odd, D and H must be 2 and 6 in some order.
From conditions 2 and 5, we know that A+B+C, D+E+F, G+H+I are all divisible by 3.
If D=2, then F=8, H=6, B=4. A+4+C is divisible by 3, therefore A and C must be 1 and 7 in some order, G and I must be 3 and 9 in some order. G6 is divisible by 8, therefore G=9. But neither 1472589 nor 7412589 is divisible by 7.
Therefore D=6, and F=4, H=2, B=8. G2 is divisible by 8, therefore G=3 or 7. A+8+C is divisible by 3, therefore one of A and C is chosen from 1 and 7, the other is chosen from 3 and 9.
If G=3, then one of A and C is 9, the other is chosen from 1 and 7. But none of 1896543, 7896543, 9816543 and 9876543 is divisible by 7.

Ice Cream Quandary,"Zee's Ice Cream Shop is world renowned for making new and inventive ice cream flavors from scratch.  They've made great profits on their Marshmallow Mustang and Cinnebago flavors, but their Purple Pinto is just not turning a profit!
Scott, Zee's President, says that customers just don't want to eat purple ice cream.  He thinks they should pull the flavor and move on.  However Sally, Zee's Marketing Director, disagrees.  She has taste tested the flavor with a sampling poll and it got rave reviews.
Daisy, the lowly Flavor Engineer, loves the Purple Pinto and knows that it has profit potential!  She thinks the problem might be stemming from the small batch sizes and the fact that Sally takes scoops for sample polls every time they run a batch of the flavor.
Daisy has collected the following information:
1. Currently, there are 30 scoops in a batch.
2. It costs Zee's $12.90 to make each batch, right now.
3. A scoop sells for $0.90.
4. A small profit is not enough!  Scott wants $25 per batch to make up for lost time.
5. Sally will not stop taking 17 sample scoops per batch.
First of all, is Daisy right?  Or is the Purple Pinto just doomed?
If she is, can you help Daisy determine how large batches should be to ensure that Zee's makes a profit and keeps making her favorite flavor?","Short answer:
Daisy is right.
She should up batch size to 86 scoops to give Scott his $25/batch profit.
Long answer:
Cost to Zee's = $12.90/batch or $0.43/scoop
Cost to Customer = $0.90/scoop (WOW!  That's more than a 100% mark-up)
BUT:
17 samples cannot be sold.
So a batch is now only 13 scoops
Cost to Customer = $11.70/batch
Zee's loses $1.20 per batch.
So, Daisy is right!
Now, to let's help her convince management to increase the batch size.
To break even: Our cost to make the scoops < Sales dollars from scoops
To make a $25 profit: Our cost to make the scoops + $25 profit < Sales dollars from scoops
Let's make s=the optimal number of scoops in a batch
Our cost to make the scoops is:
$0.43 * s + $0.43 * 17  (because we gave 17 away to marketing)
Sales from the scoops are:
$0.90 *s
Therefore:
$0.43 * s+ $0.43*17 + $25 < $0.90 * s
A little algebra, please:
0.43s+32.31<0.90s
0.47s>32.31
s > 68.75 scoops to sell
Adding in the samples Daisy gave away to Sally:
s = 69 + 17 = 86 scoops/batch
Daisy needs to up the batch size to 86 scoops to ensure a $25 profit per batch.
And, most importantly, she can use her math to convince Sally and Scott to keep making the Purple Pinto!","Daisy may just be a Flavor Engineer, but her intuition is right on!",2.67,2.23

Luckily, the new employee is smart, and successfully figures out how many of each lunch to get.
Using the facts he has, can you figure out how many bagels and salads he needs to get?","He needs to get 17 bagels, and 6 salads.
17 bagels = $25.50
6 salads = $6.60
s = salad
b = bagel
total cost = 32.10

1.1s + 1.5b = 32.10
or
s = (32.10 - 1.5b)/1.1
s + b = 23
or
s = 23 - b
Since both equations equal s, the both equal each other, and can be solved like so:
(32.10 - 1.5b)/1.1 = 23 - b
32.10 - 1.5b = 25.30 - 1.1b

What does 'a' equal in that sequence?","'a' equals 2.
Since each number is the sum of the preceding two, d must equal 0, so that the second 1 will equal 0 plus 1.  That means c has to equal 1, so that the first 1 would make sense.  Therefore, b equals -1, making 0 the sum of the previous two numbers.  So a must equal 2, leaving 1 as the sum of -1 and 2.

ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE

CDEFAB

The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.","The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number. The digital sum of 247 is 2+4+7 = 13.
The digit pairs in 125690 are 12 56 90. These are also the numbers formed by the digit pairs.
Rotating 123456 one to the left gives 234561;
Rotating 123456 one to the right gives 612345;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the left gives 789056;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the right gives 905678.",2.64,3.19

A History Lesson,"When Carl Friedrich Gauss was six years old (back in 1783), his schoolteacher asked the students to add up all the numbers from 1 to 100.

Race Against Time,"A child in the remote mountain village of Pliluk has fallen ill. Dotan, his brother Forak, and his sister Loti must get their father, the village healer, who is gathering herbs on the other side of the mountain. To make sure they get him as quickly as possible, they decide to split up. Forak will ride his horse around the mountain's base, Dotan will travel by river raft, and Loti will climb the steep cliff trail.
The raft can travel at 22 miles an hour along the 40 miles of the river, but there are 3 places where Dotan, at each place, will lose 0.4 hours by having to carry the raft around dangerous waterfalls. Forak's horse can travel 15 miles per hour on the flatter part of the 32-mile trail, but only 8 miles per hour on the steep part, which is 30% of the whole trail. Loti's road up and down the cliffs is the shortest, only 14 miles, but her average rate is only 5 miles an hour, and she must take a 10-minute rest at the summit.
Assuming Dotan does not hit a rock, Forak is not attacked by an ice panther, and Loti is not bitten by a cliff snake, who will reach their father first? Round all decimals to tenths.","Forak will reach his father first.
At the rate of 22 miles per hour, Dotan's raft covers the distance of 40 miles in 40/22 = 1.8 hours. Adding the time for three delays, 3*0.4 = 1.2 hours, his total time is 3 hours.
Thirty percent of Forak's 32-mile trail (or 32*0.3 = 9.6 miles) is steep, and at a rate of 8 miles per hour he covers this steep section in 9.6/8 = 1.2 hours. At a rate of 15 miles per hour on the 22.4-mile flat section, Forak covers this in 22.4/15 = 1.5 hours. His total time is 2.7 hours.
At her average rate of 5 miles per hour, Loti covers her 14-mile mountain trail in 14/5 = 2.8 hours, but her rest time at the summit takes 10/60 or nearly 0.2 hours, so her total time, like Dotan's, is 3 hours.

Mystery Number,"Look at the following clues to uncover the mystery number:
1. I am a 4-digit even number, and all of my digits are different.
2. The sum of all my digits is 10.
3. Each of my digits is greater than zero.
4. The sum of the digits in my thousands place and hundreds place equals the sum of the digits in my ones place and tens place.
5. My largest digit is in the thousands place.
What number am I?","The mystery number is 4132.
Since the sum of all four digits is 10, and the sum of the digits in the thousands place and the hundreds place is equal to the sum of the digits in the tens place and the ones place, then you know that each of these sums is equal to 5. Because all of the digits in the mystery number are different and none of them are equal to zero, the four digits must be some combination of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
You also know that the ones digit is an even number, so the ones digit is either 2 or 4. Finally, the last clue says that the largest digit is in the thousands place, so the mystery number must be 4132.",Make a table with a column for each digit and eliminate the impossibilities.,2.64,1.69

Speeding Blues,"Car 1 started from Point A towards point B. At the same time Car 2 started from point B towards A. They crossed each other at point C. After which, Car 1 reached point B in another 9 hrs, and Car 2 reached point A in another 4 hrs. If both the cars maintained a constant speed throughout the journey, and the speed of Car 1 was 36 miles/hr(mph), then what was the speed of Car 2?","54 miles/hr.
Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).
Thus we get b = 11664/216 = 54.
Thus speed of Car 2 = 54 miles/hr",,2.64,2.89

Obviously, at the end each bucket will contain 6 gallons of water. Call the buckets B1, B2 and B3.
If pouring a third of the water in B3 at the time into B1 leaves 6 in each, then B3 must have 9 at the time and B1 3.
If pouring half of B2 at the time into B3 at the time leaves 6 in B2 and 9 in B3, then B2 must contain 12 at the time and B3 contain 3. So B3 started with 3 gallons in.
If pouring three quarters of B1 at the time into B2 at the time leaves B1 with 3 and B2 with 12, then B1 had 12 and B2 had 3.

Since Little Choc loooves chocolate, and it is his birthday, he proposes a slight change: rather than dividing each cake into 8 slices, divide C into 9 slices, and V into 7. This way Choc can have two C slices, and his guests can still have one slice from each cake.
His guests do not mind eating more of vanilla than chocolate.  Being very health-conscious, though, they would mind eating more calories than they would have under the original plan.

Apple Picking,"Three people picked 65 apples altogether. At the first tree they each picked the same number of apples. At the second tree they each picked 3 times as many as they picked at the first tree. When they finished at the third tree, the group had 5 times as many apples as they had when they started at that tree. At the fourth tree the group picked just 5 apples.
How many apples did each person pick at the first tree?","Each person picked 1 apple at the first tree.
Begin with 65 apples picked, and work backwards. Subtract the number of apples picked at the fourth tree (5), and then divide the total (60) by 5 to equal the number of apples picked after the first two trees. The total after the first two trees = 12. Since the number of apples picked at the first two trees (12) is equal to the number of apples picked at the first tree plus 3 times the number picked at the first tree (or a total of 4 times the number picked at the first tree), then the number of apples picked at the first tree must be 12 divided by 4 = 3. Therefore, each person picked 1 apple at the first tree.
Using algebra: Suppose they pick y apples at the first tree. Then, they pick 3y apples at the second tree and have 4y apples altogether. After the third tree, they have 5X4y or 20y apples, and after the fourth tree, they have 20y + 5 apples.
20y + 5 = 65

Gauss and an Old Professor,"There was a famous mathematician named Karl Friedrich Gauss. When he was young, he entered Gotinga University. One day he met an old professor, and spoke to him. They chatted, and the professor asked Gauss about his age.
Gauss said: ""The cube and the fourth power of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
The professor said: ""Very good. It's good coincidence because the square and the cube of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
How old was Gauss, and how old was the professor?","Their ages can't end with 0, 1, 5 or 6, and must be either a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 9 minus 1 because the sum of its square and its cube or its cube and its fourth power is divisible by 9.
Gauss's age is easy. Since 17^3=4913, 17^4=83521, 22^3=10648, 22^4=234256, Gauss's age is between 18 and 21. The only possibility is 18. 18^3=5832, 18^4=104976.
The professor's age is a little harder. It can be 47 to 99, and the possibilities are: 48, 53, 54, 57, 62, 63, 69, 72, 78, 84, 87, 89, 93, 98, 99. By trial and error, 69 satisfies this condition: 69^2=4761, 69^3=328509.

let x = the number of canaries and y = the number of cages. You can set up two equations using the two situations given.
First, if there is one canary per cage, then there is 1 cage too many (in other words, there is one more bird than cages): x - y = 1

If (2h+1sq) = 4sp then divide by 2 giving:

Therefore:
(1sq + 2sp) = (1sq + 1h + 0.5sq) = (1h + 1.5sq)

Bird,"The distance between Station Atena and Station Barcena is 78 miles. A train starts from Atena towards Barcena. A bird starts at the same time from Barcena straight towards the moving train. On reaching the train, it instantaneously turns back and returns to Barcena. The bird makes these journeys from Barcena to the train and back to Barcena continuously till the train reaches Barcena. The bird finally returns to Barcena and rests. Calculate the total distance in miles the bird travels in the following two cases:
(a) the bird flies at 70 miles per hour and the speed of the train is 60 miles per hour
b) the bird flies at 60 miles per hour and the speed of the train is 70 miles per hour - it is safe to assume that the train does not in fact hit the bird for the sake of the equation.","Solution:
Case (a): Bird flies at a speed greater than that of the train
The train (at a speed of 60 miles per hour) travels 60 miles in 60 minutes.
Therefore, the train travels from Atena to Barcena (78 miles) in 78 minutes.
Importantly, the bird makes the journeys continuously back and forth for this same amount of time (namely, 78 minutes).
Thus, the total distance traveled by the bird
= 70 miles per hour x 78 minutes = 70 x 78 / 60 miles = 91 miles.
Case (b): Bird flies at a speed less than that of the train
In 36 minutes, the bird travels 36 miles, the train travels 42 miles, and the two meet.
Now, the train (which is traveling at a speed greater than that of the bird) will reach Barcena before the bird.
So, the bird simply returns to Barcena (a return journey of 36 miles).
Thus, the total distance traveled by the bird is 72 miles.",,2.59,2.4

4139 Main Street,"There is an apartment building on 4139 Main Street. There is a strange thing about floor 7 of this building ... everyone is a prime age! From the clues provided, can you decipher how old these residents are?
In Suzy's age, the digits have a sum of four. Seven years from now, Suzy's age, when you add the digits together, will be 20 less than her current age. She is under 100 years old. How old is Suzy?
Jason is younger than Suzy by at least 5 years. Four years ago Jason was prime, and in 4 years Jason will be prime again. How old is Jason?","To solve for Suzy's age, we must first list all the numbers under 100 with a sum of 4:
4, 13, 22, 31, 40
Of these, the only prime numbers are 13 and 31.  If we try the second clue on each number, we get:
13+7=20, 2+0=2, 13-2=11
31+7=38, 3+8=11, 31-11=20
Therefore, Suzy must be 31.
To find Jason's age, we should first take Suzy's age (31) and subtract 5, leaving us with 26.  This is the maximum possible age Jason could be.  Again, listing out all the prime numbers under 26:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23
If we add four to each of these, only  3, 7, 13, and 19 stay prime.  Taking these remaining 4 and subtracting four, the only one that remains prime is 7.
Therefore, Jason must be 7.

The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.

(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)","(1): m=4s
(2): m > l > x > s
(3): 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650, divided by 25 gives...
(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186
(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186
Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.
The solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10.

Snapoker Championships,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
At the 2002 International Snapoker Championships, the final was very hotly contested.  Despite the high level of competitiveness in the final, no fights broke out.  It was also a day for the history books as it had often been speculated in ""Here Piggy!"", the official Snapoker magazine, that the longest official Snapoker game, which was played in 1979 and lasted for 186 hands, would never be surpassed (incidentally, this 186-hand game was concluded when the fourth placed player lost his marbles and started the biggest Snapoker fight ever seen).

The highest total of all four players' scores such that the individual scores are still all less than the 518-point winning mark is 2060 (eg. 517, 516, 514, 513 or some other similar combination), which corresponds to 206 hands.

Popcorn Problems,"When the circus's popcorn vendor went on vacation, Charlie the Chimp saw it as the perfect opportunity to start a new act, so he volunteered to man the stand. Everything was going great until the very end of the day, when a set of twins showed up. There was just 1 large box of popcorn left to sell, and it was too late to pop another batch, so the twins asked Charlie if he could split the popcorn into two equal portions.Charlie knew that the large box held exactly 12 cups of popcorn. He also had 2 empty boxes on hand: a medium box that held exactly 8 cups and a small box that held exactly 5 cups. But none of the boxes had any measurement markings on them. There must be a way to divide the 12 cups of popcorn so that the two boxes contain exactly 6 cups each, thought the chimp.
How did he give out an equal amount of popcorn to the twins?","Fill the 8-cup box from the 12-cup box, leaving 4 cups. Fill the 5-cup box from the 8-cup box, leaving 3 cups. Empty the 5-cup box into the 12-cup box. Now there are 9 cups in the 12-cup box and 3 cups in the 8-cup box. Pour the 3 cups into the 5-cup box. Fill the 8-cup box from the 12-cup box, leaving 1 cup in the 12-cup box. Fill the 5-cup box (it already has 3 cups in it) from the 8-cup box, leaving 6 cups in the 8-cup box. Finally, empty the 5-cup box into the 12-cup box. This results in 6 cups in the 12-cup box, 6 cups in the 8-cup box, and nothing in the 5-cup box.",,2.56,2.72
Counting Wrappers,"Your favourite chocolate bar is having a special promotion, buy 10 get 1 free! To get a free bar, simply collect 10 wrappers and turn them in for 1 free bar. What fraction of a bar is each wrapper worth?","Each wrapper is worth 1/9 of a bar.
10 wrappers are worth 1 free bar, so it appears each wrapper is worth 1/10 of a bar, except that the free bar comes with a wrapper.
10 wrappers are worth 1 free bar (with 1 free wrapper), so each wrapper is worth 1/10 of a bar plus 1/10 of a wrapper. The 1/10 of a wrapper is worth 1/100 of a bar plus 1/100 of a wrapper, and so on. 1/10 + 1/100 + 1/1000 + ... = 0.111... = 1/9.
The answer can be shown with the following algebra, where w is the value of a wrapper, and b is the value of a bar.
10w = b + w (10 wrappers are worth 1 bar with 1 wrapper)
9w = b (subtract w from each side)
w = b/9 (divide both sides by 9)
Each wrapper (w) is worth 1/9 of a bar (b).",Remember that the free bar has a wrapper.,2.56,2.1

How Old is Grandpa,"Grandpa says, ""My grandson is about as many days as my son is weeks, and my grandson is as many months as I am in years. My grandson, my son and I together are 100  years. Can you tell me my age in years?""","This problem is conveniently solved by writing down the necessary equations.
Let m be my age in years. If s is my son's age in years, then my son is 52s weeks old. If g is my grandson's age in years, then my grandson is 365g days old. Thus,
365g = 52s.
Since my grandson is 12g months old,
12g = m.
Since my grandson, my son and I together are 100  years,
g + s + m = 100.
The above system of 3 equations in 3 unknowns (g, s and m) can be solved as follows.
m / 12 + 365 m / (52 x 12) + m = 100  or
52 m + 365 m + 624 m = 624 x 100  or
m = 624 x 100  / 1041 = 60.
So, I am 60  years old.""
Food for thought:
Why is the word ""about"" used in the Problem Statement in the sentence ""My grandson is about as many days as my son is weeks""? Calculate the son's age and the grandson's age. Then, verify whether the first equation (i.e., 365g = 52s) is exactly satisfied.
An elegant solution is possible on realizing the significance of the word ""about"" in the Problem Statement.
Elegant Solution:
The first equation (365g = 52s) can be approximated by
7g = s.
As before, the other two equations are
12g = m
g + s + m = 100.
The above system of 3 equations in 3 unknowns (g, s and m) can be simply solved as follows.
g + 7g + 12g = 100 or 20g = 100.
m = 12g = 12 x 100  / 20 = 60.

Candy Sales,"Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)","This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,2.54,2.66

Al bought ""b"" apples, ""b"" bananas, and ""a""+""b"" oranges, and paid 35 dollars. Ben bought one apple, two bananas, and one orange. How much money did Ben pay?","Ben paid 12 dollars.
From Al's purchase, we know that:

Since a, b, and o are positive integers, a+b and b+o are both integers greater than 2. The only pair of integers greater than 2 that multiplies to get 35 is 5 and 7, which means that a+b and b+o are 5 and 7, in some order.

Square numbers can't end in 7 or 8, and 123456 is not a square because it is divisible by 3 but not by 9. Hence the number of letters must end with 9.
Since odd squares have remainder 1 upon division by 8, the number formed by its fourth and fifth digits must be divisible by 4, which can be 48, 56 or 68.
Numbers that have remainder 2 upon division by 3, and those that are divisible by 3 but not by 9 are not squares. By trial and error, we know that the only square number satisfying these conditions is 134689=367^2.

If the largest score that can never be achieved in a game is 95 points (no matter how long the game lasts), how many points is each move worth?","The bungee is worth 17 points, and the wedgie is worth 7.
The largest score that can not be achieved by some combination of p and q points, with p relatively prime to q, is p*q-p-q = (p-1)*(q-1)-1.
So 96 must be factorable as (p-1)*(q-1), for odd primes p and q.

factors must be even, the possible factorizations are:
2*48

Number Trick...,"Professor X has managed to create a simple program that can multiply any two whole numbers and calculate the answer correctly.
But, a problem has arisen....it seems the program will NOT correctly multiply a number by itself (such as 4 X 4).
Fortunately, the professor knows a way to get around this glitch.
Keeping in mind that the program must accept ANY whole integer, do you know a way to have the program multiply the numbers in a different way to get the correct result?
This method only has to work when multiplying a number by itself.","Here's a neat trick to calculate any given number multiplied by itself:
Take one less than the given number and multiply it by one greater than the given number and add 1.
For example:
25 X 25 = 625
24 X 26 = 624 + 1 = 625
It also works for negative numbers:
-1 X -1 = 1
-2 X 0 + 1 = 1
The mathematical formula that the professor should use would be:
(n = given integer)
(n + 1) X (n - 1) + 1
This would be equivalent to n X n.",,2.52,2.08

8) HI is divisible by 9
There are two solutions.","781254963 and 187254963

Swimming to Shore,"A man is standing on a rock in the middle of a circular lake of radius 1. There is a tiger on the shore of the lake that can run four times as fast you can swim, however the tiger cannot swim. The tiger is hungry and always attempts to keep the distance between the two of you at a minimum. How can you safely swim to shore?
Assume that as long as you can get to the shore before the tiger gets to you (even if it is only a split-second before), you will be safe.","Until you are more than 1/4 of the radius away from the rock you can swim fast enough so that you can keep the tiger the furthest distance possible from you. Regardless of which direction the tiger moves around the circle, you swim the other way, always keeping the rock between you and the tiger.  While you are doing this you will be able to move outward, since you will have some energy to spare.
Before long you will be 1/4 of the radius away from the center and the tiger will be 180 degrees away. At this point swim straight to the point on the shore furthest from the tiger. You will be able to get there in 3/4 units of time, while it will take the tiger pi/4 =~ 0.7854 units of time.",,2.52,2.82

If you draw a 10 x 5 grid, cross out a square for each orb that disappears. Put a circle in each box for each green orb. The year 2292 is a leap year, so there are 29 days in the month (February). Mark each 'day' you work out. You will find on each row, you get 4 disappeared orbs and 1 green orb.

How many miles would he have to run on his first practice run?","Adoontourious will have to run 7 miles on his first run in order to run 27 miles on his last run.
Since he will run the same amount of miles on the first day of each week as on the last day of the previous week, and he will run one more mile than the previous day on the other four days of each week, then he will add four miles to the length of his daily practice run by the end of each week.

Making Change,"Canada and The United States have a quarter, dime, nickel, and penny (25, 10, 5, and 1 cent coins).
1. The minimum number of coins needed to make change for a dollar (i.e. to make any amount less than 100) is nine coins. For example, nine coins are required to make 99 cents: 3 quarters, 2 dimes, and 4 pennies. What is the only smaller amount that also requires nine coins?
2. Having a 20 cent coin instead of a dime would be more efficient; at most eight coins would be needed to make change for a dollar. See if you can make 89 cents with only eight coins (using 25, 20, 5, and 1 cent coins).
3. There are other coin values that are still more efficient, such as 25, 18, 5, and 1 cent coins. What is the fewest number of these coins needed to make 89 cents?","1. 94 cents also requires nine coins: 3 quarters, 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 4 pennies.
2. 89 cents can be made using 1 quarter, 3 twenty-cent coins, and 4 pennies. If you try to use as many quarters as possible (called a ""greedy"" algorithm), it actually takes more coins: 3 quarters, 2 nickels, and 4 pennies is nine coins. One advantage of the existing coin values is that the ""greedy"" algorithm always works: use as many coins of highest value first, then the next highest, and so on.
3. 89 cents can be made using only six coins: 1 quarter, 3 eighteen-cent coins, and 2 nickels. In fact, any amount under 100 can be made with just six coins. There are several other coin values (such as 24, 19, 4, and 1; or 28, 13, 6, and 1) that are just as efficient, but none is better. The problem with these ""efficient"" amounts is trying to figure out the best way to make change in your head.","1. Take the answer for 99 cents and just replace one coin with a smaller one.

X Likes Cars,"X likes to buy and sell cars. For two weeks he bought 5 cars every 12 hours. Then, on June 2nd, he decided to start selling. Every day he would sell 6 cars, then buy 2.

Since he needs to sell 140 cars, it will take him 14 3-day cycles to do this.  14 * 3 = 42 days. But on day 41 he sells his 6 cars and runs out. He would normally buy two more later that day, but he is already out.",,2.52,1.76

Solution: (From 2: means 2nd line etc:)
From 2:  G=1 because A*G = A (A is not 5, because then from 1, F should also be 5)
From 4: F*A has to be a single number so it can only be 2*3 or 2*4 (or vice versa) and C can only be 6 or 8
There are four possibilities here,

23*3 (=69)
Can't be 2*4 or 3*2 (because 92 and 69 are not possible), so

From 2: B is twice something, so it can only be 4 6 or 8 (not 2 because it's already known)
D is half 4 6 or 8, so it can only be 2, 3, or 4
From 3: All the possible combinations of numbers multiplied that would give a two digit number: (Eliminate any with 1 or 2 in the product eg 3*7=21 or 3*8=24 etc)

The second term of the product must be one of the numbers multiplied by each other, so eliminate any that don't fit in here leaving:

Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""

Ahmes's Papyrus,"About 2000 B.C. there lived Ahmes, a royal secretary and mathematician of the Pharaoh Amenemhat III. In 1853 an Englishman Rhind found one of Ahmes's papyruses near the temple of Ramses II in Thebes. The papyrus is a rectangle 33 cm wide and about 5 m long. There is the following math brain teaser on it (besides others).
100 measures of corn must be divided among 5 workers, so that the second worker gets as many measures more than the first worker, as the third gets more than the second, the fourth more than the third and the fifth more than the fourth. The first two workers shall get seven times less measures of corn than the three others.
How many measures of corn shall each worker get?","2 equations give a clear answer to the given question:
5w + 10d = 100
7*(2w + d) = 3w + 9d
Where w is amount of corn for the first worker, d is the difference (amount of corn) between two consecutive workers. So this is the solution:
1st worker = 10/6 measures of corn
2nd worker = 65/6 measures of corn
3rd worker = 120/6 (20) measures of corn
4th worker = 175/6 measures of corn
5th worker = 230/6 measures of corn",,2.5,2.59
Yummie Gummies,"Mikey was looking through his drawer where he was saving all of his packages of gummy fruit candy. He found a dozen packages of candy altogether. He kept a chart listing how many pieces of candy there were in each package and figured out that he had 81 pieces of candy in all. His chart listed the color of each package, but not the names of the candy. Each kind of candy comes in only one color. The chart looked like this:
Green packages 2 pieces per package
Yellow packages 5 pieces per package
Brown packages 9 pieces per package
Gray packages 12 pieces per package
Each Zing Zong is so big that these packages contain the fewest candies. There are an equal number of Zing Zong packages as Gummy Ape packages. There are 2 dozen pieces of Egg Smasher candies, and a dozen more pieces of Power Busters than Egg Smashers.
Which candy is in each color package, and how many packages of each kind does Mikey have?","Looking at the column that shows the number of pieces per package, you can see that 12 is the only number left in this column that is a factor of 24, so Egg Smashers belong in the gray packages, and there must be 24 ÷ 12 = 2 gray packages.
Looking at the same column, you can see that 9 is a factor of 36 but 5 is not, so Power Busters come in the brown packages, and there must be 36 ÷ 9 = 4 brown packages.
You now know that Gummy Apes come in the yellow packages. You also know that there are 12 - 4 - 2 = 6 packages to be accounted for, of which 3 are green and 3 are yellow. So, there must be a total of 3 x 2 = 6 pieces of Zing Zong and 3 x 5 = 15 Gummy Ape candies.

The Liars' Rail,"The people of Olde Mathville had unique ways of punishing wayward citizens.   For example, those convicted of crimes of dishonesty were chained to the Liars' Rail until they solved a number of puzzles.
One such puzzle has been recently discovered!
In the multiplication below, each letter - L, I, A, R, and S - takes the place of a different digit.   Find the digits to make the multiplication true.
L I A R
x  S
--------
R A I L
or: L I A R  x  S  =  R A I L","L=2, I=1, A=7, R=8, and S=4
2178 x 4 = 8712
One possible solution guide:
* SxL<10, as the product is a 4-digit number; S can not = 1
... so S,L can be 2,3; 2,4; 3,1; 3,2; 4,1; 4,2
* but SxR ends in L - and if S or R is even, so is L
... so S,L,R can be 2,4,7; 3,1,7; 3,2,4; 4,2,8
* the first three are quickly rejected by checking the multiplication
... S=4, L=2, R=8
* Since 2000 x 4 = 8000, nothing has been carried from multiplying the hundreds digit
... so I=1 or 0
* I=0 is rejected as '3' tens have been carried forward from multiplying 4x8; the 3 must be added to 7 to give 0 in the bottom line, and we cannot have 4 x __ = 7.
... so I=1
... so A=7 (the only way to get a 1 in the tens column of the product)",The product of S x L must be less than 10.  Combining that with the need for S x R to end in L limits the possibilities quickly.,2.48,2.79
MMMMM! Mosquitos!,"A bat ate 1050 mosquitos in four nights. Each night she ate 25 more than the night before.
How many mosquitos did the bat eat each night?","The bat ate 225 mosquitoes on the first night, 250 on the second night, 275 on the third night, and 300 on the fourth night.
Let x represent the number of mosquitoes the bat ate on the first night. You know that the bat ate 25 more than this on the second night, or x + 25. On the third night, the bat ate 25 more mosquitoes, or x + 50. On the fourth night, the bat ate 25 more mosquitoes, or x + 75. You also know the total for all four nights was 1050. So, you can write this equation:
x + (x + 25) + (x + 50) + (x + 75) = 1050
This equation simplifies to:
4x + 150 = 1050
Solving for x,
4x = 900

Tammy's Age,"I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?","Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",,2.48,3.0

SLIDE
-DEAN
______
3651
""Each letter in the equation represents a different digit,"" said the troll. ""The letters in the password represent 3651.""
So, what is the password?","The password is LENS.
Since SL-D=3 or (SL-1)-D=3 (meaning SL-D=4), and since the highest possible sum of two different one-digit numbers is 17, S must equal 1.
Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.
Suppose D=7. Then L is 0 or 1, and since S=1, L=0. A must be 1 or 2, but since S=1, A=2.
Suppose D=8. Then L is 1 or 2, and since S=1, L=2. A must be 2 or 3, but since L=2, A=3.
Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.
Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.
If D=7, then L=0. But since 10-7=3, D cannot be 7.
If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.
If E=4, then N=3. But if D=8, A=3, and if D=9, L=3 and A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=5, then since 1I-E=6, I=1. But since S=1, this cannot work.
If E=7, then I=3. But if D=8, then A=3, and if D=9, then L=3. So this cannot work.
If E=8, then I=4, and D cannot be 8. But if D=9, then A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=9, then N=8, and D cannot be 8 or 9. So this cannot work.
Therefore, E=6, N=5, and I=2. If D=8, then L=2, so D must equal 9. This means:
S=1, I=2, L=3, A=4, N=5, E=6, and D=9.

Math Reunion,"Dear Jim:
Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.
Jerry","Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.

In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
The other day, I was having a lively game of Snapoker with three friends when, after three hands, my good friend Kasy commented that my score was the only score that was not a prime number.  What was my score?","I was on 9 points.
After one round of Snapoker a total of 10 points have been awarded to the four players, so after three rounds a total of 30 points have been awarded, meaning players' scores must add up to 30.
The lowest score after three hands is 3 (receiving 1 point every hand) and the greatest score is 12 (receiving 4 points every hand).  Note also that if one player has a score of 3, the next lowest possible score is 6 (receiving 2 points on every hand).  Similarly, if one player has a score of 12, the next highest possible is 9 (receiving 3 points every hand).  If however a player has a score of 4 (1, 1 and 2 points) the next lowest possible score is 5 (2, 2 and 1 points).  A similar approach can be applied for lowest scores of 5, 6 and 7 and for highest scores of 11, 10 and 9.
Now while there are many possible combinations of points that add up to 30, there are only three combinations where one player's score is not a prime number.  These combinations of points are:
3, 7, 9, 11;
5, 5, 9, 11;
7, 7, 7, 9.
In each of the cases above, 9 is the only non-prime and thus must be my score.","In each hand there are a total of 10 points on offer, so after three hands the total of all four players' points must be 30.",2.46,2.56

Sharks 2,"The Boldavian navy has a rigorous training program.  In order to graduate from the naval academy, cadets must enter a pool and fight sharks.  Today, a group of cadets was tested.  Each cadet put on his mask, snorkel, and two flippers; and armed himself with a knife.  Then the cadets jumped into the pool.  The sharks were then released from their pens.  After 10 minutes of gruelling hand-to-fin combat, all of the sharks were killed.  Miraculously, none of the cadets were killed.  Exiting the pool, the cadets began to haul the shark bodies out of the water.  The dead sharks were soon lying in a row.  One of the cadets noted that during the fight, there were 4 times as many cadets in the water as there were sharks.  A second cadet then stated that the number of legs they now had was equal to the square of the number of sharks.  A third said that the number of cadet legs was 14 more than the total number of cadet and shark heads.  How many sharks were killed?","7 sharks were killed.
Since there were 4 times as many cadets, there were 28 cadets.  The number of cadet legs is equal to the square of the number of sharks, which would be 49 legs.  49 legs is 14 more than the number of cadet and shark heads: 7 sharks plus 28 cadets equals 35 heads.
Note that although all of the cadets survived, nothing was said about possible injuries.  In fact, each shark had bitten off one leg from each of 7 cadets.

Candy Murder,"Detective Grant was inspecting the scene of the crime. The 50-year-old victim, Joe, had been poisoned by a candy containing cyanide. On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table. John, 46, was found with 5 candies the day after a 4-yr sentence had been turned over a week ago. Jim, 35, had gotten off a 5-yr sentence a few days ago, only to be found dead with 6 candies yesterday.
Grant puzzled over these cases for days, and then -boom- it hit him. There was a pattern in these murders! What pattern did Grant spot?
Each suspect ate a candy before they died.
Life expectancy when the murders were committed was 70 years.
(It was also curious that many criminals had been let off their sentences too, but had not been killed. 23, in fact, had gotten off.)","The killer was a prosecutor (George) who thought that the criminal deserved a chance to live outside of jail. When the case came before him, he dismissed it. He then went to the criminal's house, and offered him a chance to gamble his life, or go to jail. George offered him a certain number of candies, one of which was poisoned. If the criminal chose a poisoned candy, he died. If he chose a pure candy, he lived.
The criminal's remaining life expectancy divided by his prison sentence would be the number of candies George would bring him, one of which might kill him. In the case of Joe:
His remaining life expectancy at age 50 was 20. 20 divided by 2(his sentence) is 10. George brought him 10 candies, one of which was poisoned. Joe ate the poisoned one, and left nine on the table.
The 23 criminals who got off their sentences, but did not die, chose pure candies.","SUSPECT--AGE--SENTENCE--CANDIES

Six Villages,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.

40+10+10=60,"In the equation FORTY+TEN+TEN=SIXTY, each letter represents a different digit. Can you figure out which letter is which digit?","First, there are ten different letters in this equation: E, F, I, N, O, R, S, T, X, Y. Therefore, every digit from 0 to 9 is used.
Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.
If T=8, then R=X+3, we can have R=6, X=3, or R=7, X=4.
If R=6, X=3, the remaining digits are 2, 4, 7, and again we can't choose S=F+1.
If R=7, X=4, the remaining digits are 2, 3, 6, where 3=2+1. Hence S=3, F=2.

a) How far have you walked?
b) How far (to the nearest inch) do you have to walk to return to your starting position?","a) You have walked 1060 feet.
b) You have to walk 73 feet, 9 inches
Explanation
There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100, neither of which is prime.  (No, 1 is not prime.)  So you will walk in an expanding square with sides of length 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 feet.  This is a total of 1060 feet.
The net result of your turns will be that you are 56 feet ahead of your starting position.
(2+11+23+41+59+73+97)
- (5+17+31+47+67+83)
You will also be 48 feet to the left of your starting position.
(7+19+37+53+71+89)
- (3+13+29+43+61+79)
To calculate the distance back to the starting position, calculate the length of the hypotenuse of the right angle triangle with legs that are 56 and 48 feet long.  This is 73.756 feet, or 73 feet, 9 inches.","Do it on paper, unless you need the exercise!",2.43,2.65

Powerful Weights and Measures,"Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?","The minimum number of weights is 5.
weight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0
weight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1
weight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2
weight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3
weight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4
All five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.
The progression from one stone to one mass would be:
1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....","The title has a slight hint.

I can wrap the boxes separately; in a long line of eight; as a rectangle made up of two rows of four boxes each; or together as a cube.
Wrapping separately:

Assuming the world is a perfect sphere and exactly 25,000 miles around, how much faster does the car travelling on the surface reach the original starting point?
Assume, for the sake of the puzzle, that there are 2 continuous, unobstructed, flat roadways around the earth and that the cars don't need gas, the drivers don't need 'pit stops', etc.","The answer is only about 1 second!!!
The circumference of the Earth is 2*pi*r.  The circumference of the road 15 feet above the Earth is 2*pi*(r+15).  The difference between these two distances is 2*pi*15 = 94 feet.  This is how much further the car on the elevated roadway has to travel.
70 miles per hour is equal to 103 feet per second.  At 103 feet per second, it will take the car on the elevated roadway just under one second to travel the extra 94 feet.",Circumference = 2*pi*r,2.43,2.32

You Could Go Infinite,"What three-digit number when doubled is, by value, one more than the value of the same three digits when reversed?
If this is too easy, go for extra points included with hint.","Answer-
397.
397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.
102?  Is 204 = 201 + 1?  No.
103?  Is 206 = 301 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds even.]
396?  Is 792 = 693 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds again.]
The answer given is the only one that passes.
As for extra points, an infinite number of 9's can be added between the 3 and the 7 without spoiling the major characteristics.
3999999997 * 2 = 7999999994 = 7999999993 + 1.","A wrongheaded guess would say 123, because 123 * 2 = 321 + 1.  The title hints you can easily go on to find for a ten-digit number that otherwise has same characteristics.",2.43,2.84
How Many Dollars,"Sandy and Sue each has a whole number of dollars. I ask them how many dollars they have.
Sandy says: ""If Sue gives me some dollars, we'll have the same amount of money. But if I give Sue the same number of dollars, she'll have twice as much money as I have.""
Sue says: ""And if you remove the first digit of my wealth and place it to the end, you'll get Sandy's wealth.""
If neither of them has more than 1 million dollars, how many dollars do they each have?","Let X and Y be Sandy's and Sue's amounts of money, respectively. Let Z be the number of dollars in Sandy's statement.
Then X+Z=Y-Z and 2(X-Z)=Y+Z. Solving this we get X=5Z and Y=7Z.
According to Sue's statement, let A be the first digit of Sue's wealth, B be the remaining digits, and n be the number of digits, then Y=A*10^(n-1)+B and X=10B+A.
7X=5Y
7*(10B+A)=5*(A*10^(n-1)+B)
(5*10^(n-1)-7)A=65B
Since 65B is divisible by 5 and 5*10^(n-1)-7 is not, A must equal 5. We get:
5*10^(n-1)-7=13B
The least value of n such that 5*10^(n-1)-7 is a multiple of 13 is 6:
499993=38461*13
The next is 12, which makes them have more than 1 million dollars. Hence n=6 and B=38461.
Therefore, Sandy has 384615 dollars and Sue has 538461 dollars.","First get the ratio, then get their amount.",2.43,2.98

Regular club prices: Each video normally costs between $19.95 and $39.95.

You also know that none of the tall men does not have mustache while none of the short men with hair have mustache, but half of the bald medium height men have mustaches and nine of the medium height men with hair have mustaches too.  If the number of the bald short men with mustache is less by three than the rest of other men that have mustaches and the percentage of total men with mustaches is 50% then the question is: does the very tall man have mustache or not (do not guess) and how can you prove that?","Yes, the very tall man has a mustache.
Let number of tall men = X then number of medium height men is 2X and number of short men is 6X (3*2X).
Total number of men = X+2X+6X+1(very tall man) = 82
Solving 9X = 81 gives:
Number of tall men is 9
Number of medium height men is 18
Number of short men is 54
And 1 very tall man
Grouping facts:
1. All tall men are bald and none of the tall men does not have mustache (in other words all of them have mustaches) that means you have 9 tall bald people with mustache.
2. The number of medium height men with hair is double of the number of bald medium height men (assume it Y) gives: Y+2Y = 18, and so Y = 6 which is the number of bald medium height men and the number of medium height men with hair = 12.
9 medium height men with hair have mustaches and 3 bald medium height men (half of them) have mustaches too.
3. Adding up the number of men that have mustaches up till this point from 1 & 2 above:
Number of men with mustaches = 9(tall) + 9(medium height men with hair) + 3(bald medium height men = 21
If the very tall man does not have a mustache, then the number of bald short men mustache = 18 (less by 3 than the above number.)  If the very tall man does have a mustache then the number of bald short men is 19 (less by 3 than the above number plus one for the very tall man.)
Percentage of total number of men with mustaches = 0.5
= 0.5 * 82 = 41 men
There must be 21 + (21 + W) - 3 + W = 41 men with mustaches (where W is the one very tall man if having a mustache, and either equals 1 if he has a mustache or = 0 if he does not have one.)

If you consider the group to consist of 1 man, 2 dogs and 4 spiders, the number of legs will be 42 (This is the least value possible with the given ratio).  Since 420 is ten times 42, you must multiply this ratio of men to dogs to spiders by 10 to get the answer.","Men have 2 legs,

Hole in One,"Fred took a ball that has a 13 inch diameter and drilled a circular hole through the center of it.  The hole was 5 inches wide, but how deep is it?","12 inches.
To solve this one, we can use the work of Pythagoras.  If we draw the ball and hole from the side, they look like a circle with a rectangle in it, with all four points of the rectangle touching the circle.
We know the length of the short side and we need the length of the long side.  To get it, we'll need the length of the diagonal of the rectangle to create a triangle.  By looking back at our drawing, we can see that the diagonal of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the ball.
From that we have a triangle where hypotenuse, c, is 13 inches, leg a is 5 inches, and we want to solve for leg b.  Using c^2=a^2 + b^2, we solve for b and find that the depth of the hole is 12 inches.",,2.41,2.37

The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.
The 36th root of a googol is

Rex and Ralph: Polygonal House,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.",2.39,3.18

Pyramids of Egypt,"My Dad has a miniature Pyramid of Egypt. It is 5  inches in height. Dad was invited to display it at an exhibition. Dad felt it was too small and decided to build a scaled-up model of the Pyramid out of material whose density is (1/ 5) times the density of the material used for the miniature. He did a ""back-of-the-envelope"" calculation to check whether the model would be big enough.
If the mass (or weight) of the miniature and the scaled-up model are to be the same, how many inches in height will be the scaled-up Pyramid? Give your answer to two places of decimal.","Mass = Density * volume and
Volume of model/Volume of miniature = (H of model / H of miniature)^3
In the above equation, H is the characteristic dimension (say, height).
If the mass is to be the same, then density is inversely proportional to volume. Also, the volumes are directly proportional to the cubes of the heights for objects that are geometrically similar. Therefore, the heights are seen to be inversely proportional to the cube roots of the densities. Thus,
Height of model = Height of miniature x (Density of miniature / Density of model)^1/3 or
Height of model = 5  x [ 5^1/3 ]  = 8.55  inches.",,2.39,2.32

Three Digit Employee Id!!!,"Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.
We were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?","It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.
Hence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.
Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90. These 90 id's will not have a corresponding number when written in reverse order.
Secondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order. For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.
Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.
Therefore total number of valid employee id's possible = 90 + 90 + 360 = 540.",,2.39,2.71

Every day, except every four years when he abstains on Leap Day, he smokes the same number of cigarettes, brews the same amount of coffee grinds, and uses the same amount of cream in his coffee. Every day he buys the daily newspaper, which he purchases more often than a pack of 20 cigarettes. The pack of cigarettes is purchased more often than a half-pint of cream, which in turn is purchased more often than a one pound can of coffee. On Flag Day (USA) he purchased all four items. The next time he purchased all four items on the same day was the Fourth of July of the following year. How many cigarettes does he smoke each day?","4 cigarettes a day.
The purchases are made according to 4 different cycles. There are 385 days from Flag Day until July Fourth of the following year excluding Leap Day. These purchasing cycles intersect every 385 days and are thus in the set of factors for 385 (1, 5, 7, 11, and 385). Since the newspaper is purchased every day, and the coffee and cream are purchased more often then the pack of cigarettes, then the pack is purchased either every 5 days or every 7 days.  The pack contains 20 cigarettes which only has the factor 5 in common with the possible cycle for the cigarettes.  Therefore a pack of 20 is purchased every 5 days.",Flag Day (USA) is June 14,2.38,2.95

A Day Out,"Keith opened the door, hopped into the car and revved his engine. He was going to the small town exhibition.
He arrived at the exhibition not long after, and began wandering over to look at the different things.
At the gift shop he spent 50% of his overall money.
He then went on the Dodgems and spent 20% of the remaining money.
He entered a raffle which cost 50% of the remaining money.
He finally bought one hot dog which cost 10% of the remaining money.
He ended up with $22.50.
How much money did Keith start with, and how much did each thing cost?","You have to work backwards to get this right. All you know at this point is that Keith ended up with $22.50.
The hot dog costs $2.50.
That would bring us up to $25.00. 10% of $25.00 equals $2.50 so if he spends $2.50 on the hot dog that brings us to $22.50, which is the starting point.
The raffle ticket was $25.00.
Before he buys the raffle ticket he has $50.00. He spends 50% of this, so then all you have to do is double $25.00 which makes $50.00.
The Dodgems were $12.50.
This means that before he went on the Dodgems he had $62.50. The Dodgems would have cost 20% of this, which is $12.50. That takes us to $50.00, which is where he was after the Dodgems.
The gifts cost $62.50.
Once again, you just have to multiply the money before the Dodgems by 2.
This means that he started with $125.

Rex and Ralph: Prime Clues,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""
""The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.""
Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.",2.38,3.14
101 Percent Surprise,"The other day, I took an online survey in which there were two choices: ""True"" and ""False"". I made my selection and was surprised to see the results:
33% of people had selected ""True""
68% of people had selected ""False"".
My biggest surprise was that most people didn't agree with me. The answer was obviously ""True"", how could anyone think otherwise?
I was also slightly surprised to see that the responses totaled 101 percent. Obviously the percentages were rounded to whole numbers. What is the minimum number of people that had completed the survey?","The exact results must be 32.5% and 67.5%. These values total 100% and both numbers would be rounded up to match the observed results of 33% and 68%.
The percents can be written as fractions: 32.5/100 and 67.5/100.
Multiply top and bottom by two to avoid the decimals: 65/200 and 135/200.
Finally, reduce the fractions (both are divisible by 5): 13/40 and 27/40.

"No-Fat Frankfurters, A Last Hope","Patty O'Furniture, Kurt, & Rod were walking downtown when they spotted a forlorn friend staring at a small object in her hand.  She was propped against a wall, one foot off the ground.
""I know her,"" Patty said.  ""She looks like she could use some help.  I think she broke a heel off her shoe.""
Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.
""This is my sole sister,"" the girl groaned, ""with the obvious name.""
Kurt looked blank.  After a few seconds, Rod's face lit up.
""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""
""Right,"" she grumbled, ""and it tastes like recycled history essays?""
The three grinned broadly at her.  ""Try one,"" Kurt said, proffering one of the shrink-wrapped torpedoes.
Eileen shifted some of her weight back to the toe of the damaged right shoe and tentatively accepted the Rnkfurer.  She unwrapped it, took one bite, and saw her ecstatic grin reflected on the faces of the other three.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""We were about to go order more tomorrow.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""
Eileen got it right away.  ""So we each get 25 of them, and have 25% of the total.""
Rod grinned.  ""That's cheating.  We use different numbers.""
""Oh, all right.""  She thought for a few seconds.  ""So you can do it a few ways for two people, round off for three, but we couldn't do it for four.""
""Really?""  Rod wasn't as quick with the enlarged problem.  ""I'm not surprised, but that means we'll just have to buy in pairs.""
""Or change the rules a little,"" Eileen added.
""How so?""  Kurt was ready to do almost anything that would get a Rnkfurer refill.
""Well, how about if Kurt buys twice as many as Rod's percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt's percentage ...""
Kurt looked hopeful, Patty was expectant, and Rod's analytical gears were grinding.
""It's a big order, but we could do it,"" he finally declared.
The grocer now orders Rnkfurers only in cases 100, but that didn't disturb anything.  How many did each student get this time?","Rod	405, 67.5% ... 67.5 * 2 = 135
Kurt	135, 22.5% ... 22.5 * 2 = 45
Patti	45, 7.5% ... 7.5 * 2 = 15
Eileen	15
TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",They got a total of 600 Rnkfurers.,2.37,2.93

Antique Jewelry,"Three pieces of antique jewelry - a locket, a pin, and a ring - have ages whose sum is 310 years. The sum of 2 times the age of the locket 5 years ago and the age of the pin 10 years ago is 240 years. The difference between 3 times the locket's age in 3 years and 2 times the ring's age 4 years ago is 0. Find the ages of the locket, the pin, and the ring.","Locket=L
Pin=P
Ring=R
L+P+R=310 (equation 1)
2L+P=260 (equation 2)

Combine equations 1 and 2, and multiply equation 2 by -1.
L+P+R=310
-2L-P=-260
____________
-L+R=50
Now multiply the new equation by 2 and combine it with equation 3.
3L-2R=-17
-2L+2R=100
____________
L=83
So the locket is 83 years old.
Now substitute the value for ""L"" into the original equation 2.
2L+P=260
2(83)+P=260
166+P=260
P=94
So the pin is 94 years old.
For the final step substitute the locket's age into the original equation 3 to get the ring's age.
3L-2R=-17
3(83)-2R=-17
249-2R=-17
R=133
So the ring is 133 years old.

"Easy As Cake, Junior","In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.
On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.
About this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, ""Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.""
Knowing Junior, we asked, ""How big a headache is your math gonna give us?""
She answered, ""I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.""
Name the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.","Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.
After labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, ""Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof. First, I mark a line from A to D.  This creates a trapezoid (trapezium in Britain) ABCD.  Next, I mark the lines EH, BG, and CF.  These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.""
The partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's. (The second and third cuts can be made in reverse order.)

Substitute N = T^2 into the second equation to get:  (T^2 - 640)/T = 72.
Multiplying both sides by T and rearranging gives you the polynomial:  T^2 - 72*T - 640 =  0.  Solving this gives roots of -8 and 80.  Obviously, there can't be -8 trees in the orchard, so there must be 80.",,2.35,2.08
Cow Cash,"A farmer with seven daughters is budgeting the food and medical expenses they will incur to care for their herd of cows over a two-week period. The herd consists of adult mother cows and their calves.
Each of the farmer's daughters has seven plows, each plow is pulled by seven mother cows, and each mother cow has seven calves.
The farmer and his daughters know the following:
Out of all those mother cows, two-sevenths are still nursing their calves, while five-sevenths of the mothers have weaned their calves.
Nursing mothers eat more, so they each need 8 ounces of solid cow food a day. The other mothers need only 6 ounces a day.
The weaned calves each need 2 ounces of food a day, while the calves still being nursed don't eat any solid food.
The family pays $1.02 per pound of solid cow food.
During this two-week period, each calf has to be vaccinated. The cost of the vaccination is $14 per calf.
What will be the total amount paid to feed and vaccinate the cows during this two-week period?","It costs $38,686.97 to care for the cows for 2 weeks.
Explanation
Determine the number of cows and calves.
7 daughters x 7 plows for each daughter = 49 plows altogether
7 mother cows per plow x 49 plows = 343 mother cows
7 calves per mother cow x 343 mother cows = 2,401 calves
Determine the number of types of cows and calves.
The nursing mothers = 2/7 x 343 = 98.
The mothers with weaned calves =  5/7 x 343 = 245.
Five-sevenths of the calves are weaned and do need solid food: 5/7 x 2,401 = 1,715 weaned calves.
Two-sevenths of the calves are still nursing and don't need solid food:  2/7 x 2,401 = 686 nursing calves.
Determine the amount of food each type of cow or calf requires.
Each nursing mother needs 8 ounces of food per day; the total number of ounces of food per day for all nursing cows is: 8 x 98 = 784 oz per day.
Each mother with weaned calves needs 6 ounces of food per day; the total number of ounces of food per day for all mother cows with weaned calves is: 6 x 245 = 1,470 oz of food per day.
Weaned calves eat 2 ounces of food per day: 1,715 x 2 = 3,430 oz of food per day.
Determine the amount of food the entire herd needs.
The whole herd of cows needs:
784  + 1,470  + 3,430 = 5,684 oz
5,684 oz of food per day /16 oz per lb = 355.25 lbs of cow food per day.
Determine how much money the food will cost.
There are 14 days in 2 weeks. Multiply 355.25 lbs by 14 days to find the number of pounds of food needed for 2 weeks, 4,973.5 lbs.
Since the food costs $1.02 per pound, multiply 4,973.5 lbs. by $1.02 to find the total amount needed for food, $5.072.97.
Determine how much the vaccinations will cost.
All 2,401 calves need vaccinations. Multiply 2,401 calves by $14 per shot to find the total amount needed for shots, $33,614.
Add the cost of the food to the cost of the vaccinations to find the total cost of caring for the cows for 2 weeks.
$5,072.97 + $33,614 = $38,686.97.",,2.35,2.46
Degrees of Time,How many degrees are between the hour and minute hand on a clock if the time is 3:40?,"130 Degrees
The easiest way to solve this is to think that the clock is a circle and that there are 360 degrees in a circle.  Draw a clock and set the hands at 3:40.  From the 3 to the 8 equals 150 degrees; which might have been your answer if you didn't account for the movement of the hour hand.  Since the minute hand is at the eight, it has moved 2/3 around the clock. Therefore, the hour hand has moved 2/3 the distance in between the 3 and the 4.  Since there are 30 degrees in between each number, this means that the hour hand has moved 20 degrees towards the 4, or 150 degrees - 20 degrees = 130 degrees.",Try sketching it out on paper.,2.35,1.61

Mice & Ropes,"You have two identical ropes and three mice.  Each mouse bites off the rope at a different biting speed.  All three biting speeds are constant.
Mouse(A) bites off one rope in 60 minutes.
Mouse(B) bites off one rope in 90 minutes.
Mouse(C) bites off one rope in 180 minutes.
You do not have any time or distance measuring tools and the length of the rope is unknown.  How can you measure 75 minutes?","Mark the two ropes as Rope(A) and Rope(B).
1. Let Mouse(A) and Mouse(C) start biting off Rope(A) at the same time, starting each from  one end (moving in opposite directions).  At the same time, let Mouse(B) start biting off Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(A) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X = S(A) * 60, where S(A) is biting speed for Mouse(A) and X is Rope(A) length
X = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X is Rope(A) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(A)/S(C) = 3:1, which means that for each 3 units Mouse(A) will move, Mouse (C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(A) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(A) bites off three times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides Rope(A) length in to 4 units.
Mouse(A) bitten off portion = 3/4 X (where X is Rope(A) length)
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/4 X
Finding the time spent before Rope(A) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(A) needs  60 minutes to bite off X, How many minutes are needed to bite off 3/4 X?
Minutes needed = 3/4 * 60 = 45 minutes are needed to fully bite off Rope(A) by Mouse(A) and Mouse(C).  At that point in time, Mouse(B) would have bitten off exactly half the length of Rope(B) (needing 90 minutes to bite off the full rope), and needs an additional 45 minutes to bite off the remaining rope half.
2. Let Mouse(B) continue biting off Rope(B) and make Mouse(C) start biting off the other end of Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(B) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X/2 = S(B) * 90, where S(B) is biting speed for Mouse(B) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
X/2 = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(B)/S(C) = 2:1, which means that for each 2 units Mouse(B) will move, Mouse(C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(B) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(B) bites off two times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides the remaining half of Rope(B) length to 3 units.
Mouse(B) bitten off portion = 2/3 * X/2 = X/3
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/3 * X/2 = X/6
Finding the time spent before the remaining half of Rope(B) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(B) needs  90 minutes to bite off X, how many minutes are needed to bite off X/3?
Minutes needed = 1/3 * 90 = 30 minutes are needed to fully bite off the remaining half of Rope(B) by Mouse(B) and Mouse(C).
At that point in time, 75 minutes would have passed (45 minutes consumed from biting off Rope(A) and another 30 minutes consumed from biting off Rope(B)).",,2.35,2.75

Rnkfurers In Philos,"Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.
""I know that voice!  C'mon down.""
""Who is it?"" Eileen prodded.
""Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?""
Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.
""Why should I?""
""I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.""
""Is that the new Sinatra CD?""
""No, it's the world's greatest snack.""
""I'm hungry, too!"" the other voice whined.
""Who's up there with you?""  Patty asked.
""I'll bet I know!"" Eileen called.  ""It's obvious!""
Patty's face lit up in realization.  ""Robin!"" they laughed together.
A pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.
""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""
""We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.""
""What are those?""
""You know what a perfect number is?""
""Sure,"" Patty interjected, ""a number equal to the sum of its divisors.""
""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.  What are the four quantities in the sequence?","108, 172, 136, and 134.
Method:
This one really requires a brute-force approach.  The sigma function (sum of a number's divisors) does not lend itself to 3rd-order analysis (3 numbers past the first one).  Most of the remaining numbers will leave the 100-200 range on the first or second iteration.  I used a small computer program.  The only sequence that stays in bounds for 4 terms is the one given.
Side notes:
The name ""Desire Creek"" is a nod to ""Desire Under the Elms"" and the ""Elm Creek Quilt"" books.
There are 4-cycles of amicable numbers.  However, the least quadruple is a little large, even for Patty's appetite: 1264460, 1547860, 1727636, 1305184.",You can leave out numbers that are primes (sum of proper divisors is 1) or the product of two primes (sum of divisors will be less than 100).

Coconut Craziness,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.",2.35,3.12

Father of the Brides,"The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.

Kebab Farmer,"In the legendary country of MADADIA, there once lived a kebab farmer. One day, he had 1000 freshly grown Kebabs to package and 10 empty boxes into which to put them.
He asks his assistant Norris O'Cabbage to place all the one thousand Kebabs in all the 10 boxes in such a manner that if a customer asks for any number of Kebabs from 1 to 1000, Norris should be able to pick them in terms of boxes.
How did Norris O'Cabbage place all the Kebabs among the ten boxes, given that any number of freshly harvested Kebabs can be put in one box.","1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 489
Let's start from scratch.
The Kebab farmer can ask for only 1 Kebab, so one box must contain 1 Kebab.
He can ask for 2 Kebabs, so one box must contain 2 Kebabs.
He can ask for 3 Kebabs, in which case box one and box two will add up to 3 Kebabs.
He can ask for 4 Kebabs, so one box, i.e. a third box, must contain 4 Kebabs.

Averages Aren't So Easy,"A man is biking on a 40 mile trip. He travels the first half of the trip at a speed of 15 miles per hour. If he wants his average speed to be 20 miles per hour, at what speed should he travel during the second half?","30 miles per hour.
Step 1: If he wants an average speed of 20 miles per hour on a 40 mile trip, then he needs to travel for a total time of 2 hours.
Step 2: Since he travels at a speed of 15 miles per hour during the first half of the trip, it takes him 80 minutes for the first half, so he has 40 minutes left to travel 20 miles.
Step 3: Since he needs to travel 20 miles in 40, simply add one half of 40 (20), to make 60 (an hour), and do the same to the 20 miles he needs to travel to find out how many miles per hour he needs to travel.

Park It Ranger,"Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?
Comments to triflers:
The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!","80
To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion. This takes 9 trips of 2 5/18 miles (5 advancing trips interspersed with 4 return trips) for a total of 20.5 miles traveled (9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5) and 20.5 bottles of soda used. Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases. With one less case to move, Bu will now make 2 fewer trips. The 3.5 bottles set aside are used to move the four cases the next 1/2 mile toward the Wirth Pavilion.   After this, the Wirth Pavilion is just 2 2/9 miles away ( 5 - 2 5/18 - 9/18 = 2 4/18 ). Next, he travels 15 5/9 miles (7 * 2 2/9) using 15 5/9 bottles of soda to complete his trip.

If they had won a total of 27 kebabs between them, how many did Mad Ade win?","Mad Ade won five kebabs
There were only four friends, and six differences between them which were given. Therefore every possible difference between the four friends was named and we are looking for four numbers whose six differences are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
The differences between numbers don't change if all the numbers are increased or decreased by the same amount, so we can start by assuming that the first number is one, in which case the largest number (to give a maximum difference of six), must be seven.
We have to fill in the two middle numbers so that the six differences are the numbers 1 to 6. There are just two ways to do this:
1 2 5 7 or 1 3 6 7
The total number of kebabs won in the first case is 1+2+5+7=15, which can be raised to 27 if we add three kebabs to each friends total, making their totals 4, 5, 8 and 10. The total of the second set is, however, 17, which cannot be raised to 27 by increasing each number by the same amount.

Young Sir Mad Ade, knight of the periodic table, was dispatched by the King to dispense with the infamous Dragon.
The task was not as straight forward as in may seem, as the Georgian Dragon had three heads and three tails. If this was not bad enough there was even more of a problem, the dragon had certain regenerative powers, so if one head is chopped off, a new head grows, also if Sir Mad Ade is to chop off one tail, two new tails grow.
If  Sir Mad hacks off two tails, one new head grows. But if two heads are chopped off, nothing grows.
Young Sir Mad has with him a magical sword, blessed by the lady of the boating lake. The sword is capable of removing with a single blow either one head or two heads, or one tail or two tails, but never a combination of a head or a tail in one blow.
What is the smallest number of strokes required by Sir Mad Ade to chop off all heads and tails of the dragon, thus killing it?","Sir Mad Ade managed it in nine strokes.
The best way to achieve this is that all of the tails must be converted to heads in such a way that the dragon is left with an even number of heads.
The way Sir Mad did this in the smallest number of strokes was to first convert the three tails to six tails by using three one-tail strokes, then converting the six tails to three heads via three two-tail strokes. Finally, the now six-headed dragon can be killed with three two-head strokes.

Difficult Danny 2,"Difficult Danny has acquired his nickname (and some other, less polite nicknames) due to the fact that, whenever he buys anything, he insists upon paying the exact amount, with precisely 100 pieces of currency. Danny wanted an xCube365 (it lasts 365 days before programmatically disabling itself, so that a new one must be purchased), the highly coveted gaming system that had just been released. It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?","Can at least one of each denomination be used? That totals $186 with only 6 bills, plus at least $94 with the rest of the bills. This is too high. Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.
If a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities. So $100 bill is the denomination that is not used. We now know that at least one of each of the other bills is used. That totals $86 with 5 bills, leaving 95 bills to make the other $144.
There are only 4 ways to make $144 with these denominations, which are listed in order from $1 bills to $50 bills in each of these sets: {84,10,1,0,0}, {89,1,5,0,0}, {89,3,2,1,0}, {94,0,0,0,1}. Adding in one of each bill, which we have already determined, gives {85,11,2,1,1}, {90,2,6,1,1}, {90,4,3,2,1}, {95,1,1,1,2}. {1,1,1} is the only triplet here that can make a true multiplication sentence: 1 x 1 = 1. Therefore, Danny paid with 95 $1 bills, a $5 bill, a $10 bill, a $20 bill, and 2 $50 bills.",,2.32,2.68

Now suppose a smaller wheel of radius 2 cm, is made to roll around the larger wheel in the same vertical plane while the larger wheel remains fixed. What is the total number of rotations the smaller wheel makes when its center makes one complete rotation about the larger wheel?","The correct answer is 6 rotations. Suppose you rotate the smaller wheel and the larger wheel together without rolling through one rotation clockwise, the small wheel has rotated through 1 turn clockwise. Now rotate the larger wheel back to its original position counter-clockwise through one rotation at the same time holding the center of the small wheel in the original position but allowing the wheel to rotate without sliding. It will rotate through 5 more turns due to the ratio of the circumferences of the wheels. The total number of rotations of the small wheel is 5 + 1 = 6.",,2.32,2.36

He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?","The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74
Lemp 47 94
Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Number of people who got in at the six stations - Number of people who got out at the six stations) =
227 - (364 - 182) =
227 - 182 =
45 people
Thus, I disappointed Tweeto by giving him the answer as 45 people.",,2.31,2.58
Alphabet Soup,"Jeremy sat down at the table, and prepared to eat his alphabet soup for brunch. Before putting anything in his mouth, Jeremy took out all of the letters in the bowl, and separated them into groups on his napkin. After counting them, he realized that there were:

Filling Glasses,"Joey has 8 drinking glasses, all of different sizes. He has lined them up from smallest to largest and numbered them #1 (smallest) to #8 (largest). He knows that glass #4 holds 10 ounces and that glass #7 holds a pint, or 16 ounces. Now he wants to figure out how much all the others hold!
He experiments by filling up different glasses with water and pouring the water back and forth into other glasses. Here are his results:
Pouring water from glasses #1 and #2 filled glass #4.
Pouring water from glasses #1 and #3 filled glass #5.
Pouring water from glasses #2 and #3 filled glass #6.
Pouring water from glasses #1 and #5 filled glass #7.

How much water does each glass hold?","#1 holds 4 ounces
#2 holds 6 ounces
#3 holds 8 ounces
#4 holds 10 ounces
#5 holds 12 ounces
#6 holds 14 ounces
#7 holds 16 ounces
#8 holds 20 ounces
To begin with, you know that glass #4 holds 10 ounces and that glass #7 holds 16 ounces. With this information and the given clues, you can quickly determine that glass #8 holds 20 ounces (10 ounces x 2 = 20 ounces) and that glass #3 holds 8 ounces (16 ounces / 2 = 8 ounces).
Now you can substitute for the remaining equations and find that:
Since #7 holds 16 ounces and #7 + #1 = #8, then #1 must hold 4 ounces (20 - 16 = 4).
Since #1 + #2 = #4, then #2 must hold 6 ounces (10 - 4 = 6).
Since #1 + #5 = #7, then #5 must hold 12 ounces (16 - 4 = 12).
Since #2 + #3 = #6, then #6 must hold 14 ounces (6 + 8 = 14).","Rewrite each experiment as an equation, and then substitute the known quantities for #4 and #7 into the equations wherever you can.",2.31,1.83

At exactly 2:00, the angle made by the hour hand is 60 degrees from vertical.  If you let x = the number of minutes past 2:00 that we are looking for, then the hour hand will be at:

If you were to calculate the average speed, you'll see that the chicken's average speed, after 5 minutes, is 2.6 mph.
The Self Basting Turkey's average speed is 2.67 mph.
The Duck La Orange, as stated above, has an average speed of 2 mph.
Based on this information alone it appears that the Self Basting Turkey should win.
The catch is the fact that the one-mile race does not take an even multiple of five minutes to complete. The Southern Fried Chicken's average speed is only accurate after the full five minutes of flying/walking is completed. At any time before that, the chicken's mean speed will be higher.
After 20 minutes have passed, the Southern Fried Chicken will have traveled a total of  0.87 miles, and the Self Basting Turkey will have traveled a distance of 0.89 miles. However, the S.F Chicken will then begin flying at 5 mph, and will overtake the S.B.Turkey.
The final results will be:
1. Southern Fried Chicken - 21.6 minutes (21 minutes 36 seconds)
2. Self Basting Turkey - 22.5 minutes (22 minutes 30 seconds)
3. Duck La Orange - 30 minutes",,2.3,2.35
Sum of Squares,"If the difference between two numbers is 9 and their product is 14, what is the sum of their squares?","109
You could solve this by setting up two equations:
X - Y = 9
X * Y = 14
and solving for X and Y (which equal approximately 10.35 and 1.35 or -1.35 and -10.35, respectively).  Then take X^2 + Y^2 to get 109.
Or you could recognize that:
(X-Y)^2 = X^2 - 2*X*Y + Y^2
rearranging,
X^2 + Y^2 = (X-Y)^2 + 2*X*Y
The left side of this equation is what we're looking for.  From the original two equations, we know that:
X-Y = 9 and therefore (X-Y)^2 = 81.
X*Y = 14 and therefore 2*X*Y = 28.
81 + 28 = 109, which is the answer.",,2.3,2.49

"Half Twin, Double Twin.","I met Ronny and Johnny at the zoo. They are identical twins that like math very much, so they were constantly adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing any amounts.

Ringing All Around,"It's easy to see that a ring can completely hold (surround) two identical smaller rings with half the diameter, without overlapping. Three times the diameter, the bigger ring is space enough to seat seven rings; the outer six touching both the middle ring and the bigger circle/perimeter.
Using this basic information and your imagination, determine the maximum number of rings that could be housed inside another ring with four, five, six and seven times the diameter.","For 4D (four times the diameter) ring, place the 2D ring exactly at the center inside 4D, and you will have donut-shaped empty space with a width of a D ring, around the 2D. The number of rings to be fit in this vacancy, R, is determined from the formula
R < (n - 1)*pi
where n is the nth times the diameter and R is an integer.
This formula is derived from the fact that the circumference of a polygon with R sides (made up by connecting all the nucleus of the rings in the donut area) is always smaller (actually is inscribed in) than the locus of the donut area. This locus is, of course, neither the donut's outer nor inner ring, but the one in between those two.
In a 4D ring:
central 2D = 2
R < (4 - 1)*pi = 9
number of rings, x = 2 + 9 = 11
In 5D ring with 3D center:
x = 7 + 12 = 19
6D: x = 11 + 15 = 26
7D: x = 19 + 18 = 37
The center for nth ring is always the (n - 2)th one. This calculation is based on the hypothesis that the accumulated/shared empty spaces (outside small rings) among central and donut area is small enough to fit for another ring.","I would say ""go and chop down your trees"" but Greenpeace people might sue me.",2.29,2.92

Zeros and Ones,What is the smallest integer greater than 0 that can be written entirely with zeros and ones and is evenly divisible by 225?,"The prime factorization of 225 is 5*5*3*3. So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.
All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",,2.29,2.62

Assume that the values of one Kebab, one Fries and one Pop are K, F and P respectively.
From Group II : K + 5F + 7P = 300
From Group III : K + 7F + 10P = 390

Similarly, for Group IV :
= 9K + 23F + 30P
= 9(K + 5F + 7P) - (22F + 33P)
= 9(K + 5F + 7P) - 11(2F + 3P)

"Paper On, Dude!","The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with ""rock"", 2 points with ""scissors"", and 1 point with ""paper"".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one ""throw"", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.
The players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.
Knowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?","Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.","(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.
(2) This is a ""zero-sum"" game: what one player wins, the other loses.
(3) The game is ""symmetric"": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.
(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.",2.29,2.89

"Hickory Dickory Dock, the Spider Went Round the Clock...","At exactly six o'clock, a spider started to walk at a constant speed from the hour hand anticlockwise round the edge of the clock face. When it reached the minute hand, it turned round (assume the turn was instantaneous) and walked in the opposite direction at the same constant speed. It reached the minute hand again after 20 minutes. At what time was this second meeting?","First, we set up the equation for the time (t) that the spider meets the minute hand the first time. The minute hand moves at 6 degrees per minute, and the spider moves at x degrees per minute. Since the spider starts at the 6 or at 180 degrees away from the minute hand,
6(t) = 180 - x(t)
Now if we say that the spider and minute hand are at the same spot, and start moving in the same direction, and the spider laps the minute hand (360 degrees plus the distance traveled by the minute hand, or 360 + 6(20) or 480 total degrees) then the distance traveled by the spider in 20 minutes must be 480 degrees. The spider, therefore, travels 24 degrees per minute.
Plug 24 degrees per minute into the equation for x, and solve:
6(t) = 180 -24(t)
6(t) + 24(t) = 180
30(t) = 180
t = 6
So the first meeting is at 6 minutes after 6, or 6:06. 20 minutes later at the second meeting is 6:26.",,2.28,2.18

Time gain !!!,"A watch which gains 5 seconds every 3 minutes was set correctly at 7 a.m. In the afternoon of the same day, when the watch indicated a quarter past 4 o'clock, what was the true time?","The true time is 4 p.m.
The watch advanced 9 hours and 15 minutes (555 minutes) between 7 am and 4:15 pm.
For every 3 minutes and 5 seconds (185 seconds) that the watch advances, actual time progresses 3 minutes (180 seconds).
Therefore you need to figure out how many 185-second intervals there are in 555 minutes and then figure out how much actual time passes in the same number of 180-second intervals.
Number of 185-second intervals in 555 minutes:
(555 minutes * 60 seconds/minute)/185 seconds = 180 intervals
Amount of time passing in 180, 180-second intervals:
180 intervals * 180 seconds / (60 seconds/minute) = 540 minutes
Therefore, in the time that the watch advanced 555 minutes, actual time advanced 540 minutes.  The difference is 15 minutes, making the actual time 4:00 pm.",,2.28,2.04

Scale 4: 1A balances ?C","You need 5C.
1. If you double the weights on Scale 1, you learn that 2L = 2C + 2A.
2. By checking out Scale 3 you know that you can replace 2L in the above equation with 3B: 3B = 2C + 2A.
3. Add 3C to each side.  Now 3B + 3C = 5C + 2A.

What is a Car Worth?,"Henry is preparing to leave his parents' house, but before he goes, he needs a car and some money.  His father agrees to give him $10,000 and a car if he works in the family store for a year.  This sounds like a good deal to Henry, so he accepts.
After working for 7 months, Henry decides he has done enough.  He quits his job, and his father says, ""Fair enough.  I will give you the car and $2,500.""
Henry replies, ""Knowing what the car is worth, that is perfectly fair.""
What is the car worth?","The car is worth $8,000.
If we denote the value of the car as 'c', then the value of 12 months of work would be 10000 + c, and the value of 7 months of work is 2500 + c.
Assuming that the value of a month of work is constant, we have the value of a month of work equaling (10000 + c)/(12 months) = (2500 + c)/(7 months).  Since the two are equal, we can solve for c.
(7/12)*(10000 + c) = 2500 + c
(70000/12) - 2500 = c - (7/12)*c

Tables and Chairs,"A factory that produces tables and chairs is equipped with 10 saws, 6 lathes, and 18 sanding machines. It takes a chair 10 minutes on a saw, 5 minutes on a lathe, and 5 minutes of sanding to be completed. It takes a table 5 minutes on a saw, 5 minutes on a lathe, and 20 minutes of sanding to be completed. A chair sells for $10 and a table sells for $20. How many tables and chairs should the factory produce per hour to yield the highest revenue, and what is that revenue?","The 10 saws can produce 600 minutes of work per hour (10 saws * 60 minutes).
The 6 lathes can produce 360 minutes of work per hour (6 lathes * 60 minutes).
The 18 sanding machines can produce 1080 minutes of work per hour (18 sanding machines * 60 minutes).
Let c be the number of chairs produced per hour and t the number of tables produced per hour.
The number of saws limit the combination of chairs and tables to 600=10c+5t.
The number of lathes limit the combination of chairs and tables to 360=5c+5t.
The number of sanding machines limit the combination of chairs and tables to 1080=5c+20t.
Next graph these three lines. It should be expected that the answer will lie on the intersection of two of these lines or to make all chairs or all tables. The intersection of the saw and sanding machine line occurs outside of how many chairs the lathe can make so this combination is not a viable answer. The saw and lathe lines cross at 48 chairs and 24 tables. The lathe and sanding machine lines cross at 24 chairs and 48 tables.
Next determine the revenue at all points of intersection.
Chairs    Tables      Revenue
60	0	600
48	24	960
24	48	1200
0	54	1080
So the optimal answer is to make 24 chairs and 48 tables for revenue of $1200 per hour.
To check it will take 24*10 + 48*5 = 480 minutes of saw time. There are 600 minutes available so the saws will be idle 20% of the time.
It will take 24*5 + 48*5 = 360 minutes of lathe time which is exactly what we have.
It will take 24*5 + 48*20 = 1080 minutes of sanding machine time which is exactly what we have.",,2.28,2.64

Armless Aliens,"On planet ?*!@, the inhabitants are robots with various numbers of arms. The robots are grouped into tribes according to the numbers of arms they have so that in any tribe, no member has a different number of arms to the other members.

In the ritual, each arm of a male links with an arm of a female, no male-female pair of robots linking more than once. The minimum number of robots required to link all arms once only is the number belonging to that tribe. Now one night, the Creaky tribe cornered half of the Rusty tribe and despite being outnumbered two to one, unscrewed one arm from each, there being an equal number of male and female victims. However, the Creaky tribe were extremely poor at arithmetic and had failed to realise that they needed 24 times their actual haul of spare arms in order that the number of links their members could then make, each with the same number of extra arms, was half the maximum number of links the Rusty tribe could then make.

A robot with n arms requires n females and vice-versa, and the number of members is 2n with n squared links. Let the Creaky tribe have x arms each and the Rusty tribe have y. Then the maximum number of links that the Rusty tribe can make after the mutilation is y(2y-1)/2. The number of extra arms each Creaky needs is 24y/2x allowing x(x + 24y/2x) links. Forming the links equation we have 2(y squared) - 49y - 4(x squared) = 0. We must have y=4x so that y - 4x is a factor. A long division shows that the condition for zero remainder is x=7 so y=28.

Knight's Tour II,"The knight left Breadland, and went to a neighboring kingdom named Cakeland. Cakeland is much similar to Breadland, but unlike Breadland, Cakeland is 12x4. Cakelanders like cake, as well as Breadlanders like bread.
The knight was on a square of Cakeland, he wanted to visit each square of Cakeland exactly once, and return to the square he was originally on. Each step, the knight moved to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but the queen can't reach.
The knight thought that since Cakeland has an even number of squares, he could achieve his goal this time.
However, the knight still failed.
Do you know why?","Color Cakeland as follows, i.e. each column alternatively abcd and dcba:
a d a d...
b c b c...
c b c b...
d a d a...
Then there are 12 squares of each color. Again we suppose that the lower left corner is black. Then a and c are normal white squares while b and d are normal black squares. Additionally, we notice that each a-square must be preceded and followed by a b-square. This will require more b-squares than a-squares, but there are 12 squares of each color.
Therefore, the knight couldn't achieve his goal.","If you can't figure it out, try coloring Cakeland in another way:

What Does It Mean?,"There was a body pump class that lasted a long time, but it always changed. The instructor was a very smart person and liked to throw puzzles at the students.

The kid was confused and knew the instructor was never going to tell anybody.
Another 5 minutes in, another kid asked how much time was left. The instructor said, ""About five now."" Confused, the kid went back and the class continued.
Ten minutes later, a perplexed pupil in the front asked  how much time was left. The instructor said, ""I think it's about three.""
Suddenly, the pupil clicked into what the puzzle was and how much time there was left of the class and how long the class was.
How much time was left of the class?","90 minutes.
When the first student asked, 15 minutes in, the instructor said ""Seven"". 15 times 7 is 105, the amount of time left in the class.
The second student asked 5 minutes later (20 minutes in) and the instructor said ""Five."" 20 times 5 is 100, the number of minutes left in the class.

£7.11 At The 7-11 store,"Mad Ade entered his local 7-11 store to purchase some provisions. He picked up some ""dead rat and scabby monkey"" flavoured crisps (potato chips for those of you who are American), a large bottle of pickled onion flavoured pop (soda), a left handed toilet roll and a tub of Kebab flavoured ice cream. At the checkout Mad Ade was told that the cost was £7.11.  Mad Ade was curious that the cost was the same as the store name, so he inquired as to how the figure was derived. The acne riddled clerk said that he had simply multiplied the prices of the four individual  items.  Mad Ade complained as this had been done to him in another teaser (Entitled ""Five Pound Seventy Pence"" Teaser #4848), only with three amounts instead of four.  He protested  that  the four  prices should have been ADDED, not MULTIPLIED. The spotty clerk said that that was OK with him, but, the result was still the same: exactly £7.11.

2^1100???,"Your professor prepared a rigorous 150-question final exam to be completed in under 30 minutes, but unfortunately, he seems to have misplaced it, and can only remember one problem. So, he has decided to waive your final exam, if you can answer the one question he can remember from his original exam.
Which is greater, 2^1100 or 3^700? Approximately how many times greater is it (to the nearest 10)?","3^700 is greater, by approximately 710 times (711.0220569 to be exact).
To start, one must realize these numbers are too big to deal with by hand. So, one must use exponents and the ""log"" function on a calculator.
2^1100=10^a
2^x=10^1
log(10)/log(2)=x
3.321928095=x
1100/x=331.1329952
2^3.321928095=10^1
2^(331.132995*3.321928095)=10^(331.132995*1)
2^1100=10^331.132995
Now that we know what 2^1100 equals, apply the same concept to 3^700.
3^700=10^b
3^y=10^1
log(10)/log(3)=y
2.095903274=y
3^2.095903274=10^1
3^(333.9848783*2.095903274)=10^(333.9848783*1)
3^700=10^333.9848783
So, now we have 2^1100 and 3^700 in terms of ""ten to the power of"".
2^1100=10^331.1379952
3^700=10^333.9848783
Obviously, 3^700 is greater. To figure out how much greater, requires a little more work, but not much.
First, subtract the exponents.
333.9848783-331.1379952
This equals 2.851883073
Then, take 10^2.851883073
This equals 711.0220569, which is around 710.
Thus, 3^700 is approximately 710 times greater than 2^1100. Congratulations, you passed your professor's exam.","The numbers are too big to deal with on a normal graphics calculator scale, think of it in terms of powers of ten.",2.27,2.98
Greengrocer's Cucumbers,"On a sunny morning, a greengrocer places 200 kilograms of cucumbers in cases in front of his shop. At that moment, the cucumbers are 99% water. In the afternoon, it turns out that it is the hottest day of the year, and as a result, the cucumbers dry out a little bit. At the end of the day, the greengrocer has not sold a single cucumber, and the cucumbers are only 98% water.
How many kilograms of cucumbers has the greengrocer left at the end of the day?","In the morning, the 200 kilograms of cucumbers are 99% water. So the non-water part of the cucumbers has a mass of 2 kilograms. At the end of the day, the cucumbers are 98% water. The remaining 2% is still the 2 kilograms of non-water material (which does not change when the water evaporates). If 2% equals 2 kilograms, then 100% equals 100 kilograms. So, the greengrocer has 100 kilograms of cucumbers left at the end of the day.",,2.27,2.23

The fourth layer has 10 (1+2+3+4) balls. The fifth layer has 15 (1+2+3+4+5) balls. Similarly, there are 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66 and 78 balls in the remaining layers.

x = number that like math.
2x = number that like rebus.
Add the number that like math to the number that like rebus.
We then must subtract off the number that likes both kinds of teasers and add the number that doesn't like either. The result will be equal to 100.
MATH + REBUS - BOTH + NEITHER = 100 .
x + 2x - 18 + 4 = 100.

One officer and 357 weary Madadian soldiers needed to cross the river before engaging in battle. The only method of crossing the river was a small boat owned by two midgets that lived near the river. Unfortunately, it was a midget sized boat that could either hold two midgets or one full-sized person at any given time.
How many trips would it take to transport every single soldier across the river and still leave the two midgets in joint possession of their boat?","At least 1432 trips required.
The two midgets row to the opposite shore.
One gets out and the other brings the boat back. One soldier rows across; the soldier gets out, and the midget returns with the boat.

Mad Ade's Cousin's Raise,"In the legendary land of Madadia, everything is wonderful. There is no inflation, so Madadian wonks (local currency 100 winks = 1 wonk) are constant in value.
Mad Ade's cousin Manic Martin works as an accountant in one of Madadia's leading accounting firms.

The second option was for an immediate 10% raise to 11,000 wonks annually, with an additional 10% raise every year. Manic Martin's salary, based upon his current annual, was paid bi-weekly.
Which deal would benefit Manic Martin the most?","The 5% semi-annual raise yields a higher return.
This may have been your first guess, but there is something odd about the answer. At the start of the problem, the 10% raise is earning more-  11,000 annually vs. 10,500. After the first year, the 5% option has earned 10,762 compared to 11,000.
What are the two options earning at the moment the contract closes, after 17.5 years? Surprisingly, the 5% option only realizes a little more than 55,160, compared to the 10% option which is still ahead with just under 56,000.
So where's the advantage in the 5% option? It hides in the second half of every year. Even in the first year, the 5% option makes more in the second six months than the 10% option. For the first few years, this is not enough to offset the difference. But cumulatively, over seventeen and a half years, 5% realizes a grand total of 390.27 more than the 10% option. This in spite of the fact that the 10% option starts with a higher salary- and finishes with a higher salary.",,2.26,2.6

Arthur Minit's Clock,"Mad Ade was visiting his friend, computer tycoon and Olympic Kebab hurling champion, Mike Rohsopht.
He was there on Sunday and when the radio gave the time at the hour, Mad Ade noticed that the Madadian antique clock, designed by Madadian clock maker Arthur Minit (teaser #4891) was exactly 3 minutes slow.
""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Mike assured Mad Ade that his treasured Arthur Minit clock had not been adjusted nor fixed since his last visit.
What day of the week was Mad Ade's second visit?","The answer is 17 days and 3 hours later, which would have been a Wednesday.
This is the only other time in the same month when the two would agree at all.
In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.
Since the clock was not adjusted since the last visit, it's also possible that the radio time shifted by one hour due to a change to or from summer daylight saving time.  However, it turns out that the only additional possibilities that need to be considered are those of 4 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 12 hours 57 minutes, and 29 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 3 days 10 hours 57 minutes.  Without even considering the rules for when in the month the
clock is changed, these possible solutions are ruled out because we know that both visits were in the evening (""Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht"") and they involve times in a different part of the day.",,2.26,2.81
Mad Ade's Watch,"Predictably Mad Ade is once again waiting for the ""Sweaty Chef Kebab Shop"" to open (he always arrives early).
In this instance he has arrived over an hour early and as a consequence stands looking at his watch and counting the seconds and minutes until the ""Sweaty Chef"" opens.
He noticed something odd about his watch:
The minute and the hour hand meet every 65 minutes exactly.
How much does the watch lose or gain time and by how much per hour?","The minute and the hour hand should meet 11 times in 12 hours in a normal watch i.e. they meet after every

= 65.45 minutes or 65 minutes and 27.16 seconds

1 = 2,"Bob and Sue were having a discussion one day about 1 and 2. Sue reckoned she had seen a way that you could make 1 = 2 but Bob who wasn't called 'logical Bob' for nothing was obviously adamant that this just wasn't possible. Sue said ""Ok smarty pants here's the equation to prove you wrong""...
Assumptions: There are two numbers, a and b, and they are equal.
Proof:
a = b
Multiply the equation by b
ab = b^2
Subtract a^2 from the equation
ab - a^2 = b^2 - a^2
Factor difference of squares
ab - a^2 = (b - a)(b + a)
Factor a on the left-hand side
a(b - a) = (b - a)(b + a)
Divide by common factor
a = (b + a)
Substitute a for b
a = (a + a)
Simplify
a = 2a
Divide by common factor
1 = 2
Question:
Bob didn't take long and found the line where there is a crucial mistake in the working though was understanding of Sue's issue as it is well hidden... can you see it?","Going from a(b - a) = (b - a)(b + a) to a = (b + a) is not allowed, because the equation is divided by (b - a), which is equal to 0, given that a = b.",Give a and b a value and look at the numbers at each step.,2.26,2.33

2 < 1,"Sue was disappointed after Bob showed her that 2 was not, in fact, equal to 1. She was not quite done, though. She told Bob that while 2 may not be equal to 1, she could show conclusively that 2 was in fact less than 1. Bob said it couldn't be done, of course, and Sue offered the following:
Proof:
1 < 2
Multiply the equation by log (0.5)
1 * log(0.5) < 2 * log(0.5)
Make the log factors exponents
log(0.5 ^ 1) < log(0.5 ^ 2)
Carry out the exponentiation
log(0.5) < log(0.25)
Raise 10 to the power of each side of the inequality
10^(log(0.5)) < 10^(log(0.25))
By definition of logarithms, 10^log(a) = a, so...
0.5 < 0.25
Then just multiply both sides by 4
2 < 1
Question:
Bob found the problem almost immediately. Can you?","When Sue multiplied the inequality by log(0.5), she was multiplying by a negative number, and multiplying an inequality by a negative number switches the direction. This first step should result in:

Assuming she walks at a constant rate of 4 feet per second, makes no stops until she arrives at point A again, and that we do not consider acceleration, how long is her entire trip (rounded to the nearest second)?","57 seconds.
First off, the formula of Speed = Distance / Time can be rewritten as Time = Distance / Speed. (On both sides of the equation we can multiply by Time and divide by Speed.) We will need this equation later.
We know Susan travels 15 feet in one direction and 20 feet in another and does this again on her return trip. Using the Pythagorean Theorem we find that the radius of the circle is 25 feet; therefore, the diameter is 50 feet and the circumference is about 157.1 feet. We can then plug all our values into the equation (units in feet cancel out, leaving seconds):
Time = (15 ft. + 20 ft. + 157.1 ft. + 20 ft. + 15 ft.) / (4 ft. per second) = 57 seconds (rounded to the nearest second).",,2.26,1.82

This uses the same idea as the binary system. All you do is add up the first numbers of the rods that have the number on. It works because the first numbers of each rod are 1,2,4,8 & 16, and using those numbers you can make any numbers from 1 to 31.

Camel and Watermelons,"In city A on desert, there is a guy with his camel and 1000 watermelons. He wants to sell the watermelons in city B where a fair takes place. The distance between A and B is 99km.
However, the camel can only carry a maximum of 100 watermelons at a time. In addition to that, the camel eats one watermelon per each kilometer it travels.
The guy wants to bring to the fair as many watermelons as possible. How can he do it? And what is the maximum number?","If the distance was 1, the obvious maximum would be 981 (as the camel needs to travel 19 times). If the distance was 2, the result is same as if the man had 981 watermelons and to go only 1km, so the result would be 962. When using this method, we can calculate that the final number of watermelons is 140. (Note: The result for distance of 6 is 886 but from this moment the camel needs to travel only 17 times to get all the watermelons 1km further, so the result for distance of 7 is 869)",What if the distance was just 1km?

Given that speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship. So it is obvious that the distance covered by plane will be 10 times the distance covered by the ship for the given time.
i.e. Distance covered by plane = 10 * (Distance covered by ship after plane started)
Now from the given data,
Distance covered by plane = 180 + Distance covered by ship after plane started
10 * (Distance covered by ship after plane started) = 180 + Distance covered by ship after plane started

Santa's Dilemma,"Father Christmas had a problem. He was making up a batch of dolls but could not remember exactly how many of each kind he needed. He knew that he needed 57 in total, that 27 had to have blue eyes, and 29 had to have fair hair. His assistant gnome pointed out that some had to have both features and remembered that 3 dolls were needed having blue eyes and fair hair, but which were not able to say 'Mama'. This prompted the old man to remember that he needed a total of 34 dolls able to say 'Mama', of whom 17 needed to have fair hair. The assistant was going around in circles juggling all this information but couldn't work it out. He pressed for any other bits of information that Father Christmas just might be able to manage, no matter how trivial. The only items he got were: ""Every doll had at least 1 of the features named""; ""That there was one combination of features not asked for at all"" and ""Several children had asked for all 3 features in the one doll"".

Sharing Marbles,"Henry and Gretchen each collected marbles, and they were discussing sharing their collections.  Here is the conversation they had:
Henry:  ""If I shared with Lizzie, we would each get 10 marbles.""
Gretchen:  ""If Lizzie shared with Courtney, who has 10 marbles, they would each end up with half as many marbles as I have.""
Henry:  ""Now I know how many marbles we will each end up with if we share.""
How many marbles will they each have?","15.
Using the variables H, G, L, and C to stand for Henry, Gretchen, Lizzie, and Courtney, we get:
(H + L)/2 = 10, so
H  + L = 20
(L + C)/2 = G/2, so
(L + 10)/2 = G/2, and
L + 10 = G
(H + G)/2 = (H + L + 10)/2 = (H + L)/2 + 5
Since we know (H + L)/2 = 10, we get (H + G)/2 = 15.
You can also plug in numbers to make this work.  If Henry has 10, Lizzie has 10, Courtney has 10, and Gretchen has 20, all of these answers hold.  Even if you change the mix (e.g., H = 5, L = 15, C = 10, G = 25), the answer remains the same.",,2.25,1.91

Crossing a Bridge,"Three people (A, B, and C) need to cross a bridge. A can cross the bridge in 10 minutes, B can cross in 5 minutes, and C can cross in 2 minutes. There is also a bicycle available and any person can cross the bridge in 1 minute with the bicycle. What is the shortest time that all men can get across the bridge? Each man travels at their own constant rate.","A's speed is 1/10 (in bridges per minute), B's speed is 1/5, C's speed is 1/2, and the bicycle's speed is 1.
The fastest way to get everyone across is for B and C to start out on foot and A to start out with the bicycle. At a point y, A will get off the bicycle and walk the rest of the way. Eventually C will get to the bicycle abandoned by A, then ride back to a point x, leaving the bicycle there, then turning around and walk until he reaches the end. Person B will walk until he reaches the bicycle left by C and then ride the rest of the way.
Below are the times that each will take to cross, in terms of x and y:
A: 1*y + 10*(1-y)
B: 5*x + 1*(1-x)
C: 2*y + (y-x) + 2*(1-x)
Next equate these equations: 10 - 9y = -3x + 3y + 2 = 4x + 1.
To solve set up two linear equations:
10 - 9y = -3x + 3y + 2 -> 3x - 12y = -8
10 - 9y = 4x + 1 -> 4x + 9y = 9
Then solve for x and y:
x = 12/25, y=59/75.
Given these points it will take each person 73/25 = 2.92 minutes to cross. Since they all start and end at the same time, the total duration to cross the bridge is also 2.92 minutes.",The bicycle may be left at any point along the bridge and may be ridden in either direction. Every man should finish at the same time.,2.25,2.79

Madadian Farm Animals,"Old Farmer McDoughnut owns a piece of grassland in the heart of Madadia and has three animals: a Madadian Burger Cow, a Spare Kebab Goat, and a Scotch Egg laying Goose. McDoughnut discovered the following:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 45 days.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 90 days also.
For how long can the three animals graze on the field together?","The cow, the goat, and the goose eat grass with a constant speed (amount per day): v1 for the cow, v2 for the goat, v3 for the goose.
The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:
v1 = 3 x h/180,
v2 = 2 x h/180,
v3 = 1 x h/180,
k = 1 x h/180.
Then holds for the time t that the three animals can graze together: h-tx(v1+v2+v3-k) = 0, so t = h/(v1+v2+v3-k) = h/(3xh/180+2xh/180+1xh/180-1xh/180) = 36. The three animals can graze together for 36 days.",,2.24,2.73

Suspended Meter Stick,"A meter stick is suspended exactly at its 45 cm mark from a piece of string, and an 8kg is fixed to the stick and hangs from the 0cm mark. You have six 1kg weights you can hang anywhere on the stick (you can put more than one on the same point if you wish).  How can you get the system to balance?","The turning force of the 8kg is 360
The max force on the other side would be if you put all 6 on the 100cm mark - 6*55 turning force = 330 Which isn't enough to balance, so the only way you can to this is by moving the point of suspension of the metre stick!
If you change the point of suspension to the 40cm mark, the 8kg has a turning force of 320; so you could put 5kg at the 100cm mark giving a turning force of 5*60, and put 1kg at the 60cm mark, giving a turn of 1*20 =320 in total
(There are other ways to do this if you chose a different point of suspension, but this is the key to the puzzle.)",,2.24,2.42
Pyramids By the Block,"In a catalog, you read about a set of blocks. There are 1029 blocks; all are identical in volume. They can be assembled into several tiers which are 1 foot thick and stack to form a pyramid. (The pyramid has a square base; its four sides are equivalent isosceles triangles.) How tall is this pyramid?","It is 7 feet tall.
The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3. Because a second tier will not change any of the angles involved, new triangles will be similar to old and all changes in measurement of length will be proportional. A pyramid 2 tiers tall would have v2 = ( 2*b * 2*b * 2 ) / 3 = 8*v1. For 3 tiers, v3 = ( 3*b * 3*b * 3 ) / 3 = 27*v1. It becomes clear that a cube number must be a factor of the number of blocks.
1029 = 3 * 7^3, so there are 7 tiers. (The peak being formed by 3 separate blocks, every tier has 3 times as many blocks as in the supposition. Because 7 is a prime number, there is no smaller number of tiers which would satisfy the question.)",You might want to start at the top.,2.24,2.92

All of them ate 4 kebabs. So now they have (X - 4) kebabs each.
But it is given that, after they ate 4 kebabs each, total number of kebabs remaining is equal to the kebabs each had after division i.e. X

The Balcony Scene,"You are a scenery creator for plays and you have just been asked to create the Balcony for Romeo and Juliet.
The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The balcony is like so in order for the spot light (that shines at a 45 degree angle to the roof) will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony.
Pine is cheap at exactly $1 per 5000cm^3, tax included.
Exactly how much money will you spend to build the balcony?
Conversions:
100cm = 1m
2.54cm = 1inch","[SEE HINT]
Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:
let a represent the height of the room, then b represent the height of the balcony off the floor, then f represent the thickness of the balcony floor, then r represent a-b or the radius of the balcony floor, then h represent the height of the fence.
V = {[pi(a-b)^2]f + [pi(r)h + pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h]}
= {[pi(90000)30] + [pi(300)100 + pi(299)100 + pi(298)100 ... ... pi(291)100]}
= {(2 700 000pi) + [30 000pi + 29 900pi + 29 800pi + 29 700pi ... ... 29 100pi]}
~= 8482300.16469244 + 928340.629135783

If pine is cheap at exactly $1 per 5000cm^3, tax included,

X Wonks and Y Winks.
The Cashier misheard Mad Ade's request and accidentally gave Mad Ade Y Wonks and X Winks. Neither Mad Ade or the cashier noticed the mistake, so Mad Ade left the bank.
After spending 20 Winks in the ""Sweaty Chef"" Kebab shop, Mad Ade counts his money, and to his surprise, he has double the amount he wanted to withdraw to begin with.
Find X and Y. (1Wonk = 100 Winks)","As given, the person wanted to withdraw 100X + Y Winks.
But he got 100Y + X Winks.
After spending 20 Winks, he has double the amount he wanted to withdraw. Hence, the equation is
2 * (100X + Y) = 100Y + X - 20
200X + 2Y = 100Y +X - 20
199X - 98Y = -20
98Y - 199X = 20
Now, we got one equation; but there are 2 variables. We have to apply little bit of logic over here. We know that if we interchange X & Y, amount gets double. So Y should be twice of X or one more than twice of X i.e. Y = 2X or Y = 2X+1
Case I : Y=2X
Solving two equations simultaneously
98Y - 199X = 20
Y - 2X = 0
We get X = - 20/3 & Y = - 40/2
Case II : Y=2X+1
Solving two equations simultaneously
98Y - 199X = 20
Y - 2X = 1
We get X = 26 & Y = 53

Mountain of Love,"Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Snow, there lived the fair Princess Miyuki, who had always been fascinated by fairy tales and the stories of the wonders of the world.

But of course, what's a story without the brave and wise heroic prince? Here comes Prince Hajikidama of the Marbles Kingdom.

Snapoker Tie-Breakers,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
Assume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.

In this case, the two players who would be required to drink milk through their noses would each have had a hand consisting of a joker and two 8s, 9s, 10s, jacks, queens and kings.

At what distance from the finish line does Shyam catch up with Rakesh?","Shyam catches up with Rakesh at a distance of 25m from the finish line.
Let Rakesh's and Shyam's speeds be 'r' and 's' initially.
Then we have for the first 50m, Rakesh's speed = Twice Shyam's speed i.e., r = 2s.
After the 50m mark, Rakesh's speed = 1/4th his original speed = Half of Shyam's speed
i.e., r = s/2.
Now let Rakesh and Shyam meet at 'X' m from the start line, after a time 't'.
Time taken by Rakesh to cover 'X' m  =  Time taken by Shyam to cover 'X' m
(since they meet after having covered X m.)
Time taken by Rakesh to cover 'X'm  =
(Time taken by Rakesh to cover first 50 m) + (Time taken by Rakesh to cover the remaining 'X-50' m) =
(50/2s) + ((X-50)/(s/2))
(since Rakesh's speed is 2s for first 50m and then onwards s/2)
Time taken by Shyam to cover 'X' m  = (X/s)
(since Shyam ran at the same speed s throughout)
Hence
(50/2s) + ((X-50)/(s/2)) = (X/s)
25/s + ((2X-100)/s) = X/s
(25+2X-100)/s = X/s
Hence X = 25+2X-100 i.e., X = 75m

2, 4, and 6 cannot be in the one's place because that would make the number divisible by 2. 5 cannot also be in the ones place because that would make it divisible by 5. Thus, the sum of the primes is 10(2+4+5+6+2+4+5) + 1+3+7+9+1+3+9 = 313

Boutique Bouquets ...,"The owner of a Romankachi flower boutique follows a particular pattern for his business. During a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%. After a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, the cost of a Red Rose bouquet  decreases by 162 Roka (Roka being the native Romankachi currency). After another year in which there was inflation once more followed by a slowdown, the cost of this bouquet reduces by a further 147.42 Roka. What was the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet ?","The original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.
Let the original price of the Red Rose bouquet  be 'B' Roka.
It is given that during a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%.
Hence after a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 162 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)
(since B(1+Y) is the price during inflation and  B(1-Y)(1+Y) the price during the slowdown)
Therefore the decrease in price after one year
= B - B(1-Y^2)
= B - B + B*Y^2
= B*Y^2 = 162      ... Equation 1
Hence after another year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 147.42 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)(1-Y^2)
= B(1-Y^2)^2
(since B(1-Y^2) is the price at the end of the previous year and           B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y) the price during the slowdown this year)
Therefore the decrease in price this year
= B(1-Y^2) - B(1-Y^2)^2
= B(1-Y^2)[1 - (1-Y^2)]
= B(1-Y^2)( Y^2) = 147.42    ... Equation 2
Dividing Equation 2 by Equation 1, we get
(1-Y^2) = 0.91 => Y^2 = 0.09
Substituting the above value of Y^2 in equation 1, we get
B*0.09 = 162
Hence B = 162/0.09 = 1800 Roka.
Therefore the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.",,2.21,2.74

The four character code consists of 3 digits 0 to 9 and 1 letter of the alphabet A to Z.
Let us assume the first character of the PIN to be an alphabet and the remaining three characters to be digits.
Then the number of possible PINs
= 26*10*10*10
This is the number of PINs with the first character of the PIN being an alphabet.
However we can have the alphabet as the second character, third character or fourth character of the PIN. Thus there are four different combinations.

What is the strength of the reinforcement?","Strength of reinforcement = 1700. Hence total men = 5000.
The key equation is:
(# of men) x (food per man) * (# of days) = (food consumed in the given time)
First figure out the initial amount of food:
3300 men x 850 g/man x 32 days = 89760000 grams
Food used after 7 days:
3300 men x 850 g/man x 7 days = 1963500 grams
Food remaining after 7 days:
89760000 - 1963500 = 70125000 grams
Now you know everything but the number of men present for the last 17 days.  Just use the same equation to figure it out:
(# of men) x 825 g/man x 17 days = 70125000 grams

Easy As Cake,"In our business, my two partners and I cut a lot of cake.
We work exclusively with square cakes. The cakes come in sizes that are meant to be divided into a square number of square pieces. Each portion comes decorated with an ""X"" stretching to its corners, which makes it easy to cut the usual square pieces and also offer half and quarter portions.
These markings also help on Wednesday when we savor the previous week's success by dividing a cake equally amongst ourselves. Even when a good week deserves a 64-portion cake, we can each ceremonially make a single standard cut (straight and perpendicular to the plate), and we each go home with a single piece of cake.
Using no other cuts or devices, how do we evenly divide the 8-by-8 cake? (EXTRA - How could we get 7 (and only 7) equal-size pieces from the same size cake?)","To get three twenty-one-and-one-third (64/3) portion-sized pieces, we momentarily ignore the 28 X's/portions/square-units which form the 32 unit perimeter of the cake.  There is more than one way to divide the 6-by-6 (36 X) cake inside into three equal pieces.  Using one based on its 24 unit perimeter, this cake could be divided into 24 wedges of equal size. Each triangular piece would have as its base one unit of the perimeter; the other two sides would be formed by cuts to the center of the cake. Every triangle would have the same altitude (3 units) giving the same area (A = ½ * b * h = ½ * 1 * 3 = 3/2 square units). 8 adjacent triangles, even though they include a corner or two, will be 12 square units or 1/3 of the ""inner"" cake.
Before we make any actual cuts, we return the ignored 28 portions to the picture and then make those three cuts extended to the true perimeter. The 24 triangles pictured previously increase in altitude to 4 units. By rules of similar triangles, the base increases by the same 1/3 (33 1/3%) to 1 1/3 units. The area of 8 extended triangles is 8 * ½ * 4/3 * 4 = 64/3 portions, which is exactly one-third of the cake.
(The perimeter of a 7-by-7 square can be formed by connecting the centers of the X's in the ""ignored"" 28 portions. Applying the above methods but now grouping 28 triangles into foursomes, we get 7 equal size pieces.)",Think smaller.,2.2,2.86

Allie: I have one fourth of what Jessica has.","John is definitely the liar.  If Sebastian would have more than Jessica, he would have more than $15 more than John. Jessica would have exactly $15 more than John.  Combined that would be more than $30.
Jo + Al + Je = 30
Al = Je/4
Jo = Je - 15
Sebastian is not included in the equation because he has $0.
Combine everything like terms:
Je - 15 + (Je/4) + Je = 30

The ratio of the distance traveled by the two boats when they pass each other for the first time is:  (X - 720) / 720.
The ratio of the total distance traveled by the two boats when they pass each other for the second time is:  (2x - 400) / (X + 400).
Since the boats travel at a constant speed, the ratios are equal.
(X - 720) / 720 = (2X - 400) / (X + 400)

Rare Snapoker Hands 2,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
In a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).

Old Oak Tree,"Homer had always contemplated the size of the old oak tree in the field behind his house.

He knew that the tree was 200 feet from the fence.  Homer was 6 feet tall, making his line of vision, 67 inches from the ground.
Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches
Tree height from eye level = TAN (25.80 deg) * 2460 inches = 1189 inches
Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.

The Flag Pole,"Oh no! Our flag has fallen down from the flag pole (stupid cheap string)! Quick, we need to figure out how much string we need to get it back up there...
The problem is, I don't remember its exact length!
All I can remember is that the pole was built to be exactly 14 times the height of the flag.
The flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system.
The string wraps evenly around the pole 4 times.
The string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag (the returning string is built into the pole).
The pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground.
Oh yes, and the diameter of the pole is 10cm.
So quickly! We don't have much time until everyone sees, how much string do we need?
Conversions:
100cm = 1m
2.54cm = 1 inch","If the pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground and the flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system, then the flag must be 1 meter high. If the string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag and the flag pole is 14 meters in height, then the string must cover 12 meters in total (14-1-1).
If the diameter of the pole is 10cm and the height covered is 12 meters (1200cm), then, unwrapped in to a rectangle, it would be pi(10) (since the circumference of a circle is pi{d}) by 1200 cm rectangle.
If the string wraps around in 4 even rotations, that means the rectangle divided on the y plane into 4 equal sections would represent one rotation per section. Finding the hypotenuse of each section (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) would then yield the distance covered per rotation.
This may be better represented with the following diagram:

The string's distance in one rotation would be expressed by the following equation:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2
Therefore, in 4 rotations it would be the above * 4.
The final equation is thus expressed as:
let a represent the total height of the pole, then f represent the height of the flag, then rot represent the number of rotations, then p represent the height of the pulley, then d represent the diameter of the pole
s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ ({1400-100-100}/4) ^ 2 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ 90 000 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 1206.561796
Therefore, the string covers approximately 1206.561796 cm in 12 meters when there are 4 even rotations.

Similarly, while moving back Dartes moved [50-(50-X)] X metres whereas the platoon moved (50-X) metres.
Now, as the ratios are equal,
(50+X)/X = X/(50-X)
(50+X)*(50-X) = X*X
Solving, X=35.355 metres
Thus, total distance covered by Private Dartes
= (50+X) + X
= 2*X + 50
= 2*(35.355) + 50
= 120.71 metres
Note that at first glance, one might think that the total distance covered by Private Dartes is 100 metres, as he ran the total length of the platoon (50 metres) twice. TRUE, but that's the relative distance covered by the last person i.e. assuming that the platoon is stationary.",,2.19,2.52

They plan to place their model of the Sun at the southwest corner of the ceiling, and they will mark out the relative distances of the planets along a line from the southwest corner to the northeast corner. The classroom measures 42 ft by 66 ft.
In order to make the best use of the ceiling space, the girls decide to place their model of Pluto at the northeast corner. They understand that placing Pluto there automatically determines the scale of their model. But in order to know where to place the other planets, the girls need to know what that scale is.
Assuming Pluto, the farthest planet, is 5.9 * 10^9 km from the Sun, approximately what distance in the real solar system does 1 centimeter on the model now represent?","On the solar system model, 1 cm represents approximately 2.5 * 10^6 km in the real solar system.
Since the room measures 42 ft by 66 ft, the diagonal distance between the southwest and northeast corners, by the Pythagorean Theorem, is the square root of (42^2 + 66^2) sqft = 78 ft (rounded) or 2377 cm.
So, if 2377 cm in the model represents a real distance of 5900 * 10^6 km, then 1 cm represents 5900/2377 * 10^6 km or 2.5 * 10^6 km.","1. Use the Pythagorean Theorem.

The sum of the ten numbers is (783+90)/9=97.  The largest number is found by subtracting the lowest sum of nine numbers (which excluded the largest of the ten numbers) from the sum of all ten numbers.  Thus: 97-82=15.  15 is the largest number of the ten.",,2.19,2.89

Remember That Train Scene In 'Stand By Me'?,"A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.

Can you help Jill recall their ages correctly?","Jack: 40 yrs. old

y yrs.          ?
(Their ages when Jack was the age that Jill is at present)
x yrs.        y yrs.
(Their present ages)
Since we have moved back (x-y) yrs. to make Jack y yrs. old, to find the age of Jill at that time, we go back (x-y) yrs. from her present age. So, her age was y-(x-y) yrs. = 2y-x yrs.

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)

The Matching Hands of Time,"During a normal 12 hour cycle (midnight to noon, or vice versa), how many times will the hour and minute hands line up exactly, and at what times, to the nearest second,  will this happen? (Count midnight and noon as once only, as on a clock, they are the same time.)","There are 11 times during a 12 hour cycle when this happens.
Here is the explanation of what times this happens:
If we let T represent the number of hours that elapse, then we can say that the minute hand moves 360 degrees per hour and the hour hand moves 30 degrees per hour.  Let M be the relative position of the minute hand, and H the relative position of the hour hand, measured in degrees (relative to the 12 o'clock position).
As equations, we will have
H = 30*T, M = 360*T
Now,  we can measure the angle between the two hands as M - H.
M - H = 330*T.
The hands will line up when there is no angular difference between the two.  That is, either the angle is zero, or some exact multiple of 360 degrees.
So, 330*T = 360*K, where K is some whole integer value.
Hence, T = (12/11)*K, where T represents hours after 12:00.
Here, K can be any integer value from 0 to 10.  If K = 0, then the time is 12:00 (the starting time).  For K = 11, T = 12, which again is 12:00.  The other values in between will give exact values of T in hours,  which can be converted to hours, minutes and seconds.  The exact times when the hands line up are:
12:00:00, 1:05:27, 2:10:55, 3:16:22, 4:21:49. 5:27:16, 6:32:44, 7:38:11, 8:43:38, 9:49:05,  and 10:54:33.  The next time after this will again be 12:00:00.","In one hour, the minute hand travels around a full circle of three hundred and sixty degrees, while the hour hand travels only thirty degrees in the same time.
Also keep in mind that the minute (or hour) hand will be in the same relative position after a 360 degree rotation.",2.18,2.36

Elvis's Pants,"Mad Ade decides to buy a nice pair of antique underpants from ""Honest Ron's Second Hand Underpants Emporium"".

After a year, the value of the pants has increased to £70 and he decides to sell the semi famous underwear. But already a few days later he regrets his decision to sell the beautiful undergarments, and he buys it again. Unfortunately he has to pay £80 to get it back, so he loses £10. After another year of owning the Elvis related pants, he finally decides to sell them for £90.
The Question: What is the overall profit that Mad Ade makes?","In the first trade, Mad Ade buys something for £60 and sells it again for £70, so he makes a profit of £10.  In the second trade, Mad Ade buys something for £80 and sells it again for £90, so he makes again a profit of £10.

The Romankachi Clock Problem !!!,"I always remember the days when I was at high school, whiling away my time with my friends. Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.
Considering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?
He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.","Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24
This is for 12 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =
24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.
Now let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.
Here H can take values from 0 to 23.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 0 to 7 i.e., 8 values, for H = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 0 to 5 i.e., 6 values, for H = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 0 to 4 i.e., 5 values, for H = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 10+10+8+6+5 = 39
This is for 24 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =
39 instances in a 24-hour format.",,2.18,2.87

Let N be the number of men in the tournament.
Then the number of games played by men between themselves
= N*(N-1)/2
The number of games played by men with women
= 4*N
(since there were 4 women in the tournament)
It is given that the total number of games that men played between themselves exceeded those played by men with women by 18.
Hence
N*(N-1)/2 - 4*N = 18
N*(N-1) - 8*N = 36
N*N - N - 8*N = 36
N^2 - 9*N - 36 = 0
Factorizing we get,
N^2 - 12*N + 3*N - 36 = 0
N*(N - 12) + 3*(N - 12) = 0
(N - 12)(N + 3) = 0
Hence N = 12 or -3 (not possible).

RomanKachi Locker !!!,"I went to attend the funeral of my uncle, Randervaz the second, of the rich and famous Romankachi dynasty. He'd died the previous day after a long ailment of cancer.

I had to get a legal document with my uncle's signature on it which said that now the will could be read out. However, this was locked away in one of the lockers of the Romankachi state bank. Saying this, he handed me an envelope addressed to me by my uncle. The envelope had a clue in it to lead me to the specified locker.
When I opened the letter, it read as follows :-
""Dearest nephew, you must already be knowing that you have to get a document with my signature on it from the Romankachi state bank in order for the will to be read out. All that I can tell you is that the locker is numbered 'bcb', such that
(ab)*(ba)=(bcb),
where a, b and c are all distinct positive integers from 1 to 9. The number 'ab' represents the two digit number whose 10's digit is a and units digit is b. The numbers 'ba' and 'bcb' also have similar meanings. Best of luck, Ruddy.""
Can you find the locker number and help me out?","The equation given in the letter is
(ab)*(ba)=bcb
Now (10a + b)*(10b + a) = bcb, given that the number 'ab' represents the two digit number whose 10's digit is a and units digit is b and so on for 'ba' and 'bcb'.
Hence 100*a*b + 10*(a^2 + b^2) + a*b = bcb, where ^ represents the operation ""to the power of"".
This is possible if ab = b and a^2 + b^2 = c, that is if a = 1 and hence 1 + b^2 = c.
Trying out various number from 1 to 9 for c in the above equation, I strike upon a combination that satisfies this equation 1 + b^2 = c, i.e. 1 + 2^2 = 5.
Thus a = 1, b = 2 and c = 5.
Therefore the locker number must be 252.

If they stayed for exactly 122 days on the moon, what could be the range of the number of astronauts in the team?","The number of astronauts in the team must be from 6 to 9.
It is given that
1) If the stay on the moon is for 1 to 2 months, the astronaut loses between 1 and 10 kg.
2) If the stay on the moon is for 3 to 5 months, the astronaut loses between 11 and 20 kg.
3) If the stay on the moon is for 6 to 12 months, the astronaut loses between 21 and 30 kg.
The astronauts stayed on the moon for 122 days, i.e. approximately 4 months. The total loss of weight is given to be 105 kg.
It is given that if the astronauts stay on the moon 3 to 5 months, each astronaut loses between 11 and 20 kg.
Assuming that each astronaut lost the minimum possible weight in 4 months i.e., 11 kg, the maximum number of astronauts would be 9 (since 9*11 gives 99 which is less than 105. The maximum number cannot be 10 since even if they had lost the minimum weight, they would have lost 110 kg, which is more than the given 105 kg).
If they had lost the maximum possible weight i.e., 20 kg, then the minimum number of astronauts would be 6 (since 6*20 gives 120 which is greater than 105. The minimum number cannot be 5 since even if they had lost the maximum weight, they would have lost 100 kg which is less than the given 105 kg).

Among other stationery items, pencils, erasers and sharpeners were available at this shop.
Raimo told me that he could make profits in pencils, erasers and sharpeners only by adhering to the following:
1) A pencil, an eraser and a sharpener together to cost  7k (k being Kachin, the local Romankachi currency).
2) The cost of a sharpener would be more than that of 3 erasers.
3) No two items among pencils, erasers and sharpeners would be sold at the same cost.

Also
1) A pencil, an eraser and a sharpener together to cost 7k.
2) The cost of a sharpener would be more than that of 3 erasers.
Now, let the cost of a pencil, an eraser and a sharpener be X, Y and Z respectively.
Then X+Y+Z = 7 from condition 1 above.
Also Z > 3Y from condition 2 above.
Let the cost of each eraser Y=1, the smallest possible integer.
Then Z > 3 (from condition 2).
Let us consider the different values that Z can take:
Let Z=4.
Then X = 7-Y-Z (from equation X+Y+Z = 7).
Then X = 7-1-4 = 2
Hence X = 2, Y = 1 and Z = 4.
Let Z=5.
Then X+Y = 2 (from equation X+Y+Z = 7).
Hence X = Y = 1.
This cannot be possible since it has been mentioned that no two items cost the same.

1/2 way through the trip is 90 X 3/6=45.
So far he has slept for 15 miles.
He falls asleep again when he still has half the distance left that he already has traveled. 90 X 4/6 =60 miles (traveled so far). Half of 60 is 30 miles. So he has 30 miles left to travel and he is asleep during this time. 30 + 15=45 which is half of 90.",,2.15,1.83

If the class average is 4 less than the average of the boys' average marks and the girls' average marks, find the minimum double digit number of students in the class.","The minimum double digit strength of the class is 18.
Let the number of girls in the class be X and the number of boys in the class be Y.
Then the average marks of the girls and boys is Y and X respectively.
Class average
= (Total marks/Total number of students)
= (Total marks scored by girls and boys/Total number of students in the class)
= ((Y*X + X*Y)/(Y+X))
= ((2*X*Y)/(X+Y))
The average of the boys' average and the girls' average
= (X+Y)/2
It is given that the class average is 4 less than the average of the boys' average marks and the girls' average marks.
Hence
(X+Y)/2 - ((2*X*Y)/(X+Y)) = 4
Multiplying the above equation throughout by 2*(X+Y), we get
(X+Y)^2 - 4*X*Y = 8*(X+Y)
X^2 + Y^2 + 2*X*Y - 4*X*Y = 8*(X+Y)
X^2 + Y^2 - 2*X*Y = 8*(X+Y)
(X-Y)^2 = 8*(X+Y)
In order for the Right Hand Side in the above equation to be a perfect square, the value of (X+Y) should be of the type 2k^2 i.e. 2, 8, 18, 32, 50, 72 etc.
It is given that the minimum double digit strength of the class has to be found.
Therefore the minimum double digit strength of the class = X+Y = 18.",,2.15,2.86

The total cost of the Pet Starter Kit after the 5% sales tax is applied is $47.20.
The sum of the cost of the individual items is $47.73, before the tax is applied. Since the Mouse Chow is a food item, the total amount to be taxed is only $41.01. After applying the 5% sales tax and adding the cost of the Mouse Chow, the total cost of the individual items is $49.78.

Deck Building,"Ralph wanted to buy all the lumber for his deck in one trip, and not have to go back to the lumberyard 45 miles away.  He didn't want to buy more than he needed because wood is expensive and he had nowhere to store it.
Ralph's plans for his deck called for standard 2x4 - 8 foot long pine boards with 3/8"" spacing between each board for drainage.  His deck was to be 8 feet deep by 30 feet long.  The last board farthest from the doorwall could be cut lengthwise to fit if necessary, thus giving him a smaller width board at the end where no one is likely to see it.

Population Explosion,"A group of 100 people start a colony on the first day of the year.  Each year, the birth rate is 4% of the population at the beginning of the year, and the death rate is 3% of the population at the beginning of the year.  The resulting births and deaths are truncated to a whole number.  These rates are constant.  For example, consider a population of 99 people at the start of a year.  A 4% birth rate would be 3.96, truncated to 3 births during the year.  A 3% death rate would be 2.97, truncated to 2 deaths during the year.

1) Beginning with the 1st year, the number of births will be 4 (4% of 100 = 4) and the number of deaths will be 3 (3% of 100 = 3), which results in a population increase of 1.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year for 25 years, reaching 125 at the end of the 25th year.
2) Beginning with the 26th year, the number of births per year will increase to 5 (4% of 125 = 5), while the deaths will still be 3.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 135 at the end of the 30th year.
3) Beginning with the 31st year, the number of deaths per year will increase to 4 (3% of 135 = 4.05), while the births will still be 5.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year, reaching 150 at the end of the 45th year.
4) Beginning with the 46th year, the number of births per year will increase to 6 (4% of 150 = 6), while the deaths will still be 4.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 168 at the end of the 54th year.
5) Beginning with the 55th year, the number of deaths per year will increase to 5 (3% of 168 = 5.04), while the births will still be 6.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year, reaching 175 at the end of the 61st year.
6) Beginning with the 62nd year, the number of births per year will increase to 7 (4% of 175 = 7), while the deaths will still be 5.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 201 at the end of the 75th year.
7) Beginning with the 76th year, the number of births per year will increase to 8 (4% of 201 = 8.04) and the number of deaths will increase to 6 (3% of 201 = 6.03).  The population will continue to increase at the rate of 2 per year.  The population will never again increase by only 1 per year.

The from the statement of Rupesh which states that ""Five years ago, the sum of my age and my son's age was a third of five times the average of the present ages of my son and myself."", we can write

Super Skateboards,"Alec, Brett and Chris each purchased parts for their skateboards at the sports store.

The store offers a 10% discount for purchases over $250, so the boys decided to pay for all the parts together to qualify for the discount. Altogether, the boys spent $266.40. The clues below reflect the price of the items before the discount is applied.
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
They each bought the same kinds of wheels. Together they spent $75 for the 3 sets of wheels. Each set contained 4 wheels.

Total before discount $126 $145 $25 $296
less 10% discount $12.60 $14.50 $2.50 $29.60
Amount spent $113.40 $130.50 $22.50 $266.40
Explanation:
First find the original price of all the items combined. $266.40 is the price after the 10% discount was applied.
That means $266.40 is equal to 90% of the original price.
Write an equation and then cross multiply:
266.40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x   =   9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)
Let x = the amount Alec spent on trucks.
x + (x+5) = 75
2x + 5 = 75
2x = 70
x = 35
Alec spent $35 on trucks. Brett spent $5 more than Alec. Therefore, Brett spent $40 on trucks.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51
x + (2x + 3) = 51
3x + 3 = 51
3x = 48
x = 16
Alec's spent $16 on bearings.
Brett spent $35 on bearings",,2.14,2.65
Bouncy Ball,"If you drop a bouncy ball from a distance of 9 feet from the floor, the ball will continue to bounce. Assume that each time it bounces back two thirds of the distance of the previous bounce. How far will the ball travel before it stops?","45 feet.
The distance can be calculated as 9 + (9)*(2/3)*(2) + (9)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(2)+..., with the 2 accounting for the upward and downward travel distance.  Adding 9 to this will result in the formation of an infinite geometric series:  18*(2/3)^0 + 18*(2/3)^1 +...  Factoring out the 18 will result in a series that is equal to (1/(1-(2/3))), which equals 3.

The Troll Bridge 4,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote an equation on a rock:
NOSIER
+ASTRAL
________
725613
""Each letter in the equation represents a different digit, and no letter represents zero,"" said the troll. ""The letters in the password represent 725613.""
So, what is the password?","The password is INLETS.
If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.
If N=5 and A=1, then E=9. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
If N=2 and A=4, then E=6. R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.
If N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.
If N=2, then since R cannot be 5, R=8, L=5, and I=7.
If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.
Since 1+S+T equals 5 or 15, S+T equals 4 or 14. If S+T=14, then S and T must be 5 and 9, or 6 and 8, in some order. But each of our three scenarios has a letter for at least one of 5 and 9, as well as one for 8. So S+T=4, S and T are 1 and 3 in some order, and O+S=12.
If S=1, then O=11. But since each letter represents only one digit, S=3, T=1, and O=9.
If N=5, then A=1. But since T=1, this cannot work.
If N=4, then I=9. But since O=9, this cannot work.
We are left with one possible scenario:
T=1, N=2, S=3, A=4, L=5, E=6, I=7, R=8, and O=9.
Therefore, 725613=INLETS.","1. There are nine different letters in the troll's equation, so nine digits in total are used. Since no letter represent zero, the nine digits used are obvious - just not the letter each one represents.

5 * 7 = 37,"According to basic algebra, (A + B)(A - B) is equal to A^2 - B^2 (A^2 is ""A squared""). Substituting 1 for B, we get A^2 - 1^2.
A^2 - 1^2 is the same as A^2 + (-1^2). Since -1 times -1 is one, we end up with A^2 + 1.
If we substitute 6 for A, we get (6+1)(6-1) = 6^2+1, or 37. Since 6+1 is 7 and 6-1 is 5, five times seven is thirty-seven.

1000!,How many trailing zeros are in the number 1000!?,"The ! stands for factorial.  So, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!
The only way to get a trailing zero is by multiplying a factor of 1000! which is 2 by a factor of 1000! which is 5. The modified problem is thus: How many such pairs of factors are there?
There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5. But in addition there are 40 = 1000/25 numbers which are multiples of 25, each of which gives one factor of five in addition to the one counted in the 200 and the one counted in the 40 above. Finally there is 1 = [1000/625] number which is a multiple of 625, this gives one further factor of 5. Thus there are exactly  200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249 factors of 5 in 1000! and since there are more than sufficient factors of 2, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!",,2.13,2.75

Coin Circle,Place any circular coin down flat on a table.  Can you do a simple calculation to estimate to the nearest whole number of coins the maximum number of coins of the same size that will fit in a concentric circle around the center coin?  Each surrounding coin must touch the center coin and also lie flat on the table,"Six
Since the surrounding coins will touch approximately at their diameters (d) we are looking for how many diameters of this size coin there are at the circumference (C) where the coins touch.  This circumference falls at approximately 2 x the radius (r) of the coins from the center of the circle.  The diameter of this circumference would be approximately 4 x r or 2 d.  The circumference would then be pi (3.14) x 2 d = 6.28 d.  Since each diameter of a coin represents one coin there would be approximately 6.28 coins.  The coins would only touch at their widest part or diameter if they were laid out in a straight line.  Since they are in a circular pattern they actually touch slightly below their widest diameters so the actual diameter of the circumference is slightly less than 2d.  Thus we know that there would be slightly fewer than 6.28 coins and the closest whole number estimate is six.",Use the formula Circumference = pi x diameter.,2.13,1.97

Jack & Jill,"Jack and Jill are climbing down a vertical wall.  They both use ropes hanging from the ceiling of a huge room.  They start at the same time from the top of the wall which is 16 meters tall.  The race is divided into two stages; the first 8 meters and the last 8 meters.  A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.
Who will reach the ground first and how many additional minutes will it take the loser to finish the race?","Jack will win the race and it will take an additional half minute to catch up with him.
Jacks moves 0.8 meters vertically in each step movement:

Replacing A by the diagonally crossed distance, B by the distance between Jack's feet and C by the vertically climbed distance:
1^2 = 0.6^2+C^2
C = 0.8 m
Jill moves 1 meter vertically in each hop.
According to the circle circumference calculation:

Drilling Through A Sphere,"I just drilled straight through the center of a solid sphere, resulting in a 6cm long cylindrical hole. What is the volume remaining in the sphere?
Here are some formulas you may find useful:
Volume of sphere = (4/3)Pi(r^3)
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
Volume of cylinder = Pi(R^2)H
r = radius of sphere
h = height of cap
R = radius of hole (the cap and the cylinder share this radius)
H = height of cylinder (6cm)
The portion of the sphere that was removed can be thought of as a cylinder with a cap at both ends. A cap is flat on one side (touching the cylinder) and spherical on the other side (the original surface of the sphere).","The volume is exactly 36Pi cm^3 (about 113.1 cm^3).
Hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras: R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Thus, R^2=r^2-(H/2)^2 and H=6, so R^2=r^2-9.
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
(replace R^2 and h with values computed above)
= (1/6)Pi(3(r^2-9)+(r-3)^2)(r-3)
= (1/6)Pi(3r^2-27+r^2-6r+9)(r-3)
= (1/6)Pi(4r^2-6r-18)(r-3)
= (1/6)Pi(4r^3-6r^2-18r-12r^2+18r+54)
= (1/6)Pi(4r^3-18r^2+54)
= (2/3)Pi(r^3)-3Pi(r^2)+9Pi
Volume of cylinder = Pi(R^2)H
(replace R^2 with value computed above, and H with given value of 6)
= Pi(r^2-9)6
= 6Pi(r^2)-54Pi
Volume of sphere remaining = sphere - 2 caps - cylinder
= [ (4/3)Pi(r^3) ] - [ 2 ((2/3)Pi(r^3)-3Pi(r^2)+9Pi) ] - [ 6Pi(r^2)-54Pi ]
= [ (4/3)Pi(r^3) ] - [ (4/3)Pi(r^3)-6Pi(r^2)+18Pi ] - [ 6Pi(r^2) - 54Pi ]
= (4/3)Pi(r^3) - (4/3)Pi(r^3) + 6Pi(r^2) - 18Pi - 6Pi(r^2) + 54Pi
= 36Pi
Easy solution:
Assume the hole is infinitely small (i.e. a radius of 0). Then, the volume of the cylinder (and the volume of the caps) is 0. The height of the cap is 0, so the radius of the sphere (r) is 3cm (half of the length of the cylindrical hole). Thus:
Volume of sphere remaining = sphere - 2 caps - cylinder
= (4/3)Pi(r^3) - 0 - 0
= (4/3)Pi(3^3)
= 36Pi"," for a hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras, R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Hint for an easy solution:
Assume there is a real answer. Therefore, the answer does not depend on the radius of the hole (R). Use whatever value is easiest.",2.11,2.96

Disappearing Numbers,"For every number that exists between 0 and 1 (say for example 2/3) there exists exactly one other number called its reciprocal (in this case 3/2) that is bigger than 1.
Also, for every number that exists between 0 and 1 (say 0.5) there is exactly one number that exists, found by adding 1 (1.5) that must lie between 1 and 2.
Since every number between 0 and 1 corresponds to exactly one number between 1 and 2 and at the same time corresponds to a number bigger than 1 then there must be the same number of numbers that lie between 1 and 2 as there are bigger than 1.
That means that all of the numbers bigger than 1 lie between 1 and 2 so there aren't any numbers bigger than 2.
This is clearly false, so where is the error?",The problem lies in how many numbers there are. There are an infinite number of numbers between 0 and 1 and hence an infinite number of numbers between 1 and 2 and also greater than 2. Surprisingly there can be different sized infinities so you cannot say that two infinite quantities are equal. (Take 1 away from infinite and you still have infinite).,Reversing the reasoning will give you the same correspondence.

If one dart hits triple 20 and another hits the center bull's eye, that achieves 110 points, leaving the need for an additional 53 points.  53 is prime, so can not be reached by any hit.
If two darts both hit the center bull's eye for 100 points, that still leaves a need for 63 points.  63 is not prime, but can not be reached, since it would require a triple 21 (there is no 21 on a dart board).",,2.11,2.46

Food Fight Fiasco #1,"You are in a food fight. An enemy is holding a hot sauce and will spray you with the fiery substance unless you answer the following question correctly:
A right cylinder, with a diameter congruent to its height is inscribed in a right cone with height 12 units and radius 5 units. If their axes coincide, find the radius of the cylinder.","30/11. As mentioned in the hint, there are many methods in which to solve this. One less complex method is to imagine the axis of the cone form a right triangle. This triangle shares the dimensions of the cone, so it is 12 by 5. We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.
Next we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x. If we add 10x on both sides, we get 22x=60, and dividing 22 from both sides yields x=60/22=30/11."," #1: By inscribed, your enemy means that the cylinder's whole bottom face is touching the cone's bottom face, and the cylinder is touching the cone with the circumference of the top face.

Fraction of pole covered by water = 1/3
Fraction of pole in the ground and covered by water = 1/2 + 1/3 = (3 + 2)/6 = 5/6
Fraction of pole out of water = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6
Thus, one-sixth of the pole (out of water) is 9 ft.
So, total length of pole = 54 ft.
It may be noted that:
Length of pole in the ground = 54/2 = 27 ft.
Length of pole covered by water = 54/3 = 18 ft.
Length of pole out of water = 9 ft.
The problem may also be solved by setting up the following equation: x/2 + x/3 + 9 = x
where x denotes the total length of the pole in ft.

Be Quiet Children!,"One day, a frustrated math teacher lost his patience with his students' non-stop chatting. Thus, he decided to give the ultimate hard problem:
Find the only positive integer number less than 20,000 that is also a sum of three positive integers, all containing exactly 7 factors.
There was a steady silence. Can you break the silence by figuring it out?","16,418.
First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage. The only way to get 7 as the number of factors is 1 x 7. So the prime factorization of any number with 7 factors is n^6 times x^0, where n and x are both primes. But if you look, x^0, for all nonzero values of x, is 1! So, any number with exactly 7 factors must be a prime raised to the sixth power. This yields 2^6 +3^6+5^6 = 16418. Any prime 7 or greater to the sixth power is greater than 20,000.","For the prime factorization of positive integer x, we get
x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:
[K(sub 1) + 1][K(sub 2) + 1]...
For example, the prime factorization of 228 is (2^2)(3^1)(19^1). 228 has 12 factors, since (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12.",2.1,2.94
Mathematicians,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?","The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Here, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is 52.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""

The Agent gets $ 11400 as commission (i.e., 0.057 x 200000).
Ann gets (including profit) $ 188600, i.e., 200000 - 11400.
It may be noted that: (188600 - 166902) / 166902 x 100 = 13%.
Importantly, profit is calculated on purchase cost (by Ann) and commission is calculated on selling price (by the Agent).
The problem may also be solved by setting up the following equation:
Purchase Cost + Ann's Profit + Agent's Commission = Selling Price
166902 + (13/100) 166902 + (5.7/100) S = S
where S is the Selling Price in $.

Square Flag,"A square flag has a blue field with two white diagonal bars that form a cross.  Each bar extends across the entire diagonal, from corner to corner.  The cross occupies half of the flag's area.  The flag measures 60 inches on each side.  To the nearest 0.01, what is the width of the bars?","12.43 inches
a) The square flag measures 60 inches on a side, so its area is 60*60 = 3600.
b) The white cross occupies half of the area, or 3600/2 = 1800.
c) Since the flag is square, the cross divides the flag's blue field into four equal-sized isosceles right triangles.  Each of those triangles has an area of 1800/4 = 450.
d) The area (A) of an isosceles right triangle is calculated by the formula 0.5(X^2) = A, where X is the length of one of the two perpendicular legs.  0.5(X^2) = 450, or X^2 = 900, or X = 30.  These perpendicular legs form the border between the field and the cross.
e) The hypotenuse (H) of an isosceles right triangle is calculated by the formula H = (2(X^2))^(1/2), where X is the length of one of the two perpendicular legs. H = (2(30^2))^(1/2) = (2(900)^(1/2) = 1800^(1/2) = 42.43.
f) The hypotenuse of each triangle lies along the perimeter in the center of each side of the flag.  The remaining length of each side is split equally between the two bars, leaving (60-42.43)/2 , or 8.79, for each bar.
g) Where the bars extend into the corners of the flag, isosceles right triangles with legs of 8.79 are formed.  Again, use the formula H = (2(X^2))^(1/2).  H = (2(8.79^2))^(1/2) = (2(77.26))^(1/2) = 154.52^(1/2) = 12.43 = H.  The hypotenuse of 12.43 is the width of the bars.",,2.06,2.35

The diamond is simply a square tilted 45 degrees. The area of the diamond is c^2. There are also 4 triangles with area 1/2ab. Set them equal:
(a+b)^2=c^2 + 4(1/2ab) Expand...
a^2 + 2ab + b^2= c^2 + 2ab
Subtract `2ab` from both sides and you are left with the Pythagorean Theorem.

The above errors (particularly on Teaser M) would be hard to account for if the site were recomputing the ratings every time from p and v.  We know that the site keeps track of v for each category, in order to qualify entries for the various lists.  But the site may recalculate p every time from the previous (rounded) ranking, which could cause errors that could accumulate or cancel, depending on how unlucky/lucky you were about what order people voted in.  This could account for the errors in the above data.  If this is the problem, the best fix would be to keep a separate count of p for each ranking.  A temporary fix would be to at least round p off to the nearest integer when deriving it from the previous ranking, which works up to around 200 votes or so.",,2.02,2.94

Construction Dilemma,"Mr. Math, or Sane, was hired by Nortel to design the dimensions for their building. He decided to make the building an open cylindrical area inscribed in a perfect cube.
But a tragic incident caused Sane to become sick and not be able to communicate! The only dimension that he had written down was for the corner office, 16 by 8 meters (which extends to the edge of the open area).
The construction workers can not start over now, as they've already begun building. But if they want to finish the Nortel building in time, they will need to know the final dimension of the perfect cube and cylinder! Can anyone here help them?
Alternate: If the construction workers became ambitious and decided to make all the offices out of solid wood, approximately how much would it cost them at $10 per m^3?","Formulate an equation where the hypotenuse of the two squared unknown distances will equal the radius of the building.
(Since our answer only needs two dimensions, we will convert them into square (building), circle (open area), and rectangle (corner office).
[The Pythagorean theorem will solve for the root of the radius]
Let a represent the length of the rectangle, then x-a be the radius of the circle minus the length of the rectangle, same to b (to width of the rectangle):
a^2 + b^2 = x^2
(x - a)^2 + (x - b)^2 = x^2
x^2 = (x - 16)(x - 16) + (x - 8)(x - 8)
[Use foil to expand the brackets]
x^2 = (x^2 - 16x - 16x + 256) + (x^2 - 8x - 8x + 64)
x^2 = 2x^2 - 48x + 320
[Order as a quadratic equation]
x^2 - 48x + 320 = 0
[Factor the equation using the quadratic formula with X excluded]
Let a equal 1, b equal 48, and c equal 320 as temporary variables in the factoring equation:
x = -b{+/-}[b^2 - 4ac]^1/2 / 2a
x = -48{+/-}[2304 - 1280]^1/2 / 2
x = -48{+/-}32 / 2
x = -40    and     x = -8
[Input those numbers into the now factored equation]
(x - 40)(x - 8) = 0
If the radius were 8, then that would mean the corner office would end up extending into the circular area (because the corner office is 16 x 8).
Therefore, the diameter of the cylinder or the dimensions of the building must be 40 * 2 (radius x 2) to make 80m x 80m.
Alternate: The volume of the building is expressed by:
v = l * w * h
But remember, since the cylinder is open space, we need to figure it too.
The volume of the cylinder is expressed by:
v = pi(r^2) * h
Therefore, the volume of solid wood is the volume of the building less the empty area:
v = [l * w * h] - [pi(r^2) * h]
v = [80 * 80 * 80] - [pi(40^2) * 80]
v ~= 512 000 - 402124
v ~= 109 876 m^3
If wood is $10 per m^3:

Bus Numbers,"You are on a bus with just two other mathematicians when you overhear them talking.

The other person replies, ""How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?""
""No, you could not.""
""Aha! At last, I know how old you are!""
Apparently the second mathematician had been trying to determine the first mathematician's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
The bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.","The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't — he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10. After enough trial and error, the perfect balance between the two is reached with the number 12.","There are multiple possible age combinations for the mathematician's children that would result in the same age as well as the same bus number otherwise the second mathematician can determine the ages of the children given the first mathematician's age and number of children.
Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.",1.88,2.88

Twelve items are to be divided into groups of three or four items.  The items in the group will be listed, e.g. 1, blue, bench, A. You will guess a target arrangement, e.g. bench, A, 1, blue. You will score one point for each match, e.g. If the target established beforehand is ""bench, A, blue, 1,"" your guess would score two points.

The described test would use our school's computer network, so it will be possible to tell when exactly 250 tests have been completed.  Of the first 250 pupils completing these tests, how many will have scored exactly eleven points?","Probability makes four groups of three the higher scorer.
There are 6 ways to arrange 3 items.
Only 1 guess in 6 scores all 3 points contributing 1/2 point to the average.
3 guesses in 6 score 1 point contributing 1/2 point to the average.
The remaining 2 of the 6 guesses contribute nothing to the average.
Each grouping averages 1 point, so 4 groupings will net on average 4 points.
There are 24 ways to arrange 4 items.
Only 1 guess in 24 scores all 4 points contributing 1/6 point to the average.
6 guesses in 24 score 2 points contributing 1/2 point to the average.
8 guesses in 24 score 1 point contributing 1/3 point to the average.
The remaining 9 of the 24 guesses contribute nothing to the average.
Again each grouping averages 1 point, so 3 groupings will on average net only 3 points.
Regardless of which test or mix of tests is taken, the answer is zero.  There is no way to get exactly 11 correct, because there is no way to get just 1 wrong.",Declaring what has been implied: blanks and repetition are prevented by use of the school's computer system.,1.82,2.36
Ordered Triple,"Find the number of ordered triples (A, B, C) where A, B and C are positive integers, A is a factor of B, A is a factor of C, and A+B+C=30.","If A=1, then the possibilities are B=1, C=28; ..., B=28, C=1, 28 possibilities;
If A=2, then the possibilities are B=2, C=26; ..., B=26, C=2, 13 possibilities, 41 accumulated;
If A=3, then the possibilities are B=3, C=24; ..., B=24, C=3, 8 possibilities, 49 accumulated;
If A=5, then the possibilities are B=5, C=20; ..., B=20, C=5, 4 possibilities, 53 accumulated;
If A=6, then the possibilities are B=6, C=18; ..., B=18, C=6, 3 possibilities, 56 accumulated;
If A=10, then the only possibility is B=10, C=10, 57 possibilities accumulated.","If A is a factor of both B and C, A must be a factor of the three numbers' sum 30.",1.8,2.63
Symbolism III,"I give you some numbers in a specific order, and a few symbols. Arrange those symbols however you can to make a correct math equation. You must use all of them.
For example...

Answer:
7+534-521=20
Also, do not follow the order of operations, perform in the order of the numbers (ie: 3+3*3 normally equals 12, but not following the order of operations, equals 18.)
Now, here's your puzzle.

Circles in a triangle,Find the radius of the inscribed and circumscribed circles for a triangle.,"Let a, b, and c be the sides of the triangle. Let s be the semiperimeter, i.e. s = (a + b + c) / 2. Let A be the area of the triangle, and let x be the radius of the incircle.
Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.
We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).
The radius of the circumscribed circle is given by R = abc/4A.",,1.68,3.17
