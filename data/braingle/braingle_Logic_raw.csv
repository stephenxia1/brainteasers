3. Of Brenda and Charlotte:
a. One has blue eyes and the other does not.
b. One is 5'11"" and the other is not.
4. Of the three characteristics; blue eyes, red hair and 5'11"":
a. If any of the three women has exactly two of the three characteristics, Mr. Froopaloop will marry the one with the least number of characteristics.
b. If any of the three women has exactly one of the three characteristics, Mr. Froopaloop will marry the one with the greatest number of characteristics.
Who will Mr. Froopaloop marry?","Mr. Froopaloop will marry Charlotte.
Facts 1a and 3a tell us that Charlotte is either the only one with blue eyes or the only one without blue eyes. Facts 1b and 2a tell us that Brenda is either the only one with red hair or the only one without red hair. Facts 2b and 3b tell us that Charlotte is either the only one who is 5'11"" or the only one who isn't 5'11"". Fact 4 tells us that no one woman can have one characteristic while another has two characteristics. This gives us two scenarios:
1. Audrey has blue eyes, does not have red hair, and is 5'11"". Brenda has blue eyes, red hair, and is 5'11"". Charlotte does not have blue eyes, does not have red hair, and is not 5'11"".
2. Audrey does not have blue eyes, has red hair, and is not 5'11"". Brenda does not have blue eyes, does not have red hair, and is not 5'11"". Charlotte has blue eyes, red hair, and is 5'11"".
Fact 4a tells us that in scenario 1, Mr. Froopaloop will marry Charlotte. Fact 4b tells us that in scenario 2, Mr. Froopaloop will marry...Charlotte.",,3.39,2.36
Birth Months,"Four sisters, Sara, Ophelia, Nora, and Dawn, were each born in a different one of the months September, October, November, and December.
""This is terrible,"" said Ophelia one day. ""None of us have an initial that matches the initial of her birth month.""
""I don't mind at all,"" replied the girl who was born in September.
""That's easy for you to say,"" said Nora. ""It would at least be cool if the initial of my birth month was a vowel, but no.""
In which month was each girl born?","Sara was born in October, Ophelia was born in November, Nora was born in December, and Dawn was born in September.
Nora's birth month obviously cannot be November. Since it doesn't start with a vowel, it cannot be October. Since she was talking to the girl who was born in September, it cannot be September. Therefore, it must be December.
The girl born in September obviously cannot be Sara. Since she was talking to both Ophelia and Nora, it cannot be either of them. Therefore, it must be Dawn.
This leaves the girls Sara and Ophelia and the months October and November. Ophelia cannot be born in October, so she must be born in November, and Sara was born in October.",,3.26,1.52
Birbal the Wise - VIII,"Emperor Akbar once ruled over India. He was a wise and intelligent ruler, and he had in his court the Nine Gems, his nine advisors, who were each known for a particular skill. One of these Gems was Birbal, known for his wit and wisdom. The story below is one of the examples of his wit. Do you have it in you to find out the answer?
Emperor Akbar was very fond of Birbal as were many of the village people. However, this made quite a few of Akbar's other ministers jealous.
One day, they decided to come up with a plan to rid them of the ""great"" Birbal. To avoid suspicion from falling on them, they took the help of the emperor's barber in this plan.
A week later, while Akbar was receiving a haircut, the barber lightly mentioned that he knew of someone who could allow Akbar to reach and even converse with his ancestors who had passed away, but he also stated the man who would go to the heavens would have to be witty, intelligent and wise. Akbar instantly recommended Birbal for the task.
Birbal was told that a fire would be lit around him and the smoke would carry him to heaven; however, chanting would protect him from burning to his death. Birbal instantly knew that this was a plan to get rid of him, but not wishing to anger the emperor, he agreed to perform this task in a month. During this period of time, he asked some laborers to build a tunnel connecting his house to the cemetery, where the ""rites"" would be held.
When the day came, Birbal escaped his death by going to his house where he stayed for a month growing out his beard. A month later, he went back to Akbar's palace. When asked about the health of Akbar's ancestors, Birbal replied that they were doing very well but were missing just one thing.
What did Birbal say they were missing in heaven?","Birbal stated that there weren't any barbers in heaven and said that was the reason for his long beard. Since Akbar now knew a way to reach them, he asked for his barber to be sent. Realizing that he would die in the fire, the emperor's barber confessed what he and the ministers did and no one dared to conspire against Birbal again.",,3.18,1.98
The Flawed Game,"A teacher was having trouble getting her students to learn their facts, but she noticed that her students often played the game ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"". She made a game with similar rules in order to encourage the students to learn their facts.
The class would be divided into three teams: Rock, Paper and Scissors. The teacher would ask the students a question and the class would raise their hands if they knew the answer. If the first person to answer the question correctly is in the Rock team, he or she would choose one player from the Scissors team to be eliminated. Similarly, if a player from the Scissors team was first to answer the question, then he or she would eliminate a member from the Paper team. Lastly, if a player from the Paper team was first to answer correctly, he or she would eliminate a member from the Rock team.
The teacher would then continue asking questions until only one team still has members. That team would be declared the winner and all its members would win a small chocolate.
However, as soon as she explained the rules to the class, one particularly smart student immediately found a large flaw that made the game unplayable. Can you do the same?","After one team loses all its members, the team that it eliminates members from will always win. For example, say the Scissors team is the first team to lose all its members. It is now impossible for the Paper team to lose any members, but the Paper team can still eliminate members from Rock team, so it will eventually win (if the Rock team answers questions, there would be no one left for them to eliminate so nothing would happen). This means that the best strategy is actually to avoid answering questions until one team is eliminated. If all the players know this, the game would never end.",Think about what would happen after one team loses all its members.,3.17,1.35
"Brown Eyes, Blue Eyes","On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?","All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people. If we follow this pattern, we will eventually reach the answer of 100 people leaving the island after 100 days.",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?,3.16,2.91
A Man and Two Doors,A man is trapped in a room. The room has only two possible exits: two doors. Through the first door there is a room constructed from magnifying glass. The blazing hot sun instantly fries anything or anyone that enters. Through the second door there is a fire-breathing dragon. How does the man escape?,He waits until night time and then goes through the first door.,,3.14,1.39
The King and the Poison,"In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.
The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.
What exactly happened there?","The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison. As his own poison he would bring water, which will have no effect on him, but the pharmacist who would drink the water, and then his poison would surely die. When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before. The pharmacist would drink only water, so nothing will happen to him. And because both of them brought the king water, he didn't get a strong poison like he wanted.",,3.13,2.81
The Opposite Gender,"Sam, Alex, Charlie, and Jordan are related. One of them is the opposite gender from the other three. Here are some facts:
1. Charlie's only son is either Sam or Alex.
2. Jordan's sister is either Alex or Charlie.
3. Jordan is either Sam's brother or Sam's only daughter.
Who is the opposite gender from the other three?","Charlie is the opposite gender.
If Jordan is Sam's only daughter, then Jordan cannot have a sister. Therefore, Jordan must be Sam's brother and a male.
If Jordan's sister is Alex, then fact 1 tells us that Sam is Charlie's only son. But since Jordan is Sam's brother, Sam cannot be Charlie's only son. Therefore, Charlie must be Jordan's sister.
Since Sam is Jordan and Charlie's sibling, Alex must be Charlie's son. Now we know that Alex and Jordan are male, while Charlie is female.",,3.12,2.24
Who Robbed the Bank?,"The angry chief of police did roar,
""Who robbed the bank out of you four?""
When Al was asked, he said right then,
""The thief was Ben! The thief was Ben!""
Ben said to the policin' man,
""The thief was Dan! The thief was Dan!""
When Carl was questioned, he exclaimed,
""I'm not the one who should be blamed!""
When Dan was questioned, he replied,
""When Ben said it was me, he lied!""
If three of four suspects speak true,
And one speaks false, then who oh who?
And what if only one was frank?
But most of all, who robbed the bank?","If only one is lying, Ben robbed the bank.
If only one is telling the truth, Carl robbed the bank.
Since Dan's statement was that Ben was lying, exactly one of these two must be telling the truth and the other must be lying. If Ben is telling the truth and Dan is lying, Dan must be the thief, which means that Al is lying and Carl is telling the truth. But now we have two truthtellers and two liars. So this cannot be right.
Therefore, if there is only one liar, it must be Ben. Al can only be telling the truth if Ben was the robber. If there is only one truthteller, it must be Dan. Carl can only be lying if Carl was the robber.",,3.12,1.47
Cats Have 9 Squares,"9 cats Andar, Balak, Collo, Erec, Indan, Kyft, Meva, Qupuwu, & Yitsim are positioned in a 3 by 3 grid; you know 3 things about them:
1. Balak, the leader, always sits in the top left.
2. Erec, the kitten, never sits in the top row.
3. None of the adjacent cats (even diagonal) share a single letter.
Where are they positioned?","Balak; Yitsim; Andar
Erec; Qupuwu; Collo
Indan; Kyft; Meva
Steps:
1. Qupuwu is the only one to share no letters, therefore they must be in the middle.
2. The only 2 to not share a letter with Balak are Yitsim & Erec; Erec cannot be in the top row, so Erec is below Balak & Yitsim is beside.
Balak; Yitsim; ????
Erec; Qupuwu; ????
????; ????; ????
3. Since there are 4 ""A"" names, they must go in the corners. The remaining ""A"" names are Andar, Indan, & Meva. For the corner next to Yitsim only Andar can go there because of Indan's ""I"" and Meva's ""M"".
4. The remaining name to not share a letter with Yitsim is Collo, so they go below Andar.
Balak; Yitsim; Andar
Erec; Qupuwu; Collo
????; ????; ????
5. Kyft must go in the center of the last row because of the previously mentioned 4 ""A""s.
6. Meva & Erec can not be next to each other so Indan is below Erec & Meva is below Collo.
Balak; Yitsim; Andar
Erec; Qupuwu; Collo
Indan; Kyft; Meva",Meva is in a corner.,3.11,1.92
The Non-Boxer,"There are three brothers: Al, Ben, and Carl. Two of the three brothers are boxers. Here are some facts:
1. The shorter of Al and Ben is the older boxer.
2. The younger of Ben and Carl is the shorter boxer.
3. The taller of Al and Carl is the younger boxer.
Which brother is not a boxer?","Carl is not a boxer.
From fact 1, we know that Carl is not the older boxer.
From fact 3, we know that Ben is not the younger boxer.
We now have three possible scenarios:
1. Al is the younger boxer and Ben is the older boxer.
2. Ben is the older boxer and Carl is the younger boxer.
3. Al is the older boxer and Carl is the younger boxer.
If scenario 1 is true, fact 1 tells us that Ben is shorter than Al.
If scenario 2 is true, fact 1 tells us that Ben is shorter than Al; fact 3 tells us that Carl is taller than Al, making Ben shorter than Carl.
If scenario 3 is true, fact 3 tells us that Carl is taller than Al.
We can now expand our three scenarios:
1. Al is the younger, taller boxer, and Ben is the older, shorter boxer.
2. Ben is the older, shorter boxer, and Carl is the younger, taller boxer.
3. Al is the older, shorter boxer, and Carl is the younger, taller boxer.
Scenario 2 cannot be possible because it contradicts fact 2 by making the younger of Ben and Carl the taller boxer.
Fact 2 also tells us that Al is not the shorter boxer, so scenario 3 cannot be possible, either.
Therefore, scenario 1 is true, which means that Carl is not a boxer.",,3.1,2.38

Inspector Beethoven III,"Handel has been killed and Beethoven is on the case.  He has interviewed the four suspects and their statements are shown below.  Each suspect has said two sentences.  One sentence of each suspect is a lie and one sentence is the truth.  Help Beethoven figure out who the killer is.
Joplin:  I did not kill Handel.  Either Grieg is the killer or none of us is.
Grieg:  I did not kill Handel.  Gershwin is the killer.
Strauss:  I did not kill Handel.  Grieg is lying when he says Gershwin is the killer.
Gershwin:  I did not kill Handel.  If Joplin did not kill him, then Grieg did.","Strauss is the one who killed Handel.
You need to take turns assuming someone is the killer; that means everyone's second sentence is a lie. If Joplin was the killer, Grieg's lie mixed with Strauss' counteracts the other. If Grieg was the killer, Gershwin would need to be a killer too. If Gershwin was the killer, Grieg and Strauss counter each other again, but with Strauss, everything would fit.",,3.09,2.04
Einstein's Riddle,"Einstein's Riddle:

Survival of the Sheep,"There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:
1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.
2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).
3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.
4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.
Now, here's the kicker:
5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).
6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).
Assumptions:
1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.
2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.
3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.
So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?","The sheep would remain untouched.
In fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.
Here's the reasoning:
Consider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.
Now look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.
So now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.
We can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.
You can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.","There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.",3.07,2.55

Angie June

Step 1: Oliver Angie
According to clue 1, we know there is either an Angie Oliver or an Oliver Angie; however from clue 4, we know there can't be an Angie Oliver, therefore we know that Oliver's last name is Angie.
Step 2: Colt Oliver
The first name that has Oliver as a last name can be solved with the process of elimination. It can't be June or Angie as per clue 4. It can't be Oliver as we already labeled his last name. It can't be Carla as ""Carla Oliver"" has 5 syllables, and it can't be Eric since he doesn't share any names with Oliver.
Step 3: Carla Carla
In clue 2 we know there is one of the following:
Colt Colt
Colt Carla
Carla Colt
Carla Carla
Since we already know Colt Oliver, we know Carla is the one with the last initial ""C."" ""Carla Colt"" only has 3 syllables, so therefore, we get Carla Carla.
Step 4: June Eric
For June's last name, there are 3 options: Colt, June & Eric. Clues 7 and 5 eliminate June & Colt respectively.
Step 5: Final 2
Angie's last name can't be Colt as per clue 8, so that leaves Angie June & Eric Colt.",,3.06,2.13

The dragon population later became a threat to the kingdom. The King, who married Victor's sister and made her his queen, announced a contest. The warrior who could kill the most number of dragons from sunrise to sunset of next Sunday would be declared winner and marry the King's only daughter.
On the eve of the contest, Gringo the Gorgeous, first born of and heir to the King, slept early to conserve his energy with his sharpened ax beside him.
Victor the Viking, who almost forgot his ax and shield, rode his black gelding into the forbidden forest and camped there overnight to gain a headstart.
Abner the Able spent the night in his house sharpening his spatha and polishing his bronze shield. he had his squire prepare his stallion for the contest.
Brav the Bold woke up very late the morning of the contest and had to ride his horse like crazy to catch up with the others.
Igor the Terrible, the only warrior who used two weapons was able to kill 4 dragons with his ax and 5 dragons with his spear.
At the wedding dinner hosted by the king later that evening, the winner, who killed more than a half dozen dragons with his ax, and his proud parents were honored by the King.
The winner's horse was castrated and retired from duty. The winner's bronze shield was permanently displayed in the King's Hall.
Who won the contest?","Brav the Bold won the contest. (by process of elimination)
Gringo the Gorgeous, first born of the king, could not be the winner because the winner was not the king's son. The winner and his parents were honored by the King.
Abner the Able, whose only weapon was a spatha( a sword) could not be the winner because the winner used an ax to kill dragons. Only Igor used two weapons.
Igor the Terrible, who killed only 4 dragons with his ax (and 5 dragons with his spear), could not be the winner because the winner killed more than a half dozen dragons with his ax.
Victor the Viking, whose horse was a gelding(castrated horse), could not be the winner because the winner's horse was castrated after the contest.
Brav the Bold must have killed at least 10 dragons because Igor killed a total of 9.  More than a half dozen means a number greater than 6, including 10.",,3.05,1.81
Survival of the People,"The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.","Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words ""white"" and ""black"": The answer ""black"" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer ""white"" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.
Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.",3.05,3.01

Seven Jack O'Lanterns,"It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.
You quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...","If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.
What else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!  So doing this, the Great Pumpkin has decided to give you a treat for figuring this out and you find all seven lanterns full of candy the next morning!  Congratulations!",,3.03,2.45

Blue Pill Problem,"You've been placed on a course of expensive medication in which you are to take one tablet of Sildenafil and one tablet of Citrate daily. You must be careful that you take just one of each because taking more of either can have serious side effects.
Taking Sildenafil without taking Citrate, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the Sildenafil pills and one of the Citrate pills at one time. Therefore, you open up the Sildenafil bottle, and you tap one Sildenafil pill into your hand. You put that bottle aside and you open the Citrate bottle. You do the same, but by mistake, two Citrates fall into your hand with the Sildenafil pill.
Now, here's the problem. You weren't watching your hand as the pills fell into it, so you can't tell the Sildenafil pill apart from the two Citrate pills. The pills look identical. They are both the same size, same weight (10 micrograms), same color (Blue), same shape (perfect square), same everything, and they are not marked differently in any way.
What are you going to do? You cannot tell which pill is which, and they cost $300 a piece, so you cannot afford to throw them away and start over again. How do you get your daily dose of exactly one Sildenafil and exactly one Citrate without wasting any of the pills?","Carefully cut each of the three pills in half, and carefully separate them into two piles, with half of each pill in each pile. You do not know which pill is which, but you are 100% sure that each of the two piles now contains two halves of Citrate and half of Sildenafil. Now go back into the Sildenafil bottle, take out a pill, cut it in half, and add one half to each stack. Now you have two stacks, each one containing two halves of Sildenafil and two halves of Citrate. Take one stack of pills today, and save the second stack for tomorrow.",,3.0,2.47
The Troll Bridge 1,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
Three travelers, Al, Ben and Carl, came across the bridge. The troll told them, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He wrote five three-letter words on a rock. The five words were HOE, OAR, PAD, TOE, and VAT.
He then said, ""I will tell each of you a different letter from the password. If you know what the password is, I will let you pass. But don't tell anyone else your letter."" He then whispered a letter from the password to each traveler so that neither of the other two could hear him.
Then the troll asked Al, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Al, and the troll let him pass.
Then the troll asked Ben, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Ben, and the troll let him pass.
Then the troll asked Carl, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Carl, and the troll let him pass.
So, what is the password?","The password was HOE.
The only letters unique to one of the five words were D, H, P, R, and V. One of these letters must have been Al's, since he could determine the password. The only word without any of these letters is TOE. So the password could not have been TOE.
Ben knew this and now had four words to think of. The only letters unique to one word were D, E, H, P, R, T, and V. The password must have contained at least two unique letters, one for Al and the other for Ben, since they were both able to determine the password. The only word with only one of these letters was OAR. So OAR could not have been the password.
Carl knew this and now had three words to think of. The only letters unique to one word were D, E, H, O, P, T, and V.

Murder on the ABC Express,"The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.
The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.
Mr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.",3.0,3.02

Fact 1 can only work if one of the four boys plays only one sport, another plays two sports, a third plays all three sports, and the last plays no sports at all.
From facts 4 and 5, we have four scenarios:
1. Al and Carl both play baseball and Ben and Dan both play soccer. This cannot work because now none of the boys can play no sports at all.
2. Neither Al nor Carl plays baseball, and neither Ben nor Dan plays soccer. This cannot work because now none of the boys can play all three sports.
3. Neither Al nor Carl plays baseball, and Ben and Dan both play soccer. But now neither Al nor Dan plays baseball but not soccer. So, from fact 2, this cannot work.
4. Al and Carl both play baseball, and neither Ben nor Dan plays soccer. Since the other three scenarios cannot work, this must be the correct one.
Since Carl plays baseball, fact 3 tells us that Ben plays basketball but not baseball. Now that we know that Al and Carl both play baseball and Ben plays basketball, Dan must be the one who plays no sports at all.
Since Dan does not play baseball, fact 2 tells us that Al plays baseball but not soccer. Now that we know that none of Al, Ben, and Dan play soccer, Carl must be the one who plays all three sports, and therefore the one that Trixie should date.",,3.0,2.2

Mansion Murder,"The owner of a mansion was tragically murdered last night. The murderer was one of the three visitors to the mansion: Ian, Jeff, and Kevin. Here are some facts:
1. The murderer arrived later than at least one of the other two visitors.
2. One of the three visitors was the town's mayor. He arrived earlier than at least one of the other two visitors.
3. The mayor arrived at midnight.
4. Neither Ian nor Jeff arrived after midnight.
5. The earlier arriver of Jeff and Kevin is not the mayor.
6. The later arriver of Ian and Kevin is not the murderer.
Who is the murderer?","Ian is the murderer.
From facts 2 and 3, we know that at least one of the three men arrived after midnight. From fact 4, we know that it had to be Kevin. Since Kevin didn't arrive at midnight, he could not have been the mayor. And since Jeff obviously arrived before Kevin, fact 5 tells us that Jeff can't be the mayor either. Therefore, the mayor must be Ian.
Fact 6 tells us that Kevin, the latest arriver, could not have been the murderer, meaning it must be either Ian or Jeff. Fact 1 tells us that they didn't arrive at the same time, and fact 4 tells us that Jeff didn't arrive after midnight. Since we already know that Ian arrived right at midnight, Jeff must have arrived before midnight. As the earliest visitor, he couldn't have been the murderer, leaving only Ian.
Therefore, Jeff arrived before midnight, Ian (both the mayor and the murderer) arrived at midnight, and Kevin arrived after midnight. It's scary to live in a town where the mayor is a murderer!!!",,2.97,1.56

There is even one casino that was made just to play that game.  One day, the manager of that casino came to my new office.  He said that he wanted to play that same game of cards.  Then he said if I win, I get your job, money, and everything; if you win, you get all my money, and you can own the casino.  I knew I was good at this game, but this guy seemed a little tougher than my old boss.  I accepted his challenge anyway.

""That's amazing,"" Mac said.  ""You've each guessed exactly one digit correctly and in its right place!""
What is Mac's house number?","182
Solution:
The first digit must be 1 or 7.  It can't be 7 as only one digit is correct in each guess.   So it's 1.
The other digits in guess #1 (i.e. 3 and 5) must be incorrect.   Therefore, from guess #3, the second digit is 8.
Guess #4 has a correct digit which must be its third - 2.",The fact that three guesses began with a 7 will give you a good start.,2.97,1.3
Jail Message,"You are locked in a jail cell with no windows, and you need to tap out a message on the wall for the man in the other cell next to you. The problem is that you have to do it at exactly 9:15 PM, when the guard outside is switched, so your noise won't be noticed. You can't hear the switching of the guards through your walls, and you have no clock.
There is a faucet with water dripping very consistently from it in the corner, but you don't know if it is dripping at 30 or 40 or however many drops per minute, and that wouldn't give you the time in any case. You can just make out the chiming of a church bell, but it chimes just once at the top of each hour, so you can't tell the time from that. You can feel the wall facing west start to cool after the sun sets, but you don't know what time the sun is setting, and this isn't very precise in any case. Your dinner is always passed into your cell between 6:15 and 6:45. How do you determine when it is exactly 9:15 PM?","After dinner arrives, you listen for the church bell. Since dinner comes between 6:15 and 6:45, the next chiming has to be at 7:00 PM. When you hear it, you start to count the drips from the faucet until you hear the chime again at 8:00 PM. Divide the number of drips by four, and you'll have the number of drips that fall in fifteen minutes (Or you can divide by sixty to get the drops per minute, and then multiply this by fifteen). When the bell chimes again at 9:00, you start counting drips until you reach the specified number. It is now 9:15 PM, and time to tap out your message.",,2.97,2.09
Prisoners and 2 Switches - Scenario A,"The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'
""If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.""
*note - the only difference from Scenario B, the original position of the 2 switches are known.","1.	Appoint a ""scorekeeper"" and the other 22 prisoners as ""transmitters"".
2.	When a transmitter enter the switch room for the first time, he will flick switch B ON if he sees it in the OFF position.  Alternatively, he will flick switch A if he sees switch B is in the ON position and waits for his next visit.  The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.
3.	The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.  When he sees switch B is already OFF, he flicks switch A instead and does not add to the score.  As soon as he accumulates 22, he reports to the Warden.","Assuming that:
A) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.
B) There is no restriction on the number of time each prisoner can visit the switch room
C) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.",2.97,3.23
The Right Switch,"In front of you are three light switches. Only one does anything, and it turns on the light downstairs. From here you can't see the light, and it makes no sound.

Wine Bottles,"In a land far away, a kingdom was famed for its wine. In one month, the king was scheduled to throw a huge banquet in honor of his birthday. Unfortunately, the king had many enemies. One day, about a month prior to the banquet, he went down to the wine cellar and found a spy poisoning one of the wine bottles. Unfortunately, the king did not notice which of the bottles was poisoned. The spy was interrogated and questioned, but refused to answer. He said that since they didn't know which bottle was poisoned, they were all rendered useless. Since they couldn't get anything out of him, they killed the spy for his treachery. Before he died, however, the spy did tell them a few things about this particular poison:
1.) The poison is so strong that any amount of dilution will have no effect on it, so if they tried to dilute the wines, it would still be poisonous.
2.) The poison would take 1 month to work. Only if after 1 month someone dies, then you know he was poisoned.
This made the king very upset. Three brave men came forward and said they would sacrifice their lives to honor the king.
In short:
You have 8 wine bottles, 1 month, and 3 expendable men. Since you have 1 month, you only have one shot at this. At the end of the month, you have to know EXACTLY (without guessing) which wine bottle is poisoned and what other 7 are good. Obviously this will require arranging the 3 men to drink the bottles in a certain fashion.","Let's call the 3 men A, B and C.
Here's how you should assign them to drink:
1.) A
2.) B
3.) C
4.) A, B
5.) A, C
6.) B, C
7.) A, B, C
8.) None
in other words, if the 5th bottle was poisoned, then at the end of the month, A and C would die.  The rule to help you here would be the power rule.  It states that any set of items can be combined to form 2^n combinations.  2^3 = 8.",Think about all the possible outcomes that can happen at the end of the month.  See if you can map that back to the bottles.,2.96,2.15

The test is simple:  he places a 100 carat ruby in a golden chalice in the center of a 20 foot by 20 foot tapestry.  The next ruler and successor to the throne must grasp the ruby from the chalice with his bare hand without suspending from the ceiling or stepping on the tapestry.  Three days pass as nobleman after nobleman fails miserably to retrieve the ruby from its golden perch.

Greedy Pirates,"Five pirates are trying to split up 1000 gold pieces.  The rules are as follows:
Pirate #1 must divide the gold up in such a way that a majority of the pirates (including himself) agree to.  If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.","Like the hint says, start backwards:
If there are two pirates left (#4 & #5), #4 has no options.  No matter what he proposes, pirate #5 will disagree, resulting in a 1-1 vote (no majority).  #5 will kill #4 and will keep all of the gold.
Now say there are 3 pirates left.  #4 has to agree with whatever #3 decides, because if he doesn't #3 will be killed (because #5 won't vote for #3's proposal no matter what it is).  #3 will just propose that he keep all of the gold and will get a 2-1 vote in his favor.
Now if there are 4 pirates left:
#3 won't vote for #2's proposal because if #2's fails, #3 will get all of the gold. #4 and #5 know that they will get nothing if the decision goes to #3, so they will vote for #2's proposal if he gives them one gold piece each. Therefore, #2 would keep 998 gold, and #4 and #5 would each get one gold.
So let's wrap this up:
Pirate #1 needs 2 other votes.  He will not get a vote from #2 because #2 will get 998 gold if #1's plan fails.
#1 offers #3 one gold piece to vote for him, which #3 will accept (if it gets to #2's plan, #3 will get nothing).
#1 then offers #4 or #5 (doesn't matter which) two gold pieces, which is more than they would get with #2's plan.
So #1 can end up with 997 gold pieces, with #3 getting one piece and #4 or #5 getting two pieces.

Birbal the Wise - XII,"Emperor Akbar once ruled over India. He was a wise and intelligent ruler, and he had in his court the Nine Gems, his nine advisors, who were each known for a particular skill. One of these Gems was Birbal, known for his wit and wisdom. The story below is one of the examples of his wit. Do you have it in you to find out the answer?
Birbal had been invited to lunch by a rich man. Birbal went to the man's house and found that the lunch was in fact a big party and there were many people around.
His host greeted him warmly.
""I did not know there would be so many guests,"" said Birbal, who hated large gatherings.
""They are not guests,"" said the man, ""They are my employees, all except one man. He is the only other guest here beside you.""
Then the host saw the perfect opportunity to test Birbal's wit and wisdom. ""Can you tell me which of them is the guest?"" he asked.
""Maybe I could. I will definitely give it a try,"" said Birbal. ""Talk to them as I observe them. And tell them a joke.""
The man told a joke that Birbal thought was perhaps the worst he had heard in a long time.
By the time the host finished telling the joke, Birbal knew who the guest was.
""Well,"" said the rich man. ""I've told my joke. Now tell me who my other guest is.""
Birbal pointed out the man to him.
""How did you know?"" asked his host, amazed.

Birbal the Wise - IV,"Emperor Akbar once ruled over India. He was a wise and intelligent ruler, and he had in his court the Nine Gems, his nine advisors, who were each known for a particular skill. One of these Gems was Birbal, known for his wit and wisdom. The story below is one of the examples of his wit. Do you have it in you to find out the answer?
There was once a blacksmith who used to make spears and shields. He came to Emperor Akbar's court and claimed - ""Your Majesty, nobody can make shields and spears like mine. My shields are so strong that nothing can pierce them and my spears are so sharp that there is nothing they cannot pierce.""
On hearing this statement, Birbal immediately said, ""You lie and I can prove that you are lying."" What did he find wrong with the man's statement?","Birbal told the man - ""I can prove you wrong. Let's do a simple test.""
The man, supremely confident, agreed.
Birbal said smilingly - ""OK, hold up one of your shields and I will pierce it with one of your spears.""

Boris Paley, liar
Chuck Thomson, truthteller
Dalman Paley, liar
Edwin Paley, truthteller
Finney Thomson, truthteller
Neither set of brothers consists entirely of liars (introduction), so neither consists entirely of truthtellers, either.  Boris, then, can't be telling the truth (clue 2); Boris is a liar.  If Alan lies, then Chuck tells the truth (clue 3), and vice versa, so between Alan and Chuck, one is a liar and one a truthteller.  By elimination, Dalman, Edwin, and Finney are, in some order, one liar and two truthtellers.  If Finney is a liar, so is Edwin (clue 6), which is impossible; so Finney tells the truth and so does Edwin (Clue 6); Dalman, then, is a liar.  Boris is a Paley (clue 7).  Edwin is a Paley (clue 5).  Chuck and Dalman are not brothers (clue 4), so one is a Paley and the other a Thomson; by elimination, Alan and Finney are both Thomsons.  Finney Thomson tells the truth, so Alan Thomson is a liar (clue 1) and Chuck is a truthteller (clue 3).  Boris Paley lied when he said both of his brothers tell the truth (clue 2); one of his brothers is Edwin Paley, a truthteller, so the other must be a liar - and therefore the third Paley can't be Chuck, a truthteller, so must be Dalman, a liar.  By elimination, Chuck is a Thompson.

The Antisocial Club,"The Antisocial Club meets every week at Jim's Bar.  Since they are so antisocial, however, everyone always sits as far as possible from the other members, and no one ever sits right next to another member.  Because of this, the 25-stool bar is almost always less than half full and unfortunately for Jim the members that don't sit at the bar don't order any drinks.  Jim, however, is pretty smart and makes up a new rule:  The first person to sit at the bar has to sit at one of two particular stools.  If this happens, then the maximum number of members will sit at the bar.  Which stools must be chosen?  Assume the stools are numbered 1 to 25 and are arranged in a straight line.","The first person must take either stool 9 or 17 (because of symmetry, it doesn't matter which).  Assume they pick seat 9.  The next person will pick seat 25, since it is the furthest from seat 9.  The next two people will take Seats one and 17.  The next three will occupy 5, 13, and 21.  The next six will occupy 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, and 23.  This seats the maximum of 13 people, and no one is sitting next to another person.  If a seat other than 9 or 17 is chosen first, the total bar patrons will be less than 13.","Don't forget - the people sit as far away from each other as possible.  If stool #1 is chosen first, the next person will always sit in stool #25.",2.92,2.79
Four People in a Race,"John, Paul, George, and Ringo all enter a race, but there is nobody at the finish line to judge the ending.  When the judge finally shows up to award the prize for coming in first, these are the statements the four of them make:
John:  I was neither first nor last.
Paul:  I did not finish last.
George:  I won the race!
Ringo:  I came in last.
The judge starts to hand George the prize, when Yoko, who was watching the race, says, ""Exactly one of these four is lying.""
To whom should the judge grant the prize?","The prize should go to Paul.
If John is lying, then George and Ringo would be telling the truth, which would mean John was not lying, so he can't be the liar.
If Paul was lying, then Ringo would also be lying, so he must be telling the truth, as well.
So we now know that neither John nor Paul finished last.  If Ringo was lying, then George would have finished last, which would mean that he was lying, as well.  So Ringo can't be lying.
This leaves George as our liar, so we know George did not finish first.  Neither did Ringo (he finished last), nor did John (he finished neither first nor last).  Therefore, Paul won the race!",,2.92,1.64
World of Nerds,"Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.
After dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.
In this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.
Can you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?
Players: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon
Races: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre
Occupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief
Weapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace
Monsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs
Skill levels: range from 10-32
Clues:
1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.
2. The paladin isn't an elf.
3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.
4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.
5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.
6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.
7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).
8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.
9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.
10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.
11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.","Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,2.92,3.15
Family Fired!,"Mary Beem, who was a wife, mother of four and grandmother of nine, was shot to death by an angry relative. Find out the name of the relative it was by piecing together the relationships of each person with the clues below.
The killer's sister was suspicious of her sibling and confirmed her distrust by talking to three people: her grandfather Bob, her cousin Bo, and her uncle (blood relative) Bill. She called the police, and the suspect was apprehended at the victim's funeral service. Only the direct descendants and their spouses were present. (Note: None of Mary's grandchildren were married or had kids, and no two people have the same first name.)
1. Bill was talking with his brother-in-law Barry.
2. Bart, Buck, and Bruce (who were all brothers) were by their grandmother's casket.
3. Mary's daughter May, who was with her husband Ben, had their two children: Missy and Bernie.
4. Mo, Bob's son-in-law, was comforting his wife Robin, and both were keeping an eye on their sons.
5. Bo was by himself in a corner grieving, while his sister Molly was talking with their cousin Megan.
6. Myra was consoling one of her two children, Brad, who had been very close to his grandmother.
7. Bob was with his daughter Maria.
NOTE: Each of the 4 couples has at least 2 kids.
WHO IS THE KILLER?","From the killer's sister's conversation, Bob is Mary's husband, Bill is one of Mary's children, and Bo is a grandchild.
From clue 1 and 2, Barry was a spouse, and since Bart, Buck and Bruce were all brothers, they were the set of three kids. Clue 3 is straightforward - Mary's daughter May is married to Ben and has two kids: Missy and Bernie.
From 4, Robin is a daughter and Bob her spouse.  From 5, Bo and Molly are siblings and grandchildren (since they have a cousin present). Megan has to be from the last couple.  Mo and Robin could only have been parents to the three boys (Bart Bruce and Buck), since all other siblings were a boy and girl.
Clue 6 gives the name of the remaining child, Brad, who must be a sibling of Megan. Both have a mother by the name of Myra. It is unknown at this point if Myra is a spouse or a direct relative.
Since clue 7 says that Bob (Mary's husband) was with his daughter Maria, Myra becomes a spouse. Then, by default, Bo and Molly belong to Maria.
So now, knowing that the killer's sister is COUSIN to Bo, Bill's NIECE, and Bob's GRANDDAUGHTER, the killer must be BERNIE.","Draw a family tree.

Three Married Couples and a Widow,"Four women, Audrey, Brenda, Charlotte, and Dawn, and three men, Edgar, Frank, and George, are tennis players.

If a game of doubles is played, there is never more than one couple in this game. One day, four games were played:
1. Audrey and Edgar vs Brenda and Frank
2. Audrey and George vs Dawn and Frank
3. Brenda and Charlotte vs Frank and George
4. Charlotte and Edgar vs Dawn and George
Who is the widow?","Charlotte is the widow.
First, we must figure out who Frank's wife is. From games 1 and 2, we know that Frank's wife cannot be Brenda or Dawn and must be Audrey or Charlotte. Let's make Frank's wife Charlotte and see what happens.
From games 2 and 4, we know that George's wife cannot be Audrey or Dawn, and it obviously cannot be Charlotte either, so it must be Brenda. But game 3 features both Brenda and George, and Charlotte and Frank. So Frank's wife cannot be Charlotte, and must therefore be Audrey.
From game 4, we know that George's wife cannot be Dawn, and it cannot be Audrey either, so it must be either Brenda or Charlotte. If George's wife is Charlotte, then Edgar's wife cannot be Audrey or Charlotte, and must be Brenda or Dawn.
But now Edgar's wife cannot be Brenda because game 1 features both Audrey and Frank, and Brenda and Edgar. It cannot be Dawn either because game 4 features both Charlotte and George, and Dawn and Edgar. Therefore, George's wife cannot be Charlotte and must be Brenda.
If Frank's wife is Audrey and George's wife is Brenda, Edgar's wife must be Charlotte or Dawn. Game 4 tells us that Edgar's wife must be Dawn. Now that Audrey, Brenda, and Dawn have all been assigned husbands, this leaves only Charlotte without a husband.",,2.9,1.61

The Case of the Missing Ice Cream Sandwich,"Earl and Joe are best friends, who secretly sent encrypted messages to each other ever since they were little. Now they're both in college, and Earl had aced his midterm on cryptology.
Joe congratulated Earl by buying him a Neapolitan ice cream sandwich (Joe couldn't afford much), hid the sandwich somewhere in Joe's house, and he later encrypted, on a piece of paper, where he hid the sandwich. Soon after Joe hid the sandwich, he realized he placed the sandwich near the sun, meaning that he'd better relocate it, otherwise the sandwich would melt.
Unfortunately, Joe, being extremely forgetful, had misplaced the sandwich and forgot where he put it. He still had the encryption note in his hand, and so he turned to his best friend Earl to solve it.
""I was gonna give you this later, but you gotta hurry now and find the ice cream I got you, otherwise it'll melt.""

Captain John's Journey (Part 2),"Captain John has escaped his home town onto his ship, the ""Wasp"", and now Captain John sits in his cabin reading his map. Standing up, he walks out the door into the middle of the deck and announces ""we have made it this far, but next we need to find both shipwrecks in the right order to point us the right way, towards the island"", followed by tons of ""ehs"".
There are reefs in the ocean and if Captain John passes over one, his ship sinks and he and his crew die.
With what Captain John knows about the sea, can you figure out where the nine things in a 3-by-3 grid(Wasp, sunken ship 1, sunken ship 2, 2 oceans, 3 reefs, and the island) and go in the right path to the first sunken ship, the second, then the island, without passing over a reef.
The ship can move 1 space horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and it can only pass each space once.
1. The Wasp is in the same row or column as both sunken ships.

Weight In Gold,"During the California Gold Rush, an assessor in San Francisco used a balance to measure out quantities of gold dust. He had a set of weights to place on the balance. The assessor needed to be able to measure out gold dust in exact ounces, no fractions, for every number of ounces starting at 1.
If the assessor has four weights, what is the largest number of ounces of gold dust he can measure?
Note: The answer is not 15 ounces","The maximum weight is 40 ounces.
The weights are powers of 3:  1 ounce, 3 ounces, 9 ounces, 27 ounces.
Example:
7 ounces – Plate A: 9 oz. and 1 oz. weights.   Plate B: 3 oz weight and gold
In any weighing, each weight can be placed in one of three ways: on the plate with the gold, on the plate without the gold, on the desk next to the balance. So given n weights, there are 3^n possible combinations.
Throw out the case where all weights are on the table. That leaves 3^n – 1 cases.
Half of those cases would weigh negative gold, so eliminate half of these.
Thus, the number of valid combinations for n weights is (3^n – 1) / 2.
For four weights, (3^4 – 1) / 2 = (81 – 1) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40.",Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.,2.88,2.62
Packing For Pluvia,"Kemal and his parents are part of an expedition that is going to settle a new planet, called Pluvia Three. Kemal knows that at the colony site on the planet, the average temperature is 45 degrees Centigrade, average wind speeds are 8,000 meters per hour, the planet rotates on its axis 431 times for every time it goes around its sun, and each rotation takes a third longer than Earth's. Rainfall is 254 centimeters per year, and gravity is about 78% of Earth's. Kemal is allowed to pack any four items from this list of his favorite belongings.
down-filled parka
battery-powered portable refrigerator
Asian fighting kite
baseball bat
Mickey Mouse® calendar watch
inflatable raft
hockey skates
book collection
Which four items should Kemal pack?","Kemal should pack his inflatable raft, refrigerator, baseball bat, and books.
45 degrees Centigrade = 113 degrees Fahrenheit
8,000 meters per hour = 8 km per hour = 5 miles per hour
431 revolutions (days) > 365 days in an Earth year
254 cm = 100 in. of rainfall
You can use an encyclopedia, the World Wide Web, or a call to your local weather station to get weather information for the place where you live. You will see that the Pluvia Three colony is very hot, not at all windy, and very wet.
Clearly, it is too warm for the parka or the hockey skates, and there is not enough wind to fly the kite. The Mickey Mouse® watch won't be much use since the planet has a different calendar from Earth's 365 days per year and 24 hours per day.
On the other hand, with all that rainfall, there must be lakes and seas where a raft would come in handy. Kemal would want to keep his snacks cool, so the refrigerator would be useful. It would be possible (and probably fun) to play baseball on a planet with lower gravity, although Kemal and his friends might want to make the diamond bigger than it would be on Earth because the ball will fly farther. Finally, you can read books anywhere. That's one of the nice things about them.",Assemble and interpret your data carefully. Make comparisons between Pluvia and Earth.,2.88,2.11

Numberrangements,"In Numberrangements, you are given an arrangement of letters. The letters represent all of the whole numbers from 1 to the total number of letters used. Each letter represents a different number. Using the clues given, find which number each letter represents.
ABC
DEF
GHI
1. The sum of the top row is greater than the sum of the middle row, which is greater than the sum of the bottom row.
2. E is a prime factor of G.
3. F is greater than A.
4. The sum of B and G is equal to H.
5. I is not 1.","A=7, B=1, C=9
D=6, E=2, F=8
G=4, H=5, I=3
From Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.
Let's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.
If I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.
This means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.
This leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6. This leaves 7 and 8 to be A and F, so of course, F=8 and A=7.",,2.86,2.88

Salt Dealer,"Ali ben-Ibrahim was a salt dealer in old Baghdad. Every day he went from his home just outside the city to the market with two huge sacks of salt tied to the back of his donkey. His donkey was a small, evil-smelling brute called Roxanna. It was, however, not lacking in the brains department. One hot day, as they passed along the banks of the Tigris, it broke free from Ali and plunged into the cool water. When the irate salt-seller finally persuaded the beast to leave the river it immediately noticed that much of the salt had dissolved and its load was therefore considerably lighter. After that, no matter how hard Ali tried, he could not prevent the donkey from diving into the river and ruining its load of salt. But when it came to lateral thinking, Ali himself was no slouch. One day he loaded up the donkey as usual and, as usual, the animal plunged into the river. Then it learned its lesson and never tried that trick again.

4.  If neither Sir Luke or Sir Andrew went out, then Sir Vincent did.
5. If Sir William was one of the two, then either Sir Calvin or Sir Charles was with him.
6. If Sir Vincent was not of the two who went to slay the dragon, then neither was Sir Andrew nor Sir Charles.","Sir Vincent and Sir Charles went out of the kingdom to slay the dragon.
If statement 1 is valid, Calvin was one of the two that left. If not, either William or Vincent was one of the two. Therefore the PAIR could not be Andrew and Luke, Sir Andrew and Charles or Luke and Charles.
From 3, the PAIR that left was not Luke and Calvin, Luke and Vincent or Calvin and Vincent. From 4, the two could not have been William and Calvin, William and Charles or Calvin and Charles.
From 5, William did not venture out and therefore from 4 the pair was not William and Calvin or William and Charles.

Everyone was puzzled over what to do until Gina had an idea: why not mix the batters together and then separate the contents back in the bowls. Here is what happened in chronological order:
Allie mixed with Tina
Emma mixed with Gina
Kaleb mixed with Daniel
Colt mixed with Emma
Tina mixed with Noah
Mary mixed with Gina
Quinn mixed with Emma
Jacob mixed with Lily
Gina mixed with Noah
Mary mixed with Quinn
Allie mixed with Kaleb
Noah mixed with Colt
Tina mixed with Gina
Daniel mixed with Jacob
Daniel mixed with Noah
Colt mixed with Lily
Allie mixed with Daniel
Tina mixed with Lily
In the end Allie, Colt, Daniel, Emma, Lily, Mary, Noah, Quinn, and Tina had a sweet cake while Gina, Jacob, and Kaleb didn't. Who started with the bowl with sugar?","Colt.
It can't be Gina, Jacob, or Kaleb, they don't have sugar.
It can't be Emma, Daniel, Mary, Lily, Noah, Allie or Tina, because they mixed with the above.
This leaves Colt and Quinn, it can't be Quinn because then only Quinn, Emma, and Mary would have sugar.",,2.84,2.0

Show Me the Mommy!,"Biggie Nuff, Baron of Grey Matter, now living in Shapeless, Mass., was dying from a newly developed allergy to water, and wanted his will to reflect the common inheritance law of his father's native country.  Biggie's wife, Faerie, was pregnant at the time with what would be the first child for either of them.  Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.
In due time, Biggie died, and the authorities read his will, holding dispensation of the estate until the child was born.  Five months after Biggie's death, Faerie delivered ... normal, healthy twins, a boy (whom she named Manny) and a girl (whom she named Goodie).
The estate's executor immediately appealed to the Shapeless magistrate to rule on the proper division for the estate.  After a great deal of arguing and deep thought, plus several failed attempts to raise Biggie's spirit with a seance, the judge rendered a fair decision.
How did they divide Biggie's estate?","The judge reasoned that Biggie intended to give his wife half as much as a son, or twice as much as a daughter.  Therefore, he ruled that Manny gets 4/7 of the estate, Faerie gets 2/7, and Goodie gets 1/7.

Accountants and Lawyers,"You are attending a business meeting which consists of only accountants and lawyers. From your previous dealings with these two professions, you know that accountants always tell the truth about everything, and lawyers always lie about something.
Two gentlemen, Sam and Adam, approach you. Sam introduces himself and says, ""I am a lawyer, but Adam is an accountant.""
Based on what you know from your previous dealings, what are each of the men's actual professions?","Both Sam and Adam are lawyers.
Since an accountant ALWAYS tells the truth about everything, he would never say that he is a lawyer.  Therefore, Sam must be a lawyer.  Since he is telling the truth about being a lawyer, and you know that he always lies about something, he must be lying about the second part of his statement.  Therefore, Adam is not an accountant but also a lawyer.",,2.84,1.36

The Antique Lamp?,"The Jones family of Ohio is entertaining their cousin Henry, who is visiting from Belgium.
After staying for several days, Henry is getting ready to leave, when he presents the Jones with a gift.
It is a lamp that Henry claims is a very valuable antique that has been in his family for 70 years.  It has small Bohemian figures that dance around the base when the lamp is turned on.  Henry plugs it in to show the family how it works.
After Henry leaves, the father looks at his family, and says, ""While it may be a pretty lamp, and it was nice of Henry to give it to us, it is not a Belgian antique.""
Why is the father so sure?","An antique lamp from Belgium would not have a plug that would fit into a standard outlet in North America. The father noted that the plug was a sealed plug not a replacement one and therefore was the original installation.

If it's black, from rules 1 and 4, Peter must combine black with red, yellow and green on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, but rule 7 disallows combining black with red.
Therefore, it's blue, and Peter must combine blue with red, yellow and green on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. From rule 5, Peter uses green on Thursday, he can't use green on Wednesday or Friday, and only on Sunday.
From rule 6, Peter doesn't use yellow on Friday, and he can only use red on Friday and yellow on Wednesday.

Stolen Root Beer,"Fred, who owns a restaurant, is convinced that one of his employees is stealing root beer from him.  Since he is a bad businessman, he doesn't keep very good records of his inventory or his employees, so he doesn't know who is doing it.  He decides to set a trap to find out who is stealing from him.
He assigns each of his employees a different night to close up shop.  He then arranges the last 28 bottles of root beer in a square so that each side has nine bottles, as shown below:
2 5 2
5 0 5
2 5 2
Fred figures that whatever day he comes in where there are no longer nine bottles to a side, he will know it was the person who closed the night before who is doing it.
Unfortunately for Fred, Bob, the thief, figures it out and manages to take four more bottles the night of his shift, rearranging the bottles so that Fred doesn't realize they're missing.  Not only that, but Bob was able to take four more bottles away the next night he closed while still rearranging them to have nine bottles on each side.
How did Bob do it?","After Bob takes the first four bottles, he arranges the remaining 24 bottles like this:

The Protection Racket,"The gang of four that once ran the biggest protection racket in the east eventually got out of jail.  Almost immediately, they began operating again in the same neighborhood.  They had previously divided it into four territories: north, south, east, and west.  Because each mobster had always kept his operations in the same area, the police nicknamed them Mr. North, Mr. South, Mr. East, and Mr. West.
Now the police received a reliable tip that this time each mobster was operating in a new territory.  None of the new victims was willing to identify the mobsters from photos the police showed them, but three facts became clear, and that was enough for the FBI to work out which mobster was operating where.  These are the facts:
1. Mr. East is not operating the North.
2. The North territory is not being operated by Mr. South.
3. The South territory is not being operated by Mr. East.

Tower of Terror,"Swaff was traveling in an elevator, being cool, when he suddenly heard the cord supporting the elevator snap. Being the cool guy that he is, he knew of a myth where if you could jump at the right time, you could possibly be able to survive a plunge in an elevator.
Now, when Swaff was a boy, he spent all of his math classes making fun of his female teacher's moustache. He never paid attention, so he was a tad bit slow in his mathematical calculations. He did, however, have a very bizarre talent, in which he could tell the exact speed he was traveling. That came in pretty lucky today.
Swaff knew he was falling at an even rate of 50 miles per hour. When the cord snapped, he was exactly 110  feet above the ground. He knew that he must jump at the right time to have any hopes of surviving.

Can you figure out who owns the wallet?","C owns the wallet.
EXPLANATION:
B's first statement says that A is telling the truth that it is A's wallet. His second statement, however, says that it is E's wallet. The statements cannot be true at the same time, so B lied in both of them. B is a liar.
Since B was lying when he said that A is telling the truth, A is the other liar, too.
C and D are automatically truthtellers, since they both told the truth when they said A was lying. E is also a truthteller since he said that D told the truth.
Therefore, C owns the wallet.",,2.82,1.79
Breaking the Billiard Ball,"It is your task to determine how high you can drop a billiard ball without it breaking. There is a 100 story building and you must determine which is the highest floor you can drop a ball from without it breaking. You have only two billiard balls to use as test objects. If both of them break before you determine the answer then you have failed at your task. What is the order of floors that you should drop the balls from to minimize the number of droppings that you will have to make to determine the answer?
Assume that if a ball doesn't break you can reuse it without worrying about it being weakened.","If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.  Here's how to do it:
First drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.
If the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.
If the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.
Keep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks. If it breaks on the xth dropping you will only need at most 14-x more droppings with the second ball to find the breaking point. By the 11th dropping of the first ball, if you get that far, you will have reached the 99th floor.",,2.81,2.91
Pub Regulars,"Edgar, Frank, and George are regulars at a pub. All three of them have been regulars since before this month.

2. The first day of a certain month that Edgar went to the bar was a Monday. The first day of the same month that Frank went to the bar was a Wednesday. The first day of the same month that George went to the bar was a Friday.
3. There was only one day in that month that all three men went to the pub.
On which day of that month did all three men go to the bar?","All three men went on the 27th.
From fact 1, the first day the two-day man went to the pub was either the 1st or the 2nd of the month, and the first day the three-day man went was either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. But from fact 2, they could not have gone on consecutive days, so from fact 3, the two-day man must have first gone on the 1st and the three-day man must have first gone on the 3rd. This gives us two possible scenarios:
1. Edgar went to the pub on Monday the 1st and every two days thereafter, Frank went on Wednesday the 3rd and every three days thereafter, and George went on Friday the 5th and every seven days thereafter.
2. Frank went on Wednesday the 1st and every two days thereafter, George went on Friday the 3rd and every three days thereafter, and Edgar went on Monday the 6th and every seven days thereafter.
If scenario 1 is true, then Edgar went on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, 19th, 21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th, and, depending on the length of the month, the 29th and 31st, Frank went on the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 18th, 21st, 24th, 27th, and depending on the length of the month, the 30th, and George went on the 5th, 12th, 19th, and 26th. But now there was no day when all three men went to the pub. So this cannot work.
This means that scenario 2 is true. Edgar went on the 6th, 13th, 20th, and 27th. Frank went on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, 19th, 21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th, and, depending on the length of the month, the 29th and 31st. George went on the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 18th, 21st, 24th, 27th, and depending on the length of the month, the 30th. So all three men went on the 27th.",,2.81,2.81

Be Creative,"Using one sheet of paper (8&1/2 by 11 inches), support a heavy hardcover book 1 inch above a tabletop.  You may use this one sheet of paper, scissors, a pencil and tape only.  Once you are done, only the paper may hold up the book.","Cut the paper into six strips, 1 inch wide by 11 inches long.  Wind each strip around a pencil to make a tight cylinder.

Statement 2 has to be spoken by Roger, since he is the only man.
Since there is only one marriage implied here, Statement 1 must be made by Susan, Roger's wife, making Claire Roger's sister.
Claire must be the one referring to her niece Melissa in Statement 4.  Melissa could say Statement 3, but that would leave Danielle referring to herself in Statement 5.  Therefore Melissa says Statement 5 and Danielle says Statement 3.",,2.81,2.18

The Flat Tire,"At Duke University, there were four sophomores taking Organic Chemistry. They had done so well on all the quizzes, midterms, labs, etc., that each had a solid ""A"" for the semester.
These guys were feeling pretty confident the weekend before finals, so they decided to go up to the University of Virginia to party with some friends. They had a great time; however, after all the partying, they slept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to Duke until early Monday.
Rather than take the final on schedule Monday morning, they decided to find their professor after the exam and let him know why they had missed it. They explained that they had gone to UVA for the weekend with the plan to come back to study, but, unfortunately, they had had a flat tire on the way back, hadn't brought a spare, and hadn't been able to get help for a long time.
As a result, they had missed the exam.
The Professor thought it over and then agreed that they could make up the final the following day. The guys were elated and relieved. They studied hard that night and went in the next day at
the appointed time.
The professor placed the four friends in separate rooms, handed each of them a test booklet, and told them to begin.
They looked at the first problem, worth 5 points. It was something simple about free radical formation.
""Cool,"" thought all four simultaneously, each one in his separate room, ""this is going to be easy."" Each finished the problem and then turned the page.

16 Coins,"Johnny was given 16 coins by his older, somewhat meaner brother, Mark.  He told him that he could keep them all if he could place all 16 on the table in such a way that they formed 15 rows with 4 coins in each row.
After 10 minutes, Johnny walked away with the coins and Mark, after complaining futilely to his mother, left with nothing.
How did Johnny place the coins?","If you draw a 5-pointed star with all sides of equal length, you will create a pentagon in the middle with all 5 sides of equal length. Then draw another 5 pointed star, upside-down, using the 5 points of the interior pentagon as the points of the inner star,  This will give you another 5-sided pentagon in the interior of the second, smaller star.
Now, take your 16 coins and place 5 on the outside points of the outside star.  Then place 5 more on the points of each of the two pentagons you have created.  Finally, place the last coin in the dead center of this drawing.
The lines are as follows:
5 lines for the actual drawing of the outside star
5 lines for the actual drawing of the inside star

There is also a large-screen projector that projects the following five images, repeatedly, one at a time:
A human brain, Earth, the incomplete phrase: 'Fair and ____,' the letters AZCONMUT and a cheese sandwich on plain white bread with the edges perfectly cut off.
The poor man was allowed an entire day to study the images, after which he would have to choose the door that corresponded to the commonality of the images. The next day the man walked through the correct door, and the billionaire made him rich. What door did the man choose?","The man chose door number FOUR. Here's why:
The image of the human brain made the man think of 'four corners of the mind.'
He recognized the capital letters AZCONMUT to be the abbreviations of the 'Four corner states' Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. He completed the phrase
'Fair and ____' with the word SQUARE, which also has also four corners. When he got hungry, he ordered the same sandwich in the last image. But instead of eating right away, he studied it, until he got the point that it too had four corners. Thus, the poor guy walked into a mansion poorer than poor, and walked out with a cheese sandwich, and enough dough to buy a small country.

""I am standing directly across the net from the server's daughter. My partner, who is on the same side of the net as me, is standing directly across the net from the receiver's father. The server and the receiver are standing diagonally across the net from each other.""
Who said this?","Heather's father said this.
From the speaker's first two statements, we know that the court is set up like this:
speaker | speaker's partner

server's daughter | receiver's father
From the speaker's last statement, we have two scenarios:
1. The receiver's father is the server and the speaker is the receiver.
2. The speaker's partner is the server and the server's daughter is the receiver.
If scenario 1 is true, then the receiver's father is the father of both the receiver and the server's daughter. But no one is the father of more than one person, so this is impossible.
This means that scenario 2 is true. Since the receiver was the server's daughter, she was the daughter of both the server and the receiver's father. This means that the server is Heather herself, the receiver's father is Heather's husband, and the server's daughter is Heather's daughter.

The Strange Library,"In a certain library, no two books contain the same number of words, and the total number of books is greater than number of words in the largest book.
How many words does one of the books contain, and what is the book about?","One of the books is about nothing and has zero words.
First, the library can be simplified into just two books. If there are two books, the greatest number of words possible is one and the other must have zero.
2 books: 1 word and 0 words.
Since the number of books is greater than the number of words in the largest book without repetition in number of words, the number of books will always be one more than the number of words in the largest book. There will always by necessity be books with every number of words possible less than the largest book, and there will always be a book with no words to increase the total number of books. This assumes (correctly) you can't have books with a negative number of words.
Following this logic, a library with three books has a book with two words, a book with one word, and a book with zero words.
3 books: 2 words, 1 word, and 0 words.
A library with n books has a book with n-1 words, a book with n-2 words, a book with n-3 words, and eventually a book with n-n words or zero words.

Tennis Balls 2,"You have 27 tennis balls. One is heavier than all the others, which all weigh the same. Using the scale which you have, what is the minimum amount of weighings you must make to determine with all certainty which is the heavier tennis ball?","You only have to use the scale 3 times:
First, divide the balls into three groups of nine each.
Then, weigh two of the groups on the scale separately. If there is a large difference, then the heavier group has the heavier ball in it. If they are the same weight, then the third group must have the heavier ball in it.
Third, divide this group into three smaller groups of three tennis balls each. Again, weigh two of them separately.
Once you have identified the cluster of tennis balls with the greatest weight, for the third time compare two of the tennis balls. Using the logic as in the first and second steps, you can now define the heaviest tennis ball!",Think about grouping the tennis balls...,2.79,1.74
Cookie Crunchers,"Cassie, Jon, Luke, Maria, and Sahas baked a batch of 36 cookies, two-thirds of which were chocolate chip. The rest were plain. They each ate at least one right away. The cookies were so delicious, only one-and-a-half dozen are left, of which half are plain.
1. Cassie is allergic to chocolate.
2. Luke ate twice as many chocolate chip cookies as plain cookies.
3. Sahas and Maria each ate as many cookies as Luke and Cassie combined.
4. Sahas ate more chocolate chip cookies than Maria.
If all the cookies were eaten by the bakers themselves, how many cookies of each kind did each person eat?","Cassie: 1 plain
Jon: 6 chocolate chip
Luke: 2 chocolate chip and 1 plain
Maria: 3 chocolate chip and 1 plain
Sahas: 4 chocolate chip
Of the 36 cookies baked, two thirds, or 24, were chocolate chip and 12 were plain.
Of the 1 1/2 dozen, or 18, cookies remaining, 9 are chocolate chip and 9 are plain.
So, of the cookies eaten, 24 - 9 = 15, which were chocolate chip, and 12 - 9 = 3, which were plain.
Both Cassie and Luke must each have eaten at least 1 plain cookie. Sahas and Maria each ate the same number of cookies, but Sahas ate more chocolate chip cookies than Maria, so one of Maria's cookies must have been plain. That left Cassie with 1 plain cookie, and Luke with 1 plain and 2 chocolate chip cookies. Between them, Luke and Cassie ate 4 cookies, so Sahas ate 4 chocolate chip cookies and Maria ate 3 chocolate chip cookies and 1 plain cookie. Jon must have eaten the other 6 chocolate chip cookies.","1. Determine the distribution of the types of cookies that were eaten. Then solve from there.

Lemme See that Bag,"A man working at border patrol had to inspect the luggage and cargo people brought across the border. One day this man came up on a beautiful bike with 2 huge sacks on his shoulder. The man was sweating a little, the officer unsure whether it was from the riding or of fear asked to see the cargo. The man obediently opened the bag and saw only sand. He waved the man through. Next week the man came back riding his bike with 2 huge sacks and the same thing happened.
This happened every week for months. Finally, one day he saw the man on the news being sentenced to death for a crime he committed several years back. The officer went down to the station and asked the prisoner, ""I know you're doing something illegal, but what is it?""

The Color of My Hat,"Three men are buried in the sand all facing forwards with their heads above ground. Each man has a hat placed on his head selected from a bag containing 3 red hats, and 2 black hats. The men cannot turn around to see the men behind them. The man at the back is asked what hat he is wearing. He replies 'I do not know'. The middle man is asked what hat he is wearing. He also replies 'I do not know'. The man at the front is then asked what hat he is wearing. He replies 'I am wearing a red hat'. How did he know?","Since the man at the back could not determine his own hat, this means that the front two men could not have been wearing black hats and that, therefore, there must be at least one red hat on the two front men. Therefore the middle man must not be able to see a black hat otherwise he would know he had a red one on. Therefore the front man must be wearing a red hat - which finally he deduces.

"The Total is 14, Part I","Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, pulled aside three students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each had a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
Sage and Rosemary opened their envelopes, and on seeing his number, Sage said, ""I know that Rosemary and Tim have different numbers.""
Rosemary replied, ""I already knew our numbers were all different, and now I know everyone's number.""
Tim said, ""Then I do, as well,"" even though he never opened his envelope.
How could he have known? What numbers did everyone have?","Sage had a 1, Rosemary had an 11, and Tim had a 2.
From Sage's statement, he had to have an odd number. He knew that the sum of all three numbers was even, so if his number was odd, one of the other two numbers would have to be odd, and the other even, leaving them unequal.
Rosemary could deduce this, too, so when she saw an 11, she knew that Sage had a 1 and Tim had a 2. If she had seen a 12, she would have known that the other two boys each had a 1, which is contradicted by her saying that she already knew they all had different numbers. If she saw any number other than an 11 (say 9, for example), she would not have know which odd number Sage held. (In our example, he could have had a 1 and Tim a 4, or he could have had a 3 and Tim a 2).

Hunt the Wumpus,"You are playing Hunt the Wumpus.
In this game, the goal is to kill a wumpus from an adjacent room (by shooting an arrow from an adjacent room).
However, there are obstacles that will interfere with the player.
The first of these obstacles is a bottomless pit. There are two of them in the game (each room has a 10% chance of having a pit). Enter a room with a pit and you lose. When you are in a room adjacent to that of a room with a pit, a warning will come up saying ""You feel a draft"".
The second obstacle is bats. Bats are just like pits, except that bats will randomly take you to any of the 20 rooms (even if the room has a pit or a wumpus) However, I have not included bats in this teaser.
Each room has 3 adjacent rooms.
In Room #7-- There is a draft. Exits are Room 6, Room 17, and Room 8.
In room #1--There is a draft. Exits are Room 5, Room 2, and Room 8
In room # 4-- There is a draft. Exits are Room 5, Room 6, and Room 14
In room #6-- There is a draft. Exits are Room 5, Room 7, and Room 16.
In room # 18-- There is a draft. Exits are Room 9, Room 17, and Room 16
In room #16-- There is a draft. Exits are Room 6, Room 17, and Room 18

Stolen Candy Bar,"During  lunch at school, a group of five boys from Miss Smith's home room visited a nearby canteen. One of the five boys took a candy bar without paying for it. When the boys were questioned by the school principal, they made the following statements in respective order:
1. Chris: ""Neither Austin nor I did it.""
2. Kraig: ""It was Chris or Mark.""
3. Mark: ""Both Chris and Kraig are lying.""
4. Gavin: ""Between Chris and Kraig, one of them is lying and the other is speaking the truth.""
5. Austin: ""What Gavin said is wrong.""
When Miss Smith was consulted, she said, ""Three of these boys are always truthful, but everything that two of them say will be a lie."" Assuming that Miss Smith is correct, can you determine who took the candy bar?","Mark took the candy bar.
Mark is the pivotal character here, since he is either referring to or being referred to by all of the other characters. Use trial and error to solve this:
Option 1:
Mark: Telling the truth. This means:
Chris: Liar
Kraig: Liar
Gavin: Liar
Austin: Truth.
These are the only possible outcomes if Mark tells the truth. Since the teacher said that there are three truth tellers, this solution doesn't work. Therefore, Mark must be a liar.
Option 2:
If Mark is a liar, then there are three options for Chris and Craig: both are truth tellers, Chris lies and Kraig tells the truth, or Chris tells the truth and Kraig lies. If you set up a chart with these options, you can easily determine if Gavin and Austin are telling the truth, too:
Option:..1...2...3
Mark:....L...L...L
Chris:...T...L...T
Kraig:...T...T...L
Gavin:...L...T...T
Austin:..T...L...L
Read these from top to bottom: For example, option 1 is: If Mark lies and Chris and Kraig tell the truth, then Gavin must lie and Austin must tell the truth. Do the same for the other two columns.
The only option here that satisfies the three truth-teller rule is Option 1. Since Chris and Kraig both tell the truth, the thief must be Mark.",Austin's statement is true.,2.77,2.31
Alphabet Pyramids,"Did you know that the mango is one of the world's most popular fruits? The mango is grown in North, South and Central America, the Caribbean, south and central Africa, as well as its native southern and south-east Asia.

BELOW
CANDY
FORTY
HELIX
JABOT
LEMON
LIGHT
MANGO
OCHRE
PEACH
QUEST
QUICK
VIEUX
Using these words, can you figure out which letters appear on each pyramid?","Let's start with the word MANGO, and assign a number to each pyramid.
1: M
2: A
3: N
4: G
5: O
The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.
1: M, C, T
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D, I
The J and B of JABOT must be on pyramids 3 and 4, but the B cannot be with the E, or else one cannot spell BELOW. Also, the W must be on pyramid 1.
1: M, C, T, W
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F, B
4: G, E, Y, J
5: O, P, D, I
The X in HELIX must be on pyramid 1, so we now have all the letters on that pyramid. There is only one letter left on pyramid 3, and it must be in VIEUX, QUEST and QUICK, so it must be the U. The V from VIEUX must therefore be on pyramid 2.
The Q cannot be on the same pyramid as the I, in order to spell QUICK, so it is also on pyramid 2. The S cannot be on the same pyramid as the E (QUEST), so is therefore on pyramid 5, and the K is the last letter on pyramid 4.
1: M, C, T, W, X
2: A, L, R, V, Q

Then on Day 2, it says that Jessica is moved to First Sergeant, and Anna moved 2 higher than that, a First Lieutenant, and Clark is moved 4 below Anna to Corporal.
On Day 3 Stephen is moved up to Brigadier General and Anna to Major. Clark is moved to Sergeant, and Jessica is moved down one to Sergeant.
Day 4, Abby is moved down to Corporal, Jessica is moved down to Private, and Felicia goes up to Captain.

Yellow Birds,"Abel, Mabel, and Caleb went bird watching. Each of them saw one bird that none of the others did. Each pair saw one bird that the third did not. And one bird was seen by all three. Of the birds Abel saw, two were yellow. Of the birds Mabel saw, three were yellow. Of the birds Caleb saw, four were yellow. How many yellow birds were seen in all? How many non-yellow birds were seen in all?","Three birds were seen by one person each, three were seen by each unique pair (Abel-Mabel, Abel-Caleb, and Mabel-Caleb), and one was seen by all three. So seven birds were seen in all, and each person saw a total of four. Hence, all of the birds Caleb saw were yellow. These four birds are: (1) the one Caleb saw alone, (2) the one Caleb saw with Abel, (3) the one Caleb saw with Mabel, and (4) the one all three saw together. This accounts for both of the yellow birds Abel saw, and two of the three yellow birds Mabel saw. The third yellow bird Mabel saw could not have been the one Abel and Mabel saw together, because Abel only saw two yellow birds; so the third yellow bird Mabel saw must have been the one she saw alone.
So five yellow birds were seen (the one Mabel saw, the one Caleb saw, the one Abel and Caleb saw, the one Mabel and Caleb saw, and the one all three saw), and two non-yellow birds were seen (the one Abel saw and the one Abel and Mabel saw) by the group.",,2.77,2.14
The Winning Combination 2,"You are back on the same game show with four other contestants. You didn't realise last time that the winner gets another appearance on the show! You now have another chance to win half a million dollars and become a millionaire! The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues. The first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. When adding the first number of the third set with the second number of the second set, you will get a number below 8.
2. The only digits not used in the code are 5 and 7.
3. When adding the two digits of the first set together, you will not get 10.
4. If you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed.
5. No set has a number above 90.
6. The product of both the digits in the first set is below 30 but above 20.
7. One of the number sets is 66.
8. There is only one 8 in the combination, and it is in the last set.
Now, get cracking!
Warning: Hint shows which set the 66 is in.","The set is 39-21-66-48.
First of all, the second clue tells you there are no 5's or 7's in the combination.
Now we go to the fourth clue. It tells you that if you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed. There are only a few numbers that will satisfy this:
11, 12, 16, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
Now we skip down to clue 8, which tells us there is one 8 only, and it is in the last set. It could either be the first digit or the second digit.
However, this eliminates these numbers from being in the second set: 11, 16, 23 and 24. Now, only 12, 21 and 22 are the possibilities for being in the second set.
Now, let's look at clue 7. This tells us that 66 is one of the four number sets. We know it can't be in the second, or fourth, and since clue six tells us the product of the two numbers in the first set ranges from 21-29, 66 must go in the third set.
??-??-66-??
Now we must look at the first clue. The first number of the third set (6) plus the second number of the second set will get a number below 8. This means it cannot be 12 or 22, because they would both total 8. This means that the second set of numbers is 21. Making good progress!
??-21-66-??
Now, we come back to clue 4 which tells us the second set multiplied by 4 equals the fourth set reversed. 21 multiplied by 4 is 84, which when reversed is 48!
??-21-66-48
Now, we come back to clue 6, which tells us the product of the digits in the first set is above 20 but below 30. These are the only numbers that satisfy that condition - and remember, no 5's, 7's or 8's are left in the combination:
39 (3 * 9 = 27)
46 (4 * 6 = 24)
64 (6 * 4 = 24)
93 (9 * 3 = 27)
Now, we look at clue 5. This eliminates 93. Now, come to clue 3. This tells us the sum of the two digits in the first set does not equal 10. This eliminates 46 and 64. The only number left is.... 39!
Now you have your answer;
39-21-66-48
Congratulations!!! You won, again!! You are over the moon! You have become the first millionaire in five generations of your family history!!",??-??-66-??,2.77,2.46

Logitopia 2,"Lisa, Martha, Nora, and Ophelia live in the strange country of Logitopia. This country is inhabited by four races of people: the type A people and type B people who always tell the truth, and the type C people and type D people who always lie. Each of them is of a different race.
Lisa says, ""Martha is a type A person."" Martha says, ""Nora is a type C person."" Nora says, ""Ophelia is a type D person."" Ophelia says, ""Lisa is NOT a type B person.""
Who is which race?","Lisa is a type D person, Martha is a type B person, Nora is a type C person, and Ophelia is a type A person.
Suppose Lisa is a truthteller. This means that Martha is a type A person, which means that Nora is a type C person. Since Lisa is a truthteller who is not a type A person, she is a type B person, which means Ophelia is lying. Since Ophelia is a liar who is not a type C person, she must be a type D person. But since Nora is a type C person, Ophelia cannot be a type D person. So this cannot work.
This means that Lisa is a liar and cannot be a type B person, which means that Ophelia is telling the truth and cannot be a type D person, which means that Nora is lying. Since Lisa and Nora are both lying, Martha and Ophelia must be the two truthtellers, which means that Nora is a type C person and Lisa is a type D person. Since Lisa is lying, Martha cannot be a type A person and must be a type B person, and Ophelia must be a type A person.",,2.77,1.68
Baseball Lineup,"Before the game, the manager of the ""Anytown Homers"" had to decide in what order to bat his 9 players.  However, the manager's dog chewed the paper the lineup was written on as the manager drove to the game.  He could remember:

A Murder in Heather's Family 2,"Heather, her husband, their son, their daughter, and Heather's brother lived together in a house...until yesterday, when one of the five was murdered by one of the other four. Here are some facts that refer only to the five family members:
1. At the time of the murder, a man and a woman were at the store together, the murderer and the victim were at the park together, and one of Heather's two children was at home alone.
2. Heather and her husband were apart at the time of the murder.
3. The victim's sibling is not the murderer.
4. The murderer is younger than the victim.
Who was murdered?","Heather's brother was murdered.
From facts 1 and 2, Heather and her husband were at the store and the park, in some order. Suppose Heather was at the park. Then, from fact 1, Heather's husband and their daughter were at the store, their son was at home, and Heather and her brother were at the park, which means that one of Heather and her brother must have killed the other. But, from fact 3, this cannot work, which means that Heather was at the store.
Suppose the man at the store with Heather was her brother. Then her husband was at the park with one of the two children. Since the husband is obviously older than the children, fact 4 tells us that he could not have killed them. But since he doesn't have a sibling who lives with him, fact 3 tells us he can't be the victim either.
This means that Heather and her son were at the store, her daughter was at home, and Heather's husband and brother were at the park. Again, from fact 3, the husband could not have been the victim, which means that he was the murderer and the brother was the victim.",,2.76,2.61
The Winning Combination,"You are in a game show with four other contestants.  The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues, and the first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no leading zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. The third set of two numbers is the same as the first set reversed.
2. There are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the combination.
3. If you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers, you will get the fourth set of numbers.
4. If you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.
5. The second set of numbers is not greater than 20.
6. The second number in the second set multiplied by the second number in the fourth set equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.
And get moving, I think another contestant has almost figured it out!","The combination is 71-19-17-68.
From the second clue, we know that there are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the sets.  Therefore, only 1's, 6's, 7's, 8's and 9's could be in the remaining spots.
Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.
11 * 4 = 44
16 * 4 = 64
17 * 4 = 68
18 * 4 = 72
19 * 4 = 76
Of these, 17 * 4 and 19 * 4 are the only ones that are possible; as the answer of the other numbers contains a number which we know is not in the combination.
Now we skip all the way to clue 5, which tells us the second set of numbers is not greater than 20.  This means that the first digit of that set is also a 1.
So far, we know this much:
??-1?-1?-??
Now, we can come to clue 4, which tells us if you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.  The first number in the second set is 1, so the first number in the first set must be 7.  Since the first clue tells us the first set is the third set reversed, and we know that a 1 is the first number in the third set, a 1 must be the second number in the first set and a 7 must be the second number in the third set.
So far, we know this much:
71-1?-17-??
Now, the third set (17) multiplied by 4 will get us 68.  Now we know the fourth set is 68.
71-1?-17-68
Now we come to the final clue.  This tells us the second number in the second set (unknown) multiplied by the second number in the fourth set (8) equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.  We know that the first set is 71, so adding one to that (72) and then dividing it by 8 will get us 9.  So, the finished combination is:
71-19-17-68",,2.76,2.35
Who Stole What?,"Sherlock Holmes sat opposite Inspector Lestrade in Lestrade's office at Scotland Yard. Sergeant Smith entered the room with three prisoners, who stood in line in front of Lestrade's desk. Holmes watched with interest as Lestrade interrogated the three men. Barnett stood between the man who was clean-shaven and the man who stole the cigar case. Black, who had stolen the wallet, had been arrested at the same time as Wetherby. It was the man with the mustache, not the one with the beard, who had stolen the gold watch.

Dr. Contrary's Pointy End,"Try to close your eyes and picture this in your mind (once you have read through it, of course!).
You are standing in front of a solid metal table.  Dr. Contrary places a one-hundred dollar bill in the middle of the table.  While you watch, he turns a large metal pyramid upside down and perfectly balances its point in the middle of the one-hundred dollar bill so the pyramid is balancing on that single point.  He shows you very clearly that there is nothing holding up the pyramid other than gravity.
Dr. Contrary turns to you and asks, ""Can you remove the one-hundred dollar bill in such a way that you do not disturb the upside-down pyramid?  You may not touch or move the pyramid, you cannot prop it up or lift it off the table, it cannot fall over, and you are not allowed to cut or tear the dollar bill.""  He eyeballs you and waits patiently for your response.
Can you solve Dr. Contrary's puzzle?","Light the one-hundred dollar bill on fire.  It may be painful to see some nice spending money go up in smoke, but burning the bill will successfully remove it without disturbing the overturned pyramid.
There may be semantics to be quibbled over, such as the definition of ""touch"", whether you are removing/destroying/changing the composition the dollar bill, whether there may be some small portion of the dollar bill remaining, and even the legality of the action.  However, the true purpose of this puzzle is to find the reader's ""flash of insight"" to realize that burning it is an option.  It is very unlikely that someone would come up with the solution through brute force itemized thinking.",No one said anything about keeping the one-hundred dollar bill!,2.76,2.03

"The Total is 14, Part II","Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by their ability to solve logic puzzles.  He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
They each opened their envelope and inspected their numbers.  Snap said, ""I know that Crackle and Pop each have a different number.""
Crackle replies, ""I already knew that all three of our numbers were different.""
Pop says, ""Now I know what all three of our numbers are.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class to ask if anyone else knows the numbers.  Only Gretchen raises her hand, and she correctly identifies what each person is holding.  How did she know?","Snap's statement implies that his number is odd.  Crackle's statement implies that not only is his number odd, but it is also greater than or equal to 7.  There are only six combinations that satisfy these conditions.  Namely, for (Snap, Crackle, Pop) they are:
(1, 7, 6)
(1, 9, 4)
(1, 11, 2)
(3, 7, 4)
(3, 9, 2)
(5, 7, 2)
Since Pop can reason perfectly, he knows these are the possible combinations.  In order for him to know the other two, he must be holding a 6, since he knew the solution had to be unique.  Therefore, Snap has a 1, Crackle has a 7, and Pop has a 6.

The Victim,"One of four people - two men (Jack and Mike) and two women (Carol and Lily) - was murdered.

(b) Mike's sister argued twice with the victim's legal spouse after the murder. Who was the victim?","Mike is the victim.
If Mike's sister and Jack's sister are the same person, then (a) reads ""Lily argued exactly once with (Mike or Jack)"" and (b) reads ""Lily argued twice with (the same Mike or Jack)"".  These two statements contradict each other.  Therefore Mike's sister must be different from Jack's sister.
If this is the case then there are two possibilities:
1)  Jack and Carol are brother and sister.  Mike and Lily are brother and sister.  Jack is married to Lily and Mike is married to Carol.  If this is the case, then (a) reads ""Carol argued once with Mike"" and (b) reads ""Lily argued twice with herself"", leaving Jack dead.  Since Lily did not likely argue with herself, this is not the solution.
2)  Jack and Lily are brother and sister.  Mike and Carol are brother and sister.  Jack is married to Carol and Lily is married to Mike.

In the second race, Larry beats Curly by exactly 10 meters.
If they run at the exact same speeds as they did in their previous races (and their speed is constant over the entire course of the race), by what distance should Moe beat Curly when they race?","19 meters.
Instead of thinking about the distance one finishes ahead another, think of the total distance each racer covers.  In the time it takes Moe to run 100 meters, Larry runs 90 meters, so his pace must be 90% of Moe's.  In the time it takes Larry to run 100 meters, Curly runs 90 meters, so his pace is 90% of Larry's.  Combining these two facts, we find that Curly's pace is 90% of (90% of Moe's), which is 81% of Moe's.

The Troll Bridge 2,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote thirteen pairs of letters on a rock:
A-V
B-W
C-Q
D-M
E-K
F-U
G-N
H-P
I-O
J-R
L-X
S-T
Y-Z
""These thirteen pairs consist of all 26 letters of the alphabet,"" said the troll. ""The password contains thirteen letters, no two of which are the same. Each pair consists of one letter that is in the password and one other letter. If you wrote out the ""other"" letters in alphabetical order and then wrote each ""password"" letter under each one's corresponding ""other"" letter, you would have the correct spelling of the password.""
Then the troll wrote five short words on the rock: FACE, QUEST, QUICK, SWITCH, and WORLD. ""Each short word contains exactly the same number of letters with the password,"" he said.
So, what is the password?","The password is UNPREDICTABLY.
Exactly one of S and T must be in the password. So QUEST, and so each word, must have at least one letter in common with the password.
Suppose each word has one common letter . Then none of Q, U, and E can be in the word, so C, F, and K must be in the word. But now FACE has at least two letters in common.
Suppose each word has two common letters. The second common letter in QUEST cannot be Q. Suppose it is U. Then C and K must be in the password and F cannot. But now QUICK has at least three common letters.
Suppose the second common letter in QUEST is E. Then C and F must be in the password and K cannot. But now FACE has at least three common letters.
Suppose each word has four common letters. Then Q, U, and E must be in the password, and C, F, and K cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So each word has three common letters. The second and third common letters in QUEST cannot be Q and E. Suppose they are Q and U. Then K must be in the password, and C and F cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So the second and third common letters in QUEST must be U and E. Then C must be in the password, and F and K cannot. The third common letter in FACE must be A, so V cannot. The third common letter in QUICK must be I, so O cannot.
Like QUEST, SWITCH contains both S and T. I and C are in the password, so W and H cannot. Since neither W nor O can be in the password, the three common letters in WORLD must be R, L, and D, so J, X, and M cannot.
Writing each determined ""other"" letter in alphabetical order, and writing each ""password"" letter under its corresponding ""other"" letter, we get:
F H J K M O Q V W X
U P R E D  I  C A B L
The pairs S-T and Y-Z can each only be placed in one spot here:
F H J K M O Q S V W X Y
U P R E D  I  C T A B L Z

Home For Christmas,"It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

Toddlers and Teddies,"At the local play group for babies and toddlers, I was asking the mothers about the number of teddies each of their children has. The four children are aged 1, 2, 3 and 4. Remarkably, the children have one, two, three and four teddies, although not necessarily respectively. James has more teddies than his age. John is older than Matthew. Curiously only one child has the same number of teddies as his age. Paul has less teddies than John, and the child aged 3 has two teddies. Paul is the youngest.

A Misinformed Liar Tells No Lies,"Three friends, Allie, Kaleb, and Leah have 3 different actions whenever they come across potentially new information.
The first is a Scientist, they are always correct about which statements are true and will always tell the truth.
The second is a Psychologist, they like to test people by lying and seeing their reactions, however they are misinformed. This means that they will receive a false statement, think it is true, and lie about it.
The last is a Lapidary, they will always try to tell the truth, but they are also misinformed.
They receive information (or misinformation) about each other's behaviors and make the following statements:
Kaleb: Leah is misinformed
Allie: I am not misinformed
Leah: Allie is the Psychologist
Who is who?","Allie is the Scientist.

Leah is the Lapidary.
Allie cannot be the Psychologist because the Psychologist would say they were misinformed.
Leah cannot be the Scientist because Allie isn't the Psychologist.
Kaleb cannot be the Lapidary because Leah is misinformed and the Lapidary would think Leah isn't misinformed and say that.
This leaves the scenarios:
Kaleb Scientist
Allie Lapidary
Leah Psychologist
and
Kaleb Psychologist
Allie Scientist
Leah Lapidary
Since the Psychologist cannot say someone else is the Psychologist (That would mean there's more than 1), the answer must be:
Allie is the Scientist.
Kaleb is the Psychologist.
Leah is the Lapidary.",The Psychologist ends up telling the truth and the Lapidary ends up lying.,2.72,2.16

Lazy Daughter,"A wealthy wise old woman feared that her daughter was lazy and, as a result, rather stupid. When the old woman died, her will stipulated that her assets were to be liquidated and a check was to be written for the full amount. The check was to be placed in one of three envelopes. The other two envelopes would contain a blank piece of paper. If the daughter could determine from the writing on the envelope which envelope contained the check, she would inherit her mother's fortune. Otherwise, the fortune would go to the old woman's favorite charity for animals. The daughter was not allowed to touch the envelopes. Her decision had to be made based on the writing on the envelopes. The daughter was told that only one envelope had a true statement and that the other two statements were false.
The envelopes had the following writing:
1. This envelope does not have the check.
2. This envelope has the check.
3. The second envelope does not have the check.
Which envelope should the daughter pick?","The daughter should pick envelope 1. Statements 1 and 2 were false, and the only true statement was statement 3.

Given the following clues, determine where each mammal is located.  The terms ""next to"" and ""connected together"" mean vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
1) A and D do not contain the same mammal, but one of them has a dog.
2) E and O do not contain the same mammal, but one of them has a horse.
3) B and L contain the same mammal, but not a tiger.
4) C and M contain the same mammal, but not a beaver.
5) F, K, N, and P are four different mammals.
6) The tigers are in different columns.
7) The goats are located in two of the following locations: B, C, K, and O.
8) The lions are located in two of the following locations: A, E, F, and M.
9) Cats don't get along with dogs, so neither cat is next to a dog.
10) Tigers have goats on their menu, so each tiger must be next to at least one goat and each goat must be next to at least one tiger.
11) The beavers and walruses live on the same body of water, so all four must be connected together in some fashion.","A = lion, B = cat, C = walrus, D = dog

The Murder in the Dressing Room,"Heather, a performer in a play, was sadistically murdered in her dressing room by one of the other four actors: Edgar, Frank, George, and Hans. Each actor had his or her own dressing room; rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5:
Room 1 is small and borders rooms 2 and 4.
Room 2 is large and borders rooms 1, 3, 4, and 5.
Room 3 is large and borders rooms 2 and 5.
Room 4 is large and borders rooms 1, 2, and 5.
Room 5 is small and borders rooms 2, 3, and 4.
Here are some facts:
1. The murderer's room and Heather's room border the same number of rooms.
2. Heather's room borders Edgar's room and Frank's room.
3. George's room and Hans's room are the same size.
4. Frank's room does not border George's room.
Who killed Heather?","Edgar murdered Heather.
From fact 1, Heather couldn't be in room 2, and from fact 4, neither Frank nor George could be in room 2. This leaves only Edgar and Hans.
Suppose Edgar was in room 2. From fact 3, George and Hans are either in rooms 1 and 5 in some order, or in rooms 3 and 4 in some order. The same will be true for Heather and Frank. But in either case, Heather's room does not border Frank's room, contradicting fact 2. So Hans must be in room 2.
From fact 3, George is in either room 3 or in room 4. If George is in room 4, this leaves rooms 1, 3, and 5 for Heather, Edgar, and Frank. But room 1 does not border either of the other two rooms, so this contradicts fact 2 and George must be in room 4.
Now we need to put Heather, Edgar, and Frank in there respective rooms. We are left with rooms 1, 4, and 5, room 4 being the only one that borders each of the other two, so Heather must go there. From fact 4, Edgar must be in room 5 and Frank in room 1. And from fact 1, Edgar murdered Heather.",,2.7,2.21
The President of Logitopia,"Larry, Matt, and Nick live in the strange country of Logitopia. This country is inhabited by three races of people: the type A people who always tell the truth, the type B people who always lie, and the type C people who alternately tell the truth and lie. One of the three is the president of Logitopia.
Larry makes these two statements:
1. ""The president is of a different race from the other two.""
2. ""Matt is not the president.""
Matt makes these two statements:
1. ""The president is a type B person.""
2. ""Larry is not the president.""
Nick makes these two statements:
1. ""Exactly two of us are of the same race.""
2. ""I am not the president.""
Who is the president?","Larry is president.
Suppose Matt's first statement is true. This would mean that he is not a type B person, and Larry's second statement is true. This would mean that Larry is not a type B person, and Matt's second statement is true. Since neither Larry nor Matt is the president, Nick must be president, making both his statements false. Since Nick's first statement is false, and since he's a type B person while Matt is a type A person, Larry must be a type C person, making his first statement false. But since the president belongs to a different race from each of the other two, Larry's first statement must be true. This means that Matt's first statement is false.
Suppose Matt is president. This would mean that Larry's second statement is false and Matt's and Nick's second statements are true. Then, since Matt is both the president and a type C person, and since Larry must also be a type C person if his first statement is true (which would make his first statement false), Larry's first statement must be false, making him a type B person. Then if Nick's first statement is true, he is a type A person, which means that all three are different races and makes Nick's first statement false, but if his first statement is false, he is a type C person, which means that he and Matt both belong to a race that Larry does not and makes Nick's first statement true. So Matt cannot be president.
Suppose Nick is president. This would mean that Larry's and Matt's second statements are both true, but Nick's is false. Then, since Matt's first statement and Nick's second statement are both false, Nick's first statement must be true. Then, since Matt and Nick are both type C people, Larry's first statement must be false and all three must be type C people, making Nick's first statement...false.

When Mr. Puzzle arrived home one evening last week, his wife had left him in a bit of a dilemma. They have three bedrooms and they used them all from time to time. On each door Mrs. Puzzle had placed a sign and also another sign stating that only one of the three other statements was true and that was where Mrs. Puzzle was sleeping for that night. Of the other two rooms, one was empty and the other had the neighbours' highly strung Pit Bull Terrier - Bruty inside. Mr. Puzzle was very confused, having consumed a few too many that very evening and he stared blankly at each door.
Sign on Bedroom 1. Bedroom 3 is empty
Sign on Bedroom 2. Bruty is in here
Sign on Bedroom 3. Bedroom 2 is empty
Behind which door is his wife, where is the dog and which room is empty?","Bedroom 1. Dog
Bedroom 2. Empty
Bedroom 3. Wife
If the sign on Bedroom 1 were true this would mean the wife must be in Bedroom 1, but then Bedroom 3 would have to be empty and therefore Bruty would have to be in Bedroom 2. This would mean 2 true signs, so is incorrect.
The sign on Bedroom 2 must be incorrect, as if it were true Bruty would be in here, however, only the Bedroom sign where the wife is sleeping, is true. Therefore, this is incorrect too.
Therefore:
Bedroom 3 sign is true - So Mrs. Puzzle is in here.
Bedroom 2 sign is a lie - So Bruty, the dog, must be in Bedroom 1, and this room must be empty.
Bedroom 1  sign is a lie  - Mrs Puzzle is in Bedroom 3",,2.7,1.85

Bob said: ""I have played 4 matches.""
How many matches had Bub played?","Since Bob had played 4 matches, he must have played against all 4 other players, i.e. Bab, Beb, Bib, and Bub.
The only match that Bab had played must have been against Bob.
Bib had played 3 matches, and he couldn't have played against Bab. Hence, Bib had played against Beb, Bob and Bub.
Beb had played against Bib and Bob, so he couldn't have played against Bab or Bub.

1. There is an O in the very middle (2,2).
2. There are three X's surrounding the middle square (not including diagonals).
3. There are 4 X's and 5 O's on the board.
4. The bottom right square (3,3) contains an X.
5. There is not an X on the bottom row in the middle (2,3).","The board should look like this.
O X O
X O X
O O X
After the first clue, all you know is that O is in the middle.
? ? ?
? O ?
? ? ?
At this point, clues 2 and 3 are useless.
Clue 4 says that the bottom right square contains an X.
Now your board should look like this:
? ? ?
? O ?
? ? X
Clue 5 says there is no X at 2,3.
The board should look like this:
? ? ?
? O ?
? O X
Now you can come back to clue 2.
Since there are three X's surrounding the middle square (no diagonals, the X's must go in these three places:
? X ?
X O X
? O X
Clue 3 says that there are only 4 X's on the board - there are 4 X's on the board at that point so the rest must be O's.
O X O
X O X
O O X

Competitive Clowns,"Many contestants entered the unicycle race, but only the best multi-tasking clown came out on top, considering that each had to juggle clubs while trying to win the race! Most of the pack were soon disqualified after dropping a club or falling off the unicycle. In the end, four of the best clowns crossed the finish line.

Surnames: Turner, Pettle, Vertigo, Wheeley
Colors: Green, Orange, Silver, Red
1. Mr. Turner (who isn't Matt) finished one place ahead of the red club juggler.
2. The four are Leon, Mr. Vertigo, the one who juggled with orange clubs, and the one who came in third place.
3. Kyle finished behind (but not one place behind) Mr. Wheeley.
4. Matt and Mr. Pettle finished consecutively, in some order.
5. The one who juggled with green clubs finished two places behind Jake.","1st Place - Leon Wheeley - Silver
2nd Place - Jake Turner - Orange
3rd Place - Kyle Pettle - Red
4th Place - Matt Vertigo - Green
The third place finisher wasn't Vertigo (clue 2) or Wheeley (clue 3), so he is Pettle or Turner.
Since Matt is neither Turner (clue 1) nor Pettle (clue 4), he didn't finish third.
The one who came in third wasn't Leon (clue 2) or Jake (clue 5), so he is Kyle.
By clue 3, Wheeley came in first.
Since neither Turner (clue 1) nor Pettle (clue 4) finished fourth, Vertigo did.
Vertigo isn't Leon (clue 2) or Jake (clue 5), so he's Matt.
By clue 4, Kyle is Pettle.
By elimination, Turner finished second.
By clue 1, the one with the red clubs finished third.
Since Jake finished two places ahead of the one who had the green clubs (clue 5), Jake finished second and Matt used the green clubs.

"The Total is 14, Part III","Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
Manny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, ""I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.""
Moe answers, ""IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.""
Jack thinks for a bit, and then says, ""Now I know all of our numbers.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.
What numbers does she say they each are holding?","Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.
From Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.
There are 12 triples for (Manny, Moe, Jack) that satisfy all three statements. They are:
(1, 2, 11)
(1, 6, 7)
(1, 10, 3)
(3, 2, 9)
(3, 6, 5)
(3, 10, 1)
(5, 2, 7)
(5, 6, 3)
(7, 2, 5)
(7, 6, 1)
(9, 2, 3)
(11, 2, 1)
Since Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.
Mr. Simkin suggests to Gretchen that she may have a career in law enforcement if she can further hone these impressive deductive reasoning skills.",,2.7,2.7

No guy/guy or girl/girl in Love Island.
Who loves Joseph and whom does Joseph love?","Linda loves Joseph, and Joseph loves Amy.
An 8 person loop may be represented as follows:
M1 > G1 > M2 > G2 > M3 > G3 > M4 > G4 >
From second paragraph:
Line 1: Peter > G > Albert > G >
Line 2: Joseph > G > M > Elaine >
Line 3: Paolo > G > M > Liza >
Line 4: Linda hates Paolo and is hated by the man Amy loves.
Step One: Assume Peter is M1. (Peter can be M2 or M3 or M4 with the same result.)
Peter > G1 > Albert > G2 > M3 > G3 > M4 > G4 >
Step Two: Elaine is two persons removed from Joseph (from Line 2) so either:
#A Peter > G1 > Albert > G2 > Joseph > G3 > M4 > Elaine >
#B Peter > Elaine > Albert > G2 > M3 > G3 > Joseph > G4 >
Step Three: In each case, the unknown male must be Paolo.
#A Peter > G1 > Albert > G2 > Joseph > G3 > Paolo > Elaine >
#B Peter > Elaine > Albert > G2 > Paolo > G3 > Joseph > G4 >
Step Four: Liza is two persons removed from Paolo (from Line 3).
#A Peter > Liza > Albert > G2 > Joseph > G3 > Paolo > Elaine >
#B Peter > Elaine > Albert > G2 > Paolo > G3 > Joseph > Liza >
Step Five: Linda hates Paolo (from Line 4), so:
In #A, she can't be G3 and must be G2.
In #B, she can't be G2 and must be G3.
#A Peter > Liza > Albert > Linda > Joseph > G3 > Paolo > Elaine >
#B Peter > Elaine > Albert > G2 > Paolo > Linda > Joseph > Liza >
Step Six: In each case, the unknown female must be Amy.
#A Peter > Liza > Albert > Linda > Joseph > Amy > Paolo > Elaine >
#B Peter > Elaine > Albert > Amy > Paolo > Linda > Joseph > Liza >
Step Seven: Linda is hated by the man whom Amy loves (from line 4).
Thus, #B does not work so the solution is #A.
Peter > Liza > Albert > Linda > Joseph > Amy > Paolo > Elaine >",,2.68,2.7
Double the Contrary,"Lucy and Lory are sisters. They are special. They usually tell the truth in all cases, but when recalling something her sister has said, then they twist it a little bit.
For instance, when referring to something Lory had said, Lucy always says quite the contrary: ""Lucy, look, the sky is beautiful."" ""Did you say the sky is ugly?"".
In Lory's case, when referring so something Lucy said, She always doubles any quantity that appears in the sentence: "" Hey, Lory, I found two flowers."" ""Mom, Lucy says she found four flowers"".
Some day they were talking about a friend of theirs and mom came by. She heard this:
- As you say, Jorge is the younger brother.
- But you said his brother was 20 years younger.
- No, it was you who said that his brother was three times Jorge's age.
- Well, that is not important. The important thing is that, as you said, Jorge is 30 years old.
What are Jorge's and his brother's ages?","Jorge is 15 years old, and his brother is 5 years old.
Lucy is the one that talks first, so Jorge is the older, not the younger.
Then Lory talked, so Jorge's brother is 10 years younger, not 20.
Again Lucy, so it was Jorge who was 3 times his brother's age.
And last, Lory says that Jorge is 30 years, meaning 15 is the actual age.
So, Jorge is 15, his brother 15-10 = 5, and Jorge is 3 times as old as his brother (3*5=15).",Looks like Lucy talked first.,2.68,1.72

Daughters and Sons,"A mother and her friend are talking about how many children they have. The friend knows how many daughters the mother has, but doesn't know how many sons she has. The mother says:
""All of my children have the same amount of brothers and the same amount of sisters as the other children.""
Now the friend knew how many sons she had. How many sons did the mother have?","The mother says that her children all have the same amount of brothers and same amount of sisters as each other. If B is the number of sons and G the number of daughters, then each boy has B-1 brothers and G sisters, and each girl has G-1 sisters and B brothers.
For any combination of brothers and sisters to fit into that rule, there must be either no sons or no daughters, because if there were some of each the sons would have more sisters than the daughters, and vice versa.
If the friend knows the mother has no daughters, the statement does not help her know how many sons there are, as there could be any number.
The friend knows the value of G, and if it was any number other than 0 (which it definitely is), the number of sons would have to be 0.","We don't have to know the number of daughters - all that's needed is the mother's statement, and the fact that the friend knows the number of daughters.",2.68,1.74
Bad Dream,"Two brothers were watching a horror film on video late one night. One brother dozed off and dreamed that he was being chased by the crazy man from the movie, who was trying to kill him. In the dream, he hid in a cupboard. There was no sound except his heart pounding, and he had no idea where his crazed captor was. He was terrified! At that moment, the video finished, and his brother put his hand on the shoulder of his sleeping sibling to wake him. The shock at that tense moment was enough that the sleeping brother suffered a massive heart attack and died instantly.
Did this really happen?","Of course it's not true! If he died instantly, how would anyone know what his dream was about?",,2.68,1.63
Wacky Wakkey,"In a land far, far away, called Wakkey, there are 4 rulers who rule 4 different lands, wear 4 different crowns with 4 different populations.
Rulers: King Ray, King Ross, Queen Rose, Queen Rosa
Lands: Bang, Boom, Bam, Buzz
Crowns: Gold, Diamond, Silver, Bronze
Populations: 1000, 800, 300, 200
Figure out who owns what land, wears which crown and rules what population.
Clues:
1. The ruler with the lowest population wears the silver crown.
2. Queen Rosa is ruler of Bang.
3. King Ray does not rule and has a hatred towards Buzz.
4. King Ross frequently boasts he rules the highest population.
5. No king, as both dislike bronze, wears that crown.
6. Queen Rose does not rule Bam.
7. Queen Rosa rules a population higher than 300.
8. King Ross owns Buzz.
9. King Ray cannot afford and thus does not wear the diamond crown.
10. Queen Rose is fairly wealthy and wears the gold crown.
11. King Ross does not rule Bam.
12. Boom has a population of 300.","King Ray is the ruler of Bam, wears the silver crown and rules a population of 200.
King Ross is the ruler of Buzz, wears the diamond crown and rules a population of 1000.
Queen Rose is the ruler of Boom, wears the gold crown and rules a population of 300.
Queen Rosa is the ruler of Bang, wears the bronze crown and rules a population of 800.
Explanation (making a chart would be helpful):
Clue 1: We know what it states and will keep this in mind.
Clue 2: Tells us Queen Rosa owns Bang, so we mark that down.
Clue 3: Tells us King Ray does not rule Buzz and neither can Queen Rosa, so King Ross or Queen Rose must own Buzz.
Clue 4: Tells us King Ross rules the highest population, 1000, so we mark that down.  (This narrows the hint in clue 1 to the three remaining rulers.)
Clue 5: Tells us no king wears the bronze crown, so it must be either Queen Rose or Queen Rosa.
Clue 6: Tells us Queen Rose does not rule Bam.  (Now we know that one of the kings owns Bam, and either King Ross or Queen Rose owns Buzz from the info given in clue 3.)
Clue 7: Tells us Queen Rosa rules a population higher than 300 - in other words, rules a population of 800 since 1000 is ruled already.
Clue 8: Tells us King Ross owns Buzz, so we mark that down.  This also means that Queen Rose MUST own Boom since it is the only land left.
Clue 9: Tells us King Ray does not wear the diamond crown, so we mark that down.
Clue 10: Tells us Queen Rose wears the gold crown, so we mark that down.  This also means that, since Queen Rose wears the gold, Queen Rosa MUST be wearing the bronze because as it states in clue 5, no king wears the bronze.  Also tells us that King Ray must wear the silver crown, as he cannot wear the gold, bronze, or diamond crowns (Clues 5, 9, 10).  Therefore, King Ross wears the diamond crown.
Clue 11: Tells us King Ross does not rule Bam, so King Ray MUST rule Bam because he does not rule Buzz as said in clue 3, and Queen Rose does not rule Bam as said in clue 6 - that is marked down.
Clue 12: Tells us Boom has a population of 300, so that is marked down.  This means that, since the only population left is 100, and from what it says in clue 1, King Ray rules the 100.",,2.68,2.04
Dellzup,"Harry was on holiday last year on the island of Dellzup. Dellzup has a really peculiar shape for an island. It's rectangular, 20 miles long and only 15 feet wide, and is totally covered in trees! It has two tiny villages on it, Start and End. Unfortunately, a fire has begun at Start and is travelling toward End at around 1 mile per hour. There is also a wind which is blowing towards End at around 2 miles per hour. Now Harry, who is at End, has no way of getting off the island: he cannot pass through the fire, he cannot put the fire out, and there is no one to help him. How can he save himself?","The simplest method is to light a new fire about 1 mile from End. This fire will burn toward End (because of the wind) and when it reaches End, it will go out.

Jacks and Aces,"A man has 3 cards face down on a table.  One is a jack and two are aces.  He knows the order but you do not.  You can ask him one yes or no question, but when you do, you have to point to one of the cards.  If you point to an ace, he will tell the truth, if you point to the jack, he will randomly say yes or no.  You have to find one of the aces.","Point to the middle card and say,  ""Is the card to the right an ace?""  If the answer is yes, then the card on the right is an ace. If the answer is no, the card on the left is an ace.  This solution works because if you're pointing to an ace then he's obviously telling the truth and if you're pointing to the jack the answer doesn't matter anyway because you will pick one of the other two which are both aces.","Yes, there is always a chance you will be pointing to the jack, and that the answer will be meaningless (just a random yes/no) but there is a way to work around it.

Breaking Codes,"You are a spy trying to gain access to a high profile building that contains very classified information. The only thing standing between you and those secrets is a keypunch security system containing the digits 1-9 that will open the door to the building. Your spy agency has provided you details about the order of the keys you need to enter:
1. Each digit is pressed once and only once.
2. No two consecutive digits are pressed consecutively.
3. The digits 2 and 4 are pressed 2nd and 4th in some order; the digits 6 and 8 are pressed 6th and 8th in some order.
4. The sum of the first 5 digits pressed is 19; the sum of the last 5 digits pressed is 27.
As you wonder why your agency couldn't just write down the sequence for you, you crack the code and enter the building.
What sequence of keys did you press on the security system to get into the building?","5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 3, 6, 9
From  clue 4, the sum of the first 4 digits to be pressed, the last 4 digits to be pressed, and two times the 5th digit to be pressed is 19 + 27 = 46. The sum of the first and last 4 digits to be pressed and the 5th digit must be the sum of the digits 1-9, from clue 1. This sum is 45, meaning the 5th digit is 46-45 = 1.
From clues 2 and 3, 2 must be the 2nd digit and 4 must be the 4th digit.
From clue 3, 7 must be the 1st or 3rd digit pressed since it can not be pressed before or after the 6 or 8. From clue 4, this means 5 must be pressed 1st or 3rd. But, from clue 2, it can not be the 3rd digit, so it must be the first, meaning 7 is the 3rd digit pressed.
That leaves 3, 6, 8, and 9 as the last 4 digits to be pressed. If 8 were pressed 8th, then the 9 must be pressed 6th, a contradiction with clue 4. So 8 must be pressed 6th meaning 9 is to be pressed last. This leaves 6 to be entered 8th and 3 to be entered 7th.",You can figure out the 5th digit to enter from clue 4 and some algebra.,2.67,2.34

World War II Fighter Planes,"You are the Head Researcher working on improving the survival rate* of the WW2 Alliance Force's fighter planes.
In those days, fighter planes are on single propeller engines.  Your task is to collect statistics on the number of bullet holes on fighter planes that just returned from their missions, and use this statistics as a basis to recommend improvement to the design of the fighter planes.
After studying 10,000 planes that returned from the battle field, you discovered that A)60% of the bullet holes are found at the wings of the airplane, B)39% around the cockpit area and only C)1% on the engine area.
Your immediate duty is to use this information to recommend which area (A, B or C) to increase armor plating.  You could only increase the armor plating on 1 area instead of all because additional armor plating affects the agility of the fighter plane.
Justify your rationale for your choice of section (linking to the % of bullet holes found).
* Survival rate is determined by whether the plane return safely to ground.","Section C - the engine area.
On the surface, the engine area seemingly received the least bullet hits (1%) and should not be warranted additional protection.  However, this is not true because majority of planes that suffered engine hits have not survived to return from battleground.  So there are very few planes contributing to the count on engine hits.  On the other hand, the fact that there are many hits on wings and cockpit area and yet many of these planes still returned safely show that these 2 areas are not the most critical area.
Since you could only add armor plate to 1 area - increasing armor plating to the engine area will be most viable in improving the survival rate of the planes.",This is based on real statistical methodology.,2.67,1.75

The way we can determine this is by looking at Andrew's statement. If he's lying, he's the shortest, and Keith is shorter than him. This is impossible because no one can be shorter than the shortest. Andrew and Keith must be telling the truth. That means Carlos is the third tallest, so he isn't lying. That means Danny is lying and is the shortest.

There are three possible scenarios:
1) If Miss Maryland and Miss Nevada are in the same column then Miss Maryland would be taller, because she is the tallest in that column.
2)If Miss Maryland and Miss Nevada are in the same row then Miss Maryland would be taller, because Miss Nevada is the shortest in that row.
3)If Miss Maryland and Miss Nevada share neither a row nor column then there must be some other contestant who is both in Miss Maryland's column and Miss Nevada's row. Call this woman Miss Texas.

One Hundred People at a Party,"Exactly one hundred people were at a party. Each either always tells the truth or always lies.  After the party, one of the one hundred people said, ""I shook hands with exactly one truthteller at the party."" Another person says, ""I shook hands with two truthtellers,"" and a third says, ""I shook hands with three."" And so on until someone says, ""I shook hands with 99 truthtellers."" The hundredth and final person says, ""I shook hands with no truthtellers at all!"" How many truthtellers were at the party?","There was only one truthteller.
Let the person who said he shook hands with one truthteller be Mr. One, the one who said he shook hands with two truthtellers be Mr. Two, and so on.
Suppose Mr. Ninety-Nine is a truthteller. This means the others are all truthtellers and he shook hands with them all. But if Mr. Zero and Mr. Ninety-Nine are both truthtellers, Mr. Zero would not have shaken hands with Mr. Ninety-Nine. So Mr. Ninety-Nine must be a liar.
Suppose Mr. Ninety-Eight is a truthteller. This means he shook hands with everyone else except Mr. Ninety-Nine. But if Mr. Zero and Mr. Ninety-Eight are both truthtellers, then Mr. Zero would not have shaken hands with Mr. Ninety-Eight. So Mr. Ninety-Eight must also be a liar.
Using similar logic, we can determine that everyone between Mr. Ninety-Seven and Mr. One is a liar.
What about Mr. Zero? Since everyone else was a liar, he really did not shake hands with any truthtellers. Therefore, Mr. Zero is the only truthteller.",,2.66,2.06

Dog Dilemma,"Shalom had parked his car under a tree and was heading toward the suspect's house when a vicious dog lunged at him. Luckily for Shalom he was just beyond the dog's reach. Since the suspect wasn't home, Shalom decided to leave, but he had a slight problem. The dog, straining at the end of his chain, was following Shalom's every move. With the chain attached to the tree, the dog had access to both car doors.

Ferry Routes,"XYZ Ferries, in a move to enter the profitable Mediterranean tourism industry, has just opened new stops and routes at Caligari, Monaco, Civitavecchia, and Palermo. There are two routes between Caligari and Monaco, two routes between Palermo and Caligari, a route between Civitavecchia and Monaco, a route between Civitavecchia and Caligari, and a route between Civitavecchia and Palermo.
To promote these ferry routes, XYZ Ferries has decided to make the first ride on one single route free for each person. When a friend hears about the promotions, he bets that you cannot ride every single ferry route without paying a single euro or using another mode of transportation. After mulling it over, you determine that it would be impossible to win the bet. You offer to accept the bet if you could theoretically create another ferry route. He claims that would be too easy and forces you to start in Monaco and end in Caligari. You accept the bet knowing that you will win. Where would you put this new route?","You add another route from Civitavecchia to Palermo, and your astonished friend gives you the money and listens to your explanation.
First, you simplify everything into a graph. The graph has vertices, or ports, and edges, or the ferry routes. You give each vertex a degree, or the number of edges that lead to the vertex. Using this information, you deduce that a path that visits every edge in a graph needs an edge in and an edge out, expect for the start and finish, which only need one edge. Therefore, you conclude that all points expect for the start and finish need an even numbered degree in order for the path to finish. In this problem, you only need to make Civitavecchia and Palermo have an even number of edges leading to them. The two vertices already have three edges each leading to them, so you just add a fourth edge between the two cities to make the degree number even and complete the bet.",Draw out the ferry lines and their ports. All other geographical information is irrelevant.,2.66,1.77
The Troll Bridge 5,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
Three travelers came across the bridge. The troll told them, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He wrote six three-letter words on a rock. The six words were INN, PEN, PET, PIE, TEE, and TIE.
He then said, ""I will tell each of you a different letter from the password. If you know what the password is, I will let you pass. But don't tell anyone else your letter."" He then whispered a letter from the password to each traveler so that neither of the other two could hear him.
A minute later, the troll asked all three travelers at the same time, ""Do you know how many vowels are in the password?"" ""No,"" they all said.
A minute later, the troll asked all three travelers at the same time, ""Now do you know how many vowels are in the password?"" ""No"", they said again.
A minute later, the troll asked only one of the three travelers, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said the traveler, and the troll let all three of them pass.
So, what is the password?","The password is PET.
The six words have only five letters between them: E, I, N, P, and T. INN and PEN, both of which contain one vowel, are the only two of the six words to contain N. When all three travelers responded ""no"" to the troll's first answer, they knew that none of them had been told N. So the password cannot be INN or PEN.
Of the four remaining words, PIE and TIE, which both contain two vowels, are the only two containing I. When all three travelers answered ""no"" to the troll's second question, they knew that none of them had been told I, and that the password cannot be PIE or TIE.
This leaves only PET and TEE. Although both words contain both E and T, PET is the only one of the two words containing P. The traveler who answered ""yes"" to the troll's third question must have been told P.",,2.66,2.11

1. The tallest of the four is facing the shorter person whose name starts with the letter A.

A New Twist on an Old Favourite,"Walter, Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke crossed a river in a tiny rowboat. They all started on the same side of the river. They made three trips from the starting side to the destination side, and two trips from the destination side to the starting side. Here are some facts:
1. On each trip from the starting side of the river to the destination side, two people were in the boat, but only one person rowed the boat, and that person rowed the boat for the entire trip.
2. On each return trip, only one person was in the boat.
3. Walter is the weakest of the group. He could only row the boat if no one else is in it.
4. Xavier is the second weakest of the group. He can only row the boat if he is by himself or if Yoshi, the lightest of the group, is a passenger.
5. Each man rowed the boat at least once.
Who rowed twice?","Yoshi rowed twice.
Fact 5 tells us that Walter had to row the boat at least once, but fact 3 tells us that he had to go by himself. This means he could only row the boat on a return trip, which means he rowed on at least one return trip.
The man who rowed twice could not have rowed on two trips from the starting side to the destination side, because he would have had to make a third trip by himself back to the starting side. So the man who rowed twice must have made a return trip at least once.
Now we know that if Walter made two trips, they must both have been return trips, and Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke each rowed for one of the other three trips. If Walter made only one trip, the other person who made a return trip must have been the person who rowed twice (Xavier, Yoshi, or Zeke) and that person would also have made one of the other three trips. So the three trips from the starting side to the destination side must have been rowed by Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke.
Fact 1 tells us that Xavier's trip to the destination side must have had a passenger, and fact 4 tells us that that passenger must have been Yoshi. Yoshi would have had to row back to row his trip to the destination side, or else Yoshi rowed to the destination side, then back to the start, then got rowed across by Xavier.",,2.66,2.37

Fill each of the four pools with exactly 4 liters of water.
Here are your constraints:
-You have nothing else at your disposal.
-There is no other water aside from the two 8-liter water filled jugs.
-Once water is poured into any of the 4 pools it cannot be removed from there.
-The jugs are not symmetric so you cannot measure amount by eye or judge based on shape.","It's not short but it's right - use a piece of paper and follow the steps using A, B, C and pools. Change the quantities in each as you complete each step - it is worth it to see it come out right.

Discount Coupon Shopper,"Until last week, Mandy had been putting off the purchase of four major items for her home, waiting for her town's annual bargain days. Each year, the town's four main stores (including Nickels) each send out a coupon for a different percentage discount (10%, 15%, 20%, or 30%) on the purchase of a single item. Can you find the discount that Mandy received on each of her buys, and determine from which store she purchased each item?
Given:
Discounts: 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%
Store Names: Stears, Pal-Mart, Nickels, Dullard's
Appliances: Computer, Dishwasher, Lawnmower, VCR
Clues:
1) The percentage discount Mandy received on her new computer was twice that of the item she bought at Dullard's.
2) The discount on the Stears purchase was ten percentage points lower than the one on the riding lawnmower.
3) The discount on the dishwasher wasn't 15%.
4) Pal-Mart, (which didn't issue the 30% off coupon) isn't the store at which Mandy purchased the VCR.","Stears -- Dishwasher -- 10%
Pal-Mart -- Lawnmower -- 20%
Nickels -- Computer -- 30%
Dullard's -- VCR -- 15%
**Clue #1:  According to this clue, we know that the computer discount couldn't be 10% or 15%.  By the same token, the Dullard's discount can't be 20% or 30%.  We also know that the computer wasn't bought at Dullard's.
**Clue #2:  Here we know that the discount used on the lawnmower can not be 15% because the Stears discount has to be 10 points lower.  Nor can it be 10% for the same reason.  Which means that the Stears discount can only be 20% or 10%.  The lawnmower was also not purchased at Stears.
**Clue #3:  This clue is self explanatory.  This leaves the VCR as the 15% discount.  Which in turn makes the dishwasher the 10% discount.
**Clue #4:  Pal-Mart didn't give out the 30%.  Marking this off leaves Nickels as the 30% discount holder.  The VCR was not bought at Pal-Mart.
*********We know that the Nickels discount was 30%.  The only appliances that could be purchased with the 30% discount coupon are the lawnmower and the computer.  So we can mark off the dishwasher and the VCR from Nickels.  Since we know that the VCR was purchased with the 15% discount coupon, and Stears can not be the issuer of that coupon, the VCR was not purchased at Stears.  Which leaves the VCR purchase at Dullard's, which we now know issued the 15% coupon.  Now, from clue #1, we know that the computer discount is twice that of Dullard's.  We know Dullard's is 15%, so the computer is 30%, and was purchased at Nickels.  Marking these off leaves the dishwasher at Stears and the lawnmower at Pal-Mart.  We know that the dishwasher is 10%, so we know that Stears is the 10% coupon issuer.  This leaves Pal-Mart as the 20% coupon issuer.","Make a list of one set of givens and list another set of givens that would correspond to them.  i.e (Discounts) -- (Store Names)
10% -- Stears, Pal-Mart, Nickels, Dullard's

Cross off what you know is NOT the correct answer from the clues, and when you find out a discount that fits a store name circle it, or write the information on a piece of paper in a different section to keep track.  Do the same with the other correlations that can be surmised by looking at the clues:
(Discounts) -- (Appliances)
(Store Names) -- (Appliances)

Beethoven's Wig II,"Draw a diagram of the Fantasylands to help you with this teaser...
Beethoven's Wig has been stolen again!  Instead of hiding it in a box, the enemy, who remains anonymous, has hidden it inside one of four castles.  Each castle is located in a different fantasyland and has a creature guarding its gates.

Castles: Stone, Gold, Glass, and Silver.
1.  Narnia is to the left of Lothlorien, which is to the right of the Balrog.
2.  The Stone Castle is to the right of the Wig, and is placed at either Malacandra or Lothlorien.
3.  The Giant is not at Lothlorien and is not in the same place as the wig.

World Series 2,"In Major League Baseball, the World Series is a best of seven series.  The first team to win four games is the champion.  The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.
In this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Los Angeles hosted the first two games.  The final scores of the games were:
Game 1:  4 to 3
Game 2:  6 to 5 (11 innings)
Game 3:  11 to 7
Game 4:  16 to 9
Game 5:  9 to 6 (10 innings)
Game 6:  2 to 1
Game 7:  13 to 8 (13 innings)
Which team won the World Series?","Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.  It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.
The team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.  New York scored five runs in the top of the 13th inning.
Therefore, the New York Yankees won the World Series, four games to three.",,2.65,2.35
Pass the Candy!,"A group of 9 friends have a package of 40 W&W's chocolate candies to share. They each, one at a time, take a prime number of W&W's to eat. After that, the bag is empty. Exactly four of the friends took a number of W&W's that had previously been taken by someone else. Of the group, the number of people who took exactly 5 is twice the number of people who wear glasses.
Without any regard to the order in which they were taken, what individual quantities of W&W's were taken?","Answer: 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 11
There is only one way that any number 13 or greater can be included: {2,2,2,3,3,3,5,7,13}.  This would be a valid solution, but... We know that an even number of people must have taken 5 W&W's, because it is twice the number that wear glasses.
This leaves only 5 unique primes (2,3,5,7,11) that can be involved, and we know they all are used, because there must be exactly 5 different primes (from the fourth sentence in the teaser).  And we know that 5 must be used an even number of times.
So, that gives us {2,3,5,5,7,11} requiring three more primes whose sum is 7.  Obviously, the other three must be {2,2,3}.","Even though no information is given about how many people are wearing glasses, the last statement is actually completely relevant, and in fact crucial! What does it tell you about the number of people who took 5 pieces?",2.65,2.16
Alphabet Blocks,"You have four alphabet blocks.  Each block has a different letter of the alphabet on each of its six sides.  Using these four blocks, you can spell any of the following words.  Can you figure out what six letters appear on each of the four blocks?
BODY
CRUX
JACK
JOHN
KNOW
LIFT
MANX
PUGS
QUAD
SHIM
WRIT
YELP","The first thing that you should notice is that all of the letters except V and Z appear.  Therefore each letter appears only on one block.  The letters M, A, N, and X must appear on four different blocks (so that you can spell ""MANX"").  Call them blocks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.  Block 2 (with the A) must have a letter from CRUX.  It can't be C (because then you wouldn't be able to spell JACK) or U (so you can spell QUAD), so it is R.  Block 2 must also have a letter from KNOW.  It can't be K (JACK) or W (WRIT), so it's O.  The letter H can't be on block 1 (SHIM) or block 2 or 3 (JOHN), so H is on block 4.  J is on block 1 (JOHN).  C can't be on block 1 or 2 (JACK) or block 4 (CRUX), so C is on block 3.  U is on block 1 (CRUX), and K is on block 4 (JACK).  W, then, is on block 1 (KNOW).  I isn't on block 1 or 2 (WRIT), or block 4 (SHIM), so I is on block 3.  T is on block 4 (WRIT) and S is on block 2 (SHIM).  Block 4, which we already know has H, K, T, and X, can have only two more letters:  it must have either D or Q (QUAD), and either G or P (PUGS).  But block 4 must also have a letter from YELP, which can only be P, and a letter from BODY, which can only be D.  G is on block 3 (PUGS), as is Q(QUAD).  Block 3, which already has C, G, I, N, and Q, can only have one more letter:  this sixth letter must be in both BODY and YELP, so it must be Y.  B is on block 1 (BODY).  Block 1, then, contains B, J, M, U, and W, and can have only one more letter:  this sixth letter must be in both LIFT and YELP, so it must be L.  Finally, block 2 holds E (YELP) and F (LIFT).  In summary:
Block 1:  B, J, L, M, U, W
Block 2:  A, E, F, O, R, S
Block 3:  C, G, I, N, Q, Y
Block 4:  D, H, K, P, T, X",,2.65,2.66
I Wonder!,"Find a four letter word that fits with the clues for the following puzzle. Avoid using names, words with repeated letters, or plurals of three letter words. The number in parentheses is the number of letters in the final answer. Use processes of elimination to figure this out. For example the letter T in tune is not one of the letters in the final answer so you should cross out any T's in the entire puzzle. Also (2) means that two of the letters are in the final answer. You will end up with four different letters after completing the upper part of the puzzle.

Jugs,"You've got a 4 liter jug and a 9 liter jug.

What is the fewest number of steps it takes to come up with exactly 6 liters of water?
No, you cannot pour some water into the 9 liter jug and then guess. Nor can you fill each jug up half way or something. You have to be exact. A step is defined as putting water into a jug (not emptying). For instance, filling the 4 liter jug and then pouring it into the 9 liter jug is 2 steps.","The full answer is as follows:
1. Fill up the 9 liter jug from the pool.
2. Fill up the 4 liter jug from the 9 liter jug (leaving 5 liters in the 9 liter jug).
3. Empty the 4 liter jug into the pool and fill it again from the 9 liter jug (leaving 1 liter in the 9 liter jug).
4. Empty the 4 liter jug into the pool and put the 1 liter from the 9 liter jug into the 4 liter.
5. Fill the 9 liter jug from the pool.
6. Fill up the 4 liter jug from the 9 liter jug. There was 1 liter in the 4 liter jug, so 3 liters will fill it. This leaves, in the 9 liter jug, exactly 6 liters.",It's under 10.,2.64,2.15

Lori: I was the last to get shot down.
Connor: Glebb shot down RJ.
Glebb: Connor was out before RJ.","Lori cannot be the last person standing, otherwise she'd be telling the truth that she got shot down. Lori is lying and was therefore either the first or second to get shot down. If Glebb is the last one standing, then Connor got shot down before RJ. Connor and Lori would have to be the first 2 shot down. RJ would be the last to get shot down, but then Connor would be telling the truth since Glebb is the only person left to shoot RJ. Since there is a contradiction, Glebb cannot be the last man standing; it was either RJ or Connor. It can't be RJ because then Glebb would be telling the truth that Connor did worse than RJ.

Measure 45 Minutes,"You have two ropes. Each takes exactly 60 minutes to burn. They are made of different material so even though they take the same amount of time to burn, they burn at separate rates. In addition, each rope burns inconsistently. How do you measure out exactly 45 minutes?","Take one rope and burn it at both ends.
At the same time, burn one end of the
other rope. When the first rope finishes
burning (ie. 30 minutes), light the other
end of the remaining rope (half of the

So he decided to ask the three guards, each of whom guarded one type of coin, how many coins were in his charge. However, the guards were uncooperative, and the best that Scatterbrain could get from each was a statement about the numbers of coins in the other two vaults. Dimwit, who was guarding the gold, said there were 3000 silver and 5000 bronze coins; Thickplank, who was in charge of the silver, said there were 3000 gold and 5000 bronze; while Beefbrain, who was protecting the bronze, said there were 4000 gold and 3000 silver.

On my second day I found his tracks, and by nightfall I was hot on his trail. Early the next morning I sighted him heading east. The sun was shining in my eyes so I couldn't see much more than his silhouette. The bear was uncanny. He lost me several minutes later when he cut through a stream. Knowing he might hide and charge me, I got behind a rock and squinted into the sun to search for movement. Suddenly a shadow came up from behind me.

One of the six murdered one of the other five. Here are some facts:
1. If the murderer's room and the victim's room did not border each other, the victim was either Audrey or Fran.
2. If the murderer's room and the victim's room bordered different numbers of rooms, the murderer was either Brenda or Charlotte.
3. If the murderer's room and the victim's room were different sizes, the murderer was either Dawn or Edith.
Who was the murderer?","Dawn was the murderer.
Since there was only one murderer, conclusions 2 and 3 cannot be true at the same time, and therefore at least one of these conclusions must be false. This means that at least one hypothesis must be false.
Notice how no two rooms of the same size border the same number of rooms. This means that one of hypotheses 2 and 3 is true, and the other is false.
If hypothesis 2 is true and hypothesis 3 is false, then the two rooms are the same size, and the murderer is Brenda or Charlotte. If the murderer is Brenda, the victim is Dawn. If the murderer is Charlotte, the victim is Edith. But both situations contradict fact 1.
This means that hypothesis 2 is false, hypothesis 3 is true, the two rooms border the same number of rooms, and the murderer was either Dawn or Edith. If the murderer was Edith, the victim was Brenda, which contradicts fact 1. This means the murderer was Dawn, and her victim was Audrey.

If Eli says Alice & Barry are opposites & Eli is honest, then Alice is honest.
If Alice is honest then Eli is lying because Daniel isn't lying.
That's a contradiction.
If Eli is lying then Alice is lying, and Eli is telling the truth.
If Eli says Callie & Myself aren't opposites, then Eli is basically saying that he himself is a liar, which is a contradiction.
If Eli said Alice & Daniel are opposites & is telling the truth, then Alice is lying & Eli is telling the truth.
If Eli said Alice & Daniel are opposites & is lying, then Alice is telling the truth & Eli is lying.
There is no way to conclude who is lying, but Eli's statement is conclusive, therefore it can't be this.
If Eli said Callie & Barry aren't opposites, then he would be telling the truth & Alice would be lying.",,2.6,2.0

Belly Beans,"Jelly Belly beans were the first jelly beans in outer space when President Reagan sent them on the 1983 flight of the space shuttle Challenger.
Three astronauts had four jelly beans left among them one night - a black, a yellow, a green and a red. No astronaut ate more than one jelly bean and the red bean was definitely eaten.  According to the following statements, determine which astronaut ate which jelly bean.
1. If the second astronaut did not eat the yellow or green jelly bean, then the first astronaut ate the red bean.
2. The second astronaut ate the yellow jelly bean, unless the first astronaut ate the red jelly bean.
3. If the third astronaut did not eat the black or yellow jelly bean then the second astronaut ate the red bean.
4. If the third astronaut ate the yellow jelly bean then the first astronaut did not eat the red jelly bean.","First astronaut - red jelly bean
Second astronaut - green jelly bean
Third astronaut - black jelly bean
From statement 3, you can deduce that the third astronaut did NOT eat the red jelly bean.
Similarly, from statement 1, it can be determined that the second astronaut did not eat the red jelly bean. Therefore the first astronaut ate the red jelly bean.
From 4, then the third did not eat the yellow bean. Therefore they ate the black jelly bean since from 3, the second did not eat the red bean.
From 2, the second ate the green and the yellow bean was uneaten.","If all else fails, use trial and error.",2.6,2.31

Clap Your Hands,"There is a special auditorium that holds 100 people. It is not full. Each person claps seven times after a performance. Every time ten claps are heard, the man in the front twitches. Every third twitch, one of the actors hops. Every two hops, a person in the crowd cheers. Every four cheers, the actors bow. If they only bowed once, what is the least amount of people that can be in the auditorium?
BONUS! How many bows will the actors do if the auditorium is full?","One bow = 4 cheers.
4 cheers = 8 hops.
8 hops = 24 twitches.
24 twitches = 240 claps.
240/7 = 34.28
Since you can't have a fraction of a person, there must have been at least 35 people.
BONUS!
100 people = 700 claps.
700 claps = 70 twitches.
70 twitches = 23 hops. (You can't have .3 of a hop)
23 hops = 11 cheers. (You can't have half of a cheer)
11 cheers = 2 bows. (You can't have three-quarters of a bow)
At most, they will bow twice.","Just try going through the whole process backwards.

Buckle Con,"Bart and Lisa wanted to buy a great birthday present for their dad. They went to the mall and looked for hours. At the end of the second hour, Bart says, ""This is impossible! Let's go home, man!"" ""Let's look at the clothing store,"" says Lisa. They decide to buy a belt buckle from World War 1. On the front it says, ""WW1 Flying Ace."" They take the belt to the cops and claim it is a fake.
How did they know it was a fake belt buckle?","The buckle can't be from World War 1. The buckle couldn't have said WW1 on it because they did not know there was going to be a WW2. It should have said ""The Great War"" instead.",,2.6,1.14
Find the Fake Coin,"There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?","Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.
Now let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.
And that's that. We have covered all possibilities.",,2.6,2.56

Handy People,"Long ago, back before serious illness existed and the new inventions of today, there lived the Handy People. Their height was measured in hands, and they lived long lives.  From the statements below identify each of the 5 Handy people's height (12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 hands) and their ages (100, 110, 120, 130 and 140 years).
TWIST: One statement is FALSE.
1. Har was not the oldest, nor was he the shortest or tallest.
2. Winn was taller than Edvo, who was taller but younger than Frer.
3. Tolo, who was not the second oldest, was older than Har, and shorter than Frer.
4. The one who was 13 hands tall was the oldest.
5. Har was taller and older than Winn and Tolo.
6. The fourth oldest was taller than Tolo, but shorter than Edvo, who was older than Winn.","Edvo, 15 hands, 130 years
Frer, 13 hands, 140 years
Har, 14 hands, 110 years
Tolo, 12 hands, 120 years
Winn, 16 hands, 100 years
When going through all the statements, it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true. (3 says Tolo is older than Har while 5 says Har is older than Tolo.) 2 gives the order of height as Winn, Edvo, and Frer. If 5 is true, then Har must be the tallest, but this contradicts 1, therefore 5 is false.
From 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the order of height is Winn, Edvo, Frer, and Tolo - with Har somewhere in between but not the shortest or tallest. Therefore Winn is 16 hands, and Tolo is 12.
Since Har is not the oldest, he is not 13 hands, which makes Frer 13 hands and the oldest.
From 3 and 6, Tolo is not the 2nd or 4th oldest and is not the youngest. Therefore he becomes 120 years. Also from 6, Edvo is not the 4th oldest or youngest. Therefore he is 130 years.
Since the 4th oldest is shorter than Edvo, Har must be it at 110 years. And Winn is the youngest. Since the 4th oldest was shorter than Edvo, Har is 14 hands and Edvo is 15 hands.",,2.6,2.71

All Blacks,"The rugby season may be over, but the wheeling and dealing is just reaching a high point. Recently, each of six teams acquired a different, valuable, player to beef up its roster. Each player specializes in a different position (one is a prop), and, coincidentally enough, each was acquired from a different one of the other teams. Each felt a pang of regret at leaving his former team, but is eagerly awaiting the first scrum of the season with his new mates. From the following clues, can you match each player with his position, new team and former team?
1. The one from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets.
2. The Mountaineers, Troopers and Typhoons signed the fullback, the player who left the Downers and Cowan, in some order.
3. The Downers, Scarlets and Jets lost Tuitupou, the center and the player who signed with the Typhoons, in some order.
4. Jeeper and the center signed with the Downers and the Typhoons, in some order.
5. Rokocoko and McGuyver left the Mountaineers and the Troopers, in some order.
6. The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets.
7. The hooker cleared his stuff out of his former Downer locker last week.
8. Rokocoko isn't the fullback.
9. The wing's wife was delighted that her husband signed with the Scarlets.
10. Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets.
11. The fly half, who isn't going to the Mountaineers, isn't Cowan.","The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).
The wing signed with the Scarlets. Since the player from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 1), this is a fourth player.
Cowan is neither the hooker who left the Downers nor the wing who signed with the Scarlets (clue 2), so he is a fifth player.
Cowan is not the fullback (clue 2) or the fly half (clue 11).
The center cannot have signed with the Typhoons (clue 3), so the center must have signed with the Downers while Jeeper signed with the Typhoons (clue 4). This means that Cowan cannot be the center (clue 2), and must therefore be the prop.
The center didn't leave the Troopers or the Mountaineers (clue 3), so he is the 6th player, leaving Rokocoko and McGuyver as the fullback and the fly half, in some order.
At this point we know the following information about the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) the hooker, left the Downers
4) the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) the center
Since Jeeper signed with the Typhoons, he is one of the three people listed in clue 2: he obviously isn't Cowan, so he is either the fullback or the player who left the Downers, ie the hooker (clue 7). We've established that Jeeper cannot be the fullback, so he is the hooker.
Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 10), so he is the center. This leaves Tuitupou as the wing.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers
The player that left the Mountaineers couldn't have also signed with the Mountaineers, so Cowan signed with the Mountaineers, and the player that left the Mountaineers signed with the Troopers.
The fullback didn't sign with the Jets (clue 2), so the fullback signed with the Troopers and the fly half signed with the Jets.
Rokocoko isn't the fullback (clue 8), so McGuyver is the fullback and Rokocoko is the fly half.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, signed with the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers.
Tuitupou left the Downers, the Scarlets or the Jets (clue 3). We've established that Jeeper left the Downers, and since Tuitupou signed with the Scarlets, he must have left the Jets.
The Scarlets, therefore, lost the center (clue 3).
By process of elimination, Cowan left the Typhoons.
So these are the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, left the Jets for the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, left the Typhoons for the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, left the Scarlets for the Downers.",,2.6,2.63

May D'upname saw Inspector Mad Ade's interest and decided to offer him a special coin she had been saving.
""It's a special one of a kind coin,"" she told Mad Ade, ""It was minted to celebrate the birth of Queen Elizabeth the second.""  Inspector Mad Ade viewed the coin and read the inscription on the reverse side of the coin.

Morning Melange,"This morning, the popular Bay area cable access TV show, ""Morning Melange"", featured six guests (including Francine and Evan). Each guest lives in a different town in the region (including Corte Madera), and each has a different talent or interest that was the focus of his or her segment. The segments began at 6:45, 7:00, 7:15, 7:30, 7:45 and 8:00. Discover, for each time, the full name of the featured guest, where he or she lives and his or her special interest.
1. The first three guests were, in some order: the person surnamed Ivens, the person from Berkeley and the antique car collector.
2. Damien's segment was sometime before Lautremont's segment.
3. Krieger's segment began at 7:45.
4. Alice appeared after the person from Oakland and before the person surnamed Morley.
5. The people from Berkeley and Daly City aren't of the same sex.
6. The six guests were: Cathy, the person whose first name is Damien, the person whose last name is Novak, the person from Daly City, the person from Palo Alto and the bungee jumper.
7. The last name of the financial adviser is either Lautremont or Novak.
8. Jaspersen's segment began exactly 45 minutes after the beekeeper's segment.
9. The crepe chef went on sometime before the person from Sausalito and sometime after Brandon.
10. The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15.","6:45, Damien Ivens, Oakland, Beekeeper
7:00, Alice Lautremont, Palo Alto, Antique car collector
7:15, Cathy Morley, Berkeley, Hypnotherapist
7:30, Brandon Jaspersen, Corte Madera, Bungee jumper
7:45, Evan Krieger, Daly City, Crepe Chef
8:00 Francine Novak, Sausalito, Financial Adviser
The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15 (10). Jaspersen's segment was in the second half (8). The beekeeper was in the first half, and was either 6:45 or 7:00 (8). Since Krieger was at 7:45 (3), then Jaspersen was at 7:30. This leaves the beekeeper at 6:45 (8). The antique car collector has to be at 7:00 (1).
The financial adviser isn't Jaspersen or Kreiger (7), and is therefore on during the 8:00 segment. Likewise, Morley can't be at 8:00 (7), or in the first two segments (4); thus Morley has to be at 7:15. This puts Alice at 7:00 and Oakland at 6:45 (4). This also puts Ivens at 6:45 and Berkeley at 7:15 (1).
The two guests in the 6:45 and 7:15 segments are neither Novak, from Daly City or Palo Alto, or interested in bungee jumping. Therefore, these guests must be Cathy and Damien (6). Therefore, Brandon is at 7:30, the chef at 7:45, and the guest from Sausalito at 8:00 (9). The bungee jumper, who must be at 7:30, cannot be from Daly City or Palo Alto, and so is from Corte Madera (6). Alice must be from either Daly City or Palo Alto, so cannot have a last name of Novak (6).
Therefore, Lautremont is in the 7:00 time slot and Novak is the 8:00 time slot. Damien was at 6:45 (2), leaving Cathy at 7:15.
Since Cathy is from Berkeley, Alice cannot be from Daly City (5), and is therefore from Palo Alto. Likewise, Kreiger, who must be from Daly City, cannot be Francine, and must be named Evan. This leaves Francine at 8:00.","Females are Alice, Cathy and Francine; males are Brandon, Damien and Evan.",2.59,2.72

Unlucky Car Thief,"A car thief, who had managed to evade the authorities in the past, unknowingly took the automobile that belonged to Inspector Detweiler.  The sleuth wasted no time and spared no effort in discovering and carefully examining the available clues.  He was able to identify four suspects with certainty that one of them was the culprit.
The four make the statements below.  In total, six statements are true and six false.
Suspect A:
1. C and I have met many times before today.
2. B is guilty.
3. The car thief did not know it was the Inspector's car.
Suspect B:
1. D did not do it.
2. D's third statement is false.
3. I am innocent.
Suspect C:
1. I have never met A before today.
2. B is not guilty.
3. D knows how to drive.
Suspect D:
1. B's first statement is false.
2. I do not know how to drive.
3. A did it.
Which one is the car thief?","Consider that six statements are false. A's first statement and C's first statement contradict each other.  One of them is false.  C's and D's  contradict each other.  One of them is false.  Therefore, there are four additional false statements.
Assume A is guilty.  If so, A's second statement, B's second statement, and D's first statement are the additional false statements.
Assume D is guilty.  If so, A's second statement, B's first statement, and D's third statement are false.  This also only makes five false statements.  D did not do it.
Assume C did it.  If so, A's second statement, D's first and third statements are false.  This again, makes only five false statements.
After ruling out suspects A, C and D, B is the culprit.  B's third statement, C's second statement, and D's first and third statements are the additional false statements.  This adds up to six.",,2.58,2.96

Divine Deception,"Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?","First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,2.58,3.12
Four Men and Four Women at a Wedding,"Four men, Al, Ben, Carl, and Dan, and four women, Edith, Fran, Gertrude, and Heather, attended a wedding. One of the four men married one of the four women. Here are some facts:
1. If neither Al nor Edith got married, then Gertrude got married.
2. If neither Al nor Fran got married, then Ben got married.
3. If neither Ben nor Gertrude got married, then Carl got married.
4. If neither Carl nor Fran got married, then Edith got married.
Who got married?","Ben married Edith.
Suppose Al got married. Fact 3 tells us that he married Gertrude, contradicting fact 4. So Al could not have gotten married.
Suppose Carl got married. Fact 2 tells us that he married Fran, contradicting fact 1. So Carl could not have gotten married.
Suppose Dan got married. Fact 2 tells us that he married Fran, while fact 3 tells us that he married Gertrude, contradicting each other. So Dan could not have gotten married.
Therefore, Ben got married.
From fact 1, Ben could not have married Fran or Heather. From fact 5, he could not have married Gertrude, leaving only Edith.","All four facts are in the form of ""hypothesis and conclusion"" statements, which can only be true if the hypothesis is false or if the conclusion is true.",2.58,2.23

If this person is unmarried, then we have a married person who can see an unmarried person. If he is married, we can go to the person in front of him.
Continuing in this manner, we can determine that if the person directly behind the person at the front is unmarried, then there is at least one married person behind him who can see an unmarried person. If this person is married, then since he can see the person at the front, we have a married person who can see an unmarried person.",,2.58,1.05
A Murder in Heather's Family,"One of four people (Heather, her brother, her son, and her mother) was tragically murdered last night by one of the other three. Each of the three non-victims made one statement, of which exactly one was false. Here are the three statements:
1. ""I am the mother of the murderer, but not the mother of the victim.""
2. ""I am the mother of the victim, but not the mother of the murderer.""
3. ""I am the same gender as the victim.""
Who is the murderer?","Heather's mother was the murderer.
Suppose statements 1 and 2 are both true. Then they would both be made by women, which means that statement 3 was made by a man, and the victim was a man. But this would mean that statement 3, and therefore all three statements, would be true.
This means that one of statements 1 and 2 must be false, and statement 3 is true. Suppose statement 3 was made by a woman. This means that the victim was a woman, and the other two statements were made by men. But then both statements 1 and 2 are false.
This means that statement 3 was made by a man, the victim was a man, and the other two statements were made by women. Suppose statement 2 is false. If Heather's brother is the victim, her mother could not have made a true statement 1, so she must have made statement 2, and the murderer could not have been Heather's brother, so it must have been Heather herself, but then she couldn't have made a true statement 1 either. On the other hand, if Heather's son is the victim, Heather herself must have made statement 2, which could only make her son the murderer.
This means that statement 1 is false. If Heather's brother is the victim, Heather herself could not have made a true statement 2, so she must have made statement 1, and the murderer could not have been her brother, so it must have been her mother. On the other hand, if Heather's son is the victim, her mother must have made statement 1, and the murderer must have been Heather's mother.",,2.58,2.11

So, they invited 3 of their other friends over to make the team 5 on 5. The new friends are, Paul, Kelsey, and Luke. Those 3 will start out as Privates like everyone else did. The other 7 friends will take their rank from the last time.
The teams were split.
Blue Team:
Lieutenant General Stephen
Major Felicia
Sergeant Abby
Private Paul
Private Kelsey
Red Team:
Colonel Anna
Captain Clark
Sergeant Brad

4. Lieutenant Colonel
5. Major
6. Captain
7. First Lieutenant
8. Second Lieutenant
9. First Sergeant
10. Sergeant

Each team was given a very small base, and 15 balls (pretending to be cannon balls) to throw at each other.
If anyone is a Second Lieutenant or lower, and is hit by a ball, they are out. If anyone is between a First Lieutenant and a Lieutenant Colonel, they get two total hits before they are out. And if anyone is a Colonel or higher, they get three hits before they are out.
Start:
The Red team throws 5 balls, and hits everyone once except for the General and Sergeant.
The Blue team fires 6 balls, hitting the Red team leader twice and everyone else once.
The Red team fires 3 balls and hits the General and the Major once each. The other one ends up missing.
The Blue team fires 2 balls and hits the lowest ranked man left, the other one misses.
The Red team is up again and fires 2 balls, and hits the General twice.
The Blue team throws their remaining 7 balls and hits the Red team's last player.
Who was left on the blue team?","First of all, both teams could take the same number of hits. Stephen and Anna could both take 3 hits, Felicia and Clark could both take 2 hits and the other 6 members could each take 1 hit.
So, when the Red team throws balls and hit, it hits everyone but Abby and Stephen. That takes out Paul and Kelsey, and leaves Felicia with 1 hit left.
When the Blue team fires and hits everybody once and Anna twice, that leaves Clark and Anna both with only 1 hit left.
Back to the Red team firing their 3 balls. It hits Stephen and Felicia once, taking Felicia out of the game, and leaving Stephen with 2 hits.
When the Blue team fires again, they hit the lowest ranked man, and that's Clark. So, that takes him out and just leaves Anna with one hit left.

Battleship Tournament,"The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.","From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).
In summary:
Bart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Jason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.
Roger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat Lila Peach by a Patrol Boat.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.

The Tourist Group,"A tourist group of 86 people broke up into two groups. The smaller group went to the beach, and the bigger group went to see a water mill. The following statements are all true. How many people were in each group?
a) A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.
b) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.
c) One of the groups contains only married couples.
d) The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.
e) One of the groups contains 8 times as many people who are younger than 50 as those who are at least 50 years old.","The first thing is to make this question an equation. The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then ¼(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then ¼(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation ¼(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.
If c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since ""couples"" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.
o+8o=9o.
So 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even. So, group x consists of 72 people and y consists of 14 people.
So, the answer is that there are 72 people that went to see the water mill and 14 people went to the beach.",,2.57,2.35
Seven Sportsmen,"Seven sportsmen are standing in a row. Each sportsman has a different 1-digit number. The product of the first three, the product of the middle three, and the product of the last three are all equal.
What's the middle sportsman's number?","Let their numbers be a through g, we have abc=cde=efg.
5 or 7 cannot occur, because they are prime and no other 1-digit number contains them. Therefore, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.
Since abc=efg, abcdefg/d is a perfect square. 1*2*3*4*6*8*9=2^7*3^4, and d can be only 2 or 8.
If d=2, the numbers 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 can be made into 1*8*9=3*4*6=72, and we can have c=9, e=4: 9*2*4=72.
If d=8, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 can be made into 1*4*9=2*3*6=36, but 36 is not divisible by 8.

Five Men and Five Dogs,"Five men and five dogs (each man owned a dog) went hiking. They encountered a river that was swift and deep. The only way to cross it was an abandoned boat, left ashore on their side. But it would only hold three living things. Unfortunately, the dogs were edgy and could not be near another person (not even momentarily) unless its owner was present.

""It was Brian.""
Brian:   ""It wasn't Charlie.""
""It wasn't Edward.""
Charlie: ""It was Edward.""
""It wasn't Arnold.""
Derek:   ""It was Charlie.""
""It was Brian.""
Edward:  ""It was Derek.""
""It wasn't Arnold.""
It was well known that each suspect told exactly one lie. Can you determine who stole the cake?","Charlie committed the terrible crime. The way to solve this puzzle is to look at each clue. We know that exactly one of each person's statements is true. Looking at Arnold's statements, let's check to see if 'it was Brian' is true. If 'it was Brian' is true, then we know the other statement is false, therefore it was Edward. This is a contradiction. Hence we now know it wasn't Brian, nor Edward (as 'it wasn't Edward' must be the true statement). Looking at Charlie's statement, we can similarly determine that it wasn't Arnold either. Edward's statement gives us that it wasn't Derek, which leaves only Charlie as the culprit. It is always wise to check this against the other clues.",,2.57,1.76
Bowling League,"Joyce and her four best friends bowl together on a team named the Alley Cats.  The team played a great game last Friday as each woman's score was higher than her average.  Can you find each bowler's full name and her Friday night score?
Given:
Scores -- 	170, 175, 195, 210, 230
First Names -- 	Amy, Evelyn, Hillary, Joyce, Opal
Last Names -- 	Marin, Peterson, Rielly, Shapiro, Webster
Clues:
#1) Hillary, whose average is 197, isn't Ms. Webster
#2) Opal scored exactly 20 more points than Ms. Shapiro
#3) Ms. Rielly (who isn't Evelyn), scored lower than Opal's average
#4) Amy's score was higher than Ms. Peterson's
#5) Opal is NOT Ms. Marin and neither woman scored 230 points.","Joyce Rielly -- 170
Evelyn Shapiro -- 175
Amy Webster -- 230
Hillary Marin -- 210
Opal Peterson -- 195
**Clue #1:  We know Hillary isn't Ms. Webster, so you can cross that off immediately.  We also know that Hillary's bowling average is 197.  The problem states that it was a good night because each lady scored higher than her average.  We know then, that Hillary's average must be either 210 or 230.  Cross off the others for Hillary.
**Clue #2:  Opal scored 20 more points than Ms. Shapiro.  Looking at the scores, there are 2 sets of the numbers that have differences of 20.  175 ; 195 and 210 ; 230.  So for Opal and Ms. Shapiro, you can immediately mark off  the 170 score.  Also, Opal can NOT be Ms. Shapiro.
**Clue #3:  Ms. Rielly is NOT Evelyn, so cross off Rielly on Evelyn's list.  Rielly scored lower than Opal.  This means that Opal cannot have the lowest score, which was crossed off in the last clue, and Rielly can NOT have the highest score.  So cross off the 230 on Rielly's list.  Also, if it says Rielly scored lower than Opal, we can assume Opal is NOT Ms. Rielly...mark it off.
**Clue #4:  If Amy's score was higher than Ms. Peterson's, then Amy cannot have the lowest score (170) and Ms. Peterson cannot have the highest score (230).  Cross them off.  Here as well, we can assume that if they have different scores, Amy can NOT be Ms. Peterson.
**Clue #5:  Opal is NOT Ms. Marin, neither scored 230 points.  Cross them off.  If Opal did not score 230 points, then the 20 point difference is not the 210 ; 230.  So we know that Opal and Ms. Shapiro's scores are 195 and 175, respectively.  Since we know Shapiro has a 175, any of the first names that have 175 crossed off can NOT be Shapiro, therefore Hillary can NOT be Ms. Shapiro...mark it off.  Also note that Ms. Webster scored 230.
*********Once we know that Opal's score is 195, we know that Rielly scored lower than that.  So Rielly's score is either 170 or 175.  Shapiro's score is 175, so we know that Rielly's score is 170.  First names with 170 marked off already can NOT have a last name of Rielly.  SO mark off Rielly on Amy's, Hillary's, and Opal's list.  We now see that the full name is Joyce Rielly with a score of 170.  Now you have the first complete section of the answer.  Also, we know Opal is NOT Ms. Marin, so you can cross off 195 from Ms. Marin's score list.  Now we know Marin scored 210.  That leaves Peterson with 195.  Opal is Ms. Peterson.  We know that Amy scored higher than Ms. Peterson, who scored 195.  So Amy could only have scored a 210 or 230.  Marking 175 off Amy's list shows you Evelyn has 175. which makes her Ms. Shapiro.  Marking Webster off of Opal's list, leaves Amy as Webster which in turn leaves Hillary as Marin.","Make a list of one set of givens and list another set of givens that would correspond to them... i.e. (first names) -- (last names)
Amy -- Marin, Peterson, Rielly, Shapiro, Webster
Evelyn -- Marin, Peterson, Rielly, Shapiro, Webster, etc.
Cross off what you know is NOT the correct answer from the clues, and when you find out a last name that fits a first name circle it, or write the full name on the piece of paper in a different section to keep track.  Do the same with the other correlations that can be surmised by looking at the clues:
(last names) -- (bowling scores)
(first names) -- (bowling scores)
Keep in mind that for example, if you find a last name for a first name, the other first names can NOT have that last name, so that gives you another answer to mark off to narrow the correct answer down.",2.57,2.12

The Lead Actor,"Hans Ernest Froopaloop, Jr. is in a play with four relatives: his sister, mother, son, and daughter. Each of the five has a different dressing room:
Room A: small, borders rooms B and E
Room B: large, borders rooms A, C, D, and E
Room C: large, borders rooms B and D
Room D: small, borders rooms B, C, and E
Room E: large, borders rooms A, B, and D
Here are some facts:
1. The rooms of the lead actor in the play and his or her sibling border the same number of rooms.
2. The lead's room and his or her parent's room are the same size.
3. HEF Jr's room and his daughter's room do not border each other.
4. Each room borders at least one man's room and at least one woman's room.
Who is the lead actor?","HEF Jr's sister is the lead actor.
From fact 4, we know that rooms A and C each border one man's room and one woman's room. So one of rooms B and E is occupied by a man and the other by a woman, and one of rooms B and D is occupied by a man and the other by a woman. If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.
Since there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.
Since there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.
Fact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son. Therefore, the siblings in rooms A and C must be HEF Jr. and his sister, and one of them must be the lead actor. From fact 3, we have these two scenarios:
1.
Room A: HEF Jr.
Room B: Son
Room C: Sister
Room D: Daughter
Room E: Mother
2.
Room A: Sister
Room B: Son
Room C: HEF Jr.
Room D: Mother
Room E: Daughter

Truth Day,"On one of the seven days of the week, Hans Ernest Froopaloop, Jr. always tells the truth. On each of the other six days, he always lies.
One day he said, ""I always lie on Sundays and on Mondays."" The next day he said, ""Today is either Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday."" The next day he said, ""I always lie on days beginning with T.""
On which day does Mr. Froopaloop tell the truth?","Mr. Froopaloop always tell the truth on Monday.
Mr. Froopaloop's first and third statements obviously cannot both be true. If they are both lies, then he tells the truth on one of Sunday and Monday, and he also tells the truth on one of Tuesday and Thursday, so this cannot work either. Therefore, one of Mr. Froopaloop's first and third statements is true and the other is false. His second statement must also be false.
Suppose Mr. Froopaloop's first statement is true. Since his third statement is false, he must have told the truth on Tuesday or Thursday, so his second statement must have been made on Wednesday or Friday. But since his second statement is false, this cannot work.
This means Mr. Froopaloop's third statement is true. Since his first statement is false, he must have told the truth on Sunday or Monday, so his second statement must have been made on Saturday or Sunday. But since his second statement is false, he could not have made that statement on Saturday, and it must have been on Sunday, which means he would have told the truth on Monday.","Today and tomorrow do not count as ""days beginning with T"".",2.56,1.99
Company Move,"I once worked at a company which employed 50 people, all of whom worked at the corporate headquarters in the same 4,000 square foot office building in the United States. We all lived in different directions: north, south, northwest, southeast from work, none more than 30 miles away. There were no housing complexes where we lived and no physical obstructions in the way (mountains, lakes, oceans, etc.).
The company's president made an economic decision in relocating all 50 employees to a new office location. In doing so, he didn't take into account how the move might affect the distance employees had to travel to work.
After the move, the president found that the new headquarters was closer to his home. It worked out great for him because he also got a fancy new office with more room. Once the move was finally completed, every single employee, myself included, was closer to home than before the move.

Chess Tournament,"During the final round of a chess tournament, the eventual top 4 finishers in the tournament played their final game against 4 different opponents. The tournament boards were numbered from 1 to 50 to facilitate location and identification of games. Each of the top 4 finishers played a different opening in this last game. Use the clues below to determine the first and last names of the first through fourth place winners of the tournament, the chess opening each used in his last game, and the number of the chess board on which he played his final game.
1. Mr. Hart played the King's Indian Defence.
2. Steve placed ahead of the one who used the Ruy Lopez opening.
3. The top 4 players were Larry, Mr. Korn, the contestant who opened with Queen's Gambit, and a player who played on an even-numbered board.
4. Mr. Rose finished exactly 2 places ahead of the player on board 31.
5. The number of the 3rd place winner's board is at least 10 higher or at least 10 lower than that of Mr. Baird.
6. The number of the board of the contestant who placed immediately after Bert is exactly 15 higher than the number of the board played by the one who placed immediately before Tom.
7. The lowest board number of the top 4 finishers was exactly half the number of the board played by the one who placed immediately after the one who played the Giuoco Piano opening.
8. The highest board number was exactly 8 higher than the board number of the man who finished exactly two places after Bert.","Firstly, work out the board numbers. We know that Bert finished in the first 2 (Clue 8) and board 31 finished in the last 2 (Clue 4). Using all combinations of these, we can eliminate all but the correct numbers, ie 16, 31, 32 and 40.
After we know the numbers, the rest falls into place.
First: Steve Rose, Queen's Gambit, board 40
Second: Bert Baird, Ruy Lopez, board 16
Third: Tom Korn, Giuoco Piano, board 31
Fourth: Larry Hart, King's Indian, board 32","All other information (First name, Surname, Moves, Positions) are given in the puzzle, apart from the board numbers.

Aeiea,"You are a traveler and stop in an inn to rest. While you sit by the fire, you meet another traveler, who introduces herself as Aeiea. You begin a pleasant conversation, and exchange information about why you are travelling. She says that she is travelling in search of gold that her ancestors buried, and if you come with her she will share it. You become excited until she adds one more comment about herself. ""Oh, I do need to tell you one thing. I always lie.""
Now you need to figure out two things:
1) Is Aeiea telling the truth or lying when she says she always lies?
2) Can you trust her story?","1) Aeiea is lying.
It's really fairly simple. If Aeiea is telling the truth, that means that she does not ALWAYS lie, because then the statement would be false. It leaves that Aeiea must be lying when she says that she always lies. A common misconception is that if she is lying about always lying, that means she must always tell the truth, and if that were the case then neither case would be possible. However, she doesn't have to ALWAYS tell the truth if she's lying about always lying, she simply has to tell the truth SOME of the time.
2) Taking into account the answer to number one, you cannot trust her story, as she does lie some of the time, not to mention the fact that she is obviously willing to lie to YOU.",It's not as hard as it might seem at first. Think CAREFULLY about what would be the case if she lied or told the truth with her final statement. Try not to make assumptions.,2.56,1.45
Three Coins 2,"You are travelling to an exotic country which has three types of coins.  Each coin has a different value (5, 10, or 15 units), a different color (red, green, or blue), and a different shape (round, square, and triangular).  You have one of each coin in your pocket.
a)  If you randomly select one coin, it will either be red, a circle, or the 5 unit coin.
b)  If you randomly select another coin, it will either be blue, a triangle, or the 10 unit coin.
c)  The triangular coin is worth more than the square coin.
What is the color, shape, and value of each coin?","1)  The 5 unit coin is blue and square.
2)  The 10 unit coin is green and round.
3)  The 15 unit coin is red and triangular.
Here's how to solve it:
Statement ""a"" will tell you that the round coin is not red or the 5 unit coin.  Statement ""b"" indicates that the triangular coin is not blue or the 10 unit coin.  Statement ""c"" then tells you that the triangular coin has to be the 15 unit coin (since it can't be the 5 unit coin, either).
Now going back to statement ""a"", the round coin must be the 10 unit coin which makes the square coin the 5 unit coin.  Also from statement ""a"" you can determine that the square coin is not red (since the 5 unit coin is not red), leaving the triangular coin to be red.  From statement ""b"" you can determine that the square coin is blue, since the 10 unit coin (the round one) cannot be blue.  This leaves the round coin to be green.",,2.56,1.44
"The Truth Teller, The Liar, and The Unreliable Man","There are three men, Alex, Bob and Chuck.  One of the men always tells the truth and one always lies.  The third man always tells a lie after telling the truth and always tells the truth after telling a lie.  The third man can answer the first question truthfully or can lie.
Can you tell who is the truth teller, the liar and the unreliable man by asking just three questions?  Each question is directed to a single person.","First ask Alex, ""Does Bob sometimes tell the truth and sometimes lie?""
A ""yes"" answer means one of the following must be true:
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is unreliable;
2) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller;
3) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the liar.
A ""no"" answer means one of these must be true:
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is the liar;
2) Alex is the liar and Bob is unreliable;
3) Alex is unreliable and is telling the truth and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is telling the truth and Bob is the liar.
If the answer is ""yes"", you ask Alex ""Is Bob the liar?""; if the answer is ""no"", you ask Alex ""Is Bob the truth teller?""
Depending on the answers to the first two questions, you know one of the following:
A) If the answer to both questions was ""yes"" then either
1) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller; or
2) Alex is unreliable and lied on the first question and Bob is the liar.
B) If the answer to both questions is ""no"" then either
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is the liar; or
2) Alex is unreliable and Bob is the truth teller.
C) If the answer to the first question was ""yes"" and the second question was ""no"" then either
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is unreliable; or
2) Alex is unreliable and lied on the first question and Bob is the truth teller.
In either case, Chuck is the liar.
D) If the answer to the first question was ""no"" and the second question was ""yes"" then either
1) Alex is the liar and Bob is unreliable; or
2) Alex is unreliable and Bob is the liar.
In either case, Chuck is the truth teller.
In cases A & B you've identified one person as either the liar or the truth teller and you've identified another person as either not the liar or not the truth teller.  In these cases you ask the person who is neither the liar or the truth teller a question you know the answer to.  In cases C & D you've identified Chuck as either the liar or truth teller.  At this point you simply ask Chuck a question to identify either Alex or Bob.
So the final question and results for each case are:
A) You ask Bob ""Is Alex the truth teller?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is unreliable, Bob is the liar and Chuck is the truth teller;
""no"" means that
Alex is the liar, Bob is the truth teller and Chuck is unreliable.
B) You ask Bob ""Is Alex the liar?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is the truth teller, Bob is the liar and Chuck is unreliable;
""no"" means that
Alex is unreliable, Bob is the truth teller and Chuck is the liar.
C) You ask Chuck ""Is Alex the truth teller?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is unreliable, Bob is the truth teller and Chuck is the liar;
""no"" means that
Alex is the truth teller, Bob is unreliable and Chuck is the liar.
D) You ask Chuck ""Is Alex the liar?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is the liar, Bob is unreliable and Chuck is the truth teller;
""no"" means that
Alex is unreliable, Bob is the liar and Chuck is the truth teller.",,2.56,2.78

Delvon: Jevon got 1st.
Trevon: Delvon did worse than Jevon.
Kevion: Trevon is lying.
Jevon: I did better than Kevion.","Jevon couldn't have gotten 1st because then Delvon would be the other truth teller and would have to be 2nd. Trevon would have to be lying that Delvon did worse than Jevon, which isn't a lie. Since there is a contradiction, Jevon was definitely not 1st and Delvon is lying. If Trevon is the other liar, then Jevon and Kevion must be the truth tellers. That means Delvon had to have done worse than Jevon, resulting in Trevon telling the truth. Since there is a contradiction, Trevon isn't the other liar. Kevion has to be lying about Trevon lying, so Kevion and Delvon are in the liars in the bottom 2. Jevon has to be in the top 2, but since Delvon is lying about Jevon being 1st, Jevon is 2nd and Trevon is 1st. Kevion and Delvon are still somewhere in the bottom 2.

This means Jay must be lying and is innocent. Connor has to be telling the truth and is guilty. Since Jay is lying, it can't be Kate because that would result in Jay telling the truth. Since Kate is innocent, RJ must be telling the truth and is the other guilty one.

Suppose you come across 4 such people A, B, C, D:
A  B  C  D
A says: ""B is in tribe Y.""
B says: ""C is in tribe Y.""
C says: ""D is in tribe Y.""
D says: ""A will say that C is in tribe Y.""
If there are two people from each tribe, can you deduce who is from which tribe?","LOGIC:
Suppose there are any 2 tribal people of the same tribe standing adjacent to each other.
Then, if one of them is asked about the tribe of the other, he'll say ""TRIBE X"".
If both are in tribe X, then he'll tell the truth, that is ""TRIBE X"".
X X - TRIBE X
If both are in tribe Y, then he'll lie, that is ""TRIBE X"".
Y Y - TRIBE X
Similarly, if their tribes are different, then the answer will always be ""TRIBE Y"".
X Y - TRIBE Y
Y X - TRIBE Y
So from the question, A and B are in different tribes, so are B and C and so are C and D.
Since there are two types of tribes only, A and C are in the same tribe while B and D are in the same tribe.
Now, since according to D, A will call C a liar (TRIBE Y), in spite of both of them being in the same tribe, D is lying.
Hence B and D are liars (TRIBE Y), while A and C are honest (TRIBE X).

B - TRIBE Y
C - TRIBE X
D - TRIBE Y","Try using the ""Trial and Error"" Method.",2.55,1.67

J=2; U=7; N=5; E=3  (or J=3; U=7; N=5; E=2)

Suppose Carl is lying. Then Carl is not Heather's fiance, and neither is Al or Ben. This leaves only Dan, making him a truthteller. If Al is telling the truth, then he and Dan are both truthtellers, making Al a liar. So Al must be a liar, and since he and Carl are both liars, Ben must also be lying, but now, since Dan is the only truthteller, Al must be telling the truth.

Googlebunnies I,"Googlebunnies are creatures that come in two types (spooky and flitty) and two genders (male and female). The spooky males and flitty females always tell the truth; flitty males and spooky females always lie.
You come across 3 Googlebunnies. Determine the type and gender of each based on their statements:
A: Ask B what my type is - he will give a truthful answer. C is flitty.
B: A and I are both males. C is a female.
C: A and B are both females. B is spooky.","A. Spooky Female
B. Spooky Female
C. Spooky Male
If A is truthful, B must be truthful which would make C a Flitty Female.  Since that would mean C speaks the truth then A and B are both predators which would make B's statement false.  Therefore A must be lying.
Therefore if A lies then B must lie (from A's statement).
From A's false statement then, C is spooky and from B's false statement. C is male.  Therefore C is truthful and A and B are both Spooky Females.",,2.55,2.06

A: In this box are 3 statements
B: Only 1 of these statements is true.
C: I am the greatest.
Now your task is to find out which if any of these three statements are true!","Since there are three statements it is possible that none, 1 ,2 or all 3 are true.
Since [A] is clearly true it cannot be none.
[B] cannot be true because then [B] would be the only true statement and we already know [A] is true.

Unloading the Dice,"The Sharks and the Jets have decided to settle their differences with a game of Snakes and Ladders, in which movement is determined by the roll of a single die.  The problem is, neither group trusts the other not to gain an advantage by swapping in a loaded die at a crucial moment.  Officer Krupke, who wants to keep the peace, comes up with a novel proposal.  Instead of rolling one die, each side will roll a die of its own choosing each time a die roll is required.  Then the two die rolls will be combined by a simple formula that produces a number from one to six.  This formula has the property that if either one of the two dice is fair, the results will be evenly distributed among the six numbers.  Thus either side can guarantee a fair result just by making sure that its own die is fair.  What formula might Officer Krupke have suggested?","One simple formula is: add the two dice together, and subtract 6 if the total is greater than 6.  With this formula, any number the other side rolls establishes a simple mapping from the faces of your own die to the final total.  For example, if the other side rolls a three, then your 1 maps to 4, 2 maps to 5, 3 maps to 6, 4 maps to 1, 5 maps to 2, and 6 maps to 3.  As long as your own die is fair, the six numbers will all be equally
likely to be rolled, no matter how badly biased the other side's die may be.",,2.54,2.25

""I returned to camp early to make dinner for the hunting party when I saw Adrian and Lulo arguing. They had been dating for several years and frequently held heated discussions. I didn't want to intrude, so I hid behind a tree. Suddenly Adrian picked up a rock and delivered a fatal blow to Lulo's head. Just then Adrian saw me. He was so startled he turned and ran.

The Landlord,"Al, Ben, Carl, and Dan live in four adjacent apartments. The apartments are set up like this:
|1|2|3|4|
with apartment 1 being the westernmost apartment and apartment 4 being the easternmost. One of the four is the landlord. Here are some facts:
1. If Carl does not live next to Ben, then Al is the landlord and he lives in apartment 1.
2. If Al lives east of Carl, then Dan is the landlord and he lives in apartment 4.
3. If Ben does not live next to Dan, then Carl is the landlord and he lives in apartment 3.
4. If Dan lives east of Al, then Ben is the landlord and he lives in apartment 2.
Who is the landlord?","Carl is the landlord.
Obviously only one conclusion is true at most. Let us suppose that all conclusions are false. This would mean that each hypothesis is also false. From facts 1 and 3, Ben lives next to both Carl and Dan, and therefore between Carl and Dan. Then either Al lives east of both Carl and Dan (contradicting fact 4) or Carl and Dan both live east of Al (contradicting fact 2.) So there must be exactly one true hypothesis, which will be paired with the one true conclusion. Obviously each of the three false conclusions is paired with a false hypothesis.
If conclusion 1 is true, then Al lives in apartment 1. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al has to live east of Dan. So this cannot be right.
If conclusion 2 is true, then Dan lives in apartment 4. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al must live east of Dan. So this cannot be right, either.
If conclusion 4 is true, Ben lives in apartment 2. Then, since hypotheses 1 and 3 are false, Ben lives between Carl and Dan, putting Al in apartment 4. But since hypothesis 2 is false, Carl must live east of Al. Therefore, conclusion 3 is true.","All four facts are in the form of ""hypothesis and conclusion"" statements. If the hypothesis of such a statement is false, the whole statement is true. If the conclusion is true, the whole statement is true.

Table Tennis Challenge,"Patrice and seven of her friends organized the Ultimate Table Tennis Challenge to determine who the best Ping-Pong player among them was. The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.
1. The winner of the match at the Southville YMCA lost at least three games on the indoor table in Uncle Phil's basement before meeting McNeilly in the finals.
2. The first round opponent of the eventual champion was neither Fitzroy (who lost in the first round) nor the person who lost at the Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy.
3. The championship round took the maximum possible number of games in a match.
4. The seven matches, in some order, were: Jamie's first round victory, the match in which White won exactly 2 games, the match at Eastlake Municipal Park, the match that Lottie lost, the only match Diaz played, the match Toskhaya lost and the match in which somebody won exactly one game.
5. Bill never played Dave.
6. Averson didn't play Jamie in the first round.
7. A total of 55 games were played in the whole challenge, 30 of which were the first round matches.
8. McNeilly, who isn't Lottie or Kristin, never played Samuel or Gianelli.
9. The four who advanced to the second round were: White, Lottie, the person who played Regina in the first round and someone whose indoor match was at the Islip Town Hall.
10. McNeilly's opponent in the first round won more games than Diaz.
11. Kristin never played at the Southville YMCA.
12. Regina won more games than the person eliminated at Eastlake Municipal Park.
13. Kristin won more games than Bill, who won at least five.

N. Y. Athletic, Jamie, 5, Lottie, 4
The final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).
There were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.
This leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.
This means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).
From clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.
Islip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.
From clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).
White is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.
From clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.
From clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.
Since Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.
Lottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.
In the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.
From clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.
From clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.
Regina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.
Regina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.
Kristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.
Lottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.
Lottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).
Bills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.","Last names: Averson, Chang, Diaz, Fitzroy, Gianelli, McNeilly, Toskhaya and White",2.54,2.93

Ministerial Mutterings,"In the purely fictitious land of Fiddledeboox, the Minister of Finance emerged from a top-level meeting.   Reporters had gathered to hear his announcement about either an increase or a decrease in either wages, subsidies or tax levels.
It was widely known that this Minister [M] told the truth to reporters [R] only once in every three statements.
M:  Well, I can tell you that it's about subsidies.
R:  Are they going down again?
M:  Nothing is going down.
R:  So it's good news for the people?
M:  Of course.  Either subsidies are going down or there will be a wage increase.
While others jostled to ask the next question, one logically minded newshound was already leaving with the hot headline news.
From the Minister's three statements above, can you also deduce the truth?","It was a tax increase.
Solution:
Remember that only one statement can be true.
If (1) is true then either (2) or (3) will be true as well.  So (1) is a lie.
If (3) is true, either (1) or (2) would be also true.  So (3) is a lie.
If (2) is true, it must be either wages or taxes going up or (1) would be true.  It cannot be wages, making (3) true, so taxes are increasing.

The Sick Dog and the Flower,"Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.
Unfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.
But in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.
But this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.
But the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.
Unfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.
Let's sum up the assumptions:
1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.
2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.
3. The flower doesn't want to die.
4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.
5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.
6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
7. The dog is rational.
8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.
9. The dog doesn't want to die.
10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).
11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.
13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.
14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.
15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.
So now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?","The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)
But why will the dog eat the flower?
1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die
2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.
3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.
4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.
5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.
6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.
7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison
OK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).
8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous
9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't."," 1:
We know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.
Hint 2:
Since the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.",2.53,2.67

6. Mrs. Williams partner was her grandfather.
7. Mr. Johnson's partner was a man.","From statements 3, 5 and 6 the four couples consist of 3 generations since there is a set of sisters involved and there are grandparents present.
From 2 and 3, the Jones are definitely one of the sisters, and from 6, the Williams are definitely on the 3rd generation. Looking at 1 and 4, the Johnson's are on the 2nd generation and since the Smiths have a daughter, they are on the 1st or 2nd generation. But since the Jones must be one of the sisters, the Smiths cannot fall in the 2nd generation with the Johnson's. Therefore the Smiths are the grandparents.
From 6, Mrs. Williams' partner is Mr. Smith.  From 1 and 6, Mrs. Johnston and Mrs. Williams both have male partners, therefore from 5, Mrs. Smith's partner could have only been Mrs. Jones. Which also means that Jones and Johnson are the pair of sisters.
Thus from 2, Mr. Jones is then partnered with Mr. Johnson, and from 3, Mrs Jones (who is partnered with Mrs. Smith) is playing against Mrs. Johnson (whose partner is Mr. Williams from 1).

On A Role,"Carl, Draco, Emma, Ivy, June, & Xavior are playing a game with you in which you have to guess their roles in exactly 16 statements.
The roles are:
Normal - Has no abilities
Liar - Knows all roles & has to lie
Detective - Knows all roles
Switcher - Switches 2 roles after the first statement (cannot switch themselves)
Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)
Spy - Knows who was switched
The following 16 statements were made:
Carl is not Cupid - June
Ivy is the Liar - Carl
I know someone's role - Draco
I know the Switcher - Xavior
Ivy is not Normal - Emma
I wasn't switched - Ivy
Emma knows Draco's role - June
Xavior knows who was switched - Carl
Emma & I are not the Spy - Draco
Draco or June is Normal - Xavior
I don't know the Spy - Emma
I'm the Spy - Ivy
The Cupid wasn't switched - June
Xavior isn't Cupid - Carl
I don't know the Detective - Draco
I'm not the Spy - Xavior
Who is who?
*The Detective/Liar knows who was switched; if the Detective/Liar is switched then only the new Detective/Liar is updated","Normal=Draco
Liar=Ivy
Detective=Xavior
Switcher=Emma
Cupid=June
Spy=Carl
Explanation:
Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar
Step 3: Emma is paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June
Step 4: Emma isn't the Cupid or Normal
""Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)""
Cupid can't pair themselves
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Emma can't be Normal
Step 5: Emma isn't the Detective or Spy:
""I don't know the Spy - Emma""
If Emma was the Detective or Spy, then Emma would know the Spy
This leaves Emma with Switcher
Step 6: June is Cupid & Draco is Paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
We had 2 possible scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
However, Emma isn't the detective; therefore Draco & Emma are paired by June the Cupid
Step 7: Draco = Normal
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
June is Cupid & Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Draco is Normal
Step 8: The final 3
""I'm not the Spy - Xavior""
This leaves the Detective.
""Xavior knows who was switched - Carl""
This is true, which means Ivy is the liar & Carl is the Spy.
Ivy & Carl were swapped",,2.53,2.99

5.The Triangle is not first in the sequence.","The order was Square, Circle, Triangle, Diamond, Wavy Lines.
Clue 1: We know now that the Square and Diamond are 3 cards apart, so the Square must fall 1st or 2nd and the Diamond 4th or last.
2.The Wavy Lines are to the Diamond's right, so the Diamond falls 4th leaving the Square at 1st.
3.This is just a hint to let you know the Square was 1st.
4.The Circle wasn't to the side of the Diamond, so it had to fall 2nd, next to the Square.

Let's say 95 players are eliminated, leaving 5, 19, 23, 78, and 90; well if 5 eliminates 19 then 23 eliminates 78 and 90 eliminates 5, so 5 wouldn't do that. 19, 23, 78, and 90 also have the same problem, so no one would ever win.

-Meg likes the view from the medium-sized room.

Sadie wants to share, so she can't be in the small room.
Lise wants a bathroom, so she can't be in the medium-sized room.
Meg has to be in the medium-sized room.
Ally wants to share, but not with Meg, so she has to be in the large room.  She won't share with Sadie either, so Sadie must be with Meg in the medium-sized room.
Jeanne can't share with Meg because Sadie is sharing with Meg, so she has to have her own room.

In addition to each playing an instrument, one member is the lead singer, and two others do backup singing.  From the information given, can you determine who plays what, and who sings lead and who sings backup?
1. Curt absolutely cannot use his voice or breath in any way to contribute to the music of the band - he can't sing, and he can't play the harmonica, saxophone, or trumpet.
2. Only one of the guitar and bass players is singing.
3. The three singers are Ollie (who can't play the keyboard), the drummer (I know drummers aren't renowned for singing, but this one's an exception), and the lead singer.
4. The only reason that Ralph's in the band is because the drummer can't handle all of the percussion; Ralph does misc. percussion, and he doesn't even sing!
5. Neither Eddie nor Pat (who can't sing a note) plays the harmonica.
6. The guitarist isn't a backup singer, nor is the bass player the lead singer.
7. Harry is a fine drummer, and he also plays the trumpet.  But aside from his voice, that's all he can do.
8. Mike has a very good singing voice, but someone had a better one, as Mike is only a backup singer.
9. In case it isn't obvious, nobody who plays the harmonica, saxophone, or trumpet also sings.","Ralph does misc. percussion and doesn't sing (clue 4).  The other non-singers play the harmonica, saxophone, trumpet, and one of the guitar or the bass (clues 2 and 9).  The drummer and keyboard player are singers, but neither of them is Ollie (also a singer, clue 3), so Ollie is the third singer, so the keyboard player is the lead singer (clue 3, only spot left).  Mike sings backup, so he plays the drums (only spot on clue 3), and Ollie sings backup, so he plays the bass (clue 6).

Higher Card,"You find yourself at the Greenjack table. Greenjack is similar to Blackjack, except that it is completely different. It is played with a deck of only 16 cards, divided into 4 suits: Red, Blue, Orange and Green. There are four cards in each suit: Ace, King, Queen and Jack. Ace outranks King, which outranks Queen, which outranks Jack - except for the Green Jack, which outranks every other card. If two cards have the same face value, then Red outranks Blue, which outranks Orange, which outranks Green, again except for the Green Jack, which outranks everything.
Here's how the game is played: you are dealt one card face up, and the dealer is dealt one card face down. The dealer then makes some true statements, and you have to work out who has the higher card, you or the dealer. It's that simple!
Round 1:
You are dealt the Green Ace and the dealer makes three statements:
1. My card would beat any Queen.
2. Knowing this, if my card is more likely to beat yours, then my card is Blue. Otherwise it isn't.
3. Given all of the information you now know, if your card is more likely to beat mine, then my card is a King. Otherwise it isn't.
Who has the higher card, you or the dealer?","The dealer's card is higher: after #1 you know that you have a Green Ace (GA) and the dealer's card can beat any Queen, therefore the dealer must have one of the following cards: RA, BA, OA, RK, BK, OK, GK, GJ. Of these 8 cards, 4 can beat yours, therefore by #2 the dealer can't have a blue card, which means that his card must be one of: RA, OA, RK, OK, GK, GJ. Of these 6 cards your card can beat 3, therefore by #3 the dealer can't have a King, which means he has one of: RA, OA, GJ - all of which can beat your card. Therefore the dealer's card is higher.",,2.5,2.08

Four Boxes,"There are four boxes: one brown, one black, one green, and one white. One box is labelled ""15 cents"", one is labeled ""20 cents"", one is labeled ""25 cents"", and one is labeled ""30 cents"". One contains three nickels, one contains three dimes, one contains two nickels and a dime, and one contains two dimes and a nickel. All four boxes are mislabeled.
If a perfect logician who knows all of the above...
1. looked at the label on the brown box and saw two nickels in the box, he would know what the third coin is.
2. looked at the label on the black box and saw two dimes in the box, he would not know what the third coin is.
3. looked at the label on the green box and saw one nickel and one dime in the box, he would know what the third coin is.
What are the labels and contents of each box?","The brown box is labeled ""20 cents"" and contains 15 cents, the black box is labeled ""15 cents"" and contains 30 cents, the green box is labeled ""25 cents"" and contains 20 cents, and the white box is labeled ""30 cents"" and contains 25 cents.
From fact 1, we know that there are at least two nickels in the brown box, so there are either 15 cents or 20 cents. If the box was labeled ""25 cents"" or ""30 cents"", the value of the third coin would be indeterminate, so the box must be labeled ""15 cents"" or ""20 cents"", and the contents of the box are 15 cents if the box is labeled ""20 cents"", and vice versa.
From fact 2, we know that there are at least two dimes in the black box. But since the third coin is indeterminate, the box must be labeled ""15 cents"" or ""20 cents"", implying that there is at most one dime. So the brown box and the black box must be labeled ""15 cents"" and ""20 cents"" in some order.
From fact 3, we know that there is at least one nickel and at least one dime in the green box. Since the third coin is determinate, we know that the label of the box is either ""20 cents"" or ""25 cents"". But since we have determined that the box labeled ""20 cents"" is either brown or black, the green box must be labeled ""25 cents"" and contain 20 cents.
Since the brown box cannot contain 20 cents, it must contain 15 cents and be labeled ""20 cents"", while the black box must be labeled ""15 cents"". This leaves only the white box's label: ""30 cents"".
The box containing 30 cents cannot be the white one, so it must be the black one, and the white box must contain 25 cents.","3 nickels=15 cents.
2 nickels and 1 dime=20 cents.
2 dimes and 1 nickel=25 cents.
3 dimes=30 cents.",2.49,1.29
Wood-cutting Machines,"In a wood-cutting factory, four large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are four back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all four machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the four switches outside the room to the four machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?","Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room and, by listening, test all six combinations of two back-up switches to find which two match the two ""machine-on"" switches inside the room. Only one of the six combinations of two back-ups gives complete silence when switched off and these ""machine-on"" back-ups match the two ""on"" in the room. Now, before returning to the room, leave one ""on"" off and one ""off"" on leaving the other ""on"" on and ""off"" off, that is, only two switches are activated. Back inside the room, we can now match the switches by seeing which ""on"" machine is now off and which ""off"" is now on (when we activate its switch).",,2.49,2.64

Where's the Gold?,"Two boxes are labeled ""A"" and ""B"". The sign on box A says, ""The sign on box B is true and the gold is in box A"". The sign on box B says, ""The sign on box A is false and the gold is in box A"". Assuming there is gold in one of the boxes, which box contains the gold?
1) Box A
2) Box B
3) You can't determine from the information given.","3) You can't determine from the information given.
The sign on box A says, ""The sign on box B is true and the gold is in box A"". The sign on box B says, ""The sign on box A is false and the gold is in box A"". The following argument can be made: If the statement on box A is true, then the statement on box B is true, since that is what the statement on box A says. However, the statement on box B states that the statement on box A is false, which contradicts the original assumption. Therefore, the statement on box A must be false. This implies that either the statement on box B is false or that the gold is in box B. If the statement on box B is false, then either the statement on box A is true (which it cannot be) or the gold is in box B. Either way, the gold is in box B.
However, there is a hidden assumption in this argument, namely, that each statement must be either true or false. This assumption leads to paradoxes; for example, consider the statement: ""This statement is false."" If it is true, it is false; if it is false, it is true. The only way out of the paradox is to deny that the statement is either true or false and label it meaningless instead. Both of the statements on the boxes are therefore meaningless and nothing can be concluded from them.",,2.49,2.0

The groups are: KINGS, QUEENS, RELIGIOUS FIGURES and STOOGES.
Among the KINGS are: James, Saul and Henry.
Among the QUEENS are Victoria, Elizabeth and Candace.
The RELIGIOUS FIGURES consist of the Pope, Mother Teresa and Gandhi.
The STOOGES, of course, are none other than Moe, Larry and Curly.
The Stooges decide to play a game with the rest of the group. The game is called Untouchable. The Stooges start the game by tapping certain ones on the shoulder a specific number of times. The object of the game is for the other groups to figure out the pattern the Stooges set (that is, why they tap certain individuals a certain number of times), and to follow the pattern they set.
The only stipulation to the game is that people belonging to the RELIGIOUS FIGURES group do not tap anyone; however, they can be tapped.
The shoulder taps occur this way, starting with the Stooges (who originated the pattern):
Moe taps James, Gandhi, the Pope  and  Saul twice each.
Larry taps Henry, and Curly once each.
Curly taps Henry and Larry once each.
(The KINGS catch on and do the following):
James taps the Pope, Saul, Gandhi and Moe twice each.
Saul taps Gandhi, Moe and James and the Pope twice each.
Henry taps Larry and Curly once each.
(The QUEENS catch on and do the following):
Elizabeth and Victoria tap each other four times each.

A Prisoner,"A prisoner sat alone in his cell staring through the bars at the six doors to the guardroom beyond them. Suddenly, there was the sound of footsteps. One guard came in through door A and a second entered through door F. They unlocked the cell door. ""We shall set you free,"" said one of the guards, ""but first you must pass through all six doors, each door once only, in the correct order. Three are entrances only and three are exits only. Door A must be followed by door B or E; B by C or E; C by D or F; D by A or F; E by B or D; and F by C or D."" With that the guards left through door B. In what order must the prisoner pass through the doors?","The order is CFDABE. The guards entered through doors A and F and exited at door B. The prisoner must alternate exits and entrances. Let the unknown entrance be X. With a ""_"" denoting an exit door the possible orders are:
(a) _A_F_X ; (b) _F_A_X ; (c) _X_A_F ; (d) _X_F_A ; (e) _A_X_F ; (f) _F_X_A
Neither (a) nor (c) are possible since A is followed by B or E and neither leads to F. Since A can only be preceded by D, (e) and (f) are possible as DA_X_F and _F_XDA, respectively. With D used, door F can only be preceded by C to give DA_XCF and CF_XDA, respectively. Door B must occupy the remaining space in each possibility (third door is exit) so X=E but C cannot follow E in the former and for the latter, B cannot follow F. This eliminates (e) and (f). Since only D precedes A, (b) is possible as _FDA_X and (d) as _X_FDA. For (d), the exit B must occupy a ""_"" but cannot be followed by F, and if it is the first door, neither the C or E that must follow as X can be followed by the remaining E or C, respectively. This only leaves (b) and only C (of the possible B,C,E) can precede F as CFDA_X and B must occupy the final ""_"" as an exit leaving E=X.

Native or Visitor,"Natives lie and visitors tell the truth.  I was having lunch with a salesman and I needed to know if he was a native or a visitor.  Instead of asking him, I saw a woman beside us.

Five Cards,"I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):
X X Q X A
X X X H X
At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):
K J Q T A
X D X H X
Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:
K J Q T A
C D S H C
Therefore there are two CLUBS.","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?",2.48,3.18
Cleverest in the Land,"In the village of Einstown, every villager thought they were the cleverest. They used to argue about it all the time, so eventually the leader devised a clever plan. He pretended to hold a vote for who was the cleverest person, where people had to nominate other villagers to go up to the vote. Everyone in the village would know of everyone nominated except themselves, and they all knew that at least one person got nominated.
Once the nominations were over the leader announced his plan. He said that the first person to come forward and say that they were nominated with proof would be the cleverest person in the village. He told them to go to the village hall at exactly 7:00 pm once they had worked it out. None of the people told each other if they got nominated, as they all wanted to win.
After the first night nobody had come forward. Nobody came forward on the second night either. Nor the third, fourth fifth etc. Eventually on the 30th night a certain number of people came forward claiming to have been nominated. They were all right.
How many people came forward on the 30th night and why? (Assume that they all were clever enough to work the method out).","Call the number of people nominated N.
Any person nominated would know of N-1 people nominated, as they would not know that they themselves were nominated. If there was 1 person nominated, the nominee would know of nobody who was nominated, and therefore would know that they were nominated. Because nobody came forward on the first night there was more than one person nominated.
Using the same logic, anyone on the second night who knew of one person nominated would then be able to work out that they were nominated as there was at least two people. Because nobody came forward on the second night there was at least three.
This carries on all the way up. Nobody came forward on the 29th night, meaning there was at least thirty. People now came forward the next night, so everyone who came forward knew of 29 nominees, meaning 30 people came forward on the 30th night.",,2.48,2.54

Shipwrecked,"There was a shipwreck at sea and Mad Ade, Smelly O'Riley and Elvis impersonator Tavish McPresley were washed ashore on a small island.  Reaching the shore, exhausted, they all fell asleep.
Mad Ade woke first (whilst having a glorious dream about living in a land where Kebabs were served every meal, and twice for breakfast), and saw that a box of bananas had been washed ashore.  Being greedy as he is, he ate one third of the bananas and went back to sleep to continue his Kebab related dreams.
Next, Smelly O'Riley woke up, and seeing the box of bananas, ate one third of what was left and went back to sleep.
Tavish McPresley woke up next and assumed that the other two hadn't eaten any bananas, so he ate one third of what remained.
When Tavish McPresley had finished, there were eight bananas left over.  How many bananas were in the box originally?","27
Solution:
When Tavish finished, the remaining 8 bananas represented 2/3 of the amount that had existed when he started (so each 1/3 = 4).  Therefore there were 12 bananas (4 + 4 + 4)when he started, and when Smelly O'Riley finished.
Following the same logic, the remaining 12 bananas represented 2/3 of the amount that had existed when Smelly O'Riley started (and each 1/3 = 6).  Therefore there were 18 bananas (6 + 6 + 6) when he started, and when Mad Ade finished.
Again, following the same logic, the remaining 18 bananas represented 2/3 of the amount that had existed when Mad Ade started (and each 1/3 = 9).  So, there must have been 27 (9 + 9 + 9) bananas originally.",,2.48,1.4

Twins and Their Mistakes,"Six sets of twins ( a boy and a girl in every case) made several errors in their history and geography examinations; and it was noted that every girl made precisely the same number of errors as her brother in the two subjects. Name each pair of siblings and their surname and work out how many mistakes each made in their history and geography examination papers.
1. The boy (not Luke) whose sister is Louella made more history errors than Sammy.
2. George did better in history than the boy surnamed O'Connell, who made either one more or one less geography error than the twins surnamed Dean.
3. Anne made either one more or one less geography error than Louella.
4. The twins who made 11 geography errors didn't make exactly 11 history errors.
5. David and his sister made either one more or one less mistake in the history exam than the twins who made 14 geography errors.
6. Edward and his sister did worse at history than the pair who made 15 geography errors. Edward made one more error in the geography exam than Luke.
7. The McCall twins didn't make one less history mistake than the Vole twins.
8. Susan (who made seven history errors) made one less geography error than the girl who made one less history error than Anne.
9. The twins surnamed Waters made one more history mistake than the twins surnamed Seal, who made more geography errors than the McCall twins.
10. Gail made one more geography error than the girl who made one more history error than Louella.
11. Martin made either one more or one less geography error than his best friend and his sister, who made more history mistakes than Diane.
12. Wendy and her brother (who didn't make eight history mistakes) didn't make as many errors in geography as George and his sister.
Brothers are David, Edward, George, Luke, Martin & Sammy.
Sisters are Anne, Diane, Gail, Louella, Susan & Wendy.
Surnames are Dean, McCall, O'Connell, Seal, Vole & Waters.
Geography errors are 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 & 16.
History errors are 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 & 12.","Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12. Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.
Anne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12. If the Seal twins made 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10, then (above) the Dean twins are excluded. Thus Sammy's surname is Seal and David's is Waters. Diane's surname is Vole. Martin's isn't McCall (7), so must be Dean. Luke's is McCall.

Cleaning the House,"Ever since Emily began her new job, the last thing she wants to do when she gets home is clean her apartment.  She decided to make a schedule so that she would clean a different room (including the living room) each day (Monday through Friday).  Last week she procrastinated by talking on the phone, so this week, Emily decided to let the answering machine handle  her calls, and she received a different number of messages each day.  Can you determine the which rooms she cleaned each day and the number of messages she received?
Given:
Cleaning Days -- 	Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Number of Messages -- 	1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Rooms Cleaned -- 	Bedroom, Living Room, Bathroom, Den, Kitchen
Clues:
#1) Emily received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, but fewer than on Tuesday.
#2) Emily cleaned the bathroom on the day after receiving just one message and one day before she cleaned the den.
#3) She received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den.
#4) Emily cleaned the kitchen on Wednesday.","Answers:
Monday -- Bedroom -- 3
Tuesday -- Living Room -- 5
Wednesday -- Kitchen -- 1
Thursday -- Bathroom -- 4
Friday -- Den -- 2
**Clue #1:  If she received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, she could not have received 1 message on Thursday as the day she cleaned her room would have to be 0, which is not an option.  She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.
**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.
**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.
**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.
*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.  Looking back at clue 2 gives you the answer for the last section.  She received more messages when cleaning her bedroom than when cleaning the den.  So she received 3 in the bedroom, and 2 in the den.","s:

"Good Scientist, Bad Scientist","One day, a great scientist gone bad decides to wreak havoc on others in his profession. He has another scientist kidnapped, uses an evil formula that disables 4 of the good scientist's five senses: his sight, his smell, his taste, and his sense of touch. He then has him strapped to a bed very securely. He then says, 'I am going to place a single object in the center of this room with you. If you want to live, you will have something to tell me about the object when I return. Please do not insult my intelligence by telling me that it is an object, or an object that I placed in the room, or anything having to do with me, or the object's location for that matter. We both know it is an object, that I put it here, and that it is in the center of the room. You must therefore state a SCIENTIFIC FACT about the object.'
Before leaving though, he says: 'Silly me, I almost forgot...'  (He then disables the good scientists hearing. Now he has none of his senses to work with). He returns after one hour, restores all of the scientist's senses, and says: 'So tell me something about the object professor.' The good scientist saves his own life with his answer, to the chagrin of the evil scientist.
What, though, could he have possibly said, being that he had no senses?","The good scientist simply said: 'It is a SCIENTIFIC FACT that the object you placed in the center of the room with me has MASS.'

Gold Breakout,"Someone has broken into one of the city's most secure bank vaults and stolen some gold bullion. Six suspects have been rounded up. Use the clues to try and narrow down the list of suspects.
The suspects are Alex, Beth, Charlotte, Dave, Emily, and Frank.
Clues:
1. A suspicious-looking masked person dressed in a black hoodie and thick trousers was seen with a bank certified tool kit labelled VAULT MAINTENANCE near the vault.
2. 200 lbs of gold was stolen; 100 lbs carried by each thief.
3. Emily and Dave are workers at the bank.
4. All the suspects are health and fitness fanatics except Dave and Beth.
5. The passages between the vault and the bank entrance are long, narrow, and it is easy to get lost in them.
6. Two people were seen from a distance running to the bank entrance carrying sacks.
7. All the suspects were informed that the theft happened on Saturday night.
8. Alex claimed to have been eating at the fast food place with his friends each evening from last Sunday to Saturday so he couldn't have done it.
9. Frank broke his arm a few days before the theft.
10. Charlotte works as a medical consultant and claimed that she was at home on Saturday night.
11. The bank is very secure.
12. Beth works as a receptionist.
Use the clues. Which of the suspects should be questioned further?","Alex and Emily should be investigated further.
Frank is unlikely to have done it since he broke his arm (clue 9) and the criminals were running carrying heavy amounts of gold (clues 2 and 6).
Beth is unlikely to have done it since she does not work out much (clue 4) and it might be difficult to carry a heavy amount of gold (clue 2) a long way (clue 5).
If Alex is one of the health and fitness fanatics (clue 4), what is the probability of him being at the fast food place for six consecutive evenings in a row? This statement is slightly suspicious and further investigation is required.
Since the bank is very secure (clue 11), and the passages between the vault and bank entrance are long and narrow (clue 5), Emily is a potential suspect. As the bank is secure, it would probably take an employee of the bank to get hold of the gold (Emily or Dave). Since Dave doesn't work out much (clue 4), it would be difficult for him to carry a heavy load of gold a long way while running (clue 6). That leaves Emily.",,2.47,1.56

Pitches,What is the minimum number of pitches that could be thrown in a professional baseball game?,"52.
The minimum number of pitches per batter is one.  If each batter hit a ball in play and flies out or is thrown out then there would be 6 pitches per inning.  Since someone must win in order to finish the game without extra innings, one player could hit a home run on the first pitch.  If the home team is the team that hits the home run, and all of the other batters were out in one pitch, then the game would end at the middle of the 9th inning.  This would be 6 pitches per inning for eight innings, plus one for the home run, plus 3 for the top of the ninth.  Grand total 52 minimum pitches to win a baseball game.",,2.47,1.87

Study Time,"In order to best use his study time, Caleb has enlisted the help of four other students in his philosophy class by forming a study group.  Each of the five students is assigned to read one of the first 5 chapters of their text Great Minds Don't Necessarily Think Alike, and prepare a summary of the chapter to present to the group.  Can you determine the title of each of the five chapters, as well as the student responsible for reading it?
Given:
Chapters -- 		1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Chapter Titles --		Descartes Before DesHorse, Freudian Slippers, I Kant Understand It, Jung At Heart, Sense of Hume-or
Student Names -- 	Alex, Caleb, Joan, Kiera, Toby
Clues:
#1) Alex's chapter immediately follows ""Sense of Hume-or"" and immediately precedes ""Descartes Before DesHorse.""
#2) ""Jung At Heart"" is the name of a chapter that comes somewhere before the chapter assigned to Toby.
#3) Kiera's chapter is three chapters after ""Freudian Slippers.""
#4) Two consecutive chapters, in one order or the another, are ""I Kant Understand It"" and Joan's chapter (which isn't chapter four)","Answers:
Chapter 1 -- ""Jung At Heart"" -- Caleb
Chapter 2 -- ""Freudian Slippers"" -- Toby
Chapter 3 -- ""Sense of Hume-or"" -- Joan
Chapter 4 -- ""I Kant Understand It"" -- Alex
Chapter 5 -- ""Descartes Before DesHorse"" -- Kiera
**Clue #1:  This gives us an order.  We know that three of the chapters are, in this order, (Sense, Alex's, Descartes).  Therefore, Alex's chapter can not be the first chapter, or the last.  ""Sense"" can not be the last chapter, and ""Descartes"" can not be the first.  We can also assume that ""Sense"" nor ""Descartes"" is Alex's chapter.
**Clue #2:  This lets us know that Toby's chapter can not be the first chapter, and that ""Jung"" can not be the last chapter.  We assume ""Jung"" is not Toby's chapter.
**Clue #3:  If Kiera's chapter is three AFTER ""Freud"", then ""Freud"" can NOT be the 3rd, 4th or 5th chapter.  This also means that Kiera's chapter can not be the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd chapters.
**Clue #4:  Joan's chapter is not 4th.  If ""Kant"" is 5th, Joan's would be 4th.  So we know that ""Kant"" is not the 5th chapter.  That leaves ""Descartes"" as the 5th chapter.  Assume Joan's chapter is not ""Kant.""
*********Recall the order given in Clue 1.  This means Alex's chapter is 4th, and ""Sense"" is 3rd.  This also leaves Kiera's as the 5th chapter, which is ""Descartes"".  For hers to be 3 after ""Freud"", ""Freud"" has the be the 2nd chapter.  We know that ""Jung"" comes before Toby's chapter.  This leaves chapters 1 and 4.  If ""Jung"" is chapter 4, Toby's would be 5, but we know that 5 is Kiera's, so ""Jung"" has to be chapter 1.  This makes ""Kant"" chapter 4, and Alex's chapter.  This means that Joans has to be the 3rd or the 5th because of the order between Joan's chapter and ""Kant"" that we were already given, and we already know that Kiera has the 5th chapter.  So we know that Joan has chapter 3, ""Sense.""   After marking off the chapter numbers by the names, you see that Toby's is chapter 2, ""Freud"" and that leaves Caleb with chapter 1, ""Jung.""","s:

Truth or Lies,You are traveling down a path and come to a fork in the road. A sign lays fallen at the path indicating that one path leads to a village where everyone tells the truth and the other to a village where everyone tells lies. The sign has been knocked down so you do not know which path leads to which village. Then someone from one of the villages (you don't know which one) comes down the path from which you came. You may ask him one question to determine which path goes to which village. What question do you ask?,"You point to either path and say, ""Are you from this village?"" If the person answers 'yes' then you are pointing to the truthful village, if they answer 'no' then you are pointing to the lying village.
1)If you point to the truthful village what will a truthful person say in answer to your question?
2)If you point to the truthful village what will a untruthful person say in answer to your question?
3)If you point to the untruthful village what will a truthful person say in answer to your question?
4)If you point to the untruthful village what will a untruthful person say in answer to your question?
The answers to these questions are: 1. ""yes"", 2. ""yes"", 3. ""no"", 4. ""no"".
Note that in the two cases where the answer is ""yes"" you are pointing to the truthful village and in the two cases where the answer is ""no"" you are pointing to the untruthful village. Thus you can tell from the reply to which village you are pointing. You do not have to know to whom you are speaking.",,2.47,1.63
5 Businessmen,"These five businessmen represented different companies at a recent trade fair. Unfortunately, the hotel they were all due to stay in had accidentally double booked their rooms. They tried other hotels in the area, but all were fully booked. Consequently, they all agreed to share the only two rooms available in the hotel - one twin and one triple.
From the clues, can you work out each man's name, company and official title?
1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.
2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.
3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.
4. The businessman from Reed Right did not share a room with Thomas.
5. Clarkson, who does not work for Lantel, shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi but not both.
6. Edgar's surname is either Casson or Graves. Edgar did not share with Carl.
7. The businessman from Chiptech shared with the businessman from Lantel.
8. The CEO shared with the IT Analyst.
9. Casson works for either Blue Teeth or Chiptech.
10. Neither Joshua nor Alan works for ABM Inc.
11. Fielder shared with the Director.
12. The Accountant from Blue Teeth shared with the Developer.
First names: Alan, Carl, Edgar, Joshua, Thomas.
Last names: Casson, Clarkson, Fielder, Graves, Grimaldi.
Company: ABM Inc., Blue Teeth, Chiptech, Lantel, Reed","First Name, Last Name, Company, Position:
Carl Grimaldi, ABM Inc., IT Analyst
Edgar Casson, Chiptech, Director
Joshua Graves, Reed Right, CEO
Alan Clarkson, Blue Teeth, Accountant
Thomas Fielder, Lantel, Developer
To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom. Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:
Room 1
CEO
IT Analyst
ABM delegate
Grimaldi
Carl
Reed Right delegate
Room 2
Edgar
Developer
Thomas
Clarkson
Since the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.
Now this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:
The CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth. Since he is not the Developer (12) he must be the Accountant. This leaves Thomas Fielder who is the Developer for Lantel.",,2.47,2.95

Waterloo Street,"On Waterloo Street, there are five neighbours: the Chaes, the D'Costas, the Lams, the Mazumdars and the O'Neils.  All neighbours live either adjacent to, or directly across the street from one another. Two of their houses are white, one is grey, one is green and one is blue.
From the clues below, determine which side of the street each neighbour lives (north or south) and the colour of their house.
1.  The two white houses are directly across from one another on the west end of the street.
2. The Chaes do not live adjacent to either of the white houses.
3.  The D'Costas live on the same side of the street that the Chaes live.
4.  The blue house is immediately east of the D'Costa house, on the same side of the street.
5.  The Lams house is not grey or white, and is next door to the O'Neils (which is on the south side of the street).
6.  The Mazumdar house is directly across the street from the Lams.","From 1, a white house is on either side of the west end of the street.  Since from 2, the Chaes cannot live next to the white houses, it on the east end of the street (north or south, unknown).
From 3, the D'Costas are in a white house or in the middle between one of the white houses and the Chaes. (Assuming of course that there is a maximum of 3 on either side of the street). From 4, the blue house therefore is either the in between house (if the D'Costa's are in the white house) or the Chae house.
Since from 5, the Lam and the O'Neil houses are on the south side, the Chaes, D'Costas and Mazumdars(from 6) are on the north side. That would make The O'Neils be owners of the white house on the south side, and the Lams the owners of the house beside it. That would make the Mazumdars live in the center house (therefore blue on the north side) and the D'Costas live in the white house.  Since the Lams do not have a grey house, the Chaes do.

Knight's Trouble,"Having failed to achieve his previous goal, the knight wanted to leave Breadland. However, he was captured by the king of Breadland for stepping all around in his kingdom.
The king decided to sentence the knight to death, but before that he wanted to test the knight's intelligence. The king said:
""Play a game of chess with me. You know, in my kingdom, the chessboard is 9x7. Each player has a queen on each side of the king, one is next to the king and the other is between a bishop and a knight. Also, each player has an additional pawn.
But this time the rule is changed. Each player in turn must make TWO legal moves. He can't put his king in check either after his first move or after his second move.
If you win or the game ties, I'll set you free. If I win, I'll sentence you to death immediately.
You move first.""
Could the knight avoid being sentenced to death?","The answer is affirmative.
Assume that the knight couldn't avoid being sentenced. This means that no matter what moves the knight made, the king could always win.
Then the knight could move one of his knights and then move back.
But then every piece would be on its original position, and it would be the king's turn to move, and the knight could win the game, which contradicts our assumption.
Hence, the knight had a strategy to guarantee at least a tie.

This means that if claim 3 is true, then either claim 2 or claim 4 would also be true.  Also, if C had 1 ball, then B has 1 and D has 2 which makes claims 1 and 4 true, or B has 2 and D has 1 which makes all claims lies.

C) Make a third pass.  The following can be determined: B not 8.
D) For D, only four numbers are still valid: 1, 2, 4, and 8.  Plug each of these numbers into D and check the resulting flow of equations.  If D = 1, then the resulting flow will lead to J having to be both 4 and 0.  If D = 2, then the resulting flow will lead to 2 also being assigned to G.

All you have to do to solve this is look at Isaac's first statement:  ""Louis won the fair"".  If this were true then neither of Albert's statements could be true.  Therefore this must be Isaac's false statement.

Light a fuse,"You have 2 fuses. One fuse burns for 1 hour, the other burns for 2 hours. The problem is that the fuses burn irregular. The last few inches may burn longer than first few inches. Using the 2 fuses how can you create a fuse that burns for exactly 45 minutes. Remember, cutting them does no good since you don't know how long the cut fuse lasts.","You burn both sides of the 1 hour fuse and 1 side of the 2 hour fuse at the same time. Regardless of the varying speeds of the one hour fuse, when it goes out it has been 30 minutes. At that point there would be 1 hour and 30 minutes left on the 2 hour fuse. You then light the other end of the 2 hour fuse and since the burning time would be cut in half the fuse would be 45 minutes long.",,2.43,2.57
Joe and Smoe,"Two friends, Joe and Smoe, were born in May, one in 1932, the other a year later. Each had an antique grandfather clock of which he was extremely proud. Both of the clocks worked fairly well considering their age, but one clock gained ten seconds per hour while the other one lost ten seconds per hour. On a day in January, the two friends set both clocks correctly at 12:00 noon. ""Do you realize,"" asked Joe, ""that the next time both of our clocks will show exactly the same time will be on your 47th birthday?"" Smoe agreed. Who is older, Joe or Smoe?","To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again. This is when the slow clock loses six hours, and the fast one gains six hours. This will take 90 days. In 90 days they will come together at 6:00. On a calendar, there are 90 days between noon January 31, and noon May 1 in years with no leap year. If Smoe had been born in 1933, his 47th birthday would have been in 1980, a leap year. This means that Smoe must be older, born in 1932, and the time of this problem is 1979.",,2.43,2.47

The Case of the Dead Boxer,"Tony Jack's worldly possessions were laid out on a small table in police headquarters. They consisted of a T-shirt, sneakers, and white cotton trousers. In a pocket of the trousers was a card, which read:
""July 28. Your weight, 173 lbs. Your fortune, You will enjoy a long life.""
""His life lasted 22 years,"" Inspector Hobbs told Dr. Hall. ""Late last night,"" he continued, ""we got a call to come to the carnival. Somebody had started up a Ferris wheel. We found a male corpse jack-knifed over a strut. Glancing at the man's battered face, I thought he had been beaten. Then I recognized Tony.
""Last night Tony fought 'Killer Malone' for the state middleweight title,"" he continued. ""Tony took a pounding. We know he left the arena still pretty dazed. He must have come out to the carnival. He used to be a roustabout, and he knew his way around.
""It looks like he got here after closing,"" said the inspector, ""used the scale, and then started up the big wheel. He took a ride and fell out. The medical examiner says he died instantly.""
Dr Hall, the famed criminologist, contemplated Tony's possessions.
""He might have been killed elsewhere and hung on the strut,"" said Hall. ""I heard rumors of a fix in the Malone fight.
""It looks to me like Tony refused to take a dive and the mob made him pay the full price. The killers apparently did a clumsy job. To avoid giving themselves away, they changed his clothes and staged the scene out at the Ferris wheel.""
How did Hall know?","Tony fought on the night of his death for the middleweight, one hundred and sixty pounds. When found, he had on someone else's clothing, for the card in his pocket gave his body weight as an impossible ""173 lbs.""

By clue 1, Marc isn't Haynes.
Since the fifth player to score and Haynes are Marc and Matt, in some order (clue 3), Marc is the fifth player and Matt is Haynes.
By clue 1, then, Marc is Hixson and Murphy scored second.
Morris scored first (clue 2).
Since Matt Haynes didn't score third (clue 1), he scored fourth.
By elimination, Mike scored third.
By clue 1, Holmes didn't score second or third; he scored first. Since Mike isn't Hudson (clue 4), he's Hurd, and Murphy is Hudson.",,2.43,2.09
Imprisonment,"There once was a man, who was innocent, who was sent to prison, and was to die the next day by beheading.

Eleven People in a Race,"Eleven people participated in a race. Larry, Matt, Nick, Oscar, and Pete each predicted who would finish first, second, third, fourth, and fifth.
Larry predicted that Audrey would finish first, Brenda second, Charlotte third, Dawn fourth, and Edith fifth.
Matt predicted that Fran would finish first, Gertrude second, Heather third, Edith fourth, and Dawn fifth.
Nick predicted that Gertrude would finish first, Charlotte second, Edith third, Isabelle fourth, and Judy fifth.
Oscar predicted that Fran would finish first, Gertrude second, Kate third, Brenda fourth, and Isabelle fifth.
Pete predicted that Gertrude would finish first, Fran second, Edith third, Audrey fourth, and Charlotte fifth.
As it turned out, Larry predicted two people's places correctly, Oscar and Pete each predicted one person's place correctly, and neither Matt nor Nick predicted anyone's place correctly. Nick and Oscar each correctly predicted (but in the wrong place) two people who would come in first to fifth, and the other three each correctly predicted (but in the wrong place) one person who would come in first to fifth.
Who won?","Isabelle won.
Larry and Oscar each correctly predicted three people who would come in first to fifth. This makes six people altogether, but since there could only be five, there must be some overlap. The only one they both predicted was Brenda, so she, the other two correctly predicted by Larry, and the other two correctly predicted by Oscar must have been the five winners. Neither Heather or Judy could have been a winner.
Suppose Dawn finished first to fifth. Since Matt only correctly predicted one person who would come first to fifth, none of Edith, Fran, or Gertrude could have finished first to fifth. Since Pete correctly predicted two people, Audrey and Charlotte must have been winners. But Larry correctly predicted four people. So Dawn could not have been a winner.
Since neither Dawn nor Heather finished first to fifth, the one Matt predicted correctly must have been Edith, Fran, or Gertrude. This one would also have been one of Pete's winners. His other winner must have been Audrey or Charlotte. This one plus Brenda make two winners for Larry. His third winner must be  Edith.
This means that neither Fran nor Gertrude could have finished first to fifth, and Oscar's three winners must have been Brenda, Isabelle, and Kate. Now that we know that Edith and Isabelle were both winners, we have Nick's two winners, and Charlotte could not have finished first to fifth.
Now we have four winners and six non-winners. This makes ten people altogether. Since there were obviously five winners, the eleventh person, Audrey, must also have finished first to fifth.
Since Nick predicted no one's place correctly, Edith could not have come third, which means that Pete's correct prediction must have been Audrey coming fourth. In turn, this means that Larry's correct predictions must have been Brenda coming second and Edith coming fifth. Since Isabelle could not have come fifth, Oscar's correct prediction must have been Kate coming third, leaving Isabelle in first.",,2.42,1.99
Four Female Athletes,"Four girls, Wanda, Xenia, Yolanda, and Zoe, are standing in a line. Exactly one girl plays baseball and soccer, but not basketball. Here are some facts:
1. Two girls who do not play baseball are standing next to Wanda.
2. Xenia is the only girl standing next to exactly one soccer player.
3. Yolanda is the only girl NOT standing next to exactly one basketball player.
Who plays baseball and soccer, but not basketball?","Yolanda plays baseball and soccer, but not basketball.
Fact 1 tells us that Wanda is standing between two girls. This means that she isn't on either end of the line. The two girls standing next to Wanda do not play baseball, so the girl who plays baseball and soccer but not basketball cannot be either of them. But maybe it could be Wanda.
If Wanda plays baseball and soccer but not basketball, fact 3 tells us that Yolanda is standing at the end of the line next to Wanda, since she is not standing next to any basketball players. But fact 2 contradicts this by telling us that Yolanda cannot be standing next to exactly one soccer player. So Wanda cannot play baseball and soccer but not basketball.
This leaves only the girl standing on the end NOT next to Wanda.
Now we must figure out where Yolanda is in THIS situation. If she's standing on the end next to Wanda, this means that Wanda does not play basketball, but then this would mean that the girl standing between Wanda and the girl on the end not next to Wanda is also standing between two non-basketball players. Similarly, Yolanda cannot be standing between Wanda and the girl who plays baseball and soccer but not basketball, which leaves us with our solution.",,2.42,1.68

The Winning Combination 3,"Well... The Winning Combination is back.. but with a twist!  You are a millionaire... but you have now become very greedy and a cheater.  You spend lots of money on selfish things, and are finding yourself very short of money.  The show has refused to let you back on after you meanly insulted the host.
But you are sneakier than that.  Now, your son has applied to be a contestant and has successfully made it on.  He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.
He is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!
You grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.
The combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.  A 'set' refers to a set of two numbers.
""OK, Dad...
1. The sum of the digits in the third set is less than 14 but greater than 10.
2. The third set of numbers is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
3. If you multiply the second set of numbers by 2 and add 7, then you will get the first set of numbers.
4. The sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.
5. There are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination.  Every other number is in the combination.
6. The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).
Hurry, Dad, hurry!""","The solution is 49-21-75-88.
First of all, we know that there are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination and that every other digit appears at least once (clue 5).
OK, we'll start on the first set.
We know it's a square number (clue 6).
The only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:
25
49
81
Now, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.
So you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.
81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.
25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.
So that leaves with 49.
49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.
Now we know this much:
49-21-??-??
Now we must work on the last two sets.
Clue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
Here are the possible combinations:
11-24
12-25
14-27
15-28
28-41
29-42
41-54
42-55
44-57
45-58
58-71
59-72
71-84
72-85
74-87
75-88
78-91
79-92
81-94
82-95
84-97
85-98
Now, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.
Currently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.
So now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:
58-71
75-88
72-85
Now, we read clue 4.  This tells us the sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.  The sum of the digits in the first set is 13 (4 + 9), and so the only one greater than that is the 75-88 combination (8 + 8 = 16).
So there we have it.
49-21-75-88.

Since nobody guesses just one card correctly and no two people guess the same number of cards correctly, then the number guessed correctly by the three people must be zero, two, and three cards.

Duffus's Tea Goes Green,"Duffus Mcclutski drank a lot of tea and enjoyed collecting teas from all around the world. But Duffus, not wanting to waste any tea, collected the bags after he used them, which posed a little problem as soggy tea bags don't keep well, so he placed them in his basement to dry. But when he went to organize them he forgot what was what, and, wanting to show off his famous Chinese green tea, needed to figure it out before his guests arrived. He had 6 piles, each from a different country: Canada, England, China, Jamaica, India, and the U.S.
Pile A had 2 round and 2 square bags.
Pile B had 4 double folded bags with fuzzy green mould string and tags.
Pile C had 1155 double folded bags with tags string and enough mould to supply a large hospital with penicillin.
Pile D had 2 double folded bags.
Pile E had 1 new unused double folded bag.
Pile F had 10 round and 20 double folded bags with blue slime mould.
- Most of the tea Duffus drank came from England thus leaving the most used bags.
- Canadian tea came in two shapes.
- The tea from India tasted so bad that Duffus burned it as incense rather than drink it. He kept only 1 bag for his collection.
- The Jamaican tea had tags so Duffus knew which they were.
- Duffus remembered that the green tea came in double folded bags
- Duffus also recalled being told that Canadian tea would not go mouldy because the igloos in which the tea was bagged was too cold for mould spores to exist. (Remember he's named Duffus)
- The U.S tea, however, did go mouldy.
So which pile is the Chinese green tea in?","Pile D had the green tea bags.
A= Canada / had 2 round and 2 square bags no mould / Canadian tea came in two shapes / Canadian tea would not go mouldy.
B= Jamaica / had 4 double folded bags with fuzzy green mould string and tags / tea had tags so Duffus knew which they were/ this is the only other tea with tags other than England.
C= England / had 1155 double folded bags/ Most of the tea Duffus drank came from England thus leaving the most used bags.
D= China / had 2 double folded bags (no mould) / green tea came in double folded bags/
E= India / had 1 new unused double folded bag / tea from India tasted so bad that Duffus burned it as incense rather than drink it. He kept only 1 bag for his collection.
F= U.S / had 10 round and 20 double folded bags with blue slime mould. / U.S tea, however, did go mouldy.

Madadian Mail,"Madadia is split, like other countries, into cities, towns and villages. Some are large and some are small. Postman Patel delivers the mail in the village of ""Lardville"".
Now Lardville is so small there is only one street with only ten houses, numbered from 1 to 10.
In a certain week, Patel did not deliver any mail at two houses in the village; at the other houses he delivered mail three times each. Each working day he delivered mail at exactly four houses.
The sums of the house numbers where he delivered mail were:
on Monday: 18
on Tuesday: 12
on Wednesday: 23
on Thursday: 19
on Friday: 32
on Saturday: 25
on Sunday: he never works just in case any murder suspects try to use this as an excuse.
Can you work out which two houses received no mail this week?","If postman Patel would have delivered mail three times at each house, then the total sum of the house numbers per day would be (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)x3=165. Now that sum is 18+12+23+19+32+25=129. The difference is 165-129=36; divided by 3 this is 12. The sum of the house numbers where no mail was delivered is therefore 12. The following combinations are possible:
2+10
3+9
4+8
5+7
Each day at four houses the mail was delivered. On Tuesday the sum was 12. 12 can only be made from four house numbers in 2 ways:
1+2+3+6
1+2+4+5
The same holds for Friday with the sum of 32:
5+8+9+10
6+7+9+10
From this we can conclude that the house numbers 1, 2, 9 and 10 for sure have received mail, which means that the combinations 2+10 and 3+9 are not possible. Also the combination 5+7 is not possible, because mail was delivered either at house 5 or at house 7.
Thus the only remaining solution is: houses 4 and 8.",,2.41,2.62

The Egg Game,There are 2008 eggs lying in front of you. I am also with you waiting to start the game. The goal of the game is to be the person to take that very last egg (or eggs) to win. You and I can each only take between 1 and 100 eggs at a time. You go first. How many eggs must you take initially in order to always win (assuming we both play perfectly)?,"89 eggs.
In order to see this, look at the smallest way possible to guarantee a win; you leave me with 101 eggs. If I take 1 egg, you take all 100; if I take 100 eggs, you take the last one. Therefore you would always win.
If you try with 202, I can take from 1 to 100, so there is 201 to 102 left. Then you would take 100 or 1 egg(s) in order to leave me with 101 again. By simple analysis, you must take 101 eggs over two rounds in order to get down to 101.
19*101 = 1919, so we must take 2008-1919 = 89 eggs to start off with a multiple of 101.","By a perfect game, that means over any two turns, the sum of the number of eggs  you and I take is the same (except of course, excluding the initial move you make).",2.41,2.43

They were triplets, but unfortunately due to a mix up at birth no one knew which was the oldest, the heir to the kingdom. The king decided to set a challenge for his three sons, to determine who should inherit the kingdom. He called his sons and spoke to them all. ""Nobby, Bobby, Rover"" he said ""Behind the castle you will each find an identical plot of land marked with your names.""  At this he held out 3 packets of seeds, one for each son. ""take these and grow me some flowers. I will look at them this time next year."" At that he dismissed his sons and marked the date on the calendar.
One year later he visited the three plots of land he had given his sons. He noted that Nobby's plot was full of beautiful flowers.
He walked on to Bobby's plot which was also packed with beautiful flowers. He ambled around to Rover's only to find nothing more than a patch of muddy ground and some grass.
Later that day he called his sons together. ""Boys, I have made my choice as to who shall inherit the Kingdom of MADADIA!"" he announced. The three brothers waited with bated breath.
"" I shall be leaving it to .......Rover!""
What made King Mad Ade choose his son Rover?","Because he had given them all dud seeds that he knew wouldn't grow.

Caterpillars and snails are much smaller than birds, which are much smaller than foxes, which in turn are much smaller than wolves. Wolves do not like to eat foxes or grains, while birds like to eat caterpillars but not snails. Caterpillars and snails like to eat some plants.
Therefore there is an animal that likes to eat a grain-eating animal. What is it?","The fox likes to eat the bird which likes to eat the grain.
Reason:
The bird is a plant eating animal because it does not like to eat snails, which like to eat some plant, so it does not like to eat ALL such animals.

The fox is not a plant eating animal, because the wolf does not like to eat all plants (specifically grain), and therefore must like eating all animals which like to eat some plants.

Stone Bridge Crossing,"Three people, Ann, Ben and Jen want to cross a river from left bank to right bank. Another three people, Tim, Jim and Kim want to cross the same river from right bank to left bank.
However, there is no boat but only 1 stone bridge consisting of just 7 big stones(not tied to each other), each of which can hold only 1 person at a time. All these people have a limited jumping capacity, so that they can only jump to the stone immediately next to them if it is empty.
Now, all of these people are quite arrogant and so will never turn back once they have begun their journey. That is, they can only move forward in the direction of their destination. They are also quite selfish and will not help anybody travelling in the same direction as themselves.
But they are also practical and know that they will not be able to cross without helping each other.  Each of them is willing to help a person coming from opposite direction so that they can get a path for their own journey ahead. With this help, a person can jump two stones at a time, such that if, say, Ann and Tim are occupying two adjacent stones and the stone next to Tim on the other side is empty, then Tim will help Ann in directly jumping to that stone, and vice versa.
Now initially the 6 people are lined up on the 7 stones from left to right as follows:
Ann Ben Jen emp Tim Jim Kim
(where emp stands for empty stone).
Your job is to find how they will cross over the stones such that they are finally lined up as follows:
Tim Jim Kim emp Ann Ben Jen

Step 2: Tim helps Jen in occupying the newly emptied stone between him and Jim.
Step 3: Ben occupies the stone emptied by Jen.
Step 4: Ben helps Tim in occupying the newly emptied stone.

Ann Tim Ben emp Jen Jim Kim
Step 5: Jen helps Jim in occupying the empty stone.
Step 6: Kim occupies the stone emptied by Jim.
Step 7: Kim helps Jen in occupying the stone vacated by her.
Step 8: Jim helps Ben in occupying the stone vacated by Jen.
Now the people are lined up as follows:
Ann Tim emp Jim Ben Kim Jen
Step 9: Tim helps Ann in occupying the empty stone.
Step 10: Tim jumps to the stone emptied by Ann.
Step 11: Ann helps Jim in occupying the stone vacated by Tim.
Step 12: Ben helps Kim in occupying the stone vacated by Jim.
So now the people are lined up as follows:
Tim Jim Ann Kim Ben emp Jen
Step 13: Ben occupies the empty stone.
Step 14: Kim helps Ann in occupying the stone emptied by Ben.
Step 15: Kim jumps to the stone emptied by Ann.
So finally the people are lined up as:
Tim Jim Kim emp Ann Ben Jen

Bridge Builders,"There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.
He decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.
Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?","Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.
Each company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full ¾ pay for ¾ of a bridge ($750,000).
When Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.  They figured it was not worth the $200,000 to start even building since it was so dangerous and immediately backed out, forcing the Emperor to pay Company B their full asking price of $1,000,000.","2 Hints:

Lost City of Kebabylon,"Once again, Madadia's insipid explorer, Wigan Smith, is on the trail of lost treasure. He has come across a map showing that somewhere in the middle of the Chillivalley desert, there is the lost city of ""Kebabylon"".
To reach it, he will have to travel overland by foot from the coast. On a trek like this, each person who goes on the journey can only carry enough rations for one person for five days, and the farthest Wigan Smith and his group can travel in one day is 30 miles. Also, ""Kebabylon"" is 120 miles from the starting point.
What Wigan Smith is trying to figure out is the fewest number of persons, including himself, that he will need in his group so that he can reach the ""Kebabylon"", stay overnight, and then return to the coast without running out of supplies.
How many persons (including himself) will Wigan Smith need to accomplish this mission?
Bear in mind that Wigan Smith has no moral character when it comes to money and wealth.","3 people (Wigan Smith and 2 others)
This solution only applies because Wigan Smith has no moral character.
As each person can carry five days rations for 1 person , and that the total journey will require 8 days (4 days there, overnight stay, then 4 days back), then the journey would seem impossible. However, Smith  and 2 companions could travel 2 days and have 3 rations each. If one companion ""Mysteriously died"" that night, Smith and his other companion would have 4.5 rations each. At the end of the fourth day they would have 2.5 ration each. If Smith's last companion ""Mysteriously died"" that night, he would have 5 rations, which would be more than enough to stay an extra day and return to the coast.",Only Wigan needs to make the whole journey!,2.38,2.25

1) Karthik is stronger than Essi but can't run as fast as Kit.
2) Essi is stronger than Ashwath but weaker than KK.
3) Srinivas is faster than Karthik and slower than Maha but weaker than Essi.
From observation 1, Karthik is different from Essi and Kit. Hence Karthik may be any one of KK or Maha.
From observation 2, Ashwath is different from Essi and KK. Hence Ashwath may be any one of Kit or Maha.
From observation 3, Srinivas and Karthik are different from Maha and Essi. Hence they may be either KK or Kit.
Combining observations 2 and 3, Ashwath must be Maha, because  Srinivas and Karthik are different from Maha and Essi and  Ashwath is different from Essi, hence the only left out nickname for Ashwath being Maha.
Since Ashwath is Maha and using observation 3 (wherein Srinivas and Karthik are different from Maha and Essi), Charan is left with the nickname Essi.
From observation 3 we have, Srinivas and Karthik may be one of KK or Kit. However from observation 1, Karthik is different from Essi and Kit. Hence Karthik must be nicknamed KK and hence Srinivas is left with the nickname Kit.

(3) Since 7, 25, and anything greater than 9 are also greater than 6, neither (a), (c), or (d) can be the answer because (b) would also be an answer.

Now a little concerned, the boy then looked for a rock that felt hard in his furious grip, and then threw it with all his might to the soft looking apple. The rock was torn into pieces. The boy looked down disappointedly, realizing that surely there was no way to eat the fruit, when before his eyes a little mouse passed carrying an apple.
So, there was a way. Could you tell the boy how to get the apple?","The tree was giving what it was receiving. If you hit it hard, it will be hard. Just as the delicate flowers to the delicate touch, the apple has to be taken softly, not by force.
So, the boy should try delicately to PUT (not take) the apple on the branch, and it will fall into his fingers.","The harder you hit the tree, the harder it becomes...",2.36,1.62

I Read You 5x5,"""Congratulations, Great-Aunt Nora!""  The voice of Victor Summ, her eldest nephew, was tired, but exultant.  Her older sister was the first grandparent among the five Shekrie siblings.
""Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.""  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.
Nora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  ""You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?""
""Cogita's doing great, although we had a bit of a shuffle in the maternity ward.  Hi, Professor diNoni -- you'll love this one.""
""Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.""
""It runs in the family,"" he smiled across two time zones.  ""Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ..."" Vic's voice trailed off.
""Except for one interval?""  Corman filled in.
""Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.""
Nora yelped.  ""You had *eleven*,"" then her left brain caught up, ""no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.""
""De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.""
""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!""
""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.""
He took a cleansing breath.  ""On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?""
""I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?""
Vic broke in, ""He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.""
Corman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  ""Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?""
""Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.""
""Got it.""  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.  Can you do the same?","6:00	Derec
6:10	Adele	0:10 later
6:40	Brand	0:30 later, 0:40 after Derec
7:30	Elena	0:50 later, 1:30 after Derec, 1:20 after Adele
7:50	Caleb	0:20 later, 1:50 after Derek, 1:40 after Adele, 1:10 after Brand.
The missing interval is one hour.
Method:
Number the ten time points from 0 to 11 (6:00 to 7:50).  The only ways to arrange them to get ten different intervals for the births are events at points 0, 1, 4, 9, and 11 and the reverse: 11, 10, 7, 2, and 0.  The clue gives three birth times at 6:00, 6:10, and 7:50, so we have the first arrangement.
The clues about alphabetic and reverse-alphabetic order giving five wrong placements mean that Caleb and Derek were not born 2nd, 3rd, or 4th; Adele and Elena were not born first or last, and Brand was not born 2nd or 4th.
The 50-minute interval given at the end means puts Brand and Elena into the 3rd & 4th spots, which leaves 2nd as the place for Adele.
Finally, we have Caleb and Derec to fill the first and last spots.  Caleb and Nora share a birth position.  The first paragraph mentions that Cogita is Nora's older sister, so Caleb cannot be the firstborn.","There is only one way (plus a mirror-image reflection) to arrange ten different intervals in a span of 11 ten-minute units.

Unlucky Horse,"Seven horses in a farm in Kentucky,
Of three blacks, the oldest is a daddy;
Of two browns, the 3 year old male is called BILLY,
And the horse SNOWY is white as a lily.
Of two half-sister mares, the black won in the Derby,
She's a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY;
BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie,
But faster than either ROCKY or SUNNY.
Three of the horses are ready for the Derby,
A horse must be three years to be an entry;
Maybe this year the farm gets lucky,
Their stallion's loss last year was a pity.
CHALLENGE: Describe the horse that lost in last year's Derby.","SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.
The Derby is for three year old horses. Therefore only a current four year old horse could have lost last year.
SNOWY is the only horse which could have been three last year (four this year).
The farm is preparing three of the seven horses for this years Derby. There must therefore be at least three 3-year old horses among the seven. BILLY is 3-years old. Necessarily, BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY must be 3 years old both. (They are of the same age).
Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year. This would mean that no horse would be four years old as BEAUTY and LUCKY would be one and a half years old. BEAUTY's mom won in the DERBY as a three year old, she could not win and lose at the same time. (The riddle suggests that the farm did not win last year so the mom must be over 5 years old).
In sum, if BILLY, BEAUTY, and LUCKY are three years old, their aunt must be six. BEAUTY's mom must be five or more. The oldest black must be older than the black mom. Only SNOWY could be four this year.
SNOWY is white (given), 4 years as deduced, and male from the fact that it was a stallion which lost last year.
The names of BEAUTY's mom and aunt and that of the oldest black are immaterial. The same is true with the color of lucky.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.",2.36,3.01
A Plane Trip,"Two identical airplanes (Plane A and Plane B) make the round-trip flight from Miami to Las Vegas on different days. They both use the exact same route, have the same layover time in Las Vegas and flight conditions are the same, save one: Plane A experiences no winds on the flight, and Plane B experiences a constant wind that gives it a headwind (flying against the wind) going to Las Vegas, and a tailwind (flying with the wind) back to Miami. If  both airplanes maintain the same airspeed (speed relative to the wind) the entire flight, which airplane will take longer to complete the round-trip? Why?","Plane B will take longer. The headwind decreases Plane B's speed over the ground the same amount as the tailwind increases it. However, the headwind is acting on the airplane for a longer period of time, consequently slowing the plane down longer than the period it was sped up for.",You don't need math to solve it.,2.36,1.72

Mad Ade's Blocks #2,"Mad Ade is once again babysitting for family. The devil's spawn...er...three year old nephew he is watching is playing with some painted wooden blocks that have letters on the side, much like they did in teaser #15201.
Once again there are four blocks, each with a different letter on each side, making a total of 24 letters altogether.
Mad Ade noticed that the devil's...er...his nephew managed to make the following words from the four blocks.
BOXY,
BUCK,
CHAW,
DIGS,
EXAM,
FLIT,
GIRL,
JUMP,
OGRE,
OKAY,
PAWN,
ZEST
Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and once more missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on Kebabs.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?","Block 1: A, B, F, J, R, and S.
Block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
Block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
Block 4: G, H, K, P, T, and X.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that E and A are not on the same block.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that E and O are not on the same block.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that A and O are not on the same block.
Combining these, we conclude that A, E, and O are on different blocks. Assume that A is on block 1, E is on block 2, and O is on block 3.
From the words BOXY and EXAM, we conclude that X is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and O (block 3), so X is on block 4.
From the words BOXY and OKAY, we conclude that Y is not on the same block as A (block 1), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so Y is on block 2.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that M is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and X (block 4), so M is on block 3.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that K is not on the same block as A (block 1), Y (block 2), and O (block 3), so K is on block 4.
From the word BOXY, we conclude that B is not on the same block as Y (block 2), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so B is on block 1.
From the words BUCK and JUMP, we conclude that U is not on the same block as B (block 1), M (block 3), and K (block 4), so U is on block 2.
From the words PAWN and JUMP, we conclude that P is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and M (block 3), so P is on block 4.
From the word JUMP, we conclude that J is not on the same block as U (block 2), M (block 3), and P (block 4), so J is on block 1.
From the words CHAW and BUCK, we conclude that C is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and K (block 4), so C is on block 3.
From the words CHAW and PAWN, we conclude that W is not on the same block as A (block 1), C (block 3), and P (block 4), so W is on block 2.
From the word CHAW, we conclude that H is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and C (block 3), so H is on block 4.
From the word PAWN, we conclude that N is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and P (block 4), so N is on block 3.
Now, we must still have three letters for block 1, and two letters for each of the blocks 2, 3, and 4. We have the following letters left:
D, F, G, I, L, R, S, T, Z
From the words DIGS, FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as D, F, G, L, R, S, and T, so I is on the same block as Z. Furthermore, I and Z are on block 2, 3, or 4.
From the word ZEST, we conclude that Z is not on the same block as E (block 2), so Z is on block 3 or 4.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that G and R are not on the same block as E (block 2), and O (block 3), so G and R are on block 1 or 4, but not on the same block.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 or 4), so I is on block 2 or 3. Since Z is on block 3 or 4, I and Z must be on block 3. Now we have all six letters of block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that L is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 and 4), so L is on block 2.
From the words FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that F, G, L, R, and T are not on the same block as L (block 2), and from the word ZEST, we conclude that S is not on the same block as E (block 2). So D must be on block 2.
Now we have all six letters of block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
From the words GIRL and DIGS, we conclude that G is not on the same block as R and S.
From the words FLIT and ZEST, we conclude that T is not on the same block as F and S.
Combining this, F, R, and S must be on the same block (block 1), and G and T must be on the same block (block 4).",,2.35,2.78

Old Man Justice and the Rotten Rascals,"One day three kids decide to wreak havoc in town-again (this is the third time this month). This time they run into an old man's grocery store and steal quite a few items. They hit the wrong spot this time, because this was Old Man Justice's place (he's notorious for meting out his own brand of 'justice'). Old Man Justice chases the kids through town, and during the chase, they drop the goods, turn around, and start chasing him. Unfortunately, the old man falls into a ditch and is badly hurt. A month later after he recovers he is able to identify the culprits, and Old Man Justice calls in his 'support team,' (2 of which were also victims of the thieves), and has the perpetrators rounded up for justice. At a dinner later that evening, dubbed the 'Repast of Right' the old man begins with these words:
'To do what we've done took moxie and nerve,
But alas! As we eat, our justice is served.
As we've judged these few, let's render to each their due,
Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'
(What we see as JUST, is JUST what we do.)
Neither trial, nor jury, should these ones receive,
No more to trouble us, for no more shall they breathe!
So drink wine of success, and not of defeat,
Justice is waiting, so friends let us eat.'
Question:
Provided that Old Man Justice and those in his group are not cannibals, how are these three guilty kids punished by the people at the dinner?","The Old man and his group certainly did EAT THE KIDS, (as implied by the words of Old Man Justice), but they were of course young goats, and not young delinquent children.
Notice that justice is going to be 'served' along with this meal. Also, this extreme justice is also going to result in the kids not-breathing, (meaning they will die), and thus won't be any more trouble. It is not an 'eye for eye' but more like 'one for two' because Old Man Justice was only injured, not killed, therefore the 'justice' is not proportionate to the crime.

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.
((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds
((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds
((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds
Of the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.
13, 19, 20, 22, 23 (13 insects & 19 birds)
15, 16, 17, 24, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
15, 16, 19, 22, 25 (15 insects & 22 birds)
15, 17, 18, 22, 25 (15 insects & 22 birds or 17 insects & 25 birds)
15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",,2.34,3.03

A Series of Headaches,"The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.
[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.
[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.
[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.
The Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).
Based on this information, which of these statements is accurate?
1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.
3. The World Series winner is uncertain.
The bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.","The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.
[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying ""there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.""
[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:
Prime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]
Square - 0,4,9 [2 games each]
Neither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]
Since all of the ""neither prime nor square"" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 ""prime or square"" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.
[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.
We now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd. So Detroit did not score less than 3 in any game, which means the Reds could have won a maximum of just three games: those in which they scored 7, 9, 12.",": In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.",2.34,2.8

1) This calendar year is not a leap year.
2) In this calendar year, the 15th of January and 15th of October fall on the same day of the week.
3) In this calendar year, the 10th of July and 10th of October fall on the same day of the week.
4) There will be 53 Sundays in this calendar year.","Statement 3 is false
The statements given about the calendar year are
1) This calendar year is not a leap year.

3) In this calendar year, the 10th of July and 10th of October fall on the same day of the week.
4) There will be 53 Sundays in this calendar year.
Since the calendar year started with a Sunday and ends with a Sunday too, the year must not be a leap year, since only non leap years start and end on the same day of the week. Hence statement 1 is definitely true.
Also in a non leap year, the calendar of January matches with that of October. Hence the 15th of January and 15th of October must fall on the same day of the week. Hence statement 2 is also true.
Lastly if a year starts on a Sunday and ends on a Sunday too, that calendar year has 53 Sundays. Hence statement 4 is also true.

Tarun is not lighter than Vineet and not heavier than Kiran. No two boys are equal in either height or weight. Can you determine the shortest boy and the lightest boy among the four boys?","Let us list the observations about the four boys Prashant, Vineet, Tarun and Kiran.
1) The shorter of Tarun and Kiran is the heaviest of all four.
2) The lighter of Prashant and Vineet is the tallest of all four.
3) The shorter of Vineet and Tarun is the heavier of the two.
4) The taller of Prashant and Kiran is the lightest of all the four.
5) Tarun is not lighter than Vineet and not heavier than Kiran.
6) No two boys are equal in either height or weight.
From observation 5, Tarun must be heavier than Vineet and lighter than Kiran using observation 6 which states that no two boys are equal in weight.
Since Tarun is heavier than Vineet, from observation 3 Tarun must be the shorter of the two. Also since Tarun is lighter than Kiran, from observation 1 Tarun must be taller than Kiran, resulting in Kiran being the heaviest of all the four (from observation 1).
Since Kiran is the heaviest of all the four, from observation 4, Prashant must be lighter than Kiran resulting in Prashant being the lightest of all the four (from observation 4).
Now we know that Tarun is shorter than Vineet. From observation 2, Prashant is the tallest of all the four since he is the lightest in the group. Also we have Tarun must be taller than Kiran, thus making Kiran the shortest in the group. (Kiran is shorter than Tarun who is shorter than Vineet with Prashant as the tallest in the group).
Thus ranking them according to height and weight, we get the following table
Rank	Height	     Weight
1	Prashant         Kiran
2	Vineet	     Tarun
3 	 Tarun	     Vineet
4      Kiran           Prashant

If Rachel had one queen and one king, her third card had to be an ace, contradicting fact 2. If Sara had one queen and one king, her other two cards had to both be aces. Therefore, Queenie had one queen and one king.
Since Queenie had the most singletons, Rachel and Sara could each have only had one at most. If Sara had no singletons, then they had to be two queens and two kings, leaving Rachel with one of each rank, contradicting fact 2.
This means Sara must have one singleton and three other cards, all of the same rank. Fact 3 tells us that three of Sara's cards must be queens. If Sara's fourth card was the ace, then Rachel had three kings, contradicting fact 3. This means that Sara's fourth card was a king, leaving only Rachel with an ace.","A card is a singleton if it is the only card of its rank (ace, two, etc.) in its hand.",2.33,1.49
Three Men and Three Women in a Hotel,"Three men, Ian, Jeff, and Kevin, and three women stayed in a hotel. Each of the six people stayed in a different one of these six rooms:
Room A: medium, borders rooms B and F
Room B: small, borders rooms A, C, and F
Room C: medium, borders rooms B, D, E, and F
Room D: small, borders rooms C and E
Room E: large, borders rooms C, D, and F
Room F: large, borders rooms A, B, C, and E
Ian said, ""I stayed in a large room."" Jeff said, ""I stayed in a medium room."" Kevin said, ""I stayed in a small room."" Exactly one of them lied.
Of the three rooms occupied by the men, only the liar's room bordered exactly two rooms occupied by women.
Who lied?","Ian lied.
If the liar was in a large room, he didn't say, ""I was in a large room."" Ian, a truthteller, would have been in the other large room. A similar situation exists for the other rooms. Now we know that the room that was the same size as the liar's room was occupied by a truthteller.
If the liar bordered 4 rooms, 2 were occupied by women and 2 by men. The 1 remaining room must be occupied by a woman.
If the liar was in C, A was occupied by a man AND by a woman. If the liar was in F, D was occupied by a woman and E by a man. If C was occupied by a woman, the truthteller in E would have bordered 2 women, so C must have been occupied by a man. A and B must both have been occupied by women, but now the truthteller in C must border 2 women.
If the liar bordered 3 rooms, 2 were occupied by women and 1 by a man. 1 of the 2 remaining rooms was occupied by a man and 1 by a woman.
If the liar was in B, D was occupied by a man and E by a woman. C was occupied by a man, and A and F by women. But now the truthteller in C borders 2 women. If the liar was in E, F was occupied by a man and C and D by women. Exactly 1 of A and B was occupied by a woman, but this room plus C, both occupied by women, border F, occupied by a truthteller.
So the liar bordered 2 rooms, both occupied by women.
If the liar was in D, B was occupied by a man and C and E by women. But whether A or F was occupied by a woman, this room plus C, both occupied by women, would both have bordered B, occupied by a truthteller. So the liar was in A. This means that C was occupied by a man and B and F by women. If E was occupied by a man, it would have bordered 2 rooms occupied by women (D and F). So E was occupied by a woman and D by a man.
Now we know that C and D were both occupied by truthtellers. C must have been occupied by Jeff and D by Kevin, leaving only Ian.",,2.33,2.11
The Dwarvish Feast,"In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)","It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.
How this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.
If there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,2.33,2.89
Red 8's,We wrote down all the 3 digit numbers in an increasing order. We used a red pen for the even numbers digits and a blue pen for the odd numbers digits. How many red 8's are there on the paper?,"From 100-109 there is 1 eight (108). From 110-119 there is another 8. So for every 10 numbers there is one number that has an 8. But, the ten digits from 180-189 are different since the tens column now has an eight. There are 5 even numbers in those 10 digits so there must be 5 eights but 188 has 2 eights and it is an even number. So, that means that there are 6 eights in the 180-188 digits. Altogether, the number of eights from 100-199 is 9+6. Since there are 9 hundred numbers (0-99 doesn't count), it would have been multiplied it by 9 but 800-899 is different so only multiply it by 8. Now, figure out how many eights are in the 800-899 numbers. There are more than 50 since there are 50 even numbers where the eight is the hundreds digit. But, 808, 818, etc have 2 eights. So, add 9 more eights because 880-889 is different. Now we have 8(9+6)+50+9 red 8's. There are 5 even numbers in the 880-889 numbers. So, add 5 but 888 has 3 eights so add 1 more. Now we have 8(9+6)+50+9+5+1. Then, simplify:
8(9+6)+50+9+5+1
=8(15)+50+9+5+1
=120+50+9+5+1
=185
So, the answer is that there are 185 red eights on the paper.","Do it in hundreds. First finds how many 8's there are from 100-199, then 200-299, and so on.",2.33,2.16

Obviously, A and B are not the farmer.

Since they know there cannot be four hats with the same color, they will know their hat color is the same as the one man with the different colored hat. The two people who see those colors will know their hat color. The other three will see a balanced number of hat colors, so they won't know what color their hat is.

Shopping Trip,"Mad Ade went to town with £50, but returned at night with £150.  He
bought a hat at a clothing store and a mega sized Kebab from the ""Sweaty Chef"" kebab shop, then he had his eyes tested.
Here are a few facts:
Mad Ade gets paid every Thursday by check.
The banks are only open on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.
The eye doctor is closed on Saturday.
The ""Sweaty Chef"" kebab shop is closed on Thursday and Friday.
On what day did Mad Ade go to town?","Tuesday.
Solution:
Since Mad Ade returned with more money that he left with, he must have
gone on a day when the bank was open.  So he must have gone on
Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday.  But, he got his eyes tested, and
since the eye doctor is closed on Saturday, it couldn't have been
Saturday.  He also went to the ""Sweaty Chef"" which is closed Thursday and
Friday, so that eliminates Thursday, so it must have been a
Tuesday when that Mad Ade went to town.",,2.32,1.29

Acquainted,"You and your spouse invite four other couples to a party. During the course of the conversation, it is discovered that, prior to the party, each person except you was acquainted with a different number of the people present. Assuming the acquaintance relationship is symmetric (i.e., if you are acquainted with someone, that person is also acquainted with you), then how many people did your spouse know prior to the party? How many people did you know?","Start with the assumption that everybody knows their own spouses -- which means that everybody there knew at least one person. Discounting yourself, everyone knows a different number of people, which means that (again, discounting yourself) one person knows one, one person knows two, one person knows three, etc., up to one person who knows nine people (everybody else). Number the people (besides yourself) according to how many people they know, so that person 1 is the one who knows one person, person 2 is the one who knows two people, etc.
Now pair up people with their spouses. If person 9 knows everybody else, s/he must be the only person who knows person 1, because person 1 only knows one person. So they must be married. Person 8 knows everybody except for person 1. Person 2 therefore knows person 8 and person 9. Person 9 is married to person 1, so person 2's spouse must be person 8. Person 7 knows everybody except for persons 1 and 2. Person 3 therefore knows persons 7, 8, and 9. Persons 8 and 9 are married to persons 2 and 1 respectively, so person 3's spouse must be person 7. Person 6 knows everybody except for persons 1, 2, and 3. Person 4 therefore knows persons 6, 7, 8, and 9. The only one of those not yet paired up is person 6, so person 4 and person 6 must be married.
This leaves person 5, who knows everyone except persons 1, 2, 3, and 4. These five people, therefore, must be persons 6, 7, 8, 9, and you. Since you are the only one of these five not yet paired up, person 5 must be your spouse. So your spouse knew five people prior to the party.
The above also determines that the people who know you are persons 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. So you knew five people prior to the party also.",,2.32,2.41

Romankachi Card Game!!!,"I woke up late that morning to welcome a bright sunny day after a long and hectic week. It was a holiday and I was determined to spend the day playing cards with my friend Tweeto. Tweeto's favorite card game was the Romankachi card game.
The rules of the game are as follows :-
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
We started off with 5 cards each and I served in the first round.
At the end of three rounds if I had exactly 4 cards then which of the following statements must be true:-
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement is true. One or more statements may be true.","Statements A and C must be true.
The rules of the Romankachi card game are given below.
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
The given statements are
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
Since we started the card game with 5 cards each and I started of the first round, at the end of three rounds I can have 4 cards due to any one of the following two results.
First Result :
I served in the first round and won. Hence I served in the second round but lost. Tweeto served in the third round and again I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.
The number of cards with me and Tweeto is tabulated below.

Round 2    6           4
Round 3    4           6
Applying the given statements  to the above table, we can observe that statements A and C are true since Tweeto won exactly two rounds and Tweeto won the third round. Statement B is true here because I won the first round.
Second Result :
I served in the first round and lost. Hence Tweeto served in the second round but he lost. I served in the third round and I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.
The number of cards with me and Tweeto is tabulated below.

Applying the given statements  to the above table, we can observe that statements A and C are true since Tweeto won exactly two rounds and Tweeto won the third round. Statement B is false here because I lost the first round.
Hence it is clear from both the results that statements A and C must be true for me to end up with 4 cards at the end of three rounds.",,2.31,2.44

Kebabama Canal,"Since the turn of the last century one of the quickest ways to traverse from one end of the legendary land of Madadia to the other was via the Kebabama canal. Regular passenger cruises traveled the length of the Kebabama canal every day.
On one particular run there were six passengers who all required certain conditions whilst travelling on the three day journey.
Each level of the cruiser contains six cabins numbered 1-6 consecutively, and were arranged in a row and are separated by thin dividers. These cabins must be assigned to the six passengers based on following facts.

From (2), cabin number 5 is assigned to Miss D'work.
As Miss D'work is allergic to smoke and Mr. Lastrain, Mr. Buss & Mr. Meaner all smoke, they must be in cabin numbers 1, 2 and 3 not necessarily in the same order. Also, Miss Fortune and Mr. Allot must be in cabin 4 and 6.
From (3), Mr. Buss must be in cabin 3 and Mr. Allot must be in cabin 4. Thus, Miss Fortune is in cabin 6.

Chess League !!!,"Four players - Anand, Karpov, Ivanchuk, and Polgar - participated in a chess competition in which each player played  exactly one game with each of the other three players. At the end of the competition the results were as follows :-
1) Karpov won against Ivanchuk, who did not win against Anand.
2) The number of games won by Anand is equal to the number of games won by Ivanchuk.
3) No game ended in a draw.
Then which of the following definitely is true :-
a) Ivanchuk lost to Polgar.
b) Anand lost to Karpov.
c)  Polgar lost to Anand.
d) Karpov lost to Polgar.","The given observations about the individual Round Robin games are as follows:
1) Karpov won against Ivanchuk, who did not win against Anand.
2) The number of games won by Anand is equal to the number of games won by Ivanchuk.
3) No game ended in a draw.
Let us represent Anand, Polgar, Karpov and Ivanchuk by A, P, K and I respectively.
The from the given data we have
Game        Winner
A-K
A-P
A-I                A
K-P
K-I                I

since Ivanchuk lost both the games against Karpov and Anand from observation 1.
Now from observation 1, Anand has definitely won one game since he beat Ivanchuk. From observation 2, the number of games won by Anand is equal to the number of games won by Ivanchuk. Since Ivanchuk has lost both games, he should at least win the last game so that the number of games won by him is equal to those won by Anand. Also since Anand has won one game, he cannot win games against Karpov and Polgar since Ivanchuk cannot equal him then, after having lost two out of three games. Hence Anand must lose to Karpov and Polgar and Ivanchuk must win against Polgar.
Hence among the given statement b which suggests that Anand lost to Karpov must definitely be true.",,2.3,2.15

From (1) and (3), the house number must be from 50 to 59 or 70 to 79. Take any number. It will be either a multiple of 3 or not. Also, a number multiple of 6 is always a multiple of 3. Hence, the house number can be 51, 54, 57, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76, 77 or 79.
From (2), if the house number is not a multiple of 4, then it is a number from 60 through 69. There is not a single number between 60 and 69 in short-listed numbers above. Hence, the house number must be a multiple of 4 i.e. 76.

U.N.K.A.L,"MADADIA has been chosen to host the latest United Nations Kebab Annual Liaisons (U.N.K.A.L).
Madadia's mayoress, Madka Owdiseez, has invited several wives of delegates of UNKAL for an informal luncheon.
She plans to seat her 9 guests in a row such that each lady will be able to converse with the person directly to her left and right. She has prepared the following list.
Mrs. F speaks English only.
Mrs. G speaks English and French.
Mrs. H speaks English and Russian.
Mrs. J speaks Russian only.
Mrs. K speaks English only.
Mrs. L speaks French only.
Mrs. M speaks French and German.
Mrs. N speaks English and German.
Mrs. O speaks English only.
How many distinct seating arrangements are possible? Give all possible seating arrangements. Bear in mind that Madka Owdiseez is not one of the 9 to be seated in a row.
Note that ABCD and DCBA are the same","With each arrangement considered identical to its reverse, there are 126 possible arrangements.
FKO are interchangeable, and can be arranged 6 ways. FKO stays together unless N is next to M outside GLM (more on that below).
JH must be together, and J must be at the end, because H is the only other Russian speaker. JH has 2 slots in the above configuration (H next to FKO, with J on the outside).
GLM has 1 slot in the above configuration (G next to FKO, opposite JH).
2[JH]*6[FKO]*1[MLG]=12 arrangements, or 2 mirror groups of 6 arrangements each. Thus, 6 distinct arrangements - 1 for each FKO order.
Keeping the above groups self-contained, N has 5 slots (2 within FKO, 1 between FKO and H, 1 between FKO and G, 1 beside M). That makes 30 arrangements - 5 for each FKO order.
When N is in certain positions, however, the groups can break up. Unless N is next to M outside GLM, GLM can be GML. If N is between FKO and GLM, GLM can scramble, and G can be anywhere touching FKO, except N cannot touch L. When G-[L/M]-N are consecutive in either direction, FKO can straddle that subgroup. That makes 126 arrangements - 21 for each FKO order.
Here are the 21 arrangements, using xxx for the interchangeable FKO.

"Truth, Lie or Both ...","There are three students Anu, Bob and Coy. They have exactly three books - one on Physics, one on Chemistry and one on Math. Each of these three books belongs to exactly one of the students. As I wanted to know the names of the respective owners of the books I asked them about the owners of the books. The following are the answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy.
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
I knew that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Which of the following statements can then be concluded?
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement can be concluded. One or more statements can be concluded.","All the three given statements can be concluded.
The given statements are
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
The answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy to my query about the owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books are as follows :-
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Case 1 : Let us assume that Anu always tells the truth.
Then according to Anu's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Maths book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Anu's reply with that of Bob's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy lies three times when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 1, Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie and Coy always lies. Also in this case the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Case 2 : Let us assume that Bob always tells the truth.
Then according to Bob's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Bob's reply with that of Anu's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Anu speaks the truth, lies and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Coy lies, speaks the truth and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 2, Bob always speaks the truth, Anu and Coy alternate between truth and lie and hence this case is not possible since it is given that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Case 3 : Let us assume that Coy always tells the truth. Here we can again make two sub cases.
a) According to Coy's answer,
Maths book belongs to Anu.
Physics book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
b) According to Coy's answer,
Chemistry book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Physics book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is also not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
Hence among the three cases, only Case 1 can be considered to be a valid case wherein Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie, Coy always lies and the Chemistry book belongs to Bob. Hence all the given statements 1, 2 and 3 can be concluded.",,2.29,2.51

The Experiment,"Three human subjects underwent an experiment. They were each given one letter that could be found in the following words:

They were all in the same room when a woman came through the door and sat down in front of them. She asked the first patient if he knew the what the word was that could be spelled using all three of the letters. He said yes. She then asked the other two patients and they both said yes.
What was the word and how did all three know having only one letter and not knowing the other two?","The word it spelled was 'the'.
The first subject answered yes, he knew the word. This told subject two that subject one had a letter that appeared only once throughout all five words. This means patient one's letter had to have been 'h', 'f', 'l', 'd', or 'g'. This in turn informed subject two that 'bet' could not be the word.
The third subject also made the same progress as subject two, figuring out that subject one's letter had to have been one that appeared only once. 'Bet' was then eliminated and subject two said yes, he knew the word. Subject three knew that if subject two knew the word, he had to have had a 'b', 'e', 'l', or 'd'. Subject three could then eliminate the word 'fit' from the list.
Patient three could only have had either an 't' or an 'i'. If he had an 'i', the word could have been 'lid' or 'big', but since he said yes he must to have had an 't'.",Assume that they did not cheat in any way and that each genuinely knew only the letter that they were given and that they told the truth when they said yes.,2.29,2.26

Water Locks,"A canal in UK has 13 locks and no water supply at the top.
Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
A truck capable of carrying 22 tons of water is rented to bring water from the bottom to the top.
Is the contract reasonable, and why?","At first thought:
We could think that 13 x 7,000 litres = 91,000 litres that would be lost, against 22 tons.
22 tons equal 22,000 Litres (1 ton of water = 1000 kg = 1000 litres = 1 m3).
So we would lose 91,000 litres to gain 22,000 litres: contract is not worth it.
On second thought:
Certainly, each lock loses 7,000 litres, but it takes the water from the level above!
Hence, by succession, we only lose 7,000 litres from the top level, no matter how many locks we have!
The balance, then, is 22,000 litres - 7,000 litres = 15,000 litres: the contract is worth it!
On third thought (the engineering approach):
Unfortunately, waterways ""lose"" water in a continuous manner: by evaporation, by ""leaks"" to the underground water table, by ""leaks"" through the locks.
Now come two more factors: the length of the canal (which determines the evaporation and leaks to underground), and the TIME it takes to bring the water upstream.
If the whole of the canal loses 3,000 litres/hour and it takes the boat 5 hours to reach the top, the exercise is pointless (just maintaining the levels).  Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.
On fourth thought (the economics):
If the engineering balance is ""close to equilibrium"", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.",Where are the water losses?,2.29,2.83

So Statement (4) or Statement (5) or Statement (6) is false. Also, Statements (1), (2) and (3) all are true.
From (1) and (2), there are 11 men and women. Then from (3), there are 2 possible cases - either there are 8 men and 3 women or there are 3 men and 8 women.

Babelfish Court,"Many moons ago Mad Ade lived in a block of houses called  Babelfish Court.
There was a number of residents from different cultures all living together, speaking various languages. 3 speak Greek, Italian and English, 2 speak Greek and Italian, 7 speak English, 2 speak Italian and English, 1 speaks English and Greek, 1 speaks Italian only and 3 speak Greek only. How many residents are there altogether?","There are 13 Residents of  Babelfish Court.
If we start by adding up the number of people who speak 1 language only.
1 speaks Italian only
3 speak Greek only
Equals 4 people
Then add up those who speak more than one language.
3 speak Greek, Italian and English
2 speak Greek and Italian
2 speak Italian and English
1 speak English and Greek
Equals 8  people
4 + 8 = 12
However if you look at the people that speak more than one language 6 of them speak English but the clues tell you that 7 people speak English, hence 1 person speaks English only.
So
4 + 8 + 1 = 13 Residents",,2.27,2.23

Cornerstones !!!,"Six boys A, B, C, D, E and F have to stand in a row. B and C are together, but they cannot be at either of the ends. F is at the right of E and there is exactly one boy between them. D cannot be next to F. Who should always stand at one of the ends?","D must always stand at one of the ends.
The observations that can be derived are:-
1) B and C are together, but they cannot be at either of the ends.
2) F is at the right of E and there is exactly one boy between them.
3) D cannot be next to F.
Let us first number the positions from 1 to 6(from left to right), place E and F in different positions and analyze the cases.
From observation 2, we can derive the following cases:-
Case 1  2  3  4  5  6
1       _  _  _  E  _  F
2       _  _  E  _  F  _
3       _  E  _  F  _  _
4       E  _  F  _  _  _
where the blank spaces indicate positions where the others stand.
Considering each of the above cases individually we have,
Case 1 : B, C and D cannot go into position 5, since B and C are together always and D cannot be next to F from observations 1 and 3 respectively. Hence A must go into position 5 and D into position 1 (since from observation 1, B and C cannot be at either of the ends).
Case 2 : B and C cannot be given positions 1 and 2 (since from observation 1, B and C cannot be at either of the ends), neither do they fit into any other positions in this case. Hence this case is not possible.
Case 3 : B and C cannot be given positions 5 and 6 (since from observation 1, B and C cannot be at either of the ends), neither do they fit into any other positions in this case. Hence this case is also not possible.
Case 4 : B, C and D cannot go into position 2, since B and C are together always and D cannot be next to F from observations 1 and 3 respectively. Hence A must go into position 2 and D into position 6 (since from observation 1, B and C cannot be at either of the ends).
From the above 4 cases it is clear that one of the cornerstones must always be D and the other can be either of E or F.",,2.27,1.83
Mad Ade's Garden,"Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?","Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.
Summary:
Tomatoes, Five, 27th, North
Peppers, Three, 28th, South
Radishes, Four, 25th, East
Lettuce, one, 29th, West
Broccoli, two, 30th, Northwest",,2.27,3.09
The Kebab Express,"In the land of MADADIA there are two cities, one called Kebabville and one called Kebabchester. Each at opposite ends of the country. There is a train service between the two cities called the ""Kebab Express"" that starts at 10:00pm for each city and arrives at their respective destinations at 11:30pm three days later. So a train will leave every day from either city at 10:00pm and arrive at the opposite city at 11:30pm in three days time.
One day Mad Ade got on the train at Kebabville and travelled all the way to Kebabchester. How many other ""Kebab Express"" trains would Mad Ade see go the opposite direction during his journey?","Mad Ade would see seven ""Kebab Express"" trains go past in the opposite direction.
Let's say that Mad Ade travelled on the ""Kebab  Express"" on Wednesday 10:00PM from Kebabville. The first train he would have crossed is the one scheduled to arrive at Kebabville at 11:30 PM the same day i.e. the one that left Kebabchester at 10:00 PM on last Sunday.
He will pass 7 other trains before arriving at his destination. The first, he will see approximately 45 minutes after departure. Then he will see one train approximately every 12 hours for three days. This is because the trains leave from each end of the track once every 24 hours travelling toward each other.
Also, he would have crossed the last train just before reaching Kebabchester on Saturday.
Thus, Mad Ade must have crossed 7 ""Kebab Expresses"" during his journey.",,2.27,2.32

5 Wood-cutting Machines,"In a wood-cutting factory, five large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are five back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the five switches outside the room to the five machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?","1) Turn off two machines while inside. Let's call those two machines turned off with inside switch 'inactive', and call remaining three machines 'active'.
2) Go outside.
3) Find out which two outside switches correspond to inactive machines, and which correspond to active machines. To do that, try all of following ten combinations, where 'x' represents turned-off outside switch, while 'O' represent turned on switch: xxx00,xx0x0,x0xx0,0xxx0,xx00x,x0x0x,0xx0x,x00xx,0x0xx,00xxx . Only one of these combinations is a 'silent' combination that eliminates all sound, by turning off all three active machines.
4) Label outside switches related to active machines (those marked with 'x' in the silent combination) with A, B, and C. Label outside switches related to inactive machines with D and E.
5) For inactive machines, turn D off and E on.
6) For active machines, turn A and B on, and turn C off.
7) Wait enough time for machine connected to C switch to cool off, and then turn B off, too.
8) Go inside.
9) The only machine that is still working inside is connected to outside switch A.
10) Check both machines that were active and are now turned off. The one that is warmer is connected to switch B (since it was on most recently), and the cooler one is connected to switch C (which was turned off first).
11) Turn inside switches on for both 'inactive' machines. The one that starts working is connected to outside switch E. The one that is still not working is connected to outside switch D.","Aside from sight, use other senses.",2.27,2.84

Too Many Women,"In a far far land, there was a long war.
Many men died in that war, and when it was over
there were not enough men to marry all the women in the kingdom.
The king wanted balance between men and women, so he issued an order that any woman who gives birth to a girl, will stop having children after that.
His theory was that there would be several families with one girl and one or no boys,
but there would also be families with several boys and only one girl, and so after a few years the number of males in the kingdom would increase.
What was wrong with the king's plan and why won't it work?","Assuming that the birth rate between boys and girls is 1:1,
At first, half the women would give birth to boys, and half would give birth to girls.
Then, only one half would be able to continue having children, so half of them will have boys, and half will have girls, and so on...

Art Logic,"A plain white cube has gone through 4 steps to become what it is now. The steps (not necessarily in order) are:
a) The whole cube being painted red
b) A white circle being painted on every face except for the top and back
c) The front and back faces being painted black
d) The top, back, and bottom being painted blue
All of the following facts about painting the cube are true:
1. After the last of the four steps, the top face was all purple, the left and right faces were red with a pink circle in each of their centers, the front black with a gray circle, the bottom purple with a light blue circle, and the back completely dark blue.
2. Color mixing goes as follows:
-Red+Blue=Purple
-Black+White=Gray
-Red+White=Pink
-Blue+White=Light Blue
-Red+Black=Maroon
-Blue+Black=Dark Blue
3. Once black is added to a face, it will mix with the colors on the face if possible, but it cannot be changed at all afterwards. This is not true with white.
4. Any area where two colors have been mixed cannot change color.
5. Exactly one of the following is true:
-Black was added first.
-Red was added before blue.
-Blue was added after white.
-White was added last.
In what order were the colors added?","White, blue, black, red.
Because there are both gray and dark blue regions, black was added after both white and blue. This means black was not first, and neither blue nor white was last.
Black has to have been added before red, because if it wasn't, the front face would be maroon with a pink center. So black was not last, and red was not first.
Since neither blue, black, nor white was last, red had to be added last. Combining this with other facts, white and blue could not be added third. So black was third.
Going back to the statements of which one is true, we can now figure out the lies. Red was added last, so statement 4 is false. Black was added third, so statement 1 is false. Red was not added before any other colors, so statement 2 is false. This makes statement 3 true. White was added before blue, so white is first, and blue is second.

Farley's Fishing,"Fred Farley spent his summers up north in a cottage on Stoney Lake. There, he often debated with his friends what type of bait was best to use for the fish in the waters.  He decided one year to hold a fishing tournament with the best fishers on the lake, each using a different casting lure.  5 men competed (Fred Farley was NOT one of them) and points were awarded in four categories to determine a winner:
Greatest total Weight of fish caught: 4 points
Greatest Number of fish caught: 3 points
Largest Fish: 2 points
Second-largest fish: 1 point
Winning more than one category: 1 bonus point
Two fishermen did not win any of the categories and first place ended up being a tie between two men who received the same amount of points.
From the statements below, determine the first and last name of each of the contestants, what casting lure was used, and who won each category.
1. Mike (who was one of the category winners), Mr. Black (who is not Terry), and the one that used the plastic worm live near each other.
2. Vick, who did not win the total weight category, did not use the spinner bait; nor did Mr. McNess.
3. The one that used the weighted jig, who was not Terry, did not win any of the categories.
4. Neither Sam nor Mr. Larson live near any of the other three contestants, nor did either use a spinner bait or deep-running crank bait.
5. The fisherman who won the largest-fish category, who was not Mr. Smith, used spinner bait.
6. Mr. Jones, who caught the most fish, did not use a deep-running crank bait.
7. Both Mr. McNess (who did not use a deep running crank bait) and Terry (who did not use a plastic worm) had boat trouble and started after the others.
8. A wounded-minnow was used as one of the casting lures, and Kevin was one of the contestants.","Kevin Black, spinner bait, largest fish and second largest fish category, bonus for winning two categories, 4 points.
Mike Smith, crank bait, total weight, 4 points
Sam McNess, weighted jig, no category, 0 points
Terry Larson, wounded minnow bait, no category, 0 points
Vick Jones, plastic worm, most fish, 3 points.
From 1: Mike won a category, is not Mr. Black, and did not use the plastic worm.  Mr. Black is not Mike or Terry and did not use the plastic worm.
From 2:  Vick is not Mr. Mc Ness, did not win total weight and did not use the spinner bait. Mr. McNess did not use the spinner bait.
From 3: Terry did not use the weighted jig. The weighted jig won no category.
From 4: Sam is not Larson or Black, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.  Mr. Larson is not Mike, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.
From 5: Mr. Smith did not win the largest fish or use the spinner bait. The largest fish was caught using the spinner bait.
Since Vick and Sam did not use the spinner, they did not win the largest fish category.  Since Mike won a category, he did not use the jig.
From 6: Mr. Jones won the most fish and, therefore, did not use the spinner bait, did not use the deep running crank bait either. Therefore, Black used the spinner and was the largest fish winner. Since Vick did not win the largest fish, by elimination, Kevin is Mr. Black.
From 7: Mr. McNess is not Terry and did not use a deep running crank bait. Therefore, Smith could have only used the crank bait.  Terry did not use a worm. Therefore, Vick used the worm and Sam used the weighted jig (and therefore won no category).
The worm (used by Vick) was thereby only used by either McNess or Jones, and since 2 says Vick is not Mc Ness, Vick is therefore Jones.
Terry, then, is Larson and won no category. Mike then wins the total weight category.
Then by summing up the leftover information, Terry uses the minnow and leaves Mike with the deep-running crank bait. That, in turn, makes Mike's last name Smith. Sam is then McNess.","Since only 3 of the contestants won the 4 categories, one of them won two and earned a bonus point.  Since there were two first places, the only possible outcome was that they both received 4 points. Therefore, one contestant won the total weight category (4 points), and another won the largest, second largest category and earned a bonus point (2 + 1 + 1 points).",2.26,2.72

Mad Ade's Escalator Journey,"Mad Ade once had a job working in the famous Madadian department store ""Horrids"".
He used the stores escalator on a daily basis as he skived from duty to duty.
He noticed on one particularly boring day that if he ran up 8 stairs of the escalator from the bottom step, the journey to the top took exactly 40 seconds.
On a later escalator trip he noticed that if he ran up 15 stairs of the escalator the journey time decreased to only 22.5 seconds.
Knowing this, how long would it take Mad Ade to complete the full journey if he did not run up any stairs at all?
Can you work out how many steps of the escalator are actually visible at any one time?","It takes Mad Ade 60 seconds to reach the top, and there are 24 steps visible on the escalator when it's stationary.
Running up 7 more steps reduces the time by 17.5 seconds, so running up 1 step reduces the time by 2.5 seconds, so each step takes 2.5 seconds.
So the escalator cycles through 24 steps on a complete trip from base to top. To illustrate:
8+(40/2.5)=24 steps
15+(22.5/2.5)=24 steps
The escalator cycles through all 24 steps in 24(2.5)=60 seconds",,2.26,2.07
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts and Clubs Band,"John, Paul, George, and Ringo were playing a card game. Each player had three cards, one of the four suits was the ""high suit."" When each player played one card, this was a ""trick."" The first card played in a trick was the ""leading suit."" Here are the cards in each man's hand:
John: club, heart, diamond
Paul: club, spade, spade
George: club, heart, heart
Ringo: spade, diamond, diamond
If possible, each player had to play the leading suit for each trick. If they couldn't do that, they had to play the high suit. And if they couldn't do that, they could play any card. A player who won a trick had to lead the next trick. Each of the three tricks consisted of the leading card, exactly one other card of the same suit, exactly one card of the high suit which won its player the trick, and exactly one other card. Which suit was the high suit?","The high suit is diamonds.
The first trick obviously required two cards of the leading suit, and since everyone had to play the leading suit if possible, there had to be two people who had at least one card of the first leading suit. But since John, Paul, and George each had a club, the first leading suit could not have been a club.
If the first leading suit was a heart, then the high suit had to be a card of which only one of Paul and Ringo had. This means it could only have been a club or a diamond. Similarly, if the first leading suit was a spade, the high suit could only have been a diamond, and if the leading suit was a diamond, the high suit could only have been a heart or a spade.
If the first leading suit was a heart, the second trick was led by either Paul or Ringo, and the leading suit had to be a spade. If the first leading suit was a spade, the second trick was led by John, and the leading suit could have been a club or a heart. If the first leading suit was a diamond, the second trick was led by either Paul or George, and the leading suit was a club. Now we can deduce the six possible leading suits and high suits for the whole game:
1. heart, heart, club
spade, spade, club
diamond, diamond, club
2. heart, heart, diamond
spade, spade, diamond
club, club, diamond
3. spade, spade, diamond
club, club, diamond
heart, heart, diamond
4. spade, spade, diamond
heart, heart, diamond
club, club, diamond
5. diamond, diamond, heart
club, club, heart
spade, spade, heart
6. diamond, diamond, spade
club, club, spade
heart, heart, spade
Game 1 cannot be possible because Paul would have led the spade and John and George would both have played a club, making two cards of the high suit. Games 5 and 6 cannot be possible because no one had both hearts and spades. This leaves only games 2, 3, and 4, which all have diamonds as the high suit.","This makes the puzzle too easy.

If (I) is correct, then Mr. Potato beats Mrs. Potato in the first game. Then Mr. Potato would have lost to either Mr. Mad Ade or Mrs. Mad Ade in the second game. And Mr. and Mrs. Mad Ade would have played the third game which contradicts the statement (1). So (I) is not correct.
Similarly, (II) is not correct.
(III) is correct. Mr. and Mrs. Mad Ade played the first game and Mr. Mad Ade won the game. Mr. Mad Ade won the second game against Mr. Potato and lost the third game against Mrs. Potato.

The Box of Chocolates,"Serena has received a box of chocolates as a birthday present. The box contains 12 chocolates of different shapes (one is hemispherical) and flavours (four of which are: dark chocolate, white chocolate-hazelnut, tiramisu and milk chocolate-cherry). The 12 chocolates are divided into three rows of 4 chocolate per line. With the help of the clues and the drawing, can you figure out the shape, the flavour and the position in the box of each chocolate?
1. The following four chocolates are in the same row (but not necessarily in this
order): the flower-shaped chocolate (which isn't gianduia flavour), the dark
chocolate-orange chocolate (which isn't pentagonal-shaped), the chocolate just below the white chocolate and the heart-shaped milk chocolate-cognac flavoured chocolate.
2. Every row contains only one chocolate made from dark chocolate and only one
from milk chocolate and they aren't next to each other.
3. The cremino flavoured chocolate is just to the left of the heart-shaped chocolate and just above the trapezoid-shaped one.
4. The hexagonal-shaped chocolate is just below the dark chocolate-orange one and is in the same row as the dark chocolate-hazelnut one but further to the right.
5. Both the caramel chocolate and the square-shaped chocolate (which isn't made from dark chocolate) are in the central part of the box but neither in the same row nor one below the other.
6. The round chocolate (which isn't dark chocolate-orange flavour) is further to the left than the pentagonal-shaped chocolate (which isn't #4) but further to the right than the gianduia flavoured one. These three chocolates are in different rows.
7. Chocolate #5 isn't the cremino flavoured chocolate. The two white-chocolate chocolates are in the first two rows. The rectangular-shaped chocolate is next to the oval-shaped milk chocolate. Chocolate #9 isn't rhombus-shaped. The triangularshaped
chocolate is #1.","Solution:
Position - Shape - Flavour
1 - Triangular - Dark chocolate
2 - Square - Gianduia
3 - Rectangular - White chocolate
4 - Oval - Milk chocolate
5 - Flower - White chocolate-hazelnut
6 - Rhombus - Dark chocolate-orange
7 - Round - Cremino
8 - Heart - Milk chocolate-cognac

Untrue Ages,"Boris Downhillski and Mad Ade have a conversation.
Boris says: ""I am certainly not over 40.""
Mad Ade says: ""I am 38 and you are at least 5 years older than me.""
Now Boris says: ""You are at least 39.""
All the statements by the two are false. How old are they really?","Boris is 41 and Mad Ade is 37.
Seeing as they are both lying then the real conversation should really run like this:
Boris says: ""I am certainly over 40.""
Mad Ade says: ""I am not 38 and you are at most 4 years older than me.""
Now Boris says: ""You are at most 38.""
From first statement it is clear that Boris is over 40. Also, from next 2 statements it is clear that Mad Ade is less than 38. Hence the possibilities are :
Boris = 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, ......
Mad Ade = 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, ......
It also says that the difference between their age is maximum 4 years. Hence, there is only one possible pair i.e. 41 and 37, all other combination have differences more than 4.
Hence the answer - Boris is 41 and Mad Ade is 37.",,2.25,2.14
Backwards Clock,"With the death of Arthur Minit, the legendary country of MADADIA's only clock maker, no one else had much experience yet with making clocks. The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.
The Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?","Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way. When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way. First look at the hour-hands that are at the twelve. One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes. The fast hand then has progressed 60+x minutes. For the time x that passed, then holds: (60+x)/12 = x. This means that x = 5 5/11 minutes.
For the minutes-hands that start at six holds the same. The confused clock therefore shows the correct time again at 5 5/11 minutes past 7.",,2.25,2.77

Torks' Non-Escape,"When world-famous Madadian philosopher Torks G'Arbage was imprisoned for being a disturbing influence and relieving himself in a public place, he was held in high esteem by his guards, many of whom had followed Torks' teachings. All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would facilitate his escape. One evening, the guard who was on duty accidentally on purpose left the cell door open so that Torks G'Arbage could leave for distant parts.
Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape, as it was his philosophy that if you accept society's rules, you must also accept its punishments. However, the open door was considered by the Madadian authorities to be a serious matter. It was not clear which guard was on that evening. When questioned, the four guards made the following statements in their defence:
Norris McDim:
A) I did not leave the door open.
B) Morris was the one who did it.
Nobby Shifty:
A) I was not the one who was on duty that evening.
B) Norris was on duty.

B) I hoped Torks G'Arbage would escape.

Contestants in the race:  Alvin, Brian, Chuck, David, Ethan, Frank
Colors of their shorts:  red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet
1) Brian moved up two places, now just behind the runner in the red shorts.
2) The runner in the yellow shorts fell down, lost an even number of positions, and was now in last place.
3) Frank moved ahead of the runner who wore the blue shorts.

10) David dropped behind the runners who wore the blue and violet shorts.
11) The runner in the yellow shorts moved ahead of David.
12) Chuck moved ahead of the runner who wore the orange shorts.
13) With a burst of speed, David moved ahead of Ethan, Frank, and the runner in the yellow shorts.
14) Ethan moved ahead of the runner who wore the red shorts.
15) Out of breath, the runner wearing the green shorts fell behind Brian, who now trailed the runner wearing the yellow shorts.  No further position changes occur.  The race ends.","Set up a grid of names versus colors.  From the clues, mark off combinations that can not exist.  From this, it can be found that Brian wears orange.  This leaves Ethan wearing blue.  From Clue 7 and Clue 9, Chuck can only be orange or green.  From Clue 12, Chuck can not be orange, therefore he must be green.  This leaves David wearing red, Frank wearing violet, and Alvin wearing yellow.  This establishes:  Alvin = yellow, Brian = orange, Chuck = green, David = red, Ethan = blue, Frank = violet
To determine the final results, work backward, substituting names for colors.  From Clue 15, Alvin beats Brian beats Chuck.  From Clue 14, Ethan beats David.  From Clue 13, David beats Frank beats Alvin.  This establishes the final results as:  Ethan, David, Frank, Alvin, Brian, Chuck.

Greatest Human,"In a survey to find the greatest human being, the top four people and their occupation were listed in Clock magazine. However, only one entry in each field was correctly positioned. The following facts were true. (1) Albert was two places above the bricklayer, (2) Darling was one place below Charles, (3) Curious was two places below the welder. Can you find the 1st name, surname and occupation for each position?
First Name
1st place - Isaac
2nd place - Albert
3rd place - Marie
4th place - Charles
Surname
1st place - Newtune
2nd place - Eyeline
3rd place - Curious
4th place - Darling
Occupation
1st place - Welder
2nd place - Gardener
3rd place - Cleaner
4th place - Bricklayer","Using (1), Albert is at 1 or 2. If he is at 1, then from (3), Charles is at 2 or 3. However, with Charles at 2 (and Darling at 3), from (2), Curious can only be at 4 and so it is not possible to find just one correct entry in the Surname list (Newtune and Eyeline must be both correct or both incorrect). If Charles is at 3 (with Darling at 4), then from (2), Curious can only be at 3. This gives both Curious and Darling correct (invalid). So Albert must be at 2 (with the bricklayer at 4). From (3), Charles can be at 1 or 3. However, if Charles is at 3 (with Darling at 4), then both Curious and Darling are correct (invalid). So Charles is at 1 (with Darling at 2). From (2), Curious can now be at 3 or 4, but if Curious is at 3 (with the welder at 1) then both the welder and bricklayer are correct (invalid).",,2.24,2.67

Madadian Combined Cheese and Dog Show,"Mad Ade, Daft Derrick, Sue Denim, two pieces of Madadian ""Kebabrie"" Cheese, two pieces of Madadian ""Chillirella"" Cheese, and ""Beef Curry"" the dog were on their way to the annual Madadian combined Cheese and Dog show (it's Madadian, these things happen).
Mad Ade's ""Kebabretta"" scooter can only carry two objects at a time.
Mad Ade, Daft Derrick and Sue Denim can all drive the scooter. If Mad Ade is not around, Daft Derrick will eat the ""Kebabrie""; if Daft Derrick is not around, Mad Ade will eat the ""Chillirella"". If Sue Denim is not around, ""Beef Curry"" will eat the cheese and bite Mad Ade and Daft Derrick.
Can they all get to the Cheese/Dog show without anything bad happening?
If so, what's the smallest number of trips needed (each way counts as one trip)?","Yes, they can do it, and the smallest number of trips is 17. There are essentially two ways of doing this in 17 steps. One way is:
Sue Denim and ""Beef Curry""; Sue Denim; Sue Denim and ""Kebabrie""; Sue Denim and ""Beef Curry""; Mad Ade and ""Kebabrie""; Mad Ade; Daft Derrick and Mad Ade; Daft Derrick; Sue Denim and ""Beef Curry""; Mad Ade; Daft Derrick and Mad Ade; Daft Derrick; Daft Derrick and ""Chillirella""; Sue Denim and ""Beef Curry""; Sue Denim and ""Chillirella""; Sue Denim; Sue Denim and ""Beef Curry"".
The other method is to do this in reverse. Another way of looking at it is that we're swapping ""Kebabrie"" and ""Chillirella"", Daft Derrick and Mad Ade, since from the point of view of the other restrictions this changes nothing.",,2.24,2.35
Buying Steaks,"You are buying steaks at a butcher's.  You see that he has 12 steaks:  six worth $4 each and six worth $6 each.  The butcher tells you, however, that if you let him pick the steaks he will charge you $4 apiece and if you pick the steaks he will charge you $6 apiece, no matter which steaks are chosen.  What should you do to get the best deal?
Assume that the actual number of steaks you purchase is of no concern, except for the butcher's deal.  In other words you'd be just as happy buying 5 steaks as you would buying no steaks.","You should ask the butcher to give you eleven steaks, and let him choose.
If you choose the steaks, you will obviously pay the maximum price possible ($6 each), no matter how many steaks you buy.
If you let the butcher choose, he will pick the six $4 steaks first, so the only way you can make him give you some $6 steaks is to order more than six.  Ordering all twelve would mean that you paid $4 per steak, averaging $5 each in value.  You saved $1 per steak.
However, if you order all 12 then you are technically choosing the steaks (because saying ""give me all of them"" is just a shorter way of saying ""give me that one, and that one, and...""), so you would have to ask for 11 and let the butcher pick them at his discretion.",,2.24,1.92

Bob: Joe owns the wallet.
Mike: I own the wallet.

Joe: I own the wallet.","Mike owns the wallet. The way we can determine this is by looking at Bob's statement, which says Joe owns the wallet. Joe says he owns the wallet. If Bob is telling the truth, that means Joe owns the wallet, and Bob also owns the wallet since he is telling the truth. Since only 1 person has the wallet, Bob must be lying, and so is Joe.

More Calendar Cubes,"My grandmother has a pair of calendar cubes; each cube has six digits on it, one on each face.
Every morning, she re-arranges them to show the day of the month as a two-digit number (01 to 31).
Even though some numbers appear on both cubes, you can easily tell them apart because one cube is ivory and the other is brown.
I noticed that it was possible to use the ivory cube in the tens place and the brown cube in the ones place for SEVEN days in a row (within one month)!
Can you figure out what digits are on each cube?","The ivory cube has 012345; the brown cube has 012678.
The 6 on the brown cube is also a 9, just turn it upside-down!
There are two times each month where it is possible to keep the ivory cube in the tens place for seven days in a row:
06 07 08 09 10 11 12 and 16 17 18 19 20 21 22.","Both cubes need a 1 (to form 11) and a 2 (to form 22).
The 0 must be paired with every other digit, so it must be on both cubes too.
This leaves six spaces (three on each die) to fit seven digits (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).

Kebab Line Up,"Four men are in a line at the Madadian Police station, charged with unlicensed kebab breeding.

Two men who are not fair, are each standing next to Mad Ade
Buster Artery is the only man standing next to exactly one handsome man.
Cliff Hedge is the only man not standing next to exactly one scarred man.
Who is fair, handsome and unscarred?","Cliff Hedge is fair, handsome and unscarred.
From (2), both the men standing next to Mad Ade are not fair. Also, exactly one man is fair, handsome and unscarred. Hence, there are two cases:
Case 1 :: ? (N, ?, ?) : Mad Ade (Y, Y, N) : ? (N, ?, ?) : ? (?, ?, ?)
Case 2 :: ? (N, ?, ?) : Mad Ade (?, ?, ?) : ? (N, ?, ?) : ? (Y, Y, N)
Note the representation - Name (Fair, Handsome, Scarred). ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. Mad Ade (Y, Y, N) means Mad Ade is Fair, Handsome and Unscarred.(oh, how true this is..NOT)
It is clear that either Mad Ade or the man at the extreme right is fair, handsome and unscarred.
From (4), it is deduced that Cliff Hedge is standing next to unscarred man and each of the other men standing next to exactly one scarred man.
Case 1 :: Cliff Hedge (N, ?, N) : Mad Ade (Y, Y, N) : ? (N, ?, Y) : ? (?, ?, Y)
Case 2 :: ? (N, ?, Y) : Mad Ade (?, ?, Y) : ? (N, ?, N) : Cliff Hedge (Y, Y, N)
From (3), Buster Artery is the only man standing next to exactly one handsome man. But in Case 1, Cliff Hedge is standing next to exactly one handsome man. Hence, Case 1 is not possible and Case 2 is the correct one.
Case 2 :: ? (N, ?, Y) : Mad Ade (?, ?, Y) : ? (N, ?, N) : Cliff Hedge (Y, Y, N)
Again from (3) and (4), there are 2 possibilities as shown below.
Case 2a :: Donny Moe (N, N, Y) : Mad Ade (?, N, Y) : Buster Artery (N, N, N) : Cliff Hedge (Y, Y, N)
Case 2b :: Buster Artery (N, N, Y) : Mad Ade (?, Y, Y) : Donny Moe (N, N, N) : Cliff Hedge (Y, Y, N)

The Chairman,"Five men among A, B, C, D and E sitting in this order at a round table had to decide as to who among them would be the chairman by voting. None of the five members voted for himself or his neighbors. The first ballot was a tie off. The second time, C voted for E while the others stuck to their old choices, thereby resulting in E's victory. Who voted for B in the first ballot?","D voted for B in the first ballot.
A, B, C, D and E are sitting in this order at a round table.
The observations given are
1) None of the five members voted for himself or his neighbors.
2) The first ballot was a tie off.
3) The second time, C voted for E while the others stuck to their old choices, thereby resulting in E's victory.
From observation 1, we can deduce the following table for the first ballot:-
Person --> Voted for
A --> D or C
B --> E or D
C --> A or E
D --> A or B
E --> B or C
From observation 2, all of them must have got one vote each since the first ballot was a tie off. Now the above table can be split into one of the following two tables using observation 2.
Table 1:
Person --> Voted for
A --> D
B --> E
C --> A
D --> B
E --> C
OR
Table 2:
Person --> Voted for
A --> C
B --> D
C --> E
D --> A
E --> B
The two tables above would ensure a tie-off for the first ballot.
Now from observation 3, the second time, C voted for E while the others stuck to their old choices, thereby resulting in E's victory. This situation can emerge only if table 1 is the initial voting pattern and not table 2 (since from table 2, C anyway votes for E. If the others stuck to their choices, the second ballot would also result in a tie off). Keeping the initial pattern to be table 1, E won the second ballot because he received two votes from B and C.
Hence if table 1 was the initial voting pattern, then D voted for B in the first ballot.",,2.23,1.79
Romankachi Goodies !!!,"Last week, I'd been to the famous Romankachi cookie store ""Cookie World"" and found that there were three types of cookies to my liking - kachie costing $11 each, chococook costing $7 each and peacon costing $8 each. I had spent any amount between $45 and $50 (Both values inclusive). In how many ways could I have purchased the items, if I wanted to purchase at least one of each type of cookie ?","There are 6 ways.
Since it is given that one item each has to be definitely bought, the minimum amount spent by me was $11 + $7 + $8 = $26. Using this minimum amount I should have bought at least one kachie, one chococook and one peacon cookies.
Since my total expenditure was $45 to $50, the extra amount I still have to spend (after having spent the minimum amount of $26) is $19 to $24, both $45 and $50 inclusive.
This extra amount can be spent in 6 possible ways as shown below :-
1) 2*11 = $22 (two kachie cookies).
2) 1*11 + 1*8 = $19 (one kachie cookie and one peacon cookie).
3) 2*7 + 1*8 = $22 (two chococook cookies and one peacon cookie).
4) 2*8 + 1*7 = $23 (two peacon cookies and one chococook cookie).
5) 7*3 = $21 (three chococook cookies)
6) 8*3 = $24 (three peacon cookies).

Romankachi Cars !!!,"Four new models rolled out of RomanKachi Motors Ltd. this season, each of which is of a different weight and a different cost. They are the Jaguar, the Miroza, the Scotto and the Venz.
1) The heaviest car is the cheapest and the lightest car the costliest.
2) Miroza, the second heaviest, is the third costliest.
3) Scotto is heavier than Venz and costlier to Jaguar.
Can you find which model is the cheapest and which model the costliest ?","The cheapest and the costliest models are the Jaguar and the Venz respectively.
Four new models the Jaguar, the Miroza, the Scotto and the Venz are of  different weight and cost.
The conditions given are
1) The heaviest car is the cheapest and the lightest car the costliest.
2) Miroza, the second heaviest, is the third costliest.
3) Scotto is heavier than Venz and costlier to Jaguar.
Let us take the car X as the heaviest and the car Y as the lightest.
Then from condition 1 above, we can write the following table :-
Weight 	   Cost
1       X	     Y
2    Miroza
3                 Miroza
4       Y	      X
since from condition 2, Miroza, the second heaviest, is the third costliest.
Also from condition 3, we have Scotto to be heavier than Venz and costlier to Jaguar. Hence Scotto can neither be the heaviest (since Jaguar must be heavier than it because Jaguar is cheaper to it) nor the costliest (since Venz must be costlier than it because Venz is lighter to it). Hence Scotto is the third in weight and second in cost.
As Scotto is heavier than Venz, the car 'Y' must be Venz and the car 'X' must be Jaguar.
Thus the final arrangement is shown below :-
Weight 	   Cost
1    Jaguar	   Venz
2    Miroza	   Scotto
3    Scotto	   Miroza
4    Venz	   Jaguar

Golden Kebab Tokens,"A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?","There were a total of 6 friends. Each end up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.
The number of Golden kebab tokens is evenly divisible by the number of friends as well as the number of families.
Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG
If the Golden kebab tokens had been divided by families rather than by individuals, the number of recipients would be (G - 2) and each share would be (N + 5).
Again, total number of Golden kebab tokens = (N + 5)(G - 2)
But, the total number of the Golden kebab tokens is the same.
NG = (N + 5)(G - 2)
NG = NG -2N +5G -10
2N = 5G -10
N = (5/2)G - 5
Now, N and G are the positive integers and also total number of Golden kebab tokens must be divisible by G, (G-1) and (G-2). This is because initially there were G friends; then since it was divided family wise, the total number of units, the coins were to be divided would be (G-2) (as two groups had two sisters, so two friends got combined as one group, one per group); and after Wendy Boatkumsin backed out, there were (G-1) friends.
Now trying different EVEN values for G, starting with 2; there were total 6 friends and 60 Golden kebab tokens. The Golden kebab tokens are divided among 5 friends and hence each friend ends up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.",,2.23,2.82
Mad Ade's Blocks,"Mad Ade was looking after his two year old Nephew (He charges two Kebabs an hour if you are in need of a babysitter).
His Nephew had 4 play blocks each with 6 sides. Each side has a letter from the alphabet. No letters are ever repeated. By arranging the blocks in different ways Mad Ade's nephew managed (By complete and utter fluke) to spell all the words listed below:
BODY
MAZE
CURT
MOVE
DRAW
NOTE
FEAR
PICK
HUNT
QUIT
JOKE
SNOB
KNEW
TYPE
LIFE
Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on the Kebabs he was earning.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?","Out of the 26 letters in the alphabet, Only G and X are not used.
There are 7 words with letter 'E' - MAZE, MOVE, NOTE, FEAR, JOKE, KNEW, TYPE, LIFE. It means that none of the letters in these 7 words can be on the same block as the letter 'E'. Hence, the other 5 letters must be from B, C, D, H, Q, S, U.
As BODY is one of the possible word, B and D can not be on the same block.Similarly, C and U also can not be on the same block as CURT is one of the possible word. Hence, E, H, Q, S are on the same block.
Also, S and B can not be on the same block (SNOB). Q and U can not be on the same block (QUIT). Hence, first Block contains C, D, E, H, Q, S
the easiest way is to write down 4 rows each with A to Z, except G and X. Take each word one by one, remove not possible letters and circle the possible letters.
The letters on four blocks are:
Block 1 : C, D, E, H, Q, S
Block 2 : A, B, K, L, T, V
Block 3 : F, O, P, U, W, Z
Block 4 : I, J, M, N, R, Y",,2.23,2.73

Alien Ambassadors,"The boffins from NASA have received and decoded a digital message from the Galactic Council, informing them that four alien ambassadors from the solar system are due to visit Earth in the next 24 hours. The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?","ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy and so, is the Assassin.
Looking at clue 2 we know that both the ambassadors standing next to Agurgle from Uranus are not green. Also, from the body of the teaser, we also know only one alien is green, tentacled and slimy. So there are two deductions to be made: (Note the key is - Alien (Green, Tentacled, Un-Slimey). Where ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. ""?"" denotes unknown, and each set of braces[] indicates a booth)
Either Deduction A
[ N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [ N, ?, ?] [ ?, ?, ?]
Or Deduction B
[N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, ?][ N, ?, ?] [Y, Y, N]
You can see that either Agurgle from Uranus or the alien at the extreme right hand booth is green, tentacled and slimy.
Now taking clue 3, you can work out that ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to a slimy alien AND each of the other aliens' booths are next to precisely one slimy alien.
So, based on the first set of deductions, you can infer the following.
Deduction A (ii):
[ChimChim from Pluto N, ?, N] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [N, ?, Y] [?, ?, Y]
Or Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
You can then use clue 1 to eliminate one of these deductions: Wym-Inar from Venus is the only alien in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien. But in Deduction A(ii), ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to exactly one tentacled alien.  Therefore, Deduction A (ii) is not possible and Deduction B (ii) is the correct one.
Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, looking again at clues 2 and 3, there are a further 2 possible deductions to be made.
Deduction A (iii)
[Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus] [?, N, Y] [Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
Deduction B (iii)
[Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, Y][Agurgle from Uranus ?, Y, Y][Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy, and is therefore our Neptunian Assassin.",Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.,2.23,2.87

For the product of two numbers to be a prime number (clue #5), one of those two numbers must be 1.  Therefore, either C or H must be 1.
To achieve the required proportion (clue #6), the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations:  931 or 421 or 842.
If [AGC] = 842, then D would have to be 1 (clue #1).  Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.
If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.  Therefore, A = 4 and G = 2.
Since G = 2, then J = 8 (clue #2).  J can not be 1 or 4, since those two numerals are now assigned.
The only remaining letters that can be assigned to 6 are B and I.  D can not be 6, as it would not produce a square number (clue #1).  Neither E nor F can be 6, since that would not produce an odd number (clue #4). H can not be 6, as it would not produce a prime number (clue #5).  Since either B or I must be 6, then 6 must be paired with 0 (clue #3), as the other even numerals have now been assigned.
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then D = 5 (clue #1).
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then E and H must also be separated by 6 (clue #7).  The only remaining numerals that satisfy this requirement are 3 and 9.  This means that F = 7.  This sets H = 3 and  E = 9, which then sets B = 6 and I = 0.","A triangle number can be expressed as the sum of the numbers 1 to n, for any integer value of n.

The First Lap:
Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.
In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.
The Second Lap:
Paul slipped on a water puddle and fell back to third place, leaving the person he was right by, way in front. Clark moved up 2 spots, pushing those two people back one place each. Then, Felicia and Anna switched places, and Luke and Brad switched places. The people in 11th and 12th ended up switching places just before the third lap as well.
The Third Lap:
The two people in 10th and 11th place switched spots, the two people in 5th and 6th places switched spots, and the two people in 7th and 8th places switched spots. Brad ended up getting passed by the two people directly behind him, and Jessica was passed by the person directly behind her. Everyone then finished in the order that they are currently in.

Here is how they got there:
On the first lap the top 4 runners were Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica. Felicia and Brianna weren't far behind which means they were in 5th and 6th place. With Kelsey, Anna, and Abby in the back (10th, 11th, and 12th places), that means Luke, Brad, and Clark were in 7th, 8th, and 9th. In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people are Ben and Paul, which means that they were in 1st and 2nd, and the top ranked person was doing the worst, Stephen, which means that he was in 4th putting Jessica in 3rd place. Brianna was in 5th place, and Major Felicia was in 6th place. Clark and Brad passed Luke in a certain order, making Clark 7th, Brad 8th, and Luke 9th. The three girls in back then were in their places according to their rank, so that put Anna in 10th, Abby in 11th, and Kelsey in 12th. So, now we know what place everyone is after this lap.
On the second lap Paul slipped and was passed by Jessica, putting Ben in 1st, Jessica in 2nd, and Paul in 3rd. Clark moved up 2 spots putting him in 5th place, Brianna in 6th place, and Felicia in 7th place. Felicia then switched places with Anna, which put Felicia in 10th place, and Anna in 7th place. Luke and Brad switched places as well, which put Luke in 8th, and Brad in 9th. The 11th and 12th place people switched places too, which put Kelsey in 11th, and Abby in 12th.
On the third lap the 10th and 11th place people switched spots, putting Kelsey in 10th, and Felicia in 11th. 5th and 6th place switched, making Brianna in 5th, and Clark in 6th, and the 7th and 8th place people switched, putting Luke in 7th and Anna in 8th. Brad was passed by the two people who were directly behind him which made Kelsey in 9th, Felicia in 10th, and Brad in 11th. Jessica was also passed by Paul, the person directly behind her, putting Paul in 2nd, and Jessica in 3rd.

4) The second tallest building, which is colored green, is at one of the ends and is to the immediate left of the shortest building.
From observation 2, the blue building must be exactly at the center of the row of 5 buildings. Hence the order should be
Building1
Building2
Blue
Building3
Building4
From observations 3 and 4, we get that green is the second tallest building and orange is the fourth tallest building. From observation 4, we get that the Green colored building is at one of the ends and is to the immediate left of the shortest building. Also from observation 2, the Orange and Red colored buildings should be equidistant from the Blue colored building and the Green and the Yellow colored buildings must also be equidistant the Blue colored building. Hence the order after all these observations should be
Green
Orange/Red (shortest)
Blue
Orange/Red
Yellow
From observation 3, orange is the second shortest building and hence it cannot be to the right of Green, since from observation 4, green sits next to the shortest building.
Hence Red is the shortest building. Thus the final order is
Green
Red
Blue
Orange
Yellow
Now from observation 1, we have the tallest building is adjacent to two other buildings. In the order above only three colored buildings namely Red, Blue and Orange are adjacent to two other buildings. Since Red is the shortest and Orange the second shortest, the building colored Blue must be the tallest out of the given buildings.
Hence the Blue colored building is the tallest among the given buildings.",,2.22,1.94
Dino Photo?,"Ms. Tina Gull, who is notorious for  her gullibility, asked her friend the detective a question.
""Detective Brown, I met a man who found a cave painting. He gave me and a friend the opportunity to buy it from the archaeological team. Are you interested in going in on the deal with me?""
Detective Brown thought for a moment and asked Ms. Tina,
""What was this painting of?""
Ms. Tina answered, ""There are two cave people going hunting. One has a spear and the other a bunch of stones. They are stalking a dinosaur. Then, in another picture, they are actually killing the thing, throwing the spear and everything!''
Detective Brown thought for a while and politely told her he wouldn't go in on the deal and advised her not to either as this was a scam (again).
Why did he say this?","The cave painting has to be fake. If it was drawn by ancient people, they would not have known dinosaurs had existed, as dinosaurs died out about 63 million years before the first hominid evolved.",Think about what the cave people were doing.,2.21,0.7

Kebab Shop Line Up,"There had been a break in at the ""Sweaty Chef"" Kebab shop, and the new owner, Mustapha Bettaname, had been robbed of his secret kebab recipe. The police had one eye witness, Al Kaholic, the local wino and world champion turps nudger.
A Police line up of 11 suspects was made to stand in a straight line to have an Identity Parade. The main culprit was asked to stand in the center of the line-up.
1) Barb Dwyre and Chris Mass stood to the right of the main culprit
2) Two suspects stood between Ewan Watarmy and Lou Stooth
3) Seven suspects stood between Mike Rhosopht and Phil Mypokits
4) Gerry Atrick stood to the right of Hugo Phurst
5) Robin Banks and Polly Ester-Phants stood either side of Ewan Watarmy
6) Diddy Dewit and Polly Ester-Phants stood to the left of the main culprit
7) Six suspects stood between Chris Mass and Ewan Watarmy
8) Two suspects stood between Ewan Watarmy and Diddy Dewit
Who is the main culprit?
Can you tell the positions of all the suspects?","Suspects from left to right: Diddy Dewit, (Mike Rhosopht/Phil Mypokits), (Robin Banks/Polly Ester-Phants), Ewan Watarmy, (Robin Banks/Polly Ester-Phants), HUGO PHURST, Lou Stooth, (Barb Dwyre/Gerry Atrick), (Barb Dwyre/Gerry Atrick), (Mike Rhosopht/Phil Mypokits), Chris Mass
Let's number the positions 1 to 11 from left to right. Hence, the main culprit is at position 6. Now, looking at the clues 7, 5, 2 and 8 together:
Position 1 - Diddy Dewit or Lou Stooth
Position 3 - Polly Ester-Phants or Robin Banks
Position 4 - Ewan Watarmy
Position 5 - Polly Ester-Phants or Robin Banks
Position 7 - Diddy Dewit or Lou Stooth
Position 11 - Chris Mass
From clue (3), the only possible positions for Mike Rhosopht and Phil Mypokits are Position 2 and Position 10.
Now there are 3 positions remaining - 6, 8 and 9 and remaining 3 suspects are Hugo Phurst, Barb Dwyre and Gerry Atrick. But from clue (1), Barb Dwyre stood to the right of the main culprit i.e. Barb Dwyre must be on position 8 or 9 as position 6 is for the main culprit. So either Hugo Phurst or Gerry Atrick is the main culprit.
From (4), Gerry Atrick stood to the right of Hugo Phurst. Hence, Hugo Phurst is the main culprit.
Suspects from left to right are: Diddy Dewit, (Mike Rhosopht/Phil Mypokits), (Robin Banks/Polly Ester-Phants), Ewan Watarmy, (Robin Banks/Polly Ester-Phants), HUGO PHURST, Lou Stooth, (Barb Dwyre/Gerry Atrick), (Barb Dwyre/Gerry Atrick), (Mike Rhosopht/Phil Mypokits), Chris Mass.
Thus,
Diddy Dewit (1), Ewan Watarmy (4), Hugo Phurst (6), Lou Stooth (7) and Chris Mass (11) are the suspects whose positions are fixed.
Mike Rhosopht and Phil Mypokits are at position 2 or 10.

Bike-Mania,"A motorcycle workshop owner had dismantled some motorcycles, so as to get three varieties of brakes - B1, B2 and B3, four varieties of Engines - SL, SK, EZ and RX, and three varieties of tires - MRF, BS and MCN. It was further known that B1 cannot be with SL or SK. EZ must be with B3. MRF must be with SL and vice versa. MCN or BS cannot be with SK. If B2 brakes are to be fitted, then which of the following must also be used?
1) SK engine and MCN tyres.
2) MCN tyres and SK engine or RX engine.
3) SL engine and MRF tyres.
4) None of these.","If B2 brakes are to be fitted, statement 3 i.e., SL engine and MRF tires must also be used.
The given choices to be used along with B2 brakes are
1) SK engine and MCN tires.
2) MCN tires and SK engine or RX engine.
3) SL engine and MRF tires.
4) None of these.
The given observations are
A) B1 cannot be with SL or SK.
B) EZ must be with B3.
C) MRF must be with SL and vice versa.
D) MCN or BS cannot be with SK.
From observation A, brake B1 must be with engines EZ or RX (since it cannot be with SL or SK). But from observation B, engine EZ must be with B3. Hence brake B1 must be with RX.
Thus B2 must be with either engine SL or engine SK. If engine SK is selected, we cannot use either of tires MCN or BS from observation D. MRF tires cannot be used with SK engine because MRF must be with SL and vice versa from observation C.
Therefore if brake B2 is used, engine SL along with tires MRF must be used.",,2.21,2.14

Mad Ade's Fishing Trip,"Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.","Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th (4).
Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day. (1)
17th is 8 or 24.
On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. (2)
17th is 24 and Cutbank.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse (3).
With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. (5)
He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st.
Humpback is 21st. (2)
Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. (5)
Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)
First day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.
15th then is Bottle.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).
Mouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.
Dolly is 14th or 15th.
Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)
Mayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.
Stonefly is 15th.
Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.
At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)
Stonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.
Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)
Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.
Summary:
14th, Elk Hair Caddis, Dolly Varden, 16, Little Curl
15th, Stonefly Nymph, Cutthroat, 19, Bottle Well

Kebab Wrestlers Pool Game,"Four members of the Madadian pro-celebrity Kebab wrestling team took part in a charity pool match to raise money for new spandex sequined grease proof leotards
Al Gore-Rhythm, Annie Buddyhome, Dan Druff and Hayden Seek participated in the POOL competition.
FACTS
1, There are total of 15 balls.
2, For each ball potted, the player will receive one point.
3, They all will play each other once.
4, A game will end when all the balls are potted.
5, The winner will be the player who scored the most points.
OUTCOMES
1, Hayden Seek finished with 18 points.
2, Al Gore-Rhythm finished with odd number of points.
3, Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points in the match between them.
4, There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm.
5, Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game.
6, Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff.
7, Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome.
Who won the competition?
How many points did each player score?","1) Hayden Seek finished with 18 points. - This was a given so my answer needs no explanation.
3) Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points. - Therefore, the score was 10 Dan Druff and 5 Hayden Seek; because there is only 15 balls which equals 15 points per game
There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm. - The final score had to be 7 and 8 and since Al Gore-Rhythm finished with an odd score, If you trialed both numbers you will notice Al Gore-Rhythm equaled out to have the 8 points therefore, Annie Buddyhome had the 7 points.
Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game. - Al Gore-Rhythm equaled 10 points and Dan Druff equaled 5 points so the score would be double winner and half for the loser.
Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff. Since the score was 10/5 with Dan Druff winning, that means that Hayden Seek scored 4 points in this game because of one point less.
Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome- Once again 15 points and the game is over, Dan Druff scores 7 and Annie Buddyhome scores 8.
By process of elimination; since Hayden Seek scores 18 points total and you can figure out the 5 points against Dan Druff and the 4 points against Al Gore-Rhythm 9 points was the only number that would fit into the equation.
Thus the scores are Al Gore-Rhythm 8 and Annie Buddyhome 7
Annie Buddyhome 8 and Dan Druff 7
Dan Druff 10 and Hayden Seek 5
Hayden Seek 4 and Al Gore-Rhythm 11
Al Gore-Rhythm 10 and Dan Druff 5
Annie Buddyhome 6 and Hayden Seek 9
Al Gore-Rhythm 11+10+8= 29 points (odd)
Annie Buddyhome 8+7+6=21 points
Hayden Seek 5+4+9=18 points (given)
Dan Druff 7+10+5=22 points
Therefore the conclusion is that Al Gore-Rhythm won with 29 points and Dan Druff came in second place with 22 points. Annie Buddyhome is third place with 21 points and last is Hayden Seek with 18 points.",,2.2,2.66

Some interesting points arise here. For instance, Brighton Early appears in eight of the nine groups, while Zoltan Pepper doesn't appear at all. He's completely blocked out by his own and others' conditions on working with certain people, and Brighton Early benefits greatly by being the only musician/singer, especially when he doesn't refuse to work with anyone else. Winnie DePooh doesn't get a similar advantage by being the only director/singer because he refuses to work with Eve O'Looshun, which limits his availability. I guess the moral of the story is, be willing to work with anybody and you'll be able to work more.",,2.19,2.63

Neighbourhood Woes !!!,"In Rangeelia, a neighbour situated west of our country, the native people can be divided into three types: Lalpilas, Pilharas and Haralals.

Pilharas always get confused between yellow and green (i.e. they see yellow as green and vice versa) but can see any other color properly. Haralals always get confused between green and red (i.e. they see green as red and vice versa) but can see any other color properly.
Three people Amar, Akbar and Anthony, who belong to Rangeelia, made the following statements about Gabbar Singh, the famous dacoit of Rangeelia, when he was last seen by them :-
Amar    : Gabbar Singh was wearing a green shirt.
Akbar    : Gabbar Singh was not wearing a yellow shirt.
Anthony : Gabbar Singh was wearing a red shirt.
If none of Amar, Akbar or Anthony is a Haralal, then what was the color of Gabbar Singh's shirt ?","Gabbar Singh was wearing a yellow shirt.
It is given that
Lalpilas always get confused between red and yellow (i.e. they see yellow as red and vice versa) but can see any other color properly.
Pilharas always get confused between yellow and green (i.e. they see yellow as green and vice versa) but can see any other color properly.
Haralals always get confused between green and red (i.e. they see green as red and vice versa) but can see any other color properly.
The statements made by Amar, Akbar and Anthony are
Amar    : Gabbar Singh was wearing a green shirt.
Akbar   : Gabbar Singh was not wearing a yellow shirt.
Anthony : Gabbar Singh was wearing a red shirt.
Since none of  Amar, Akbar or Anthony is a Haralal, Gabbar Singh could not have worn a red or green shirt.
If Gabbar had worn a red shirt, then Amar would not have made such a statement (since only Haralals get confused between red and green and it is given that Amar is not a Haralal).
If Gabbar had worn a green shirt, then Anthony would not have made such a statement (since only Haralals get confused between red and green and it is given that Anthony is not a Haralal).
So the only possibility is that Gabbar Singh wore a yellow shirt.
Amar, who is probably a Pilhara, confused yellow with green.
Akbar, who is probably a Pilhara or a Lalpila, confused yellow with either green or red and hence said that he was not in yellow.
Anthony who is probably a Lalpila confused yellow with red.",,2.18,2.14

7. If X is greater than 2, then the previous statement is false.
Which statements are true?","If X is 2, then statements 2 and 3 create a paradox. Therefore, X is not 2, so statements 2 and 3 are both true because the ""if"" part is not satisfied.
Therefore, statement 6 must be true, because if X is less than 3, we know X must be 2. In this case, statement 5 is false.
However, because statement 6 is true, there are at least 3 true statements, meaning we can't conclude if statement 5 is false based on this statement alone.
Statement 7 is false because X is definitely greater than 2, and the previous statement was true.
Statement 1 and 4 must be false, because their truth will imply their falseness.
For example, if statement 4 was true, then it won't be satisfied anymore (as there are at least 4 statements true), so it can't be true.

1000 Point Star,"Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?","199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,2.15,3.19
Grobi's Treat,"Grobi is a very unique creature.
Grobi:
1...is round in shape.
2...is six inches in diameter.
3...lives on an acre-sized flat field.
4...moves only by jumping; cannot walk, crawl, fly, or move in any manner other than jumping.
5...can jump, in any one jump, a minimum of 6 inches or a maximum of 72 inches (6 feet) across the field (cannot jump straight up-down).  Grobi can therefore, in any one jump, jump any distance across the field at or between the 6-72 inch limits.
6...can jump directly north, south, east, or west only; cannot jump diagonally.
7...must jump four times in any one direction (N-S-E-W) before changing direction (N-S-E-W) or to continue in the same direction (N-S-E-W).
8...dines on mushrooms which grow in the field.  The mushrooms grow to a maximum of six inches in diameter and to a height of an inch.
9...can ingest a mushroom only by landing directly atop the mushroom.
10...is very adept at precisely determining distances.
One day Grobi - happily jumping around in the middle of the field - locates a six-inch diameter mushroom six inches away (center of Grobi to center of mushroom distance) directly west of Grobi.
Grobi quickly (and accurately) calculates that FOUR jumps is the fastest way to get to the mushroom and eat, which Grobi does.
Describe the route taken by Grobi to eat the mushroom including the direction of jumps, each approximate jump-distance, and the specific number of jumps in each direction.","Grobi had already taken ONE jump to the east (in a new four-jump 'direction' series) when the mushroom was located to the west.  Grobi therefore had to take THREE more jumps to the east before being able to change direction and head back west.  Grobi took three minimum jumps (six inches or so each) to the east and then a long (24 inches or so) FOURTH jump to the west to land atop the mushroom.
No other conditions would solve the puzzle as written:
1.  If Grobi had been jumping west (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series), or had just concluded a four-jump 'direction' series, then the mushroom could have been attained in one jump.
2.  If Grobi had been jumping north or south (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series) then four additional jumps (even if able to change direction) would have put Grobi out of alignment with the mushroom.
3.  If Grobi had been jumping east (and had done two or three jumps as part of a four-jump 'direction' series) then the mushroom could have been attained in two or three additional jumps and not the four that was Grobi's correct calculation.","No need to ""invent"" anything new for Grobi such as extraordinary motivating or grasping or ingestion appendages.  The problem can be solved using the information given.  Key words in the puzzle are ""happily jumping around"".",2.15,2.51

a) If the balance is not equal, designate the heavy side balls H and the light side balls L.  The group of 4 unbalanced balls must be good balls.
If the 5 unknown is heavier (5 H > 4 L + ref):  take the ref ball, one H, and two L's, and place to one side.
2nd balance:  Balance the remaining balls like this:  2H+L against 2H+L.
a) If the balance is equal, then one of the two L's placed to one side is a light ball or the H placed to one side is a heavy ball.
3rd balance:  Balance the two L's against each other.  If unequal, the lighter side is a light ball.  If equal, the H is a heavy ball.
b) If the 2nd balance is not equal, then either the 2H has the heavy ball or the opposing L is light.
3rd balance: Balance the two H balls from the heavier side against each other.  If equal, then L is a light ball.  If not, the heavier H is a heavy ball.
If the 5 unknown is lighter (5 L > 4 H + ref):  take the ref ball, one L, and two H's, and place to one side.
2nd balance:  Balance the remaining balls like this:  2L+H against 2L+H.
a) If the balance is equal, then one of the two H's placed to one side is a heavy ball or the L placed to one side is a light ball.
3rd balance:  Balance the two H's against each other.  If unequal, the heavier side is a heavy ball.  If equal, the L is a light ball.
b) If the 2nd balance is not equal, then either the 2L has the light ball or the opposing H is heavy.
3rd balance:  Balance the two L balls from the lighter side against each other.  If equal, then the H is a heavy ball.  If not, the lighter L is a light ball.
b) If the first balance is equal, then the odd ball could be in the group of 4 unknown balls.  The other 10 must all be good balls.
2nd balance:  Place one of the 4 unknown balls to one side and balance the remaining three against three good reference balls from the 10 good balls.
a) If the balance is equal, then the ball placed to one side could be the odd ball.
3rd balance:  Balance this ball against a reference to determine if it's good or not.
b) If the 3 unknown are heavier then:  3rd balance:  balance two of the three balls against each other.  If equal, the unbalanced ball is heavy.  If not equal, the heavy side has a heavy ball.
c) If the 3 unknown are lighter then:
3rd balance: balance two of the three balls against each other.  If equal, the unbalanced ball is lighter.  If not, equal the lighter side has a lighter ball.",,2.14,2.62
Madadian Kebabrie Cheese,"Mad Ade's Great Uncle Gaseous O' Windpants owned the Madadian Grocery store ""The Beggars Can't Be Choosers"". Madadia was well renowned for its pungent cheeses, especially its ""Kebabrie"" and ""Chillirella"".
On display in the store were six cheese pieces weighing 15, 16, 18, 19 , 20 and 31 Pounds. Five out of the six pieces are ""Kebabrie"" and the remaining one is ""Chillirella"".
Norma Leigh-Sobar purchased two pieces of ""Kebabrie"" and Laura Anne-Hardy also purchased some ""Kebabrie"" , but she purchased twice as much in weight than Norma .
How much does the remaining ""Chillirella"" weigh?","Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.
Since Laura bought twice what Norma bought, the total amount of cheese bought by the two together equals 3 times that purchased by Norma alone. Now, the total weight of all the wedges at the grocery divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so the ""Chillirella"" wedge must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. But the only such wedge is the 20 pound wedge, thus the ""Chillirella"" wedge must have weighed 20 pounds.
Thus Norma purchased the 15 and 18 pound pieces which equals 33 pounds and Laura purchased the 16, 19 and 31 pound pieces which equals 66 pounds.",,2.14,2.5

Mad Ade's Chess Problem Again,"Mad Ade was standing outside waiting as usual for the Sweaty Chef Kebab Shop to open and was staring into the shop window of the store next door. He noticed a chess set on display.
He wondered how many ways are there of arranging the sixteen black or white pieces of the chess set on the first two rows of the board?
Obviously, Mad Ade did not bother working it out as the Kebab shop opened almost immediately as he thought about it.
What would have been the answer if Mad Ade wasn't so greedy and had worked it out?
Given that each pawn is identical and each rook, knight and bishop is identical to its pair.","For 16 pieces that are all different the answer is 16! (!=factorial ie. 16x15x14...x1)
But, we have duplicate combinations because there are identical pieces being used. The number of duplicate combinations is =
2 (for Rooks) x 2 (for Knights) x 2(for Bishops) x 8! (for Pawns).
This gives 8x8! = 322560.
Dividing 16! by 322560 gives us the number of unique combinations for a normal chess set = 64864800 different ways.",,2.14,2.62

Also the given observations are
A) Each of the box should contain at least one cake, at least one toffee, at least 3 items and at the most 4 items.
B) Pastry and toy cannot be in the same box.
C) No box can contain two toys.

Toffee      1   1   1   1   1
Pastry
Toy          1   1   1
since the cakes and toffees must follow observation A of at least 1 in each of the boxes and toys must follow observation C of no more than one toy in a box.
We have 4 pastries and 1 toffee remaining to be distributed to these 5 boxes.
From observation B, since pastry and toy cannot be in the same box, the 4 pastries must go to boxes 4 and 5. Also in order to keep with the later part of observation A of at least 3 items and at most 4 items, these four pastries must be packed 2 each into boxes 4 and 5.
The remaining toffee must go into one of the three boxes 1, 2 or 3. Let us assume that this toffee goes to box 1.

The Eight Queens,"One of the most famous logic puzzles is the ""Eight Queens puzzle"".  The object of this puzzle is to place 8 chess queens on a standard 8x8 chessboard so that no queen can be captured by any of the other queens.
Logically, no queen can share the same row, column, or diagonal with any other queen.
Can you discover an arrangement that works?","There are actually 12 completely unique solutions to this puzzle (unique meaning not simply rotating or flipping the board).

The Cake Disaster 2,"One day, in baking class, 15 students were baking cakes when the fire alarm went off. Everyone exited the building, but when they got back, they found someone had dumped all the sugar into two of the batter-filled bowls. Everyone was puzzled over what to do until Alice had an idea: why not mix the batters together and then separate the contents back in the bowls. Here is what happened in chronological order:
Alice mixed with Flare
June pours some into Emma's
Luke mixed with Callie
June mixed with Gabbi

Emma & Quinn had no sugar; which 2 bowls started with sugar?
Everyone was able to figure it out.","Luke & Callie
To start, it can't be Emma or Quinn or anyone who mixed/gave to them. This leaves Flare, Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Watt, Misty, and Ryan.
It can't be Flare because he exchanged with Alice before Alice exchanged with Emma. It can't be Watt because he mixed with Tina before Tina exchanged with Emma. This leaves Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Misty, and Ryan.
It can't be Gabbi because she mixed with Flare before Flare mixed with Tina who mixed with Emma later. This leaves Luke, Callie, Misty, and Ryan.
If only one of Luke & Callie started with sugar it wouldn't be solvable because no interactions happened before them and the outcome would be the same, therefore the solution is either Misty and Ryan or Luke and Callie.
However, it can't be Ryan and Misty because they can't give June sugar!",Everyone was able to figure it out.,2.11,2.37

A Journey to Flower-Heaven,"Hi. My name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of big gardens. In one of them I have hundreds of beautiful, delicious, red flowers.
At my house, my dog is waiting. I have told him about this flower-heaven-garden with hundreds of flowers, and it really wants to find that garden to eat the flowers (yes, my dog eats flowers).
However, this flower-heaven is far away, and my dog wants to go there as soon as possible. It has to travel through some other gardens on its way, but it wants to travel between as few other gardens as possible.
Your mission is to find the best route for my dog, from my house to the flower-heaven. The dog wants to go through as few gardens as possible on its way.
Here are some facts about my gardens:
1. There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.
2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field
3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven
4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain
5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star
6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo
7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house
8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house
9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack
10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house
11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house
12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser
13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens
14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven
15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.
16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest
Through which gardens should my dog travel?","-You should start by drawing the two houses and the two gardens between them (1). The house to the west is my (mister Kvakk's) house (10).
-From 7 we know that the garden to the left of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 9 and 11 to draw flower-heaven to the south of Quack. The first garden to the south of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 4 to draw the four gardens The pool, Soria, Star and The mountain between Kvakk and flower-heaven
-From 5 you see that you don't need to go through The forest to go from Kvakk to Quack. Therefore, the garden to the left of Quack must be Duck country. And so on, the garden to the south must be The forest.
-Use 6 to draw in the garden Longo
-And finally, use 8 to draw the garden The field
-By 3 and 13 we know se the solution. The three gardens that lie against flower-haven must be The angels valley, Longo and The mountain.
The shortest route (measured in number of gardens) is: Kvakk's house / The field / Longo / Flower-heaven","It's easiest to solve this if you try to draw a kind of map. You should maybe start by using the information points in this order: 1, 10, 7, 9, 11, 4, 5, 6, 8",2.11,2.82

Brute force methods can be used to arrive at a solution.  However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.  Continue eliminating possibilities in the order shown below.
A) H can not be 8.  C can not be 1.  C can not be 0.  B can not be 9.  D can not be 1.  D can not be 2.  F can not be 1.

1) 5 + 7 + 3 + 6 + 9 = 30, which is a multiple of 6.
2) 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 0 = 15, which is a multiple of 5.
3) 5 + 3 + 9 + 2 + 8 = 27, which is a multiple of 9.

8) 24 is a multiple of 8.
9) 80 is a multiple of 10.
10) 19, 43, and 05 are prime numbers.
A) The sum of digits 0 through 9 is 45.  To satisfy Conditions 1 and 2, a pair of multiples must equal 45.  The only pair that satisfies those conditions are 30 (multiple of 6) and 15 (multiple of 5).  Likewise, to satisfy Conditions 3 and 4, the pair of multiples must be 27 (multiple of 9) and 18 (multiple of 2).
B) Make lists of the multiples of 3, 4, 7, 8, and 10 (for Conditions 5 through 9).  Delete multiples whose digits are the same (33, 44, 66, 77, 88, 99).
C) To satisfy Condition 9, J must be 0.  Delete multiples that require 0 in a different location.  For JA to be prime (Condition 10), A must be: 2, 3, 5, or 7.  Delete multiples of 3 that have another digit for A.
D) For FE and HC to be prime (Condition 10), C and E can not be even or 5.  Delete multiples of 4 and 7 that have another digit for C and E.
E) Per Condition 4, B + D + F + H + J = 18.  D, H, and J must be even (required to form multiples of even numbers).  To attain the sum of 18 (an even number), B and F must either be both odd or both even.  If both are even, then the sum of those five digits would be 20.  B and F must be odd.  Delete multiples of 3 and 7 that have an even digit for B and F.  The only remaining multiple of 7 is 91.  E is 9 and F is 1.  Delete multiples that require 1 or 9 in a different location.

1) B + C + F + J = E + G + H + I = AD
2) B - H = J - G = 3
3) C - F = E - I = 5
4) B * I = AJ","2951804637
A = 2, B = 9, C = 5, D = 1, E = 8, F = 0, G = 4, H = 6, I = 3, J = 7
1) 9 + 5 + 0 + 7 = 8 + 4 + 6 + 3 = 21
2) 8 - 3 = 5 - 0 = 5
3) 7 - 4 = 9 - 6 = 3
4) 9 * 3 = 27
A) The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.  Therefore, each group of four digits must sum to one of the following: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
B) If the sum of each group is 14, then A and D must be a combination of 1 and 4, which sum to 5.  Subtract 5 from 45, leaving 40.  Divide 40 by 2, leaving 20.  20 does not equal 14, so the sum of each group can not be 14.  Repeating the preceding sequence for each of the possible sums leaves only two possible results: 18 (1 + 8 = 9, 45 - 9 = 36, 36 / 2 = 18) and 21 (2 + 1 = 3, 45 - 3 = 42, 42 / 2 = 21).  A must be: 1, 2.  D must be: 1, 8.
C) To satisfy equation #2, B and J must be 3 greater than H and G, respectively.  B and J must each be one of the following: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  H and G must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
D) To satisfy equation #3, C and E must be 5 greater than F and I, respectively.  C and E must each be one of the following: 5, 7, 8, 9.  F and I must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4.
E) For equation #4, there are six possibilities for B and four possibilities for I, creating 24 possible equations.  Eliminate any equation where A is not 1 or 2.  Eliminate any equation where J is not 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  Eliminate any equation where any digit is duplicated.  B must be: 6, 7, 8, 9.  I must be: 2, 3, 4.  J must be: 6, 7, 8.
F) Returning to equations #2 and #3, eliminate additional possibilities.  E must be: 7, 8, 9.  G must be: 3, 4, 5.  H must be: 3, 4, 5, 6.  This results in F = 0 and C = 5.
G) Since H can not be 5, B can not be 8.  Since G can not be 5, J can not be 8.  Going back to equation #4, eliminate those equations where either B or J is 8.  B = 9, I = 3, A = 2, and J = 7.

9) There are boys in two corners.
10) Kevin occupies an even position, and is the only boy who borders a unique number of girls.","A) There are five boys prior to the median, meaning that there are three boys in each of the first two rows.  If the first boy is at location 4, then there could only be two boys in the first row.  The first boy must be located before position 4, therefore a girl must occupy: 28 (clue 7).  The second boy can not be at position 4 (clue 6).  The earliest position that the third boy could occupy is position 5.  Therefore, a girl must occupy: 4.
B) If boys are at positions 1 (a corner) and 25 (clue 7), then a boy would have to be at either position 7 or 22 (clue 9).  In either case, more than three boys would not be along the edge of the picture, violating clue 5.  Therefore, a girl must occupy: 1.  Boys must occupy: 7 and 22 (clue 9).  Girls must occupy: 6, 14, 15, and 23.
C) For three boys to be in the first row, the second boy must occupy: 5 (which also satisfies clue 6).  A girl must occupy 12.  Per clue 8, a boy must occupy: 13.  A girl must occupy: 20.  To avoid violating clue 5, boys must occupy: 8 and 21.  A girl must occupy: 9.

Pet Owners,"Edgar, Frank, George, and Hans are pet owners. Edgar says, ""If Hans and I each own a dog, then exactly one of Frank and George owns a dog."" Frank says, ""If George and I each own a cat, then exactly one of Edgar and Hans owns a dog."" George says, ""If Edgar and I each own a dog, then exactly one of Frank and Hans owns a cat."" Hans says, ""If Frank and I each own a cat, then exactly one of Frank and me owns a dog."" Only one man is telling the truth...but who?","Frank is telling the truth.
Suppose Edgar doesn't have a dog. This would mean that both he and George have false hypotheses, which would make both statements true. Therefore, Edgar must own a dog.
Suppose Hans doesn't own a dog. This would mean that Edgar's hypothesis is false and Frank's conclusion is true, making both statements true. Therefore, Hans must own a dog.
Suppose Frank doesn't have a cat. This would mean that both he and Hans have false hypotheses, making both statements true. Therefore, Frank must own a cat.
Suppose Hans doesn't own a cat. This would mean that his hypothesis is false and George's conclusion is true, making both statements true. Therefore, Hans must own a cat.
Suppose Frank and George don't both own dogs. This would mean that exactly two of the three below are true:
1. Frank doesn't own a dog (making Hans's conclusion true).
2. George doesn't own a dog (making George's hypothesis false).
3. Exactly one of Frank and George owns a dog (making Edgar's conclusion true).
As you can see, if Frank and George don't both own dogs, there will always be at least two truthtellers. Therefore, they both own dogs.
Now we know that Edgar's, George's, and Hans's hypotheses are all true and their conclusions are all false, making them all liars and leaving only Frank."," 1: All four statements are in the form of ""hypothesis and conclusion"" statements. For such a statement to be false, the hypothesis must be true and the conclusion must be false.
Hint 2: It is possible for a ""pet owner"" to own both a dog and a cat. It is also possible for a ""pet owner"" to own neither a dog nor a cat.",1.99,2.28
At the Baseball Game,"It is a sunny and warm spring day in Cipher, South Decoder. Fans at the baseball park have come to see their own Cipher Solvers play their rivals, the Rockford Peaches, in the first game of the season. Everyone is hoping for a good show.
The home fans became very vocal as 5 of their players (Tim, Hank, K.C., Flynn, and Jimmy Blake) either made an exciting play to allow runs to score, or made an embarrassing error - or both!
Scorecard
Names: Tim, Hank, K.C., Flynn, Jimmy Blake
Positions: pitcher, catcher, 3rd base, shortstop, left field
RBIs: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
Errors: 0, 1, ?, 2, 3
First Inning
By the end of the game, two players were charged with the same number of errors, either 1 or 2. This number (?) is to be deduced from the clues.
Second Inning
No player ended up with the same number of errors and RBIs.
Third Inning
The left fielder had his 1 RBI when, with runners at 1st and 3rd, he hit one over the head of the Peaches' 2nd baseman and into right field.
Fourth Inning
Jimmy Blake earned his 2 RBIs when he hit a triple, allowing the center fielder and the 3rd baseman to score.
Fifth Inning
Flynn had his 1 error when he missed a throw to 1st base.
Sixth Inning
Tim, who posted either 2 or 3 RBIs, ended up with 1 error more than the pitcher after he (Tim) quite literally dropped the ball.
Seventh Inning
The player who finished with no RBIs and 2 errors, including fumbling a fly ball, doesn't play 3rd base.
Eighth Inning
The player who had his 3 RBIs with a game-tying in-the-park home run that had the fans on their feet, scored at least 1 error, but he had fewer errors than the shortstop.
Ninth Inning
K.C. ended the game with 2 fewer errors than the catcher, who let a wild pitch get past him so that the Peaches regained the lead.
Can you determine which position the boys played, as well as how many runs batted in (RBI) and errors they made?","Hank (catcher) with 0 RBIs and 2 errors
K.C. (left field) with 1 RBI and 0 errors

Line Drawings,"We all know and love those drawing puzzles in which you have to draw a symbol without retracing or lifting your pencil. The quickest way to check if a symbol can be drawn with such restrictions is to count the vertices in which an odd number of line segments meet.

Can a symbol have only one vertex in which this occurs?","It cannot.

The Butcher and the Baker,"One of Mr. Johnson, his wife, their son, and their daughter is a butcher, and another is a baker. Here are some facts:
1. If the butcher and the baker are the same gender, then the baker is older than the butcher.
2. If neither the butcher nor the baker is the parent of the other, then the butcher is older than the baker.
3. If the butcher is a man, then he and the baker are the same age.
4. If the butcher and the baker are of the opposite gender, then the man is older than the woman.
Whose occupation can be determined?","Mr. Johnson's daughter can be determined. She is the butcher.
Suppose the butcher is a man. This means that hypothesis 3 is true, making conclusion 3 true, making the butcher and the baker the same age, making conclusion 2 false, making hypothesis 2 false, making one the parent of the other. But since they are the same age, this cannot be right. So the butcher must be a woman.
Suppose the baker is a man. This means that hypothesis 4 is true, making conclusion 4 true, making the baker older than the butcher, making conclusion 2 false, making hypothesis 2 false, making one the parent of the other. Since the baker is older, he must be the parent. Therefore, Mr. Johnson is the baker and his daughter is the butcher.
Suppose the baker is a woman. This means that hypothesis 1 is true, making conclusion 1 true, making the baker older than the butcher. Therefore, Mr. Johnson's wife is the baker and his daughter is the butcher.

Bingo Card 4,"You are given a stack of bingo cards.  Your task is to find a specific card.  Given the following clues, what is the number arrangement of that card?
Columns, left to right, are: B (contains numbers 1 through 15), I (contains numbers 16 through 30), N (contains numbers 31 through 45), G (contains numbers 46 through 60), O (contains numbers 61 through 75).  Rows, top to bottom, are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  An example of coordinate nomenclature: B1 identifies column B row 1.  N3 is a free space (contains no number).  No number appears more than once.
1) Each numeral (0 through 9) appears one time in Row 1.
2) The sum of the numbers in Row 4 is a square number.
3) There is only one two-digit prime number in each row.
4) The range of the numbers in Column N is 8.
5) Each number in Column G has a tens digit that is less than the units digit.
6) Each number in Column O is odd.
7) In only one column are the numbers in descending order from top to bottom.
8) Each column has only one numeral that appears exactly two times.
9) The smallest number in each column is located in Row 5.
10) The sums of each column share a single common prime factor.
11) The numeral 5 only appears one time on the card.
12) The sum of the numbers in each diagonal is an odd number.
13) The product of B3 and O3 has a units digit of 2.

1) Per clue 5, eliminate the appropriate numbers in Column G.  Of the remaining numbers, at least one with a tens digit of 5 will have to be used.  Per clues 1 and 11, only one number can have the numeral 5, so that number must be at G1.  Eliminate all numbers that contain a 5 from all other locations.
2) Per clue 6, eliminate all even numbers from Column O.
3) Per clue 1, eliminate any number from Row 1 with only one digit or duplicate digits.  By analyzing combinations of numbers, the following can be determined: B1 contains a 1, delete 30, I1 contains a 2, delete 23, delete 63 and 73, O1 contains a 6.  In conjunction with clue 3, delete 29 and 59.
4) Per clue 10, analyze the various possible sums of Columns G and O.  The only common prime factor is 31.  Each column must sum to a multiple of 31 (based on available numbers: B to 31, I to 124, N to 155, G to 248, and O to 341).  G1 must be 58.  All two-digit prime numbers (clue 3) must be in Columns G and O.  O1 must be 67.  Per clue 1, N1 must be 39.  Per clue 9, G5 must be 46 and O5 must be 61.
5) For Column N, there is only set of numbers that sums to 155, and satisfies clues 4, 8, and 9 (34, 39, 40, 42).  N5 must be 34.
6) For Column I, there are two sets of numbers that sum to 124, and satisfy clues 8 and 9 (16, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 20, 22, 24, 28, 30).  To satisfy clue 1, I1 must be 24.  B1 must be 10.  To satisfy clue 12, G4 must be 48 and B5 must be odd.
7) The column that satisfies clue 7 is Column B.  To satisfy clue 8, B2 must be 9 and B5 must be 1.
8) To satisfy clue 2, the only square number that can be achieved is 196.  B4 must be 3, I4 must be 30, N4 must be 42, and O4 must be 73.
9) B3 must be 8.  N2 must be 40.
10) To satisfy clue 13, O3 must be 69.  This leaves O2 being 71.  To satisfy clue 3, G3 must be 47.  This leaves G2 being 49.
11) To satisfy clue 14, I3 must be 22.  Finally, to achieve a sum of 124 (multiple of 31), I2 must be 28 and I5 must be 20.",,1.88,3.08
