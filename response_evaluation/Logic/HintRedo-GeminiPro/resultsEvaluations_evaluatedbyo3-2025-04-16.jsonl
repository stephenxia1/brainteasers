{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.\n\"Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,\" his wife called from the dining room.\nThe math major said, \"I'll get them Dad!\"\nAs everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.\nThe table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.\nOnce everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, \"I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.\"\n\"You'd better not make any passes yourself!\" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.\n\"Lighten up, Farrah\" the biology major joked.  \"He wasn't even that cute.\"\n\"He was adorable!\" the youngest interjected.\n\"Everyone's entitled to their opinion,\" said Brooke.  \"Let's eat!\"\nThe daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, \"We have an announcement to make!\" After a dramatic pause she screamed \"we're getting married!\" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, \"I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.\"  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, \"Wow, what'd that rock set you back?\"\n\"This calls for a toast!\" roared Dad.\n\"Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!\" Mom gushed.  \"I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?\" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  \"Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,\" she asked and then quickly added, \"But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?\"\n\"Sure Mom,\" her daughter answered.  \"We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.\"\n\"Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,\" one of the girls announced.\n\"What a coincidence,\" said the boy sitting next to her.  \"We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.\"\n\"That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team\" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, \"he gave me the idea!\"\n\"Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,\" the father announced.  \"She'd really like to see you all.\"\n\"Sorry Dad,\" the business major replied, \"we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.\"\n\"Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.

One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.\nThe physics major said \"I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.\"\n\"Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer\" the dad said.  \"You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,\" he joked.  \"I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,\" the father remarked to the golfer.  \"Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,\" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  \"How about you join me on the links?\"\n\"Sure!\" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.\n\"Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs\" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.\n\"It's a foursome then!\" her dad said happily.\nIan grumbled, \"Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!\"\nThe boyfriend of the political science major laughed, \"I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.\"\n---------\nIdentify the boyfriend and his sport, the school, and major for each daughter.

As soon as he accumulates 22, he reports to the Warden.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": "The problem requires a strategy for 23 prisoners to determine when all of them have visited a specific room, called the switch room. The room contains two light switches, A and B, both initially in the OFF position. When a prisoner visits the room, they must flip exactly one switch. After planning the strategy on the first day, prisoners are isolated and cannot communicate directly. One prisoner must eventually declare \"We have all visited the switch room.\" If true, they are freed; if false, they are fed to alligators. The warden selects prisoners randomly but ensures that, given enough time, everyone will visit the switch room as many times as everyone else.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n\n1.  **Designate Roles:**\n    *   One prisoner is designated as the \"Counter\".\n    *   The other N-1 (i.e., 23-1 = 22) prisoners are \"Messengers\".\n\n2.  **Switch Usage:**\n    *   Switch A will be used as the \"signaling switch\". Messengers will turn it ON to indicate they have visited. The Counter will turn it OFF to acknowledge the signal.\n    *   Switch B will be used as an \"auxiliary switch\". It will be flipped whenever a prisoner must flip a switch, but their role does not require them to flip switch A at that moment.\n    *   Initial state: Both switches A and B are OFF.\n\n3.  **Counter's State:**\n    *   The Counter keeps a mental count, initialized to 0. This count represents the number of unique Messengers who have signaled their visit.\n\n4.  **Messenger's State:**\n    *   Each Messenger keeps a mental flag, \"I have signaled\", initialized to `false`. This flag indicates whether they have already made their signal using switch A.\n\n5.  **Prisoner Actions in the Switch Room:**\n\n    *   **If the prisoner is a Messenger:**\n        1.  Check the state of switch A and their \"I have signaled\" flag.\n        2.  If switch A is OFF AND their \"I have signaled\" flag is `false`:\n            *   Flip switch A to ON.\n            *   Set their \"I have signaled\" flag to `true`. (This Messenger has now successfully signaled their visit).\n        3.  Else (meaning either switch A is already ON, or the Messenger's \"I have signaled\" flag is `true`):\n            *   Flip switch B (from OFF to ON, or from ON to OFF).\n\n    *   **If the prisoner is the Counter:**\n        1.  Check the state of switch A.\n        2.  If switch A is ON:\n            *   Increment their mental count by 1.\n            *   Flip switch A to OFF. (This acknowledges the signal and resets the switch for the next Messenger).\n        3.  Else (meaning switch A is OFF):\n            *   Flip switch B.\n\n6.  **The Declaration:**\n    *   When the Counter's mental count reaches N-1 (which is 22 in this case), the Counter declares: \"We have all visited the switch room.\"\n\n**Reasoning for Correctness:**\n\n1.  **Each Messenger signals at most once:** A Messenger only flips switch A to ON if it's OFF and they haven't signaled before. After doing so, they set their \"I have signaled\" flag to `true` and will never flip A to ON again. They will flip B on subsequent visits.\n\n2.  **Counter correctly counts Messengers:** The Counter only increments their count when they find switch A ON. Since only Messengers turn switch A ON (and each does so at most once), each increment in the Counter's count corresponds to a unique Messenger signaling their visit. The Counter then turns switch A OFF, allowing another Messenger to signal.\n\n3.  **Declaration is true:** When the Counter's count reaches N-1, it means N-1 distinct Messengers have visited the switch room and signaled. The Counter themself has also visited the switch room multiple times (at least N-1 times to observe A being ON and increment the count). Therefore, all N (22 Messengers + 1 Counter = 23 prisoners) have visited the switch room.\n\n4.  **The process will complete (no deadlock):**\n    *   Any Messenger who has not yet signaled needs to visit the room when switch A is OFF.\n    *   If a Messenger visits and switch A is ON, it means another Messenger has signaled and is waiting for the Counter to acknowledge. The current Messenger flips switch B and waits for their next turn.\n    *   The Counter will eventually visit. If switch A is ON, the Counter will turn it OFF, making it available for the next signal.\n    *   If switch A is OFF, it will remain OFF if visited by the Counter or by Messengers who have already signaled (they all flip switch B). It will only be turned ON by a Messenger who has not yet signaled.\n    *   The condition \"everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else\" ensures that any non-signaled Messenger will eventually visit the room when switch A is OFF, and that the Counter will eventually visit to process all signals.\n\nThis strategy ensures that the declaration is made only when it is true, and that eventually, such a declaration can be made. The use of switch B ensures that the rule \"must flip exactly one switch\" is always satisfied without interfering with the counting mechanism of switch A.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{The\\ strategy\\ described\\ above}$", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

Try drawing out examples.", "Human Solution": "199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": NaN, "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}
{"ID": 5, "Question": "Question: I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)\nI was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, \"I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.\nNow I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:\n1. The king is next to at least one diamond.\n2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.\n3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.\n4. The ten is next to at least one club.\n5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.\n6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.\n7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.\n8. My ace is not the card on the far left.\"\nThere was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, \"I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!\"\nThe other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.\nWhich suit is it?\n Hint: The first step is to determine where the ace goes.\nAlso, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?", "Hint": "The first step is to determine where the ace goes.\nAlso, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?", "Human Solution": "The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):\nX X Q X A\nX X X H X\nAt least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):\nK J Q T A\nX D X H X\nNow we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?\nI held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.\nBut which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.\nTherefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.\nTherefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.

Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.\n Hint: Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Hint": "Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Human Solution": "Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nLeonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow\nHoward's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds.

A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.\nHere, you are approached by three gods and their herald.\nProblem\nOn the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.\nFirst, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.\nSecond, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.\nFinally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment.

As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (\"would you say ja?\") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.\nIf the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.\nSimilarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.\nThe next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, \"If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?\" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: \"no I would not say yes,\" even though he would; or \"yes I would say no,\" even though he wouldn't.)\nFinally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, \"If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?\" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified).

Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out.

Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.\n1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel.

A secret message lies within the P.S. that will assist you in searching for the password.\"\nThe P.S. is given in a reformatted version with specific capitalizations:\n\"P.S.\nIsaac Newton:\nNear Orange Bags Lying East.\nGets As Strange Equally Slowly.\"\n\nStep 2: Decode the secret message from the P.S.\nWe look at the first letter of each capitalized word in the last two lines:\nFrom \"Near Orange Bags Lying East\":\nN (Near)\nO (Orange)\nB (Bags)\nL (Lying)\nE (East)\nThese letters form the word \"NOBLE\".\n\nFrom \"Gets As Strange Equally Slowly\":\nG (Gets)\nA (As)\nS (Strange)\nE (Equally)\nS (Slowly)\nThese letters form the word \"GASES\".\n\nCombining these, the secret message from the P.S. is \"NOBLE GASES\".\n\nStep 3: Understand the role of the secret message.\nThe hint states that this message \"will assist you in searching for the password\". This implies that the password itself is one of the noble gases, or closely related to them. The noble gases are: Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn) (Oganesson is also a noble gas but less commonly known in such puzzles).\n\nStep 4: Analyze the main body of the postcard for clues pointing to a specific noble gas.\nThe main text of the postcard is:\n\"A relative of mine was expelled.\nIt was my niece.\nWouldn't you agree?\nIt was because she joined a band of bikers.\nShe's doing lots of things wrong.\nShe always shows a lot of toughness.\"\n\nWe need to find which noble gas fits the description, particularly focusing on the line \"It was my niece.\"\nThe word \"niece\" is key here. If we consider the chemical symbols of the noble gases, \"Ne\" is the symbol for Neon. The word \"niece\" contains \"N\" and \"e\" at the beginning (n-ie-ce, or if one considers the sound, or simply the letters). This is a strong pointer towards Neon.\n\nStep 5: Corroborate \"Neon\" with other clues in the postcard.\nLet's see if the other statements about the niece can be metaphorically or literally linked to Neon:\n\n*   \"A relative of mine was expelled.\":\n    *   Neon is a member of the noble gas family (chemical \"relatives\").\n    *   Neon is commercially obtained by fractional distillation of liquid air. In this process, components of air are separated, which can be likened to being \"expelled\".\n\n*   \"It was because she joined a band of bikers.\":\n    *   Neon is famously used in neon signs, which are often bright and colorful, and used for advertisements for places like bars, clubs, or entertainment venues, some of which might be frequented by \"bikers\".\n    *   The word \"band\" can also refer to spectral bands. Neon has a very characteristic and prominent emission spectrum, producing bright lines (bands) of light, particularly in the red-orange region.\n\n*   \"She's doing lots of things wrong.\":\n    *   This is more of a narrative element describing the rebellious character of the \"niece\". It might not have a direct chemical interpretation, or it could be a misdirection or simply to build the story.\n\n*   \"She always shows a lot of toughness.\":\n    *   Noble gases, including Neon, are known for their chemical inertness (unreactivity). This lack of reactivity can be metaphorically interpreted as \"toughness\" or resilience against chemical change.\n\nStep 6: Consider the mention of \"Isaac Newton:\" in the P.S.\nIsaac Newton made pioneering contributions to the field of optics, including the study of light and spectra using prisms. Neon is well-known for the bright, distinctive reddish-orange light it emits when an electric current is passed through it, and its emission spectrum is a key identifier. The connection to Newton's work on light and spectra makes Neon a fitting choice among the noble gases, especially those known for visual characteristics.\n\nStep 7: Conclusion.\nThe acrostic in the P.S. clearly points to \"NOBLE GASES\". The line \"It was my niece\" in the main postcard text strongly suggests \"Neon\" because \"niece\" contains \"Ne\", the chemical symbol for Neon. The other descriptions of the niece and the mention of Isaac Newton further support \"Neon\" as the password.\n\nTherefore, the password is \"Neon\".\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{Neon}}$.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?\n1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.\n2.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "Question: The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?\n1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.\n2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.\n3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.\n4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).\n5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.\n6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.\n7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).\n8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.\n9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.\n10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.\n Hint: In case you need all the kid's names:\nThe boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.\nThe girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.\nThe last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.", "Hint": "In case you need all the kid's names:\nThe boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.\nThe girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.\nThe last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.", "Human Solution": "From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.

From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.

The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:\nStacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.\nBart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.\n_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.\n_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.\nGeorgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.\nThe only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).\nIn summary:\nBart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.\nStacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.\nJason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.\nRoger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.\nGeorgia Roon beat Lila Peach by a Patrol Boat.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": NaN, "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 20, "Question": "Question: The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?\n Hint: Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.", "Hint": "Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise.

(R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.\nDetective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.\nA prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.\nMr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": NaN, "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:\nIn the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).\nThe monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: \"white\" or \"black\". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right.

They guess their own hat color starting from the back of the line. Each person sees the hats of those in front of them. Everyone hears the guess and its outcome for preceding people.\n\nLet N=10 be the number of people. We can assign numerical values to the hat colors, for example, white = 0 and black = 1. This allows us to use mathematical operations.\n\nThe core idea is that the first person to speak (Person 10, at the very back) will sacrifice their chance of certain survival to convey a crucial piece of information to the others. The remaining 9 people can use this information, along with the hats they see, to guarantee their own survival.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n\n**1. The Agreement (Night Before)**\nAll 10 people agree on the following plan:\n*   \"White\" will represent the number 0.\n*   \"Black\" will represent the number 1.\n*   Person 10 will communicate the parity (evenness or oddness) of the sum of the hat colors of the 9 people in front of them.\n*   Each subsequent person will use this information, along with the hats they see and the announcements of people behind them, to deduce their own hat color.\n\n**2. Person 10's Turn (The Sacrifice)**\n*   Person 10 is at the back of the line and can see the hats of Person 1 through Person 9. Let $h_i$ be the color (0 or 1) of Person $i$'s hat.\n*   Person 10 calculates the sum of these 9 hat colors modulo 2: $S_9 = (h_1 + h_2 + \\dots + h_9) \\pmod 2$.\n*   Person 10 must guess their own hat color, $h_{10}$. They will use their guess to communicate the value of $S_9$.\n    *   If $S_9 = 0$ (meaning an even number of black hats among Persons 1-9), Person 10 announces \"white\".\n    *   If $S_9 = 1$ (meaning an odd number of black hats among Persons 1-9), Person 10 announces \"black\".\n*   This guess is for Person 10's own hat. Since $h_{10}$ is random, Person 10 has a 50% chance of guessing correctly and surviving. Regardless of whether Person 10 survives or dies, their announcement (\"white\" or \"black\") tells everyone else the value of $S_9$. Let $g_{10}$ be the value (0 or 1) corresponding to Person 10's guess. All other people (Persons 1-9) now know that $S_9 = g_{10}$.\n\n**3. Person 9's Turn**\n*   Person 9 can see the hats of Person 1 through Person 8.\n*   Person 9 calculates the sum of these 8 hat colors modulo 2: $S_8 = (h_1 + h_2 + \\dots + h_8) \\pmod 2$.\n*   Person 9 knows $S_9$ from Person 10's announcement.\n*   The sum $S_9$ can be written as $S_9 = (h_1 + \\dots + h_8 + h_9) \\pmod 2 = (S_8 + h_9) \\pmod 2$.\n*   Therefore, Person 9 can determine their own hat color $h_9$ by calculating: $h_9 = (S_9 - S_8) \\pmod 2$. (This is equivalent to $(S_9 + S_8) \\pmod 2$ if we want to avoid negative results before modulo, but since we work with 0 and 1, $(0-1)\\pmod 2 = -1\\pmod 2 = 1\\pmod 2$, and $(1-0)\\pmod 2 = 1\\pmod 2$, etc. it works fine).\n*   Person 9 announces their calculated hat color (0 for \"white\", 1 for \"black\"). This guess is guaranteed to be correct, so Person 9 survives.\n\n**4. Person $k$'s Turn (for $k = 8, 7, \\ldots, 1$)**\nThe logic continues down the line. For any Person $k$:\n*   Person $k$ can see the hats of Person 1 through Person $k-1$.\n*   Person $k$ calculates the sum of these $k-1$ hat colors modulo 2: $S_{k-1} = (h_1 + h_2 + \\dots + h_{k-1}) \\pmod 2$. (For Person 1, who sees no hats, $S_0 = 0$).\n*   Person $k$ knows $S_9$ from Person 10's announcement.\n*   Person $k$ also knows the actual hat colors $h_{k+1}, h_{k+2}, \\dots, h_9$ because Persons $k+1$ through 9 have already announced their hat colors correctly and survived. Let $S_{known\\_behind} = (h_{k+1} + h_{k+2} + \\dots + h_9) \\pmod 2$. (For Person 9, this sum is empty and equals 0).\n*   The sum $S_9$ can be written as $S_9 = (h_1 + \\dots + h_{k-1} + h_k + h_{k+1} + \\dots + h_9) \\pmod 2 = (S_{k-1} + h_k + S_{known\\_behind}) \\pmod 2$.\n*   Therefore, Person $k$ can determine their own hat color $h_k$ by calculating: $h_k = (S_9 - S_{k-1} - S_{known\\_behind}) \\pmod 2$.\n*   Person $k$ announces their calculated hat color. This guess is guaranteed to be correct, so Person $k$ survives.\n\n**Outcome of the Strategy**\n*   Persons 1 through 9 are all guaranteed to correctly guess their hat", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate.

Y. Athletic, Jamie, 5, Lottie, 4\nThe final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).\nThere were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.\nThis leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.\nThis means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).\nFrom clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.\nIslip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.\nFrom clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).\nWhite is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.\nFrom clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.\nFrom clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.\nSince Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.\nLottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.\nIn the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.\nFrom clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.\nFrom clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.\nRegina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.\nRegina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.\nKristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.\nLottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.\nLottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).\nBills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": NaN, "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 37, "Question": "Question: On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.\nOf the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.\nEach night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.\nNow, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes.

It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night.

Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat.

At the end of the race, the friends will move up or down in ranks according on how they did. If you can't move up or down any ranks, you will stay in the same rank that you are currently in. The scoring will be as follows\n1st Place- Move up 5 ranks\n2nd Place- Move up 4 ranks\n3rd Place- Move up 3 ranks\n4th and 5th Places- Move up 1 rank each\n6th and 7th Places- Stay the same rank\n8th and 9th Places- Move down 1 rank each\n10th and 11th Places- Move down 2 ranks each\n12th Place- Move down 3 ranks\nThe ranks people have right now:\nLieutenant General Stephen\nColonel Anna\nMajor Felicia\nCaptain Clark\nSergeant Abby\nSergeant Brad\nCorporal Jessica\nPrivate Paul\nPrivate Kelsey\nPrivate Luke\nPrivate Brianna\nPrivate Ben\nThis is a list of the ranks again, just in case anyone forgot it.\nRanks\n1. Lieutenant General\n2. Brigadier General\n3. Colonel\n4. Lieutenant Colonel\n5. Major\n6. Captain\n7. First Lieutenant\n8. Second Lieutenant\n9. First Sergeant\n10. Sergeant\n11. Corporal\n12. Private\nThe First Lap:\nStephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.\nIn the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.\nThe Second Lap:\nPaul slipped on a water puddle and fell back to third place, leaving the person he was right by, way in front. Clark moved up 2 spots, pushing those two people back one place each. Then, Felicia and Anna switched places, and Luke and Brad switched places. The people in 11th and 12th ended up switching places just before the third lap as well.\nThe Third Lap:\nThe two people in 10th and 11th place switched spots, the two people in 5th and 6th places switched spots, and the two people in 7th and 8th places switched spots. Brad ended up getting passed by the two people directly behind him, and Jessica was passed by the person directly behind her. Everyone then finished in the order that they are currently in.\nCan you figure out which place everyone is in, and what rank they will be after this race?\n Hint: On the first lap the top 4 runners were Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica. Felicia and Brianna weren't far behind which means they were in 5th and 6th place.

E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.\nLet's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.\nIf I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.\nThis means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.\nThis leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A.

Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.\nOn fourth thought (the economics):\nIf the engineering balance is \"close to equilibrium\", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": "The question asks whether renting a truck to bring water from the bottom of a 13-lock canal to the top is a reasonable contract, given that the canal has no water supply at the top and each lock usage loses 7000 L of water. The truck can carry 22 tons of water.\n\nLet's break down the information and use the hint: \"Where are the water losses?\"\n\n1.  **Understanding Lock Operation and Water Loss:**\n    *   When a boat travels *downwards* through a flight of locks, water is released from each lock chamber to the level below. For a boat to pass from the summit pound (topmost level) all the way to the bottom, the net effect is that one lockful of water is transferred from the summit pound to the pound below the lowest lock. So, each downward transit of the entire flight results in a loss of one lockful from the summit.\n    *   When a boat travels *upwards* through a flight of locks, water from the pound below is used to fill the lock chamber, and then that water (plus the boat) is raised to the level of the pound above. For a boat to pass from the bottom all the way to the summit pound, the net effect is that one lockful of water is transferred from the pound below the lowest lock to the summit pound.\n    *   The problem states \"Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.\" We interpret this to mean that for each complete boat transit *downwards* through the flight of locks, the summit pound loses 7000 L of water. If boats go up, they effectively bring water up to the summit. However, the problem implies a need for replenishment, suggesting a net loss or a scenario where downward traffic dominates or specific lockages cause loss without full upward transit compensation. The critical issue is the depletion of the summit pound.\n\n2.  **The Hint: \"Where are the water losses?\"**\n    The water \"lost\" from the top of the canal system (the summit pound) when a boat goes down isn't destroyed. It flows down through the locks and ultimately ends up at the bottom of the canal flight. Therefore, the water needed to replenish the top is actually available at the bottom of the system.\n\n3.  **Truck Capacity:**\n    *   The truck carries 22 tons of water.\n    *   Since 1 ton = 1000 kg, and the density of water is approximately 1 kg/L, 22 tons of water is 22,000 kg, which is equivalent to 22,000 Liters (L).\n\n4.  **Replenishment Capacity of the Truck:**\n    *   Each lock usage (interpreted as a full downward transit depleting the summit) loses 7000 L from the top.\n    *   One truckload brings 22,000 L of water.\n    *   So, one truckload can compensate for 22,000 L / 7,000 L/transit \u2248 3.14 downward transits.\n\n5.  **Reasonableness of the Contract:**\n    Is using a truck reasonable?\n    *   **Efficiency and Scale:** Canals are large-scale civil engineering structures. A lock holds 7000 L (which is 7 cubic meters). If the canal has even moderate traffic, say 10 downward transits a day, this would require 10 * 7000 L = 70,000 L of water. To replenish this, it would take 70,000 L / 22,000 L/trip \u2248 3.18 truck trips per day. This involves significant logistical effort: driving the truck (often on roads not designed for heavy, frequent HGV traffic next to canals), loading 22 tons of water, driving to the top, and unloading it. This is a very labor-intensive and slow process for water replenishment.\n    *   **Cost:** Renting a heavy truck, fuel costs, driver wages, and the time involved would make this an extremely expensive way to move water on an ongoing basis.\n    *   **The Engineering Alternative:** As the hint guides us, the water lost from the top accumulates at the bottom. The standard engineering solution for canals with no natural summit feed is to install a **back-pumping system**. This system pumps water from the lowest pound back up to the summit pound. While pumps have an initial capital cost and ongoing electricity costs, they are designed to move large volumes of water much more efficiently and with less manual intervention than trucking.\n    *   **Sustainability:** Relying on a truck for primary water supply to a 13-lock canal is not a sustainable operational model. It's more of an emergency, temporary fix.\n\n**Conclusion on Reasonableness:**\n\nThe contract is **not reasonable** as a long-term or primary solution for maintaining the water level in the summit pound of a 13-lock canal.\n\n**Why:**\n1.  **Inefficiency:** The volume of water a truck can carry (22,000 L) is small relative to the potential water demand of a canal. It would require frequent trips for even moderate canal usage (e.g., one truckload only compensates for about 3 downward boat passages).\n2.  **High Operational Cost:** Transporting water by truck is expensive due to fuel, vehicle rental/maintenance, and labor costs.\n3.  **Availability of a Better Solution:** The water \"lost\" from the top is available at the bottom of the lock system. The standard and more efficient engineering solution is to pump this water back to the top using a dedicated pumping station. This is more cost-effective and sustainable for the volumes required by a canal. The truck is essentially performing the job of a pump in a very inefficient manner.\n\nTherefore, contracting a truck for this purpose suggests a lack of proper infrastructure (like a pumping system) or a misunderstanding of efficient water management for canals. It's a makeshift solution, not a reasonable, ongoing operational strategy.\n\nFinal Answer: The contract is not reasonable. The primary reason is that the water lost from the top of the canal accumulates at the bottom. A far more efficient and cost-effective method for replenishing the water at the top would be to install a pumping system to move the water from the bottom back to the top. Using a truck to transport 22,000 L of water at a time is a logistically complex, expensive, and low-capacity solution for the needs of a 13-lock canal, only sufficient for about 3 downward boat passages per truckload. It is not a sustainable or economically viable long-term solution.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

Yes, 10 / 5 = 2.\nSo, each of the remaining 5 friends received an additional 2 tokens.\nThe number of tokens each of these 5 friends ended up with is N + (N / (G - 1)) = 10 + 2 = 12 tokens.\n\nLet's check Case 2: G = 8, N = 15.\nThe number of other friends is G - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7.\nIs N divisible by G - 1? Is 15 divisible by 7? No, 15 is not divisible by 7 (15 / 7 is not an integer).\nSo, Case 2 is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is Case 1:\nThe number of friends G = 6.\nThe initial number of tokens per friend N = 10.\nWendy gives up her 10 tokens. These are divided among the other 5 friends.\nEach of these 5 friends gets an additional 10 / 5 = 2 tokens.\nSo, these 5 friends end up with 10 + 2 = 12 tokens each. Wendy ends up with 0 tokens.\n\nThe question asks: \"How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?\"\n\"How many friends were there?\" refers to the initial number of friends, G = 6.\n\"how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?\" refers to the G-1 = 5 friends who received tokens in the end. Each of these 5 friends ended up with 12 tokens. Wendy, the 6th friend, ended up with 0 tokens. When the question asks \"how many ... did each ... end up with\", it typically refers to a single value if one exists. In this case, 5 friends ended up with 12 tokens each.\n\nSo, there were 6 friends. Each of the 5 friends who got tokens ended up with 12 tokens.\n\nThe final answer is composed of two numbers: the number of friends and the number of tokens each of the remaining friends ended up with.\nNumber of friends = 6.\nNumber of tokens each of the 5 friends ended up with = 12.\n\nFinal answer: There were 6 friends, and 5 of them ended up with 12 Golden kebab tokens each. (The problem asks for how many tokens \"each friend\" ended up with, implying a single number, so this should refer to the 12 tokens). So we state 6 friends and 12 tokens.\n\nFinal answer: There were 6 friends. The friends who received tokens at the end each received 12 Golden kebab tokens.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "1"}

For each team, there were:\n[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.\n[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.\n[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.\n[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.\n[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.\nThe Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.

We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.\n[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying \"there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.\"\n[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:\nPrime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]\nSquare - 0,4,9 [2 games each]\nNeither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]\nSince all of the \"neither prime nor square\" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 \"prime or square\" games for each team.

Subtract 5 from 45, leaving 40.  Divide 40 by 2, leaving 20.  20 does not equal 14, so the sum of each group can not be 14.  Repeating the preceding sequence for each of the possible sums leaves only two possible results: 18 (1 + 8 = 9, 45 - 9 = 36, 36 / 2 = 18) and 21 (2 + 1 = 3, 45 - 3 = 42, 42 / 2 = 21).

For the statement to be true, we must interpret the numbers or the operation \"+\" in a non-standard way. The hint \"nan\" often stands for \"Not a Number\" in computing, which suggests that we might be dealing with a context where standard numerical rules don't apply, or the statement itself is not a conventional numerical truth.\n\nLet's consider the famous Pythagorean triple (3, 4, 5). In a right-angled triangle, if the lengths of the two shorter sides (legs) are 3 units and 4 units, then the length of the longest side (the hypotenuse) is 5 units. This is because 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 (which is 9 + 16 = 25).\n\nThe question \"How is it possible that 3 + 4 = 5?\" can be interpreted in this geometric context.\nIf \"3\" and \"4\" represent the lengths of the two legs of a right-angled triangle, and the operation \"+\" is interpreted not as standard arithmetic addition, but as a specific type of geometric combination, then the \"result\" (the hypotenuse) is \"5\".\n\nFor example, if we consider vectors:\nLet vector **A** have a magnitude of 3 (e.g., **A** = (3,0)).\nLet vector **B** have a magnitude of 4 and be orthogonal to **A** (e.g., **B** = (0,4)).\nThe vector sum **C** = **A** + **B** would be (3,0) + (0,4) = (3,4).\nThe magnitude of vector **C** is |**C**| = \u221a(3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2) = \u221a(9 + 16) = \u221a25 = 5.\n\nSo, if \"3\" and \"4\" refer to the magnitudes of two orthogonal vectors, and \"5\" refers to the magnitude of their vector sum, the statement \"3 + 4 = 5\" is a highly informal and notationally abusive way of expressing this relationship. The \"+\" sign is not representing the sum of the magnitudes (3+4=7), but rather the result of combining the entities (vectors or sides of a triangle) in a specific way that leads to a new entity whose characteristic measure is 5.\n\nThe hint \"nan\" (\"Not a Number\") can be interpreted as follows:\n1.  The equation \"3 + 4 = 5\" is not a (true) numerical statement under standard arithmetic rules. In that sense, the truth value of the equation as a standard arithmetic proposition is \"false,\" or one might say the equation itself (as a purported arithmetical truth) is \"not a number\" or invalid.\n2.  The operation \"+\" in \"3 + 4 = 5\" is not behaving like standard addition of numbers. Its meaning is context-dependent (here, geometric). Thus, the expression \"3+4\" in this context doesn't yield a number in the usual additive way, so the operation itself steps outside the realm of simple numerical calculation leading to \"Not a Number\" in terms of standard arithmetic processes.\n\nTherefore, it is possible that 3 + 4 = 5 in the context of a right-angled triangle, where 3 and 4 are the lengths of the legs and 5 is the length of the hypotenuse, and the \"+\" sign is used colloquially (and incorrectly from a strict mathematical notation standpoint) to represent this geometric relationship.\n\nAnother possibility, though less connected to \"nan\" as \"Not a Number\" but still mathematically valid, is modular arithmetic:\n3 + 4 = 7.\nWe want 7 to be equivalent to 5 in some modulus `m`.\nSo, 7 \u2261 5 (mod m).\nThis means 7 - 5 \u2261 0 (mod m).\nSo, 2 \u2261 0 (mod m).\nThis implies that `m` must be a divisor of 2. So, `m` can be 1 or 2.\nIf m=1, all integers are congruent, so 3+4=5 is true (as is any equation). This is trivial.\nIf m=2:\n3 \u2261 1 (mod 2)\n4 \u2261 0 (mod 2)\n5 \u2261 1 (mod 2)\nSo, the equation becomes 1 + 0 \u2261 1 (mod 2), which simplifies to 1 \u2261 1 (mod 2). This is true.\nThus, in modulo 2 arithmetic, the statement 3 + 4 = 5 holds true. The hint \"nan\" doesn't directly support this interpretation as clearly as the Pythagorean one.\n\nGiven the commonality of the 3-4-5 triangle riddle, the Pythagorean interpretation with the \"nan\" hint explaining the non-standard nature of the arithmetic is the most likely intended solution.\n\nFinal Answer: It is possible if \"3\" and \"4\" are the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle, and \"5\" is the length of the hypotenuse. The \"+\" symbol is used informally to represent the geometric combination of these sides to form the triangle, rather than standard arithmetic addition. The hint \"nan\" (Not a Number) suggests that the equation is not a standard arithmetical truth, or the operation isn't a standard numerical one. For example, if we have a segment of length 3 and another of length 4, and we place them at a right angle, the distance between their far ends will be 5. This is a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem (3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 5\u00b2).", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

Also, the result of $v_3 / 5$ must be a value corresponding to a valid single Roman numeral letter for $L_2$ or $L_4$.\n\nLet's test possible Roman numeral values for $L_3$:\nCase 1: $L_3 = I \\implies v_3 = 1$.\nThen $v_1 = 20 \\times 1 = 20$.

'U' is a possibility. (1 -> U)\n- 2nd letter (S): Digit 2 can be S, K, Q, T. 'S' is a possibility. (2 -> S)\n- 3rd letter (E): Digit 3 can be I, H, E, N. 'E' is a possibility. (3 -> E)\n- 4th letter (F): Digit 4 can be O, I, F, W. 'F' is a possibility. (4 -> F)\n- 5th letter (U): Digit 5 can be Z, U, Y, S. 'U' is a possibility. (5 -> U)\n- 6th letter (L): Digit 6 can be I, L, E, C. 'L' is a possibility.

Not a candidate.\n- \"futile\" is 6 letters long. This is a candidate.\n- \"ineffective\" is 11 letters long. Not a candidate.\n- \"worthless\" is 9 letters long. Not a candidate.\n- \"unhelpful\" is 9 letters long. Not a candidate.\n\nLet's test the candidate \"futile\" (F U T I L E):\n- 1st letter (F): Digit 1 can be O, U, D, B. 'F' is NOT a possibility.\nTherefore, \"futile\" cannot be formed.\n\nLet's search for other 6-letter antonyms of \"useful\". A less common but valid antonym is \"otiose\".\n\"Otiose\" means \"serving no practical purpose or result; futile\" or \"(of a person) idle.\" This is a good antonym for \"useful.\"\nLet's test \"otiose\" (O T I O S E):\n- 1st letter (O): Digit 1 can be O, U, D, B. 'O' is a possibility. (1 -> O)\n- 2nd letter (T): Digit 2 can be S, K, Q, T. 'T' is a possibility. (2 -> T)\n- 3rd letter (I): Digit 3 can be I, H, E, N. 'I' is a possibility.

(5 -> S)\n- 6th letter (E): Digit 6 can be I, L, E, C. 'E' is a possibility. (6 -> E)\nSo, \"otiose\" can be formed from 123456.\n\nLet's consider another 6-letter antonym candidate for \"useful\", such as \"effete\" (meaning lacking effectiveness or vitality).\nTest \"effete\" (E F F E T E):\n- 1st letter (E): Digit 1 can be O, U, D, B. 'E' is NOT a possibility.\nTherefore, \"effete\" cannot be formed.\n\nAnother possibility: \"unmeet\" (meaning not fitting or appropriate). This could be an antonym contextually.\nTest \"unmeet\" (U N M E E T):\n- 1st letter (U): Digit 1 can be O, U, D, B. 'U' is a possibility. (1 -> U)\n- 2nd letter (N): Digit 2 can be S, K, Q, T. 'N' is NOT a possibility.\nTherefore, \"unmeet\" cannot be formed.\n\nThe pair of words (\"useful\", \"otiose\") fits all conditions:\n1. Both are 6 letters long.\n2. \"useful\" can be formed from 123456.\n3. \"otiose\" can be formed from 123456.\n4. \"useful\" and \"otiose\" are antonyms.\n5. One of the words is \"useful\", as per the hint.\n\nThus, the two words are \"useful\" and \"otiose\".\n\nFinal Answer: The two words are useful and otiose.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "1", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

We are told H = 128.\nLet N be the total number of pennies on the table. N is very large.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Create the first subgroup:** Count out exactly 128 pennies from the large pile of pennies. Separate this group of 128 pennies from the rest. Let's call this subgroup P1.\n\n2.  **Define the second subgroup:** The remaining N - 128 pennies form the second subgroup. Let's call this subgroup P2.\n\n3.  **Flip the pennies in the first subgroup:** Take subgroup P1 (which contains 128 pennies) and flip over every single penny in it. Let's call this modified subgroup P1'.\n\nNow, we need to show that subgroup P1' and subgroup P2 have the same number of heads facing up.\n\nLet's reason this through:\n\n*   When you initially selected the 128 pennies for subgroup P1, let's say there were 'x' heads in this subgroup P1. Since you are blindfolded, you don't know the value of x. The number of tails in P1 would then be (128 - x).\n\n*   The remaining pennies (subgroup P2) would then contain the rest of the heads. Since there were initially 128 heads in total on the table, and x of them are in P1, the number of heads in subgroup P2 is (128 - x).\n\n*   Now, consider what happens when you flip all the pennies in subgroup P1 to create P1':\n    *   The 'x' heads in P1 become 'x' tails in P1'.\n    *   The (128 - x) tails in P1 become (128 - x) heads in P1'.\n    So, after flipping, the number of heads in subgroup P1' is (128 - x).\n\n*   Let's summarize the number of heads in the two final subgroups:\n    *   Number of heads in P1' (the flipped group of 128 pennies) = 128 - x.\n    *   Number of heads in P2 (the remaining N - 128 pennies, untouched) = 128 - x.\n\nSince both subgroups have (128 - x) heads, they have the same number of heads facing up. This procedure works regardless of how many heads (x) were in the initial selection of 128 pennies, and it can be performed while blindfolded as it only requires counting and flipping.\n\nSo, the two subgroups are:\n1.  The pile of 128 pennies that you separated and then flipped over.\n2.  The pile of the remaining pennies.\n\nThese two subgroups will have the same number of heads.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Take 128 pennies, flip them all over.

It ends with the letters AL.\n- Therefore, Word 6 must start with AL.\n\nNow let's find Word 6.\nClue 6: \"Solitary.\" (starting with AL)\nA word meaning \"solitary\" that starts with AL is ALONE.\n- Word 6 = ALONE. It ends with the letters NE.\n- Therefore, Word 7 must start with NE.\n\nLet's check for consistency. We assumed Word 7 was NERO. NERO starts with NE. This matches the ending of ALONE (NE). So the chain of words is consistent and closes the loop correctly.\n\nLet's list the words and verify all connections and clues:\n1.  **DETER** (Clue: To prevent by fear)\n    - Ends in ER.\n2.  **ERATO** (Clue: One of the muses)\n    - Starts with ER (from DETER). Ends in TO.\n3.  **TOAST** (Clue: Often on the breakfast table)\n    - Starts with TO (from ERATO). Ends in ST.\n4.  **STILE** (Clue: Steps for passing over a fence)\n    - Starts with ST (from TOAST). Ends in LE.\n5.  **LEGAL** (Clue: Lawful)\n    - Starts with LE (from STILE). Ends in AL.\n6.  **ALONE** (Clue: Solitary)\n    - Starts with AL (from LEGAL). Ends in NE.\n7.  **NERO** (Clue: A musical Roman emperor)\n    - Starts with NE (from ALONE). Ends in RO.\n8.  **ROBIN** (Clue: A bird)\n    - Starts with RO (from NERO). Ends in IN.\n9.  **INTER** (Clue: To bury)\n    - Starts with IN (from ROBIN). Ends in ER.\n10. **ERODE** (Clue: To eat into)\n    - Starts with ER (from INTER). Ends in DE.\n\nThe last two letters of Word 10 (ERODE) are DE. These should be the first two letters of Word 1 (DETER). This is correct, as DETER starts with DE. All clues are satisfied, and all letter links are correct.\n\nThe solution is:\n1. DETER\n2. ERATO\n3. TOAST\n4. STILE\n5. LEGAL\n6. ALONE\n7. NERO\n8. ROBIN\n9. INTER\n10. ERODE\n\nFinal answer: The 10 words are:\n1. DETER\n2. ERATO\n3. TOAST\n4. STILE\n5. LEGAL\n6. ALONE\n7. NERO\n8. ROBIN\n9. INTER\n10. ERODE", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

Stu Pidfule had been determined to treat each child equally, and in a way he did, even though Derek, Eric and Monkeyboy all got different amounts.\nHow could this be?\n Hint: nan", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "He had left each of them the same thing. An amount equal to one year of their annual salary.

We need to find a way in which they were treated equally despite the different monetary sums. The hint given is \"nan.\"\n\nLet's consider what the hint \"nan\" could signify. In riddles, short hints like this often refer to a name or a key concept. \"Nan\" is a common diminutive for names like Anne or Nancy, and is often used to refer to a grandmother (\"Nana\").\n\nConsider the children: Derek, Eric, and Monkeyboy.\nIf Stu Pidfule wanted to treat them equally, he must have given them something of equal standing or status, even if the monetary value was different.\n\nThe hint \"Nan\" could refer to another child, perhaps a daughter named Nan.\nIf Stu Pidfule had children named Derek, Eric, Monkeyboy, and Nan, how could he treat them all equally?\nOne fundamental way a parent treats children equally is by giving them their family name (surname).\nSo, Derek Pidfule, Eric Pidfule, Monkeyboy Pidfule, and (if she exists) Nan Pidfule would all share the surname Pidfule. This is a form of equal treatment \u2013 they all equally carry the family name.\n\nThe problem focuses on the three children mentioned in the will's provision of money: Derek, Eric, and Monkeyboy. They all got different amounts of money.\nHowever, they were all treated equally \"in a way.\" That way could be that they all received Stu Pidfule's surname.\n\nSo, the equal treatment was that they all inherited his last name: Pidfule.\nDerek Pidfule, Eric Pidfule, Monkeyboy Pidfule. They are all equally \"Pidfule.\"\nThe hint \"Nan\" suggests there might be another child (or someone Stu considered like a child, e.g., a granddaughter he raised) named Nan, who would also be Nan Pidfule, sharing in this equal treatment of bearing the family name. The question focuses on Derek, Eric, and Monkeyboy for the monetary part, stating they got different amounts.\n\nThus, the equality lies in them all being his children and carrying his surname. The inequality lies in the monetary sums bequeathed to them.\n\nHow could this be?\nThey were treated equally in that they all received his surname (Pidfule).\nDerek Pidfule, Eric Pidfule, and Monkeyboy Pidfule. The hint \"Nan\" would then refer to another child, Nan Pidfule, who was also treated equally in this respect. The money they received was different, but the name they carried, signifying their equal status as his children, was the same.\n\nThe \"in a way he did\" treat them equally refers to this non-monetary aspect.\n\nFinal answer: Stu Pidfule treated each child equally by giving them his surname, Pidfule. Derek Pidfule, Eric Pidfule, and Monkeyboy Pidfule all shared the same last name. The hint \"Nan\" likely refers to another child, Nan Pidfule, who also shared this equal treatment.

{"ID": 111, "Question": "Question: Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.\nUnfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.\nBut in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.\nBut this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.\nBut the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.\nUnfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.\nLet's sum up the assumptions:\n1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.\n2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.\n3. The flower doesn't want to die.\n4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.\n5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.\n6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n7. The dog is rational.\n8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.\n9. The dog doesn't want to die.\n10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).\n11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.\n13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.\n14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.\n15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.\nSo now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?\n Hint:  1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.\nHint 2:\nSince the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.", "Hint": " 1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten.

So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.", "Human Solution": "The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)\nBut why will the dog eat the flower?\n1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die\n2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.\n3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.\n4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.\n5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.\n6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.\n7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison\nOK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).\n8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous\n9. It can eat the flower.

Block 2 (with the A) must have a letter from CRUX.  It can't be C (because then you wouldn't be able to spell JACK) or U (so you can spell QUAD), so it is R.  Block 2 must also have a letter from KNOW.  It can't be K (JACK) or W (WRIT), so it's O.  The letter H can't be on block 1 (SHIM) or block 2 or 3 (JOHN), so H is on block 4.  J is on block 1 (JOHN).  C can't be on block 1 or 2 (JACK) or block 4 (CRUX), so C is on block 3.  U is on block 1 (CRUX), and K is on block 4 (JACK).  W, then, is on block 1 (KNOW).  I isn't on block 1 or 2 (WRIT), or block 4 (SHIM), so I is on block 3.  T is on block 4 (WRIT) and S is on block 2 (SHIM).  Block 4, which we already know has H, K, T, and X, can have only two more letters:  it must have either D or Q (QUAD), and either G or P (PUGS).

There are 3 representatives from each group.\nThe groups are: KINGS, QUEENS, RELIGIOUS FIGURES and STOOGES.\nAmong the KINGS are: James, Saul and Henry.\nAmong the QUEENS are Victoria, Elizabeth and Candace.\nThe RELIGIOUS FIGURES consist of the Pope, Mother Teresa and Gandhi.\nThe STOOGES, of course, are none other than Moe, Larry and Curly.\nThe Stooges decide to play a game with the rest of the group. The game is called Untouchable. The Stooges start the game by tapping certain ones on the shoulder a specific number of times. The object of the game is for the other groups to figure out the pattern the Stooges set (that is, why they tap certain individuals a certain number of times), and to follow the pattern they set.\nThe only stipulation to the game is that people belonging to the RELIGIOUS FIGURES group do not tap anyone; however, they can be tapped.\nThe shoulder taps occur this way, starting with the Stooges (who originated the pattern):\nMoe taps James, Gandhi, the Pope  and  Saul twice each.\nLarry taps Henry, and Curly once each.\nCurly taps Henry and Larry once each.\n(The KINGS catch on and do the following):\nJames taps the Pope, Saul, Gandhi and Moe twice each.\nSaul taps Gandhi, Moe and James and the Pope twice each.\nHenry taps Larry and Curly once each.\n(The QUEENS catch on and do the following):\nElizabeth and Victoria tap each other four times each.\nQuestion:\nWho are the untouchables?\n Hint: Think about the letters in each name.

Neither of them have a counterpart with the same number of vowels. They would, therefore be the untouchables.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": "The problem asks us to identify the \"untouchables\" in a game involving shoulder taps. The hint suggests focusing on the letters in each name. Let's establish the pattern of tapping.\n\nFirst, let's list all the participants and their groups:\nKINGS: James, Saul, Henry\nQUEENS: Victoria, Elizabeth, Candace\nRELIGIOUS FIGURES: Pope, Mother Teresa, Gandhi\nSTOOGES: Moe, Larry, Curly\n\nThe core of the problem is to find a pattern in the tapping behavior. The hint points towards the letters in the names. Let's count the number of vowels (A, E, I, O, U) in each person's name. We will assume 'Y' is not a vowel for this puzzle, and check if this assumption leads to a consistent pattern.\n\nVowel counts for each person:\nKINGS:\n*   James: J-A-M-E-S. Vowels: A, E. (2 vowels)\n*   Saul: S-A-U-L. Vowels: A, U. (2 vowels)\n*   Henry: H-E-N-R-Y. Vowels: E. (1 vowel, assuming Y is not a vowel).\n\nQUEENS:\n*   Victoria: V-I-C-T-O-R-I-A. Vowels: I, O, I, A. (4 vowels)\n*   Elizabeth: E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H. Vowels: E, I, A, E. (4 vowels)\n*   Candace: C-A-N-D-A-C-E. Vowels: A, A, E. (3 vowels)\n\nRELIGIOUS FIGURES:\n*   Pope: P-O-P-E. Vowels: O, E. (2 vowels)\n*   Mother Teresa: M-O-TH-E-R T-E-R-E-S-A. Vowels: O, E, E, E, A. (5 vowels)\n*   Gandhi: G-A-N-D-H-I. Vowels: A, I. (2 vowels)\n\nSTOOGES:\n*   Moe: M-O-E. Vowels: O, E. (2 vowels)\n*   Larry: L-A-R-R-Y. Vowels: A. (1 vowel, assuming Y is not a vowel).\n*   Curly: C-U-R-L-Y. Vowels: U. (1 vowel, assuming Y is not a vowel).\n\nNow let's check this against the tapping information:\n\n1.  **Stooges' Taps:**\n    *   Moe (2 vowels) taps James (2 vowels), Gandhi (2 vowels), Pope (2 vowels), and Saul (2 vowels) twice each.\n        The number of taps (2) matches the number of vowels in the names of the people tapped (and Moe's own vowel count). This suggests a pattern: people with N vowels tap other people with N vowels N times.\n    *   Larry (1 vowel) taps Henry (1 vowel) and Curly (1 vowel) once each.\n        The number of taps (1) matches the number of vowels in the names of the people tapped (and Larry's own vowel count). This supports the pattern and our assumption about 'Y' not being a vowel here. If 'Y' was a vowel, Larry, Henry, Curly would have 2 vowels, and the taps should be twice.\n    *   Curly (1 vowel) taps Henry (1 vowel) and Larry (1 vowel) once each.\n        Same as Larry, this fits the pattern.\n\n2.  **KINGS' Taps:**\n    *   James (2 vowels) taps Pope (2 vowels), Saul (2 vowels), Gandhi (2 vowels), and Moe (2 vowels) twice each.\n        This fits the pattern.\n    *   Saul (2 vowels) taps Gandhi (2 vowels), Moe (2 vowels), James (2 vowels), and Pope (2 vowels) twice each.\n        This fits the pattern.\n    *   Henry (1 vowel) taps Larry (1 vowel) and Curly (1 vowel) once each.\n        This fits the pattern.\n\n3.  **QUEENS' Taps:**\n    *   Elizabeth (4 vowels) and Victoria (4 vowels) tap each other four times each.\n        This fits the pattern (N=4).\n\nThe pattern seems to be: A person X with N vowels taps a person Y with N vowels, N times. People only tap others with the same vowel count as themselves.\n\nNow we need to find the \"untouchables,\" which we interpret as those who are not tapped by anyone.\n\nLet's list people by their vowel counts:\n*   **1 vowel:** Henry, Larry, Curly.\n    *   Henry is tapped by Larry and Curly.\n    *   Larry is tapped by Henry and Curly.\n    *   Curly is tapped by Henry and Larry.\n    *   All are tapped.\n*   **2 vowels:** James, Saul, Pope, Gandhi, Moe.\n    *   James is tapped by Moe and Saul.\n    *   Saul is tapped by Moe and James.\n    *   Pope is tapped by Moe, James, and Saul. (Religious figures can be tapped).\n    *   Gandhi is tapped by Moe, James, and Saul. (Religious figures can be tapped).\n    *   Moe is tapped by James and Saul.\n    *   All are tapped.\n*   **3 vowels:** Candace.\n    *   There are no other people with 3 vowels mentioned in the problem with whom Candace could interact based on the established pattern. The problem states that for QUEENS, \"Elizabeth and Victoria tap each other four times each\", with no mention of Candace tapping or being tapped. This implies Candace is not tapped.\n*   **4 vowels:** Victoria, Elizabeth.\n    *   Victoria is tapped by Elizabeth.\n    *   Elizabeth is tapped by Victoria.\n    *   Both are tapped.\n*   **5 vowels:** Mother Teresa.\n    *   There are no other people with 5 vowels mentioned in the problem. Mother Teresa is a religious figure, so she does not tap anyone. Since there's no one else with 5 vowels to tap her according to the pattern, she is not tapped.\n\nSo, the people who are not tapped are Candace and Mother Teresa. These are the \"untouchables.\"\n\nLet's confirm our assumption about 'Y'. If 'Y' were a vowel in names like Larry, Curly, Henry, they would have 2 vowels each. Then they should tap each other twice. But they tap each other once. This would contradict the pattern. So 'Y' is treated as a consonant in this puzzle, and the vowels are A,", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

The hint \"Use the Number System\" is crucial for solving it. Let's analyze each clue and connect it to a symbol typically found on a keyboard, associated with the number keys. The clues appear in a specific order.\n\n1.  **\"I am always excited\"**: This points to the **exclamation mark (!)**. The exclamation mark is used to convey excitement or emphasis. On a standard QWERTY keyboard, ! is typically found by pressing Shift + 1.\n\n2.  **\"I tell people where things are at\"**: This describes the **\"at\" symbol (@)**. It's used in email addresses (user@domain) and to denote location or rate. @ is typically Shift + 2.\n\n3.  **\"You can play a game on me\"**: This suggests the **hash symbol (#)**, also known as the pound sign or number sign. A common game, tic-tac-toe, is played on a grid that resembles a hash symbol. The # symbol is also called the \"number sign,\" fitting the \"Number System\" hint. # is typically Shift + 3.\n\n4.  **\"I'm very rich\"**: This points to the **dollar sign ($)**, which is a symbol for currency and wealth. $ is typically Shift + 4.\n\n5.  **\"I give percentages\"**: This directly refers to the **percent sign (%)**. % is typically Shift + 5.\n\n6.  **\"I am always looking up\"**: This describes the **caret symbol (^)**, which visually points upwards. It's also used for exponentiation (raising to a power), which can be seen as \"going up.\" ^ is typically Shift + 6.\n\n7.  **\"And.........\"**: This suggests the **ampersand symbol (&)**, which means \"and.\" & is typically Shift + 7.\n\n8.  **\"I look like a light in the sky\"**: This points to the **asterisk symbol (*)**. \"Asterisk\" means \"little star,\" and the symbol often resembles a star. * is typically Shift + 8.\n\n9.  **\"I keep things arranged that are to my right\"**: This describes an **opening parenthesis ( ( )**. In mathematics and writing, an opening parenthesis groups and arranges the content that follows it (to its right). ( is typically Shift + 9.\n\n10. **\"I keep things arranged that are to my left\"**: This describes a **closing parenthesis ( ) )**. It completes the grouping or arrangement of the content that precedes it (to its left, enclosed by the matching opening parenthesis). ) is typically Shift + 0.\n\nThe clues perfectly match the symbols found above the number keys 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0 on a standard QWERTY keyboard, in that precise order. The hint \"Use the Number System\" guides us to consider these number keys and their associated shifted symbols.\n\nThe question \"What Are We?\" asks for the identity of this collection of symbols.

Understand the Seating Structure:**\n*   There is a Left Compartment (LC) and a Right Compartment (RC).\n*   Each compartment has two rows of seats. Let's call them Row 1 (front) and Row 2 (back).\n*   Each row in a compartment has three seats: Window (W), Middle (M), Aisle (A).\n*   So each compartment has 2 * 3 = 6 seats. Total 12 seats for 12 people.\n\n**2. People Involved:**\nHarry, Neville, Ginny, Luna, Hermione, Ron, Malfoy, Parkinson, Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, Nott (12 people).\n\n**3. Placing Harry, Neville, Hermione, and Ron in the Left Compartment (LC):**\n*   Clue 2: Neville is in the left compartment (LC).\n*   Clue 12: Harry must get a window seat.\n*   Clue 1: Harry is sitting across from Neville. This means they are in the same column, different rows, in the same compartment (LC). So Neville is also in a window seat.\n*   Clue 15: Harry is closer to the front of the train. Let's assume Row 1 is the front row and Row 2 is the back row. So Harry is in Row 1 and Neville is in Row 2.\n    *   Harry is in LW1 (Left compartment, Row 1, Window).\n    *   Neville is in LW2 (Left compartment, Row 2, Window).\n*   Clue 4: Hermione, who is sitting completely diagonal from Neville, is next to either Harry, Ron, or both.\n    *   Neville is in LW2 (Window, Row 2). Completely diagonal means across rows and from one side to the other (e.g., Window to Aisle). So Hermione is in LA1 (Aisle, Row 1) in LC.\n*   Clue 6: Ron is sitting between Harry and Hermione.\n    *   Harry is in LW1, Hermione is in LA1. For Ron to be between them, Ron must be in LM1 (Middle, Row 1) in LC.\n    *   This also satisfies Hermione being next to Ron (from Clue 4).\n*   So, in LC, Row 1: Harry (W), Ron (M), Hermione (A).\n    *   This arrangement also satisfies the hint: \"Harry, Ron, Harmione are together.\"\n\n**4. Placing Luna and Ginny in the Left Compartment (LC):**\n*   Clue 7: Luna is sitting diagonally from Harry.\n    *   Harry is in LW1 (Window, Row 1). Diagonally from Harry can be completely diagonal (LA2) or slightly diagonal (LM2). The definition of \"completely diagonal\" in Clue 4 (Neville LW2 to Hermione LA1) fits the description \"across, over 2\". So Luna is in LA2 (Aisle, Row 2) in LC.\n*   Clue 3: Ginny is sitting next to Neville, Luna, or both.\n    *   Neville is in LW2 (Window, Row 2). Luna is in LA2 (Aisle, Row 2). For Ginny to be next to Neville and/or Luna, Ginny must be in LM2 (Middle, Row 2) in LC. This means Ginny is next to both Neville and Luna.\n*   So, in LC, Row 2: Neville (W), Ginny (M), Luna (A).\n\n**Left Compartment Summary:**\n*   Row 1 (Front): Harry (Window), Ron (Middle), Hermione (Aisle)\n*   Row 2 (Back): Neville (Window), Ginny (Middle), Luna (Aisle)\nAll people in LC are: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, Luna.\n\n**5. Placing Malfoy, Parkinson, Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, Nott in the Right Compartment (RC):**\n*   Clue 5: Malfoy cannot be in the left compartment. So Malfoy is in the Right Compartment (RC).\n*   Clue 13: Hermione is in the aisle across the row from Malfoy.\n    *   Hermione is in LA1 (Aisle, Row 1, LC). \"Across the row\" here means across the corridor, in the same row number and seat type. So Malfoy is in RA1 (Aisle, Row 1, RC).\n*   Clue 14: Crabbe is in the aisle across the row from Luna.\n    *   Luna is in LA2 (Aisle, Row 2, LC). So Crabbe is in RA2 (Aisle, Row 2, RC).\n*   Clue 8: Malfoy is sitting next to Parkinson or Crabbe.\n    *   Malfoy is in RA1. Crabbe is in RA2 (different row). So Malfoy must be next to Parkinson. Thus, Parkinson is in RM1 (Middle, Row 1, RC).\n*   So, in RC, Row 1: RW1 (?), Parkinson (M), Malfoy (A).\n*   Clue 10: Crabbe and Goyle are sitting together next to one other person.\n    *   Crabbe is in RA2 (Aisle, Row 2, RC). For Crabbe and Goyle to sit together, Goyle must be in RM2 (Middle, Row 2, RC). The \"one other person\" they are next to must be in RW2 (Window, Row 2, RC).\n*   So, in RC, Row 2: Person X (W), Goyle (M), Crabbe (A).\n\n**6. Placing Zabini and Nott in the Right Compartment (RC):**\n*   The remaining people are Zabini and Nott. The remaining seats are RW1 and RW2 (Person X).\n*   Clue 9: Zabini is sitting opposite Nott. This means they are in the same column, different rows, in the same compartment (RC). So Zabini and Nott must occupy RW1 and RW2. One is in RW1, the other in RW2. So Person X is either Zabini or Nott.\n*   Clue 11: Nott is diagonal from Parkinson.\n    *   Parkinson is in RM1 (Middle, Row 1, RC).\n    *   If Nott is in RW1, Nott would be in the same row as Parkinson, which is not diagonal.\n    *   So Nott must be in RW2 (Window, Row 2, RC). This position is \"slightly diagonal\" (across the row, one seat over) from Parkinson (RM1). This fits the definition.\n    *   Since Nott is in RW2, Zabini must be in RW1 (opposite Nott).\n*   So, in RC, Row 1: Zabini (W), Parkinson (M), Malfoy (A).\n*   And in RC, Row 2: Nott (W), Goyle (M), Crabbe (A).\n\n**Right Compartment Summary:**\n*   Row 1 (Front): Zabini (Window), Parkinson (Middle), Malfoy (Aisle)\n*   Row 2 (Back): Nott (Window), Goyle (Middle), Crabbe (Aisle)\nAll people in RC are: Zabini, Parkinson, Malfoy, Nott, Goyle, Crabbe.\n\n**Final Seating Arrangement:**\n\n**Left Compartment:**\n*   **Row 1 (Front):**\n    *   Window: Harry\n    *   Middle: Ron\n    *   Aisle: Hermione\n*   **Row 2 (Back):**\n    *   Window: Neville\n    *   Middle: Ginny\n    *   Aisle: Luna\n\n**Right Compartment:**\n*   **Row 1 (Front):**\n    *   Window: Zabini\n    *   Middle: Parkinson\n    *   Aisle: Malfoy\n*   **Row 2 (Back):**\n    *   Window: Nott\n    *   Middle: Goyle\n    *   Aisle: Crabbe\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the clues.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Left Compartment: Row 1 (Front) - Harry (Window), Ron (Middle), Hermione (Aisle); Row 2 (Back) - Neville (Window), Ginny (Middle), Luna (Aisle).

This hint strongly suggests that the two opposite words are related to directions. Common directional opposites include North/South, East/West, Left/Right, Up/Down.\n\nLet's consider these pairs:\n1.  North/South: Both words are 5 letters long, but the code word 6@&^ is 4 letters long. So this pair is not suitable.\n2.  East/West: Both words are 4 letters long. This pair fits the length requirement. Let's check if they can be formed using the given letter sets.\n\nChecking EAST:\n-   The first letter is E. Is E in L1 = {L, E, P, W, T}? Yes, E is in L1. So 6 could be E.\n-   The second letter is A. Is A in L2 = {E, C, O, N, A}? Yes, A is in L2. So @ could be A.\n-   The third letter is S. Is S in L3 = {E, S, B, R, G}? Yes, S is in L3. So & could be S.\n-   The fourth letter is T. Is T in L4 = {N, H, A, T, K}? Yes, T is in L4. So ^ could be T.\nThus, EAST can be formed by choosing 6=E, @=A, &=S, ^=T. All these choices are valid according to the given sets.\n\nChecking WEST:\n-   The first letter is W. Is W in L1 = {L, E, P, W, T}? Yes, W is in L1. So 6 could be W.\n-   The second letter is E. Is E in L2 = {E, C, O, N, A}? Yes, E is in L2. So @ could be E.\n-   The third letter is S. Is S in L3 = {E, S, B, R, G}? Yes, S is in L3. So & could be S.\n-   The fourth letter is T. Is T in L4 = {N, H, A, T, K}? Yes, T is in L4. So ^ could be T.\nThus, WEST can be formed by choosing 6=W, @=E, &=S, ^=T. All these choices are valid according to the given sets.\n\nEAST and WEST are opposites and both are 4-letter words. Both can be formed from the code word 6@&^ using the allowed letter substitutions. This pair fits all the conditions and the hint perfectly.\n\nLet's briefly check other directional pairs:\n3.  Left/Right: \"Right\" is 5 letters long. So this pair is not suitable. \"Left\" is 4 letters.\n    Let's check LEFT:\n    L is in L1 = {L, E, P, W, T}. (6=L)\n    E is in L2 = {E, C, O, N, A}. (@=E)\n    F is not in L3 = {E, S, B, R, G}. So LEFT cannot be formed.\n4.  Up/Down: \"Up\" is 2 letters long, \"Down\" is 4 letters long. They are not both 4-letter words.\n\nLet's check some other common 4-letter opposites to see if they fit, although the \"Directionality\" hint makes EAST/WEST the prime candidate.\n-   LOVE/HATE:\n    LOVE: L (in L1), O (in L2), V (not in L3). So LOVE cannot be formed.\n-   GOOD/EVIL:\n    EVIL: E (in L1), V (not in L2). So EVIL cannot be formed.\n-   TAKE/GIVE:\n    TAKE: T (in L1), A (in L2), K (in L4). For the third letter, we need a letter for &. If the word is T A K E, then the third letter is K and fourth is E, which does not match the word. If the word is T A X K, where X is the third letter. The word is TAKE. So T A K E. The 4th letter is E. Is E in L4 = {N, H, A, T, K}? No.\n    Let's recheck TAKE: T A K E.\n    6=T (T in L1 {L,E,P,W,T} - yes)\n    @=A (A in L2 {E,C,O,N,A} - yes)\n    &=K (K not in L3 {E,S,B,R,G} - no, K is in L4)\n    So the word structure must be 6@&^ = T A K E.\n    This means: 6=T, @=A, &=K, ^=E.\n    K is not in L3. E is in L4 if K is A, T, K, N, H. E is not in L4.\n    Let's try TAKE as T A K E.\n    T from L1.\n    A from L2.\n    K from L3. K is not in L3 {E, S, B, R, G}.\n    So TAKE cannot be formed.\n\n    My previous check for TAKE was: T A E K\n    6=T (in L1), @=A (in L2), &=E (E in L3 = {E,S,B,R,G} - Yes), ^=K (K in L4 = {N,H,A,T,K} - Yes).\n    So T A E K can be formed. Is TAEK an English word? No.\n    The word is TAKE. T A K E.\n    So 6=T, @=A, &=K, ^=E.\n    K is not in L3. E is not in L4. So TAKE cannot be formed in this way.\n\n    What if the word is TAKE, so the letters are T, A, K, E.\n    1st letter T is in L1. (6=T)\n    2nd letter A is in L2. (@=A)\n    3rd letter K is in L3? No, L3 = {E, S, B, R, G}.\n    So TAKE cannot be formed.\n\nIt seems my earlier check for TAKE was flawed. The word TAKE has letters T, A, K, E.\nFor 6@&^ to be TAKE:\n6=T (T in L1 - yes)\n@=A (A in L2 - yes)\n&=K (K must be in L3={E,S,B,R,G} - no)\nSo TAKE cannot be formed.\n\nThis reinforces that EAST and WEST is the correct solution.\nThe two words are EAST and WEST. They are opposites, four letters long, and can be formed from 6@&^ using the given letter choices. The hint \"Directionality\" strongly supports this answer.\n\nFinal confirmation of EAST and WEST:\nEAST:\n6 = E (from {L, E, P, W, T})\n@ = A (from {E, C, O, N, A})\n& = S (from {E, S, B, R, G})\n^ = T (from {N, H, A, T, K})\nAll valid.\n\nWEST:\n6 = W (from {L, E, P, W, T})\n@ = E (from {E, C, O, N, A})\n& = S (from {E, S, B, R, G})\n^ = T (from {N, H, A, T, K})\nAll valid.\n\nThe two English words are EAST and WEST.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{EAST and WEST}}$.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

If we have n objects, with n1 identical objects of type 1, n2 identical objects of type 2, ..., nk identical objects of type k, such that n1 + n2 + ... + nk = n, then the number of distinct permutations is n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!).\n\nIn this case, n = 16 (total number of pieces, and total number of squares).\nThe counts of identical pieces are:\n- n_pawns = 8\n- n_rooks = 2\n- n_knights = 2\n- n_bishops = 2\n- n_queen = 1\n- n_king = 1\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these 16 pieces on 16 squares is:\nN = 16! / (8! * 2! * 2! * 2! * 1! * 1!)\nN = 16! / (8! * 2! * 2! * 2!)\n\nLet's calculate this value:\n16! = 20,922,789,888,000\n8! = 40,320\n2! = 2\n\nSo, the denominator is 8! * 2! * 2! * 2! = 40,320 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 40,320 * 8 = 322,560.\n\nN = 20,922,789,888,000 / 322,560\n\nWe can also simplify the expression before calculating:\nN = (16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8!) / (8! * 2 * 2 * 2)\nN = (16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / 8\nN = 2 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9\nN = 30 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9\nN = 420 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9\nN = 5460 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9\nN = 65520 * 11 * 10 * 9\nN = 720720 * 10 * 9\nN = 7207200 * 9\nN = 64,864,800\n\nSo, there are 64,864,800 ways to arrange the 16 pieces of one color on the first two rows of the board.\nThe question asks \"What would have been the answer if Mad Ade wasn't so greedy and had worked it out?\".

She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.\n**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.\n**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.\n**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.\n*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

Since there are no other lions, this new sheep (formerly the lion) will not be eaten.\nThe lion prefers eating sheep to grass, and in this case, eating the sheep does not lead to being eaten.\nSo, the lion will eat the sheep.\nOutcome for N=1: The sheep gets eaten.\n\nCase N=2 (2 lions, 1 sheep):\nLet the lions be L1 and L2. L1 is closest to the sheep.\nL1 considers eating the sheep.\nIf L1 eats grass, it survives as a lion. The sheep is not eaten by L1.\nIf L1 eats the sheep, L1 turns into a sheep (let's call it S_L1). Now there is 1 lion (L2) and 1 sheep (S_L1).\nL2 is now in the situation of N=1 (1 lion, 1 sheep). From our N=1 analysis, L2 will eat S_L1.\nSo, if L1 eats the sheep, L1 will subsequently be eaten by L2.\nL1 knows this because L1 is perfectly logical and knows L2 is also perfectly logical.\nL1 would rather eat grass all its life than be eaten by another lion.\nTherefore, L1 will choose to eat grass.\nOutcome for N=2: The sheep does not get eaten.\n\nCase N=3 (3 lions, 1 sheep):\nLet the lions be L1, L2, L3. L1 is closest to the sheep.\nL1 considers eating the sheep.\nIf L1 eats grass, it survives as a lion. The sheep is not eaten by L1.\nIf L1 eats the sheep, L1 turns into a sheep (S_L1). Now there are 2 lions (L2, L3) and 1 sheep (S_L1). Let L2 be closest to S_L1.\nL2 is now in the situation of N=2 (2 lions, 1 sheep). From our N=2 analysis, L2 will not eat S_L1.\nSo, if L1 eats the sheep, L1 (as S_L1) will not be eaten by L2.\nL1 knows this. L1 prefers eating sheep to grass, and in this case, eating the sheep leads to survival as a sheep (not being eaten by other lions).\nTherefore, L1 will choose to eat the sheep.\nOutcome for N=3: The sheep gets eaten.\n\nCase N=4 (4 lions, 1 sheep):\nLet the lions be L1, L2, L3, L4. L1 is closest to the sheep.\nL1 considers eating the sheep.\nIf L1 eats grass, it survives as a lion. The sheep is not eaten by L1.\nIf L1 eats the sheep, L1 turns into a sheep (S_L1). Now there are 3 lions (L2, L3, L4) and 1 sheep (S_L1). Let L2 be closest to S_L1.\nL2 is now in the situation of N=3 (3 lions, 1 sheep). From our N=3 analysis, L2 will eat S_L1.\nSo, if L1 eats the sheep, L1 will subsequently be eaten by L2.\nL1 knows this. L1 would rather eat grass than be eaten.\nTherefore, L1 will choose to eat grass.\nOutcome for N=4: The sheep does not get eaten.\n\nLet's summarize the pattern:\nN=1: Sheep gets eaten.\nN=2: Sheep does not get eaten.\nN=3: Sheep gets eaten.\nN=4: Sheep does not get eaten.\n\nIt appears that if N is odd, the sheep gets eaten. If N is even, the sheep does not get eaten.\nLet's formalize this with an inductive argument.\nLet P(N) be the statement \"with N lions and 1 sheep, the sheep gets eaten if N is odd, and the sheep does not get eaten if N is even\".\n\nBase Case: For N=1, which is odd, the sheep gets eaten. This is true.\nInductive Hypothesis: Assume P(k) is true for some integer k >= 1. That is, if there are k lions, the sheep is eaten if k is odd, and not eaten if k is even.\n\nInductive Step: Consider the case with k+1 lions and 1 sheep. Let L1 be the lion closest to the sheep.\nL1's decision:\nIf L1 eats the sheep, L1 turns into a sheep (S_L1). There are now k lions and S_L1. The decision of whether S_L1 gets eaten falls to the remaining k lions.\nAccording to the inductive hypothesis P(k):\n- If k is odd: The sheep (S_L1) will be eaten by one of the k lions.\n- If k is even: The sheep (S_L1) will not be eaten by any of the k lions.\n\nNow, consider L1's choice based on k+1 lions:\n\nScenario 1: k+1 is odd. This means k is even.\nIf L1 eats the sheep, it turns into S_L1. There are k (even number of) lions remaining. By P(k), since k is even, S_L1 will not be eaten.\nL1 knows this. L1 prefers eating sheep (and surviving as a sheep) to eating grass. So L1 will eat the sheep.\nThus, if k+1 is odd, the sheep gets eaten. This matches P(k+1).\n\nScenario 2: k+1 is even. This means k is odd.\nIf L1 eats the sheep, it turns into S_L1. There are k (odd number of) lions remaining. By P(k), since k is odd, S_L1 will be eaten.\nL1 knows this. L1 prefers eating grass (and surviving as a lion) to being eaten. So L1 will not eat the sheep.\nThus, if k+1 is even, the sheep does not get eaten. This matches P(k+1).\n\nThe inductive step holds. Since P(1) is true, P(N) is true for all N >= 1.\n\nThe problem states there are 100 lions. So N=100.\nSince N=100 is an even number, according to our derived rule, the sheep will not get eaten.\nThe lion closest to the sheep (L1) will reason as follows:\n\"If I eat the sheep, I will turn into a sheep. There will be 99 lions left.\nThe situation will then be 99 lions and 1 sheep (me). Since 99 is an odd number, the sheep (me) will be eaten by one of the other lions.\nI would rather eat grass all my life than be eaten by another lion.\nTherefore, I will not eat the sheep; I will eat grass.\"\n\nAll lions are infinitely logical and arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nConclusion: The sheep will not get eaten.\n\nFinal Answer: The sheep will not get eaten. The reasoning is based on backward induction.\nLet's denote E(N) as the proposition that the sheep is eaten when there are N lions.\nIf N=1, the lion eats the sheep and becomes a sheep. There are no other lions to eat it. So E(1) is true.\nIf N=2, lion L1 considers eating the sheep. If it does, it becomes a sheep. Then there is 1 lion (L2) and 1 sheep (L1 transformed). According to E(1), L2 will eat L1. So L1, to avoid being eaten, will not eat the sheep. So E(2) is false.\nIf N=3, lion L1 considers eating the sheep. If it does, it becomes a sheep. Then there are 2 lions and 1 sheep (L1 transformed). According to E(2), this new sheep (L1) will NOT be eaten. So L1 will eat the original sheep. So E(3) is true.\nIn general, a lion will eat the sheep if and only if it knows it will not be eaten afterwards. It will not be eaten if, after it turns into a sheep, the remaining N-1 lions will not eat it. This means E(N-1) must be false.\nSo, E(N) is true if E(N-1) is false.\nAnd E(N) is false if E(N-1) is true.\nThis means E(N) = not E(N-1).\nSince E(1) is true:\nE(1) = true (1 is odd)\nE(2) = false (2 is even)\nE(3) = true (3 is odd)\nE(4) = false (4 is even)\n...\nGenerally, E(N) is true if N is odd, and E(N) is false if N is even.\nThere are 100 lions. Since 100 is an even number, E(100) is false.\nTherefore, the sheep will not get eaten. The first lion will choose to eat grass.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{The\\ sheep\\ will\\ not\\ get\\ eaten}$", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

So, the three \"culprits\" are three young goats.\n\n2.  **Identify the Basic Punishment:** The poem clearly states the fate of these \"kids\" (goats):\n    *   \"No more to trouble us, for no more shall they breathe!\" \u2013 This means they are killed.\n    *   \"As we eat, our justice is served.\" \u2013 This means they are eaten by Old Man Justice and his group at the \"Repast of Right\" dinner.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Principle of Justice: \"One for two\"**: The poem provides a specific principle for their justice:\n    *   \"As we've judged these few, let's render to each their due,\" \u2013 This indicates the principle applies to each of the three goats individually.\n    *   \"Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'\" \u2013 This is the core of their brand of justice, distinguishing it from simple reciprocal justice. The \"one\" refers to each individual goat. The \"two\" refers to what is rendered to, or done to, that goat.\n\n4.  **Connecting \"One for Two\" to the Punishment:** Since the goats are killed and eaten, the \"one for two\" principle must describe this process or its justification.\n    *   The \"one\" is each goat.\n    *   The \"two\" refers to the dual nature of the punishment meted out to each goat:\n        1.  **Death:** Their lives are taken (\"no more shall they breathe\").\n        2.  **Consumption:** Their bodies are eaten by their \"judges\" (\"As we eat, our justice is served\").\n\n    This interpretation means that for each \"one\" goat, it receives a \"two-fold\" due: it is not just killed, but its body is also consumed, representing a complete and total form of \"justice\" from the perspective of Old Man Justice and his group. This is harsher than a simple \"eye for an eye,\" which might have involved mere restitution for stolen goods or a less \"total\" punishment. The eating itself is framed as the serving of justice.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Answer:** The three guilty \"kids\" (young goats) are punished by being killed and then cooked and eaten by Old Man Justice and his group during their \"Repast of Right.\" The specific principle of this justice, as stated in the poem, is \"one for two,\" meaning that for each \"one\" goat, a \"two-fold\" retribution is exacted: its death and its consumption.\n\nTherefore, the punishment is: The three young goats are killed and eaten by Old Man Justice and his group. The justification or nature of this punishment is that for each goat (\"one\"), they enact a two-part justice (\"two\"): taking its life and consuming its body.\n\nFinal answer: The three \"kids,\" which are young goats, are punished by being killed and then eaten by Old Man Justice and his group at the dinner. The principle of \"one for two\" signifies that for each \"one\" goat, a two-fold justice is rendered: 1) its life is taken, and 2) its body is consumed as food by the group.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

Biggie's wife, Faerie, was pregnant at the time with what would be the first child for either of them.  Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.\nIn due time, Biggie died, and the authorities read his will, holding dispensation of the estate until the child was born.  Five months after Biggie's death, Faerie delivered ... normal, healthy twins, a boy (whom she named Manny) and a girl (whom she named Goodie).\nThe estate's executor immediately appealed to the Shapeless magistrate to rule on the proper division for the estate.

The will specified the division for two separate scenarios: (1) if the child were a boy, and (2) if the child were a girl.\n\nLet E be the total value of the estate.\nLet S be the share of the son (Manny).\nLet D be the share of the daughter (Goodie).\nLet W be the share of the widow (Faerie).\n\nFrom Biggie's will:\n1.  If the child were a boy: The son gets 2/3 of the estate, and the widow gets 1/3.\n    This means S = (2/3)E and W = (1/3)E.\n    This establishes a ratio between the son's share and the widow's share: S/W = (2/3)E / (1/3)E = 2/1. So, S = 2W.\n\n2.  If the child were a girl: The widow gets 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter gets 1/3.\n    This means W = (2/3)E and D = (1/3)E.\n    This establishes a ratio between the widow's share and the daughter's share: W/D = (2/3)E / (1/3)E = 2/1. So, W = 2D.\n\nFaerie delivered twins: one boy (Manny) and one girl (Goodie). The will does not explicitly cover this scenario. The judge needs to make a \"fair decision\". A common approach to resolving such ambiguities in wills, often rooted in historical legal principles (the problem mentions \"common inheritance law of his father's native country\"), is to uphold the relative proportions specified in the will as far as possible.\n\nWe have two conditions on the relative shares:\na) The son should receive twice as much as the widow: S = 2W.\nb) The widow should receive twice as much as the daughter: W = 2D.\n\nWe can use these two relationships to determine the relative shares of all three beneficiaries: Manny (S), Faerie (W), and Goodie (D).\nFrom (b), W = 2D.\nSubstitute this into (a): S = 2W = 2(2D) = 4D.\nSo, the shares are related as follows: S = 4D and W = 2D.\nWe can express the ratio of their shares as S : W : D.\nSubstituting D as the common unit: 4D : 2D : D.\nDividing by D (assuming D is not zero, which means the daughter gets some share), the ratio is 4 : 2 : 1.\n\nThis means that for every $4 the son receives, the widow receives $2, and the daughter receives $1.\nThe sum of these ratio parts is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\nSo, the estate E should be divided into 7 equal parts.\n\nThe distribution of the estate is as follows:\n*   The son (Manny) receives 4 parts out of 7: S = (4/7)E.\n*   The widow (Faerie) receives 2 parts out of 7: W = (2/7)E.\n*   The daughter (Goodie) receives 1 part out of 7: D = (1/7)E.\n\nLet's check if this distribution satisfies the conditions:\n*   Sum of shares: S + W + D = (4/7)E + (2/7)E + (1/7)E = (4+2+1)/7 * E = 7/7 * E = E. The entire estate is distributed.\n*   Ratio S/W: (4/7)E / (2/7)E = 4/2 = 2. This matches the condition S = 2W from the will's first scenario.\n*   Ratio W/D: (2/7)E / (1/7)E = 2/1 = 2. This matches the condition W = 2D from the will's second scenario.\n\nThis division method maintains the testator's intended relativities between the beneficiaries named in each specific contingency. The hint also states that \"The fraction is in sevenths,\" which our solution provides.\n\nTherefore, the fair division of Biggie's estate is:\n*   Manny (the son) gets 4/7 of the estate.\n*   Faerie (the widow) gets 2/7 of the estate.\n*   Goodie (the daughter) gets 1/7 of the estate.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Son gets 4/7, Widow gets 2/7, Daughter gets 1/7}$\nThe question asks \"How did they divide Biggie's estate?\".

We know T_i = B_i + R_i.\nThe total number of ribbons won is 28. So, T_PP + T_RR + T_SS + T_MTT + T_VV + T_YY = 28.\n\n1.  From Clue 2, \"Pretty in Pink\" won one-quarter of the total amount.\n    T_PP = (1/4) * 28 = 7 ribbons.\n2.  From Clue 2, T_PP was the same amount as \"Ravishing Red\", \"Yummy Yellow\" and \"Simply Silver\" won together.\n    So, T_RR + T_YY + T_SS = T_PP = 7.\n3.  Substitute these into the total sum:\n    T_PP + (T_RR + T_YY + T_SS) + T_MTT + T_VV = 28\n    7 + 7 + T_MTT + T_VV = 28\n    14 + T_MTT + T_VV = 28\n    T_MTT + T_VV = 14.\n4.  From Clue 3, \"Very Violet\" won the same number of ribbons as both \"Mrs.Thelma Thorne\" and \"Simply Silver\" together.\n    T_VV = T_MTT + T_SS.\n5.  Substitute T_VV from step 4 into the equation from step 3:\n    T_MTT + (T_MTT + T_SS) = 14\n    2 * T_MTT + T_SS = 14.\n6.  From Clue 4, three-quarters of \"Ravishing Red's\" ribbons were red.\n    R_RR = (3/4) * T_RR. This implies T_RR must be a multiple of 4.\n    Since T_RR + T_YY + T_SS = 7, and each rose must have won at least one ribbon (implied by the context, and confirmed necessary by Clue 1 later), T_RR must be less than 7.\n    The only multiple of 4 less than 7 is 4. So, T_RR = 4.\n    Then R_RR = (3/4) * 4 = 3.\n    And B_RR = T_RR - R_RR = 4 - 3 = 1.\n7.  Now that T_RR = 4, substitute this into T_RR + T_YY + T_SS = 7:\n    4 + T_YY + T_SS = 7\n    T_YY + T_SS = 3.\n8.  From Clue 5, \"Yummy Yellow\" won just one blue ribbon. So B_YY = 1.\n    From the Hint, \"Yummy yellow didn't win any red ribbons\". So R_YY = 0.\n    Therefore, T_YY = B_YY + R_YY = 1 + 0 = 1.\n9.  Substitute T_YY = 1 into T_YY + T_SS = 3:\n    1 + T_SS = 3\n    T_SS = 2.\n10. Now substitute T_SS = 2 into the equation from step 5 (2 * T_MTT + T_SS = 14):\n    2 * T_MTT + 2 = 14\n    2 * T_MTT = 12\n    T_MTT = 6.\n11. From Clue 5, one-third of \"Mrs. Thelma Thorne's\" ribbons were blue.\n    B_MTT = (1/3) * T_MTT = (1/3) * 6 = 2.\n    So, R_MTT = T_MTT - B_MTT = 6 - 2 = 4.\n12. Now find T_VV using the equation from step 4 (T_VV = T_MTT + T_SS):\n    T_VV = 6 + 2 = 8.\n13. At this point, we have the total number of ribbons for each rose:\n    T_PP = 7\n    T_RR = 4\n    T_SS = 2\n    T_MTT = 6\n    T_VV = 8\n    T_YY = 1\n    Let's check Clue 1: \"No two roses won the same total number of ribbons.\" The totals are 7, 4, 2, 6, 8, 1. These are all distinct, so Clue 1 is satisfied.\n\n14. Now we determine the blue and red ribbons for the remaining roses.\n    For Simply Silver (SS): From Clue 6, \"Simply Silver\" won an equal number of blue and red ribbons.\n    B_SS = R_SS. Since T_SS = 2, and T_SS = B_SS + R_SS, we have B_SS + B_SS = 2, so 2 * B_SS = 2, which means B_SS = 1.\n    Therefore, R_SS = 1.\n15. For Very Violet (VV): From Clue 8, \"Very Violet\" won as many red ribbons as were won by \"Mrs. Thelma Thorne\" and \"Ravishing Red\" together.\n    R_VV = R_MTT + R_RR = 4 + 3 = 7.\n    Since T_VV = 8, B_VV = T_VV - R_VV = 8 - 7 = 1.\n16. For Pretty in Pink (PP): From Clue 7, \"Very Violet\" won the same number of blue ribbons as \"Pretty in Pink\".\n    B_PP = B_VV = 1.\n    Since T_PP = 7, R_PP = T_PP - B_PP = 7 - 1 = 6.\n\nLet's summarize the blue and red ribbons for each rose:\n*   Pretty in Pink (PP): B_PP = 1, R_PP = 6. (Total T_PP = 7)\n*   Ravishing Red (RR): B_RR = 1, R_RR = 3. (Total T_RR = 4)\n*   Simply Silver (SS): B_SS = 1, R_SS = 1. (Total T_SS = 2)\n*   Mrs. Thelma Thorne (MTT): B_MTT = 2, R_MTT = 4. (Total T_MTT = 6)\n*   Very Violet (VV): B_VV = 1, R_VV = 7. (Total T_VV = 8)\n*   Yummy Yellow (YY): B_YY = 1, R_YY = 0. (Total T_YY = 1)\n\nLet's verify all clues with this distribution.\n1.  Total ribbons: 7, 4, 2, 6, 8, 1. All distinct. (Clue 1 OK)\n2.  T_PP = 7. (28/4 = 7). T_RR + T_YY + T_SS = 4 + 1 + 2 = 7. (Clue 2 OK)\n3.  T_VV = T_MTT + T_SS => 8 = 6 + 2. (Clue 3 OK)\n4.

He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.\nHe is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!\nYou grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.\nThe combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.

This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.\nSo you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.\n81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.\n25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.

Every other number is in the combination.\"\nThis means the allowed digits are {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}. Let D be this set of allowed digits.\nThe second part, \"Every other number is in the combination,\" means that each digit in D must appear at least once in the 8 digits that form the combination. Since there are 7 distinct allowed digits and 8 digits in total for the combination ($S_1S_2S_3S_4$), exactly one digit from D must be repeated.\n\nHint: \"The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.\" So $S_1 \\le 60$.\nClue 6: \"The first set of two digits is a square number.\"\n$S_1$ must be a two-digit square number, so $S_1 \\in \\{16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, ...\\}$.\nGiven $S_1 \\le 60$, possible values for $S_1$ are {16, 25, 36, 49}.\nNow check these values against Clue 5 (digits must be in D):\n- $S_1 = 16$: Digits are 1 and 6. Digit 6 is not in D. So $S_1 \\ne 16$.\n- $S_1 = 25$: Digits are 2 and 5. Both are in D. This is a possibility.\n- $S_1 = 36$: Digits are 3 and 6. Neither are in D. So $S_1 \\ne 36$.\n- $S_1 = 49$: Digits are 4 and 9. Both are in D. This is a possibility.\nSo $S_1$ is either 25 or 49.\n\nClue 3: \"If you multiply the second set of numbers by 2 and add 7, then you will get the first set of numbers.\" So $S_1 = 2S_2 + 7$.\nSince $S_2$ is a two-digit number, its digits must be from D.

This is not a two-digit number. If we were to write it as 09, the digit 0 is not allowed.\nTherefore, $S_1$ must be 49.\nUsing $S_1=49$ in $S_1 = 2S_2+7$:\n$49 = 2S_2 + 7$\n$2S_2 = 42$\n$S_2 = 21$.\nThe digits of $S_2=21$ are 2 and 1.

Possible $S_3$: 49, 94, 58, 85. (No 6,7 as 6 is not allowed)\n\nClue 2: \"The third set of numbers is 13 smaller than the fourth set.\" So $S_4 = S_3 + 13$.\nSince $S_4$ is a two-digit number, $S_4 \\le 99$. Therefore, $S_3 \\le 99-13 = 86$.\nThis eliminates $S_3=92$ (since $92+13=105$) and $S_3=94$ (since $94+13=107$).\nThe refined list of possible $S_3$ values: 29, 47, 74, 48, 84, 57, 75, 49, 58, 85.\nFor each of these, we find $S_4=S_3+13$ and check if digits of $S_4$ are in D.\n1. $S_3=29 \\Rightarrow S_4=42$.

{"ID": 182, "Question": "Question: You've been placed on a course of expensive medication in which you are to take one tablet of Sildenafil and one tablet of Citrate daily. You must be careful that you take just one of each because taking more of either can have serious side effects.\nTaking Sildenafil without taking Citrate, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the Sildenafil pills and one of the Citrate pills at one time. Therefore, you open up the Sildenafil bottle, and you tap one Sildenafil pill into your hand. You put that bottle aside and you open the Citrate bottle. You do the same, but by mistake, two Citrates fall into your hand with the Sildenafil pill.\nNow, here's the problem. You weren't watching your hand as the pills fell into it, so you can't tell the Sildenafil pill apart from the two Citrate pills. The pills look identical. They are both the same size, same weight (10 micrograms), same color (Blue), same shape (perfect square), same everything, and they are not marked differently in any way.\nWhat are you going to do?

We are looking for two 5-letter prepositions that are opposites.\n\nLet's list some common prepositions and check their lengths and opposites:\n- IN (2 letters) / OUT (3 letters) - not 5 letters.\n- ON (2 letters) / OFF (3 letters) - not 5 letters.\n- UP (2 letters) / DOWN (4 letters) - not 5 letters.\n- OVER (4 letters) / UNDER (5 letters) - UNDER is 5 letters, but OVER is 4 letters.

On a day in January, the two friends set both clocks correctly at 12:00 noon. \"Do you realize,\" asked Joe, \"that the next time both of our clocks will show exactly the same time will be on your 47th birthday?\" Smoe agreed.

{"ID": 193, "Question": "Question: It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.\nYou quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...\n Hint: If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.

No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.\nWhat else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!

The letter above the one which is between them is G.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": "Okay, let's break this down step by step, as per the hint.\n\n**Step 1: Construct the 5x5 letter square.**\nThe alphabet to be used is A-Z, excluding Q. This gives us 25 letters:\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\nThe square is 5x5. 'A' is in the upper left-hand corner, and 'Z' is in the lower right-hand corner. This implies the letters are filled in reading order (left to right, then top to bottom).\n\nThe grid will look like this:\nRow 1: A B C D E\nRow 2: F G H I J\nRow 3: K L M N O\nRow 4: P R S T U\nRow 5: V W X Y Z\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the question to find the \"Target Letter\".**\nThe question asks for \"which letter comes just above the letter X\", where X is a letter determined by a complex set of instructions. Let's call this intermediate, complexly-defined letter the \"Target Letter\".\n\nThe Target Letter is defined as: \"the letter which comes between (Letter A) and (Letter B)\"\nwhere:\n*   Letter A = \"the letter just before the letter just below B\" (here, \"B\" refers to the letter B from the alphabet).\n*   Letter B = \"the letter just before the letter just above Y\" (here, \"Y\" refers to the letter Y from the alphabet).\n\nLet's find Letter A first.\n**Step 2a: Find \"the letter just below B\" (alphabetical B).**\n1.  Locate the letter 'B' in the grid. It is in Row 1, Column 2.\n2.  \"The letter just below B\" is the letter in the grid cell directly under B. This is Row 2, Column 2.\n3.  The letter at Row 2, Column 2 is G.\n\n**Step 2b: Find \"the letter just before\" the result from Step 2a (which is G).**\n1.  We need \"the letter just before G\". This phrasing typically means alphabetically \"before\".\n2.  The letter alphabetically before G is F.\n3.  So, Letter A = F.\n\nNow let's find Letter B.\n**Step 2c: Find \"the letter just above Y\" (alphabetical Y).**\n1.  Locate the letter 'Y' (alphabetical Y) in the grid. It is in Row 5, Column 4.\n2.  \"The letter just above Y\" is the letter in the grid cell directly above Y. This is Row 4, Column 4.\n3.  The letter at Row 4, Column 4 is T.\n\n**Step 2d: Find \"the letter just before\" the result from Step 2c (which is T).**\n1.  We need \"the letter just before T\". Again, this means alphabetically \"before\".\n2.  The letter alphabetically before T is S.\n3.  So, Letter B = S.\n\n**Step 2e: Find \"the letter which comes between (Letter A) and (Letter B)\" (which are F and S).**\n1.  We need to find \"the letter which comes between F and S\". This implies a single, middle letter in the alphabetical sequence from F to S, using our 25-letter alphabet (Q excluded).\n2.  The sequence of letters from F to S is: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S.\n3.  To find the middle letter, we can assign ordinal values to the letters in our 25-letter alphabet:\n    A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, F=6, G=7, H=8, I=9, J=10, K=11, L=12, M=13, N=14, O=15, P=16, R=17, S=18, T=19, ...\n    The ordinal value of F is 6.\n    The ordinal value of S is 18.\n4.  The ordinal value of the letter exactly between F and S is the average of their ordinal values: (6 + 18) / 2 = 24 / 2 = 12.\n5.  The 12th letter in our 25-letter alphabet is L.\n    (F (6th), G (7th), H (8th), I (9th), J (10th), K (11th), L (12th)).\n6.  So, the \"Target Letter\" is L.\n\n**Step 3: Find the letter that \"comes just above\" the Target Letter (L).**\n1.  The Target Letter is L.\n2.  Locate L in the grid. L is in Row 3, Column 2.\n3.  \"The letter just above L\" means the letter in the grid cell directly above L's position.\n4.  The cell above Row 3, Column 2 is Row 2, Column 2.\n5.  The letter in Row 2, Column 2 is G.\n\nTherefore, the letter that comes just above the letter which comes between the letter just before the letter just below B and the letter just before the letter just above Y is G.\n\nLet's recap the derived letters:\n*   Letter just below B (R1C2) is G (R2C2).\n*   Letter just before G (alphabetically) is F. (This is \"Letter A\" from Step 2)\n*   Letter just above Y (R5C4) is T (R4C4).\n*   Letter just before T (alphabetically) is S. (This is \"Letter B\" from Step 2)\n*   Letter between F and S (alphabetically) is L. (This is the \"Target Letter\")\n*   Letter just above L (R3C2) in the grid is G (R2C2).\n\nThe final answer is G.\n\nFinal Answer: G", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

By simple analysis, you must take 101 eggs over two rounds in order to get down to 101.\n19*101 = 1919, so we must take 2008-1919 = 89 eggs to start off with a multiple of 101.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": "This is a game theory problem, often referred to as a variation of Nim. The goal is to take the last egg. Players can take between 1 and 100 eggs. You go first.\n\nLet N = 2008 be the total number of eggs.\nLet min_take = 1 and max_take = 100 be the minimum and maximum number of eggs a player can take in a turn.\n\nThe key to solving such games is to identify winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position (P-position) if every move from it leads to a winning position (N-position) for the opponent. A position is a winning position (N-position) if there is at least one move to a losing position for the opponent. The player who takes the last egg wins, so having 0 eggs remaining when it's the opponent's turn is a winning state for you. Conversely, if there are 0 eggs and it's your turn, you have already won (or lost if you cannot make a move, but here the goal is to take the last egg).\n\nThe hint states: \"By a perfect game, that means over any two turns, the sum of the number of eggs you and I take is the same (except of course, excluding the initial move you make).\"\nLet's say after your initial move, I take y_i eggs and then you take x_i eggs. The hint implies that y_i + x_i = C for some constant C.\nIf I take y_i eggs (where 1 <= y_i <= 100), you want to choose x_i (where 1 <= x_i <= 100) such that y_i + x_i = C.\nTo ensure you can always make such a move, C must be chosen carefully. If I take y_i eggs, you will take C - y_i eggs. You must ensure that 1 <= C - y_i <= 100 for all possible y_i (1 <= y_i <= 100).\nIf y_i = 1, then C - 1 <= 100, so C <= 101.\nIf y_i = 100, then C - 100 >= 1, so C >= 101.\nThus, C must be 101.\nSo, in a perfect game (after your initial move), if I take y_i eggs, you will take x_i = 101 - y_i eggs. This means that in one round (my turn + your turn), a total of 101 eggs are removed.\n\nYour strategy is to ensure that after your move, the number of eggs remaining is a multiple of 101.\nLet N_k be the number of eggs remaining after your k-th move. You want N_k to be a multiple of 101.\nYou make the first move. Let x_0 be the number of eggs you take initially.\nThe number of eggs remaining will be N - x_0. You want N - x_0 to be a multiple of 101.\nSo, (N - x_0) mod 101 = 0.\nThis is equivalent to N mod 101 = x_0 mod 101.\nWe need to calculate N mod 101.\nN = 2008.\n2008 / 101 = 19 with a remainder.\n101 * 19 = 1919.\n2008 - 1919 = 89.\nSo, 2008 mod 101 = 89.\nWe need x_0 mod 101 = 89.\nSince you can take between 1 and 100 eggs (1 <= x_0 <= 100), the only possible value for x_0 is 89.\nThis is a valid move.\n\nLet's check the strategy:\n1.  You take x_0 = 89 eggs.\n    Number of eggs remaining: 2008 - 89 = 1919.\n    1919 = 19 * 101. So the remaining number of eggs is a multiple of 101.\n2.  Now it's my turn. I take y_1 eggs, where 1 <= y_1 <= 100.\n    Number of eggs remaining: 1919 - y_1.\n3.  Now it's your turn. You take x_1 eggs. You want to restore the property that the number of eggs is a multiple of 101.\n    So, (1919 - y_1) - x_1 must be a multiple of 101.\n    This means 19 * 101 - y_1 - x_1 must be a multiple of 101.\n    This implies y_1 + x_1 must be a multiple of 101.\n    Since 1 <= y_1 <= 100 and you must take 1 <= x_1 <= 100, the sum 2 <= y_1 + x_1 <= 200.\n    The only multiple of 101 in this range is 101.\n    So you must choose x_1 such that y_1 + x_1 = 101.\n    Therefore, you take x_1 = 101 - y_1 eggs.\n    Since 1 <= y_1 <= 100, it follows that 1 <= 101 - y_1 <= 100. So x_1 is a valid move.\n    After your move, the number of eggs remaining is 1919 - (y_1 + x_1) = 1919 - 101 = 1818 = 18 * 101.\n    This is again a multiple of 101.\n\nThis process continues. Each round consisting of my move and your move reduces the number of eggs by 101.\nEventually, after one of your moves, the number of eggs remaining will be 1 * 101 = 101.\n1.  It's my turn. I take y_k eggs, where 1 <= y_k <= 100.\n    Number of eggs remaining: 101 - y_k.\n    Since 1 <= y_k <= 100, the number of remaining eggs is between 1 (if y_k = 100) and 100 (if y_k = 1).\n2.  It's your turn. You take x_k eggs. You choose x_k = 101 - y_k.\n    So you take exactly the remaining 101 - y_k eggs. Since 1 <= 101 - y_k <= 100, this is a valid move.\n    You take all the remaining eggs and win.\n\nThis strategy guarantees a win for you if N is not a multiple of (max_take + 1). If N is a multiple of (max_take + 1), the first player loses if the second player follows this strategy.\nIn this case, max_take + 1 = 100 + 1 = 101.\nN = 2008. 2008 mod 101 = 89.\nSince 89 != 0, the first player (you) can win.\nThe number of eggs you must take initially is N mod 101 = 89.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{89}}$.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

Parse the Clues and Extract Information:**\n\n*   **Clue 1:** The set of errors is {0, 1, 1, 2, 3} or {0, 1, 2, 2, 3}.\n*   **Clue 2:** For every player, RBIs \u2260 Errors.\n*   **Clue 3:** Left Fielder (LF) has 1 RBI. So, LF_RBIs = 1. From Clue 2, LF_Errors \u2260 1.\n*   **Clue 4:** Jimmy Blake (JB) has 2 RBIs. So, JB_RBIs = 2. From Clue 2, JB_Errors \u2260 2.\n*   **Clue 5:** Flynn has 1 error. So, Flynn_Errors = 1. From Clue 2, Flynn_RBIs \u2260 1.\n*   **Clue 6:** Tim's RBIs = 2 or 3. Tim's Errors = Pitcher's Errors + 1. Tim made an error, so Tim_Errors \u2265 1. From Clue 2, Tim_RBIs \u2260 Tim_Errors.\n*   **Clue 7:** There's a player (let's call him Px) with 0 RBIs and 2 Errors. Px_RBIs = 0, Px_Errors = 2. Px is not 3rd base. (This means 2 is one of the error values).\n*   **Clue 8:** There's a player (let's call him Py) with 3 RBIs. Py_RBIs = 3. Py_Errors \u2265 1. Py_Errors < Shortstop's Errors. From Clue 2, Py_Errors \u2260 3. So Py_Errors can be 1 or 2.\n*   **Clue 9:** K.C.'s Errors = Catcher's Errors - 2. This implies Catcher's Errors \u2265 2. The catcher made an error, so Catcher_Errors \u2265 1, which is consistent.\n\n**3. Combine Information and Deduce:**\n\n*   **Identify Tim and his RBIs:**\n    *   JB_RBIs = 2 (Clue 4).\n    *   Tim_RBIs = 2 or 3 (Clue 6). Since RBIs are unique, Tim_RBIs must be 3.\n    *   So Tim is the player Py from Clue 8 (player with 3 RBIs).\n    *   Therefore, Tim_RBIs = 3. Tim_Errors \u2265 1. Tim_Errors < Shortstop's Errors. Tim_Errors \u2260 3. So Tim_Errors is 1 or 2.\n    *   Also, Tim_Errors = Pitcher's Errors + 1 (Clue 6).\n        *   If Tim_Errors = 1, then Pitcher's Errors = 0.\n        *   If Tim_Errors = 2, then Pitcher's Errors = 1.\n\n*   **Assign RBIs to Players:**\n    *   Tim_RBIs = 3.\n    *   JB_RBIs = 2.\n    *   Px_RBIs = 0 (Clue 7).\n    *   LF_RBIs = 1 (Clue 3).\n    *   The remaining RBI value is 4. Flynn_RBIs \u2260 1 (Clue 5). Flynn cannot be Px (RBIs=0, Errors=2, but Flynn_Errors=1). Flynn cannot be LF (RBIs=1, but Flynn_RBIs!=1). So Flynn must have 4 RBIs.\n    *   Flynn_RBIs = 4. (Flynn_Errors = 1, so 4 \u2260 1, consistent with Clue 2).\n\n*   **Identify Px and LF:**\n    *   The players are Tim, Hank, K.C., Flynn, Jimmy Blake.\n    *   RBIs assigned: Tim (3), JB (2), Flynn (4).\n    *   Remaining players for RBIs 0 and 1 are Hank and K.C.\n    *   Px (RBIs=0, Errors=2) is either Hank or K.C.\n    *   LF (RBIs=1) is either Hank or K.C.\n    *   Let's check K.C. with Clue 9: K.C._Errors = Catcher's Errors - 2.\n        *   If K.C. is Px, then K.C._RBIs = 0, K.C._Errors = 2. Then 2 = Catcher's Errors - 2, so Catcher's Errors = 4. This is not possible as errors are from {0, 1, ?, 2, 3}.\n        *   So K.C. is not Px. Therefore, K.C. is the Left Fielder.\n        *   K.C._RBIs = 1, K.C. is Left Fielder.\n        *   This means Hank is Px. Hank_RBIs = 0, Hank_Errors = 2. Hank is not 3rd base (Clue 7).\n\n*   **Determine K.C.'s Errors and Catcher's Errors:**\n    *   K.C. is Left Fielder, so K.C._Errors \u2260 1 (Clue 3).\n    *   K.C._Errors = Catcher's Errors - 2 (Clue 9). Catcher's Errors \u2265 2.\n        *   If Catcher's Errors = 2, K.C._Errors = 0. (0 \u2260 1, so this is possible).\n        *   If Catcher's Errors = 3, K.C._Errors = 1. (This contradicts K.C._Errors \u2260 1).\n    *   So, Catcher's Errors = 2, and", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

Adam was born in 1309 of the Muslim calendar, Ben 1310 in the Christian calendar and Cyril 1311 in the Jewish calendar. Cyril was born over 3000 years before Ben, who in turn was born 619 years before Adam.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": "The problem states that Adam, Ben, and Cyril were born in 1309, 1310, and 1311, lived their whole lives on the same road in old Jerusalem, lived over 60 years, had full active lives, but never crossed paths. The hint is \"Calendar differences?\"\n\nThis hint is crucial. It suggests that the years 1309, 1310, and 1311 might not all refer to the same calendar system (e.g., Anno Domini - AD). Jerusalem is a city of immense historical and religious significance for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and each of these religions has its own calendar system.\n\nLet's consider three prominent calendar systems that would have been relevant in Jerusalem's history:\n\n1.  **The Hebrew Calendar (Anno Mundi - AM):** This calendar counts years from the traditional date of the creation of the world. The year 1 AM is equivalent to 3761/3760 BCE (Before Common Era).\n    If one of them, say Adam, was born in **1309 AM**:\n    This would be 1309 years after creation according to this calendar.\n    To convert to BCE/CE: Roughly, Year AM - 3760 = Year BCE/CE.\n    So, 1309 AM would be approximately 3761 BCE - 1309 = **2452 BCE**.\n    If Adam lived for over 60 years, his life would span roughly from 2452 BCE to (2452 - 60) = 2392 BCE (or earlier).\n\n2.  **The Julian/Gregorian Calendar (Anno Domini - AD or Common Era - CE):** This calendar counts years from the traditional birth year of Jesus Christ. The problem mentions \"old Jerusalem\" and the years sound medieval if interpreted as AD.\n    If one of them, say Ben, was born in **1310 AD**:\n    His life would span roughly from 1310 AD to (1310 + 60) = **1370 AD** (or later).\n    (Note: In 1310, the Julian calendar was in use. The Gregorian calendar reform was in 1582).\n\n3.  **The Islamic Calendar (Anno Hegirae - AH):** This calendar counts years from the Hijra (Prophet Muhammad's emigration from Mecca to Medina), which corresponds to 622 AD. The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, with years being about 11 days shorter than solar years.\n    If one of them, say Cyril, was born in **1311 AH**:\n    To convert AH to AD approximately: AD \u2248 AH \u00d7 (354.37/365.25) + 622, or more simply for rough estimation, AD \u2248 (AH \u00d7 32 / 33) + 622.\n    Or, using an online converter: 1 Muharram 1311 AH (the start of the year) corresponds to July 21, 1893 AD.\n    So, Cyril would have been born around **1893 AD**.\n    If Cyril lived for over 60 years, his life would span roughly from 1893 AD to (1893 + 60) = **1953 AD** (or later).\n\nNow let's look at the lifespans:\n*   Adam (hypothetically): Born 1309 AM (c. 2452 BCE). Lived c. 2452 BCE \u2013 2392 BCE (or earlier, if lived longer than 60).\n*   Ben (hypothetically): Born 1310 AD. Lived c. 1310 AD \u2013 1370 AD (or later).\n*   Cyril (hypothetically): Born 1311 AH (c. 1893 AD). Lived c. 1893 AD \u2013 1953 AD (or later).\n\nComparing these lifespans:\n*   Adam's life (ending around 2392 BCE) is separated from Ben's life (starting 1310 AD) by over 3700 years.\n*   Ben's life (ending around 1370 AD) is separated from Cyril's life (starting around 1893 AD) by over 500 years.\n\nSince their lifespans are in completely different millennia or centuries due to being recorded in different calendar systems, they would never have had the opportunity to cross paths, even if they lived on the same road in Jerusalem (which itself has existed through all these periods).\n\nThe names Adam (ancient, biblical), Ben (Hebrew), and Cyril (Christian) could also be loosely suggestive of different traditions, but the core is the calendar epochs. The order of assignment of names to the calendar years (1309, 1310, 1311) and systems (AM, AD, AH) can be varied, but the result will be the same: three widely separated lifespans.\n\nTherefore, they never crossed paths because their births, though recorded with numerically similar year numbers (1309, 1310, 1311), occurred in vastly different historical eras due to the use of different calendar systems (e.g., Anno Mundi, Anno Domini, Anno Hegirae).\n\nFinal answer: They never crossed paths because their birth years 1309, 1310, and 1311 refer to three different calendar systems with widely separated epochs. For example, one might have been born in 1309 AM (Anno Mundi, Hebrew calendar, e.g., c. 2452 BCE), another in 1310 AD (Anno Domini, Christian calendar, i.e., 1310 CE), and the third in 1311 AH (Anno Hegirae, Islamic calendar, e.g., c. 1893 CE). These different dating systems place their 60+ year lifespans centuries or millennia apart, making it impossible for them to meet.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

Let X be the person who broke the window.\nLet's denote the truthfulness of each person's statement as $v(Person)$. $v(Person)=1$ if the statement is true, and $v(Person)=0$ if it is false.\n\nThe statements are:\n1.  John (J): \"It was Pete or Tom.\" ($X=P \\lor X=T$)\n2.  Pete (P): \"It was neither George nor me.\" ($X \\neq G \\land X \\neq P$)\n3.  Tom (T): \"Both of you (John and Pete) are lying.\" ($\\neg v(J) \\land \\neg v(P)$)\n4.

George (G): \"No, Steve, you are wrong.\" ($\\neg v(S)$)\n\nThe mother's statement tells us that exactly three sons are telling the truth and two are lying. So, $v(J) + v(P) + v(T) + v(S) + v(G) = 3$.\n\nLet's analyze the statements of Steve and George.\nGeorge's statement is \"No, Steve, you are wrong\", which means $v(G) = \\neg v(S)$.\nThis implies that one of Steve and George is telling the truth, and the other is lying. So, $v(S) + v(G) = 1$.\n\nSubstitute this into the mother's condition:\n$v(J) + v(P) + v(T) + (v(S) + v(G)) = 3$\n$v(J) + v(P) + v(T) + 1 = 3$\n$v(J) + v(P) + v(T) = 2$.\nThis means exactly two of John, Pete, and Tom are telling the truth, and one is lying.\n\nNow let's analyze Tom's statement: $v(T) = (\\neg v(J) \\land \\neg v(P))$.\nThis means Tom is telling the truth if and only if both John and Pete are lying.\nLet's assume Tom is telling the truth, so $v(T)=1$.\nThen $v(J)=0$ and $v(P)=0$.\nIn this case, $v(J) + v(P) + v(T) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1$.\nThis contradicts our finding that $v(J) + v(P) + v(T) = 2$.\nTherefore, our assumption that Tom is telling the truth must be false. So, Tom is lying, which means $v(T)=0$.\n\nSince Tom is lying ($v(T)=0$) and $v(J) + v(P) + v(T) = 2$:\n$v(J) + v(P) + 0 = 2$.\nThis implies that $v(J)=1$ and $v(P)=1$. So, John is telling the truth and Pete is telling the truth.\n\nNow we know the truthfulness of John, Pete, and Tom:\nJohn is telling the truth ($v(J)=1$).\nPete is telling the truth ($v(P)=1$).\nTom is lying ($v(T)=0$). This is consistent as Tom's statement is \"Both John and Pete are lying\", which is $(\\neg v(J) \\land \\neg v(P)) = (\\neg 1 \\land \\neg 1) = (0 \\land 0) = 0$.\n\nNow let's determine the truthfulness of Steve and George.\nSteve's statement: \"No, only one of them (John and Pete) is lying.\" This means $v(J) \\neq v(P)$.\nSince $v(J)=1$ and $v(P)=1$, they are not different ($1=1$). So John and Pete are both telling the truth, meaning zero of them are lying.\nThus, Steve's statement \"only one of them is lying\" is false. So Steve is lying ($v(S)=0$).\n\nGeorge's statement: \"No, Steve, you are wrong.\" This means $v(G) = \\neg v(S)$.\nSince Steve is lying ($v(S)=0$), George's statement that Steve is wrong is true. So George is telling the truth ($v(G)=1$).\n\nSo we have the truthfulness of all five brothers:\nJohn: True\nPete: True\nTom: Lying\nSteve: Lying\nGeorge: True\nThe number of truths is $1+1+0+0+1=3$, which matches the mother's statement.\n\nNow we use the content of the true statements to find out who broke the window:\nJohn's statement (True): \"It was Pete or Tom.\" So $X=P \\lor X=T$.\nPete's statement (True): \"It was neither George nor me.\" So $X \\neq G \\land X \\neq P$.\n\nFrom Pete's statement being true, we know $X \\neq P$.\nFrom John's statement being true, we know $X=P \\lor X=T$.\nSince $X \\neq P$, it must be that $X=T$.\nWe also check this against the other part of Pete's true statement: $X \\neq G$. If $X=T$, then $T \\neq G$, which is true.\nTherefore, Tom broke the window.\n\nLet's verify this with the trial and error table.\nIf Tom broke the window (X=T):\nJohn: \"It was Pete or Tom.\" (T=P or T=T) -> True.\nPete: \"It was neither George nor me.\" (T!=G and T!=P) -> True.\nTom: \"Both of you are lying.\" (John is Lying AND Pete is Lying). Since John is True and Pete is True, this statement is False. So Tom is Lying.\nSteve: \"No, only one of them is lying.\" (Exactly one of John and Pete is Lying). Since John is True and Pete is True (0 liars), this statement is False. So Steve is Lying.\nGeorge: \"No, Steve, you are wrong.\" (Steve is Lying). Since Steve is Lying, this statement is True. So George is Telling the truth.\nTruths: John, Pete, George (3 truths). Lies: Tom, Steve (2 lies). This matches the mother's statement.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Tom}$.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "1"}

{"ID": 231, "Question": "Question: There is a famous diamond displayed in a room that measures 15 meters by 15 meters by 15 meters. The room is made entirely of concrete blocks and the floor is covered with a thick carpet. The only thing in the room is the diamond that is housed under a glass cube. The glass cube stands on a one-meter pedestal in the centre of the room. Alarm wires spaced eight centimetres apart and running parallel to each other lie under the carpet. The alarm will trigger if more than four kilograms of pressure is applied to any individual wire. Will Carlo who weighs 74 kilograms was able to steal the famous diamond using the following equipment: a five meter 2 x 4 board, four leather straps (each two meters long and five cm wide), a hammer, and a saw. How could he do it without triggering the alarm?\n Hint: How can he spread out his weight?", "Hint": "How can he spread out his weight?", "Human Solution": "Will Carlo stole the diamond in the following manner: First, he cut five meter 2 x 4 boards in half. Then using the available straps, he fastened the two boards to his feet like skies. With the boards strapped to his feet, his weight was displacing enough so that he did not exceed the wire's weight tolerance and triggers the alarm. Carlo then slowly and carefully walked to the centre of the room, smashed the glass cube with the hammer, took the diamond and returned the same way he came in.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": "Yes, Carlo could steal the diamond without triggering the alarm. Here's how he could do it:\n\n**Understanding the Constraints:**\n1.  Carlo's weight: 74 kg.\n2.  Alarm triggers if > 4 kg of pressure is applied to any individual wire.\n3.  Alarm wires are spaced 8 cm apart.\n\n**Calculations for Weight Distribution:**\n1.  **Minimum wires needed for Carlo's total weight:** To support 74 kg without any single wire exceeding 4 kg, Carlo needs to distribute his weight over at least 74 kg / 4 kg/wire = 18.5 wires. Since he can't use half a wire, he must distribute his weight over at least 19 wires.\n2.  **\"Snowshoe\" approach:** It's practical for Carlo to make two \"snowshoes,\" one for each foot. This means each snowshoe would need to support half his weight: 74 kg / 2 = 37 kg.\n3.  **Minimum wires per snowshoe:** Each snowshoe must support 37 kg. So, each snowshoe must distribute this weight over at least 37 kg / 4 kg/wire = 9.25 wires. Therefore, each snowshoe must cover at least 10 wires.\n4.  **Required length of snowshoe (perpendicular to wires):** To cover 10 distinct wires that are 8 cm apart, the snowshoe needs a dimension (that will be oriented perpendicular to the wires) of at least (10 - 1) * 8 cm = 72 cm. To be safe and ensure 10 wires are well engaged, a length of 10 * 8 cm = 80 cm for this dimension is a good target. An 80 cm long object will cover 80cm / 8cm/wire = 10 wire \"intervals\", meaning it rests on 10 or 11 wires depending on exact placement relative to the first wire. If it covers 10 wires, the pressure is 3.7 kg/wire. If 11 wires, it's 3.36 kg/wire. Both are acceptable.\n\n**Constructing the Snowshoes:**\nCarlo has a 5-meter (500 cm) 2x4 board, four leather straps, a hammer, and a saw.\nA \"2x4\" board typically has actual dimensions of about 1.5 inches x 3.5 inches, which is approximately 3.8 cm x 8.9 cm. Let's assume the board is 8.9 cm wide.\n\n1.  **Cutting the board:** Carlo uses the saw to cut the 500 cm long board into segments that are 80 cm long (this dimension will be perpendicular to the alarm wires).\n    500 cm / 80 cm/segment = 6.25 segments.\n    So, Carlo can cut 6 segments, each 80 cm long. This will use 6 * 80 cm = 480 cm of the board, leaving 20 cm of board material.\n    Each segment is 80 cm long and 8.9 cm wide (and 3.8 cm thick).\n\n2.  **Assembling the snowshoes:** Carlo needs to make two snowshoes. He has 6 segments (80 cm x 8.9 cm). He can use 3 segments for each snowshoe.\n    He lays 3 segments side-by-side, aligning their 80 cm lengths.\n    The resulting snowshoe will have dimensions:\n    *   Length (oriented perpendicular to the wires): 80 cm.\n    *   Width (this will be the dimension his foot rests on, parallel to the wires): 3 * 8.9 cm = 26.67 cm.\n    *   Thickness: 3.8 cm.\n\n3.  **Securing the snowshoes:** Carlo uses the four leather straps to bind the 3 segments of each snowshoe together. Two straps should be sufficient for each snowshoe, wrapped around the 3 segments to hold them firmly as a single platform. Each strap is 2 meters long, which is ample. The hammer might be used to tap the boards into a snug fit before strapping or potentially to help fashion a way to tighten/secure the straps if they don't have buckles (e.g., punching holes using the saw edge and hammer).\n\n**Using the Snowshoes:**\n1.  Each snowshoe, when stepped on, distributes 37 kg of weight.\n2.  The 80 cm dimension of the snowshoe is placed perpendicular to the alarm wires.\n3.  This 80 cm length will cover 80 cm / 8 cm/wire = 10 wires (or 11, as discussed).\n4.  Pressure per wire = 37 kg / 10 wires = 3.7 kg/wire.\n5.  Since 3.7 kg/wire is less than or equal to the 4 kg/wire limit, the alarm will not trigger.\n6.  Carlo places one snowshoe on the carpet, orienting it correctly. He steps onto it. Then, he places the second snowshoe in front of the first, transfers his weight to it, and then moves the first snowshoe forward. He repeats this process to \"walk\" or \"shuffle\" across the room to the diamond pedestal.\n\nThis method allows Carlo to traverse the room and reach the diamond without applying more than 4 kg of pressure to any individual alarm wire. The hammer's primary role might be for dealing with the glass cube or pedestal once he reaches it, rather than for crossing the floor, though it could play a minor role in assembling the snowshoes.\n\nFinal answer: Yes, Carlo can steal the diamond without triggering the alarm. He can use the saw to cut the 5-meter board into six 80-cm long segments. He then uses three segments for each \"snowshoe,\" laying them side-by-side to create a platform 80 cm long (this dimension to be placed perpendicular to the alarm wires) and approximately 26.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

This also means the Balrog is at Malacandra.\n   - Clue 1 states: \"Lothlorien, which is to the right of the Balrog.\" This means Balrog's position < Lothlorien's position (4). So Balrog is at position 1, 2, or 3.\n     - The Dragon is at position 2, so the Balrog cannot be at position 2.\n     - Mordor is at position 1.

Lothlorien is at position 4.\n     - Therefore, the Giant is not at position 4. So the Giant must be at position 1.\n     - This means the Troll must be at position 4.\n\n   Now we have all creatures placed:\n   Position 1: Mordor (Silver Castle, Giant)\n   Position 2: Narnia (Golden Castle, Dragon)\n   Position 3: Malacandra (Stone Castle, Balrog)\n   Position 4: Lothlorien (Glass Castle, Troll)\n\n**6. Determine the location of Beethoven's Wig using Clues 2, 3, and 7:**\n   - Clue 2 states: \"The Stone Castle is to the right of the Wig\". Stone Castle is at position 3. So Wig's position < 3 (i.e., Wig is at position 1 or 2).\n   - Clue 7 states: \"The Silver Castle, which is 1 fantasyland to the left of the wig.\" Silver Castle is at position 1.\n     - So, Wig's position = Silver Castle's position + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n     - This means Beethoven's Wig is at position 2.\n   - Clue 3 states: \"The Giant is not in the same place as the wig.\" The Giant is at position 1 and the Wig is at position 2. This is consistent.\n\n   The Wig is at position 2, which is Narnia, in the Golden Castle.\n\n**7. Final verification of all clues:**\n   - **Clue 1**: Narnia (2) is to the left of Lothlorien (4). (True). Lothlorien (4) is to the right of the Balrog (3). (True).\n   - **Clue 2**: The Stone Castle (3) is to the right of the Wig (2). (True). The Stone Castle is placed at Malacandra (position 3). (True).\n   - **Clue 3**: The Giant (at 1) is not at Lothlorien (4). (True). The Giant (at 1) is not in the same place as the wig (at 2). (True).\n   - **Clue 4**: The Balrog (at 3) is not in Lothlorien (4). (True). Balrog stays at the Stone Castle (at 3). (True).\n   - **Clue 5**: The Troll (at 4) doesn't live at the Golden Castle (at 2). (True). The Golden Castle (at 2) is to the left of where the Balrog stays (at 3). (True). The Golden Castle (at 2) is to the right of the Silver Castle (at 1). (True).\n   - **Clue 6**: Mordor (at 1) is to the left of the Dragon (at 2). (True). Dragon stays at the second place. (True).\n   - **Clue 7**: The Troll (at 4) is not at the Silver Castle (at 1). (True). The Silver Castle (at 1) is 1 fantasyland to the left of the wig (at 2). (True).\n   - **Hint**: Mordor (1) and Lothlorien (4) are at the edges. (True).\n\nAll clues are satisfied.\n\n**Summary of the Solution:**\n\nThe order of the fantasylands (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th):\n1.  **Mordor**: Silver Castle, guarded by the Giant.\n2.  **Narnia**: Golden Castle, guarded by the Dragon. **Beethoven's Wig is hidden here.**\n3.  **Malacandra**: Stone Castle, guarded by the Balrog.\n4.  **Lothlorien**: Glass Castle, guarded by the Troll.\n\nFinal answer:\nThe order of the fantasylands is:\n1st: Mordor\n2nd: Narnia\n3rd: Malacandra\n4th: Lothlorien\n\nThe castles and creatures are assigned as follows:\n-   In Mordor (1st) is the Silver Castle, guarded by the Giant.\n-   In Narnia (2nd) is the Golden Castle, guarded by the Dragon.\n-   In Malacandra (3rd) is the Stone Castle, guarded by the Balrog.\n-   In Lothlorien (4th) is the Glass Castle, guarded by the Troll.\n\nBeethoven's Wig is hidden in the Golden Castle, which is in Narnia (the 2nd fantasyland).", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

The possible grades are A, B, C, D. We are given that A is the best grade and D is the worst, so A > B > C > D in terms of quality.\n\nThe statements are:\n1.  J, JE, L, P are all different (all distinct grades).\n2.  If J = A, then L = D. (J=A => L=D)\n3.  If L = C, then J = D. (L=C => J=D)\n4.  Jack will get a better grade than Paul. (J > P)\n5.  If Jean doesn't get an A, then Jack will get a C. (JE != A => J = C)\n6.  If Lucy gets a B, then Paul won't get a D. (L = B => P != D)\n7.  If Lucy gets an A, then Paul will get a B. (L = A => P = B)\n8.  If Jean doesn't get a B, Paul won't either (Paul won't get a B). (JE != B => P != B)\n\nLet's analyze these statements.\n\nStep 1: Determine Jack's grade (J).\nCan Jack get an A? (Using the hint)\nAssume J = A.\nFrom statement (2), if J = A, then L = D.\nFrom statement (1), J, JE, L, P are distinct. Since J=A and L=D, JE and P must be B and C in some order.\nSo JE can be B or C. In either case, JE != A.\nFrom statement (5), if JE != A, then J = C.\nSince JE is B or C, JE != A is true. Therefore, statement (5) implies J = C.\nThis contradicts our assumption that J = A (since A and C are different grades).\nThus, the assumption J = A is false. So, Jack did not get an A (J != A).\n\nStep 2: Implications of J != A and statement (5).\nStatement (5) is: JE != A => J = C. This is a conditional statement. It is true if the premise (JE != A) is false, or if the conclusion (J = C) is true.\nSo, (JE != A is false) OR (J = C is true).\nThis means (JE = A) OR (J = C).\nWe have two main cases to consider, keeping in mind that J != A.\n\nCase 1: Jean gets an A (JE = A).\nSince J != A and JE = A, and all grades are distinct (statement 1), J, L, P must be a permutation of {B, C, D}.\nFrom statement (8): JE != B => P != B.\nSince JE = A, JE != B is true. So, statement (8) implies P != B.\nP must be chosen from {B, C, D}. Since P != B, P must be C or D.\n\nSubcase 1.1: P = C.\nIf P = C, then J and L must be B and D in some order.\nFrom statement (4), J > P. So J > C.\nThe available grades for J are B and D.\nIf J = B, then B > C. This is true. So J = B.\nThen L must be D (the remaining grade).\nLet's check this assignment: J=B, JE=A, L=D, P=C.\n1.  Distinct grades: B, A, D, C. (True)\n2.  J=A => L=D: J=B, so premise J=A is false. (True)\n3.  L=C => J=D: L=D, so premise L=C is false. (True)\n4.  J > P: B > C. (True)\n5.  JE!=A => J=C: JE=A, so premise JE!=A is false. (True)\n6.  L=B => P!=D: L=D, so premise L=B is false. (True)\n7.  L=A => P=B: L=D, so premise L=A is false. (True)\n8.  JE!=B => P!=B: JE=A, so JE!=B is true. Conclusion P!=B must be true. P=C, so P!=B is true. (True)\nAll statements hold for J=B, JE=A, L=D, P=C. This is a valid solution.\n\nSubcase 1.2: P = D.\nIf P = D, then J and L must be B and C in some order.\nFrom statement (4), J > P. So J > D.\nPossible grades for J are B or C. Both B > D and C > D are true.\n    Subcase 1.2.1: J = B, L = C.\n    Assignment: J=B, JE=A, L=C, P=D.\n    Check statement (3): L=C => J=D. Here L=C is true. So J=D must be true. But J=B. So statement (3) is false. This assignment is invalid.\n    Subcase 1.2.2: J = C, L = B.\n    Assignment: J=C, JE=A, L=B, P=D.\n    Check statement (6): L=B => P!=D. Here L=B is true. So P!=D must be true. But P=D. So statement (6) is false. This assignment is invalid.\nSo, P cannot be D if JE=A.\n\nThus, under Case 1 (JE=A), the only valid assignment is J=B, JE=A, L=D, P=C.\n\nCase 2: Jack gets a C (J = C).\nThis case assumes J=C. From (JE=A or J=C), if JE=A then it is Case 1. So here we consider J=C and JE!=A.\nSo, J = C and JE != A.\nFrom statement (4), J > P. So C > P. This implies P = D.\nFrom statement (1), J, JE, L, P are distinct. We have J=C and P=D. So JE and L must be A and B in some order.\nSince JE != A (assumption for this branch of Case 2), JE must be B.\nThen L must be A (the remaining grade).\nLet's check this assignment: J=C, JE=B, L=A, P=D.\n1.  Distinct grades: C, B, A, D. (True)\n2.  J=A => L=D: J=C, premise J=A is false. (True)\n3.  L=C => J=D: L=A, premise L=C is false. (True)\n4.  J > P: C > D. (True)\n5.

{"ID": 241, "Question": "Question: In Major League Baseball, the World Series is a best of seven series.  The first team to win four games is the champion.  The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.\nIn this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.

", "Hint": "In baseball, the home team bats last.  ", "Human Solution": "Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.  It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.\nThe team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.  New York scored five runs in the top of the 13th inning.\nTherefore, the New York Yankees won the World Series, four games to three.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": NaN, "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

How many people were in each group?\na) A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.\nb) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.\nc) One of the groups contains only married couples.\nd) The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.\ne) One of the groups contains 8 times as many people who are younger than 50 as those who are at least 50 years old.\n Hint: Set up an equation.", "Hint": "Set up an equation.", "Human Solution": "The first thing is to make this question an equation. The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then \u00bc(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then \u00bc(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation \u00bc(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.\nIf c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since \"couples\" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.\no+8o=9o.\nSo 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even. So, group x consists of 72 people and y consists of 14 people.\nSo, the answer is that there are 72 people that went to see the water mill and 14 people went to the beach.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": NaN, "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 249, "Question": "Question: Serena has received a box of chocolates as a birthday present. The box contains 12 chocolates of different shapes (one is hemispherical) and flavours (four of which are: dark chocolate, white chocolate-hazelnut, tiramisu and milk chocolate-cherry). The 12 chocolates are divided into three rows of 4 chocolate per line. With the help of the clues and the drawing, can you figure out the shape, the flavour and the position in the box of each chocolate?\n1. The following four chocolates are in the same row (but not necessarily in this\norder): the flower-shaped chocolate (which isn't gianduia flavour), the dark\nchocolate-orange chocolate (which isn't pentagonal-shaped), the chocolate just below the white chocolate and the heart-shaped milk chocolate-cognac flavoured chocolate.\n2. Every row contains only one chocolate made from dark chocolate and only one\nfrom milk chocolate and they aren't next to each other.\n3. The cremino flavoured chocolate is just to the left of the heart-shaped chocolate and just above the trapezoid-shaped one.\n4. The hexagonal-shaped chocolate is just below the dark chocolate-orange one and is in the same row as the dark chocolate-hazelnut one but further to the right.\n5. Both the caramel chocolate and the square-shaped chocolate (which isn't made from dark chocolate) are in the central part of the box but neither in the same row nor one below the other.\n6. The round chocolate (which isn't dark chocolate-orange flavour) is further to the left than the pentagonal-shaped chocolate (which isn't #4) but further to the right than the gianduia flavoured one. These three chocolates are in different rows.\n7. Chocolate #5 isn't the cremino flavoured chocolate. The two white-chocolate chocolates are in the first two rows. The rectangular-shaped chocolate is next to the oval-shaped milk chocolate. Chocolate #9 isn't rhombus-shaped. The triangularshaped\nchocolate is #1.\n Hint: Dark chocolate is first.", "Hint": "Dark chocolate is first.", "Human Solution": "Solution:\nPosition - Shape - Flavour\n1 - Triangular - Dark chocolate\n2 - Square - Gianduia\n3 - Rectangular - White chocolate\n4 - Oval - Milk chocolate\n5 - Flower - White chocolate-hazelnut\n6 - Rhombus - Dark chocolate-orange\n7 - Round - Cremino\n8 - Heart - Milk chocolate-cognac\n9 - Hemispherical - Dark chocolate hazelnut\n10 - Hexagonal - Tiramisu\n11 - Trapezoid - Caramel\n12 - Pentagonal - Milk chocolate-cherry", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": NaN, "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}
