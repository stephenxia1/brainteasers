REGULAR\u2019S RULE  \n   \u2013 Each regular keeps in his head whether he has already \u201csignalled\u201d or not.  \n   \u2013 When a regular is taken to the switch room  \n     \u2022 If he has not yet signalled AND switch A is OFF, he turns switch A ON\n        (thereby signalling for the first and only time).  \n     \u2022 Otherwise (either he has already signalled before, or A is already ON),  \n        he flips switch B instead.  \n   \u2013 After a regular has signalled once, he will never touch switch A again; from\n     then on he always flips switch B.\n\n2. COUNTER\u2019S RULE  \n   \u2013 The counter keeps a count C that starts at 0.  \n   \u2013 When the counter is taken to the switch room  \n     \u2022 If switch A is ON, he turns it OFF and increases C by 1.  \n     \u2022 If switch A is OFF, he flips switch B.  \n   \u2013 When C reaches 22 the counter immediately tells the warden  \n      \u201cEvery prisoner has visited the switch room.\u201d\n\nWhy it works\n\n\u2022 Each regular turns switch A from OFF to ON exactly once, the very first time\n  he finds A OFF.  Therefore exactly 22 ON\u2013>OFF events of switch A will ever be\n  performed, one per regular.\n\n\u2022 Only the counter ever turns A from ON back to OFF, so each time he does so\n  he can safely add one to his count C, knowing it represents a distinct\n  prisoner.\n\n\u2022 When C becomes 22, the counter has seen 22 different ON\u2013>OFF events, hence\n  every one of the 22 regulars has signalled and therefore has visited the\n  room at least once.  (The counter himself obviously has visited as well, so\n  all 23 have been in the room.)\n\n\u2022 Because the warden keeps choosing prisoners at random but guarantees that\n  eventually everyone is taken to the room arbitrarily many times, every\n  regular will eventually find A OFF while he has not yet signalled, and will\n  be able to turn it ON.  Thus the counter\u2019s count will eventually reach 22,\n  and the prisoners will eventually be released.\n\n\u2022 At no visit does anyone violate the warden\u2019s rule: every prisoner flips\n  exactly one switch on every visit (A or B as prescribed).\n\nTherefore the above strategy guarantees that the declaration will be made\nexactly once and only after every prisoner has visited the switch room.\n\nFinal answer: Designate one prisoner as counter, use switch A for signalling (regulars turn it ON once, counter turns it OFF and counts), use switch B as a dummy to satisfy the \u201cmust flip one switch\u201d rule; when the counter has turned A OFF 22 times he announces that everyone has visited, which is certain to be true.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 4, "Question": "Typical \"stars\" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).\nGiven the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?", "Hint": "It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.", "Human Solution": "199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3.

Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000.

The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.\n4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.\n5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.\n6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.\n7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).\n8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.\n9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.\n10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.\n11. Raj's character isn't the elf.\n12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.\n13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.", "Hint": "Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Human Solution": "Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nLeonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow\nHoward's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Howard\u2019s character is a 10th-level halfling thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.  \nLeonard\u2019s character is a 16th-level hobbit merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.  \nPenny\u2019s character is a 20th-level elf archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.  \nRaj\u2019s character is a 32nd-level gremlin sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.  \nSheldon\u2019s character is a 24th-level ogre paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\n\nFinal answer: Howard \u2013 halfling thief, dagger, kobolds, level 10; Leonard \u2013 hobbit merchant, crossbow, orcs, level 16; Penny \u2013 elf archbishop, bolo, chimeras, level 20; Raj \u2013 gremlin sorcerer, fireballs, giants, level 32; Sheldon \u2013 ogre paladin, mace, harpies, level 24.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}
{"ID": 7, "Question": "Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.\nHere, you are approached by three gods and their herald.\nProblem\nOn the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.\nFirst, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.\nSecond, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.\nFinally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.\nWith your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?", "Hint": "Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?", "Human Solution": "First, ask the god standing in the middle, \"If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?\"\nBy phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (\"would you say ja?\") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.\nIf the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.\nSimilarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.\nThe next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, \"If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?\" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: \"no I would not say yes,\" even though he would; or \"yes I would say no,\" even though he wouldn't.)\nFinally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, \"If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?\" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified).

{"ID": 11, "Question": "Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden).

{"ID": 20, "Question": "The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?", "Hint": "Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.", "Human Solution": "Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.\nDetective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.\nA prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.\nMr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "First list the ten surviving passengers and translate every statement into a simple \u201ccar\u2013fact\u201d about the moment just before the lights went out.  \n( D = dining-car, P = passenger-car )\n\n1.

{"ID": 41, "Question": "In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.\nHow many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)", "Hint": "The number of days depends on the number of red hats.", "Human Solution": "It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nHow this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nIf there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Call the (unknown) number of red-hatted dwarves R.  \nBecause there are 100 dwarves altogether and at least one blue hat, 1 \u2264 R \u2264 99.\n\nStep 1 \u2013 one red hat (R = 1).  \nEvery dwarf sees the other 99 hats.  \nThe unique red-hatted dwarf sees no red hats but knows there is at least one; therefore it must be his own.  \nHe stays for the feast the night of the announcement, but the next night he does not return.  \nSo with one red hat the party is red-free after 1 day.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 two red hats (R = 2).  \nEach red-hatted dwarf sees exactly one red hat.  \nEach reasons: \u201cIf my own hat were blue, there would be only one red hat, and that dwarf would have left after the first day.\u201d  \nWhen both red hats show up on the second night, each realises his guess was wrong \u2013 he too must be red \u2013 and both stay away thereafter.  \nHence the party is red-free after 2 days.\n\nInduction step \u2013 assume the statement true for R = k (all k red hats leave after k days).  \nNow suppose there are k + 1 red hats.  \nEach red dwarf sees k red hats.  \nHe thinks: \u201cIf I were blue, there would be exactly k red hats, so by the inductive hypothesis they would all be gone after k days.\u201d  \nWhen, after k days, every red dwarf still sees k red hats present, he concludes his own hat is also red.  \nAll k + 1 red hats fail to appear on the (k + 1)-st night.\n\nTherefore, by induction, if there are R red-hatted dwarves they all leave simultaneously after R days.\n\nConclusion.  \nThe number of days that pass before the party is free of red hats equals the original number of red-hatted dwarves.

E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.\nLet's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.\nIf I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.\nThis means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4.

{"ID": 57, "Question": "There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.\nHe decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.\nCompany A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, \"Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.\"  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.

The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.\nEach company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.

{"ID": 58, "Question": "A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.\nAfter this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other.

If at every stage there is a single longest block, the seating order is completely\n    determined and nothing can go \u201cwrong\u201d.  \n    The way to be sure that this happens is to make that longest block a power of two in\n    length; when such a block is split according to the rule it breaks into two unequal\n    blocks, one of which is again a power of two and strictly longer than every other\n    block that already exists.  \n    Therefore the \u201cpower\u2013of\u2013two\u2019\u2019 block remains unique for the whole game and the\n    choices of later members are forced.\n\n3.  At the beginning the bar is one single block of length 25.  \n    After the first member sits on stool k the left block has length k\u22121 and the right\n    block has length 25\u2212k.  \n    For one of these two blocks to be a power of two (and therefore automatically\n    longer than the other) we must have\n\n          k\u22121 = 16  or  25\u2212k = 16 ,\n\n    i.e.\n\n          k = 17   or   k = 9 .\n\n    Those are the only possibilities.\n\n4.  Suppose the first member sits on stool 9 (the case 17 is symmetric).  \n    The right\u2013hand block then has length 16, the left\u2013hand block length 8.  \n    The next member is forced to take stool 25, after which the block 10\u201324 has length\n    15; its middle stool 17 is forced, leaving two blocks of length 7 and one of length 8.\n    The block of length 8 is now the longest one; the next member must take stool 1,\n    producing a block of length 6 and a block of length 5, etc.  \n    Continuing this forced splitting one sees that the occupied stools become\n\n          1,3,5,7, \u2026 ,23,25,\n\n    i.e. every odd\u2013numbered stool.  Thirteen stools are occupied, which is the absolute\n    maximum because no two occupied stools are adjacent.\n\n5.

In that case fewer than 13 stools are occupied.  \n    Thus no other first stool can guarantee the optimum.\n\nConclusion  \n\nTo be certain that the bar ends up as full as possible, Jim must oblige the first member to sit on stool 9 or on stool 17.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.  Therefore, each group of four digits must sum to one of the following: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.\nB) If the sum of each group is 14, then A and D must be a combination of 1 and 4, which sum to 5.  Subtract 5 from 45, leaving 40.  Divide 40 by 2, leaving 20.  20 does not equal 14, so the sum of each group can not be 14.  Repeating the preceding sequence for each of the possible sums leaves only two possible results: 18 (1 + 8 = 9, 45 - 9 = 36, 36 / 2 = 18) and 21 (2 + 1 = 3, 45 - 3 = 42, 42 / 2 = 21).

F and I must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4.\nE) For equation #4, there are six possibilities for B and four possibilities for I, creating 24 possible equations.  Eliminate any equation where A is not 1 or 2.  Eliminate any equation where J is not 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  Eliminate any equation where any digit is duplicated.  B must be: 6, 7, 8, 9.

What a strategy has to do  \n   \u2022  Before the headbands are put on, the 500 prisoners must agree on one\n      rule that tells every prisoner what colour to shout as a function\n      of the 499 headbands he will be able to see.  \n   \u2022  After the headbands are put on, nobody may move or speak; at the\n      count of ten everyone shouts one word (\u201cblack\u2019\u2019 or \u201cwhite\u2019\u2019).  \n   \u2022  We want to maximise the smallest possible number of correct shouts\n      (the \u201cguaranteed\u2019\u2019 number of survivors).\n\n2.  An upper bound of 250  \n   Take any strategy whatever.  \n   Put the headbands on at random, each colour used with probability \u00bd\n   and independently for every head.  \n   For any fixed strategy and for any particular prisoner, what he\n   shouts is a function of the 499 other heads, and those 499 heads are\n   independent of his own.  Hence, conditioned on what he can see, his\n   own headband is still black with probability \u00bd and white with\n   probability \u00bd.  Therefore his probability of being right is exactly\n   \u00bd.  \n   The expected number of correct shouts is therefore  \n                 500 \u00d7 \u00bd = 250.  \n   If a strategy could guarantee strictly more than 250 survivors for\n   every possible colouring, its expectation would have to be > 250,\n   contradicting the calculation above.  \n   So no strategy can guarantee more than 250 survivors.\n\n3.  A strategy that guarantees 250 survivors  \n   Pair the prisoners in advance:\n\n        (1,2), (3,4), \u2026 , (499,500)\n\n   \u2013 In every pair the first prisoner will imitate the colour he sees on\n     his partner\u2019s head.  \n   \u2013 The second prisoner will shout the opposite colour to the one he\n     sees on his partner\u2019s head.\n\n   Look at any pair.\n\n        \u2022 If the two headbands in the pair are the same colour, the\n          first prisoner (who copies that colour) is right and the\n          second (who says the opposite colour) is wrong.\n\n        \u2022 If the two headbands are different colours, the second\n          prisoner is right and the first is wrong.\n\n   Thus in every pair exactly one member is guaranteed to be correct,\n   independently of what happens anywhere else.  With 250 pairs we are\n   certain to have\n\n        250 \u00d7 1 = 250\n\n   correct shouts.\n\n4.  Combining 2 and 3  \n   The upper bound tells us we can never guarantee more than 250\n   survivors; the pairing strategy shows we can always guarantee 250.\n   Therefore 250 is the optimal \u2013 and hence the answer to the tribe\n   leader\u2019s first challenge.\n\nFinal answer: 250", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 111, "Question": "Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.\nUnfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.\nBut in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.\nBut this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.\nBut the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.\nUnfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.\nLet's sum up the assumptions:\n1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.\n2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.\n3. The flower doesn't want to die.\n4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.\n5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.\n6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n7. The dog is rational.\n8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.\n9. The dog doesn't want to die.\n10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).\n11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.\n13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.\n14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.\n15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.\nSo now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?", "Hint": " 1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.\nHint 2:\nSince the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.", "Human Solution": "The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)\nBut why will the dog eat the flower?\n1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die\n2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.\n3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.\n4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.\n5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.\n6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.\n7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison\nOK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).\n8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous\n9. It can eat the flower.

Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.

{"ID": 148, "Question": "There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?", "Hint": "Divide the coins into 3 groups", "Human Solution": "Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.\nNow let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.\nAnd that's that.

Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.\nIn due time, Biggie died, and the authorities read his will, holding dispensation of the estate until the child was born.  Five months after Biggie's death, Faerie delivered ... normal, healthy twins, a boy (whom she named Manny) and a girl (whom she named Goodie).\nThe estate's executor immediately appealed to the Shapeless magistrate to rule on the proper division for the estate.

{"ID": 193, "Question": "It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.\nYou quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...", "Hint": "If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.

No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.\nWhat else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!

The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.

The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then \u00bc(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then \u00bc(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation \u00bc(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.\nIf c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since \"couples\" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.\no+8o=9o.\nSo 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even.

Behaviour of the Leader  \n   \u2022 Every time he enters the room he looks at switch A.  \n     \u2013 If A is ON he flips A to OFF and adds 1 to a private count.  \n     \u2013 If A is OFF he ignores it and instead flips switch B (whatever its\n       present position is, he reverses it).  \n   \u2022 As soon as his private count reaches 22 he knows that every one of the\n     other 22 prisoners has been in the room at least once, so the next time\n     he is brought out of his cell he tells the warden  \n        \u201cWe have all visited the switch room.\u201d\n\n4.  Behaviour of every Ordinary prisoner  \n   Each Ordinary prisoner keeps one bit of personal memory, \u201cHave-I-already-\n   given-my-token?\u201d  It is initially NO.\n\n   Each time an Ordinary prisoner is taken to the switch room he does this:\n\n   \u2013 If his personal memory is NO and switch A is OFF  \n          \u2192 he flips A to ON (thus placing one token for the Leader)  \n            and sets his personal memory to YES.  \n\n   \u2013 Otherwise  \n          \u2192 he flips switch B (reverses its position).  \n\n   Thus an Ordinary prisoner turns switch A on at most once in his life;\n   afterwards he always contents himself with toggling B.\n\nWhy the strategy works\n\n\u2022 Only Ordinary prisoners ever turn A from OFF to ON, and each of them does\n  that at most once.  Therefore exactly one token is deposited for each\n  Ordinary prisoner.  \n\n\u2022 Only the Leader ever turns A from ON to OFF, and he increments his counter\n  exactly once for every such action.  Hence the Leader\u2019s counter can never\n  exceed 22.\n\n\u2022 Whenever an Ordinary prisoner still holding his token enters the room he\n  will find A OFF sooner or later (because only the Leader resets A to OFF,\n  and every prisoner is guaranteed infinitely many visits).  Hence every\n  Ordinary prisoner will eventually deposit his one token, so the Leader\u2019s\n  counter will eventually reach 22.\n\n\u2022 When the Leader\u2019s counter first becomes 22, each Ordinary prisoner must\n  already have deposited his unique token, i.e. every prisoner has visited\n  at least once.  Therefore the Leader\u2019s declaration will never be wrong.\n\n\u2022 Because the warden keeps selecting prisoners forever, sooner or later the\n  Leader will both reach the count 22 and be selected again, so the\n  declaration is eventually made and the prisoners are freed with certainty.\n\nAll prisoners obey the warden\u2019s rule \u201cexactly one switch must be flipped on\neach visit\u201d: in every situation the prescribed action changes precisely one\nswitch.\n\nHence the plan is correct and guarantees eventual release.\n\nFinal answer: A strategy that designates one Counter prisoner who counts 22 \u201cON\u201d settings of switch A supplied once each by the other 22 prisoners, while everyone always flips exactly one switch, guarantees that the Counter will eventually know that all prisoners have visited and can safely announce it, thereby ensuring freedom.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Call the n equally\u2013spaced points 0,1,\u2026,n-1 (mod n).  \nChoose a constant step k (1\u2264k\u2264n-1) and join each point i to i+k (mod n), continuing until we return to the starting point.\n\n1.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.\nAfter dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.\nIn this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.\nCan you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?\nPlayers: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon\nRaces: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre\nOccupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief\nWeapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace\nMonsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs\nSkill levels: range from 10-32\nClues:\n1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.\n2. The paladin isn't an elf.\n3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.\n4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.\n5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.\n6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.\n7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).\n8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.\n9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.\n10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.\n11. Raj's character isn't the elf.\n12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.\n13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.", "Hint": "Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Human Solution": "Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nLeonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow\nHoward's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Howard\u2019s character  \n\u2022 Race \u2013 Halfling  \n\u2022 Occupation \u2013 Thief  \n\u2022 Weapon \u2013 Dagger  \n\u2022 Speciality \u2013 Kobolds  \n\u2022 Skill level \u2013 10  \n\nLeonard\u2019s character  \n\u2022 Race \u2013 Hobbit  \n\u2022 Occupation \u2013 Merchant  \n\u2022 Weapon \u2013 Crossbow  \n\u2022 Speciality \u2013 Orcs  \n\u2022 Skill level \u2013 16  \n\nPenny\u2019s character  \n\u2022 Race \u2013 Elf  \n\u2022 Occupation \u2013 Archbishop  \n\u2022 Weapon \u2013 Bolo  \n\u2022 Speciality \u2013 Chimeras  \n\u2022 Skill level \u2013 20  \n\nRaj\u2019s character  \n\u2022 Race \u2013 Gremlin  \n\u2022 Occupation \u2013 Sorcerer  \n\u2022 Weapon \u2013 Fireballs  \n\u2022 Speciality \u2013 Giants  \n\u2022 Skill level \u2013 32  \n\nSheldon\u2019s character  \n\u2022 Race \u2013 Ogre  \n\u2022 Occupation \u2013 Paladin  \n\u2022 Weapon \u2013 Mace  \n\u2022 Speciality \u2013 Harpies  \n\u2022 Skill level \u2013 24  \n\nFinal answer: Howard \u2013 halfling thief (dagger, kobolds, level 10); Leonard \u2013 hobbit merchant (crossbow, orcs, level 16); Penny \u2013 elf archbishop (bolo, chimeras, level 20); Raj \u2013 gremlin sorcerer (fireballs, giants, level 32); Sheldon \u2013 ogre paladin (mace, harpies, level 24).", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 11, "Question": "Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?\n1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.\n2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.\n3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.

{"ID": 15, "Question": "Einstein's Riddle:\nEinstein wrote the following riddle. He said that 98% of the world could not solve it. But several NIEHS scientists were able to solve it, and they said it's not all that hard if you pay attention and are very patient. Give it a try:\nThere are 5 houses in 5 different colors in a row. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. The 5 owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage. Other facts:\n1.\tThe Brit lives in the red house.\n2.\tThe Swede keeps dogs as pets.\n3.\tThe Dane drinks tea.\n4.\tThe green house is on the immediate left of the white house.\n5.\tThe green house's owner drinks coffee.\n6.\tThe owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.\n7.\tThe owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill.\n8.\tThe owner living in the center house drinks milk.\n9.\tThe Norwegian lives in the first house.\n10.\tThe owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.\n11.\tThe owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill.\n12.\tThe owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer.\n13.\tThe German smokes Prince.\n14.\tThe Norwegian lives next to the blue house.\n15.\tThe owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who drinks water.\nThe question is: WHO OWNS THE FISH?", "Hint": "Just take your time.

From clue 4 (green immediately to the left of white)  \n   Green cannot be 1 or 2 (2 is blue) and the pair (green, white) cannot be (3, 4) because the green owner would then drink coffee (clue 5) instead of the milk fixed for house 3.  \n   Therefore: house 4 is green, house 5 white.\n\n5.

{"ID": 20, "Question": "The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?", "Hint": "Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.", "Human Solution": "Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car.

One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:\nIn the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).\nThe monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: \"white\" or \"black\". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right.

{"ID": 37, "Question": "On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.\nOf the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.\nEach night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.\nNow, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes.

{"ID": 41, "Question": "In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.\nHow many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party?

Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nIf there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast.

E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.\nLet's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.\nIf I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.\nThis means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4.

{"ID": 57, "Question": "There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.\nHe decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.\nCompany A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, \"Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.\"  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.

The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.\nEach company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full \u00be pay for \u00be of a bridge ($750,000).\nWhen Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.

Because the risk of failure or cost overrun rested entirely on B, the offer looked \u201ctoo good to refuse.\u201d\n\nWhen the foundations and piers were in, the Emperor naturally wanted the roadway as well; when the steelwork stood, he wanted the bridge completed. Each time he compared what he already had (and what it still lacked) with the extra amount he would have to pay, and each time the additional payment seemed reasonable. In the end he let B finish everything and, exactly as the contract specified, paid the top figure of $1 000 000.\n\nCompany B was perfectly honest: the Emperor always had the power to stop at $200 000 or $750 000. He never exercised that power because the staged arrangement made the full $1 000 000 seem the best bargain.

{"ID": 61, "Question": "In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.\nThe pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.\nWhat exactly happened there?", "Hint": "Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison", "Human Solution": "The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison.

When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before.

But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand.

One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes.

{"ID": 111, "Question": "Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.\nUnfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.\nBut in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.\nBut this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.\nBut the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.\nUnfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.\nLet's sum up the assumptions:\n1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.\n2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.\n3. The flower doesn't want to die.\n4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.\n5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.\n6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n7. The dog is rational.\n8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.\n9. The dog doesn't want to die.\n10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).\n11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.\n13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.\n14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.\n15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.\nSo now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?", "Hint": " 1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.\nHint 2:\nSince the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.", "Human Solution": "The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)\nBut why will the dog eat the flower?\n1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die\n2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.\n3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.\n4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog.

What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.\n6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.\n7.

And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).\n8.

The Mountaineers, Troopers and Typhoons signed the fullback, the player who left the Downers and Cowan, in some order.\n3.

(7)\n\nStarting with R\u2080 = 0 and iterating the tightest case (equality in (7)) four times\nreproduces exactly the sequence in (6), ending at R\u2084 = 40.\nBecause (7) is an inequality, no other choice of four weights can yield R\u2084 > 40.\nTherefore 40 oz is an absolute upper bound.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  Completeness of the set {1,3,9,27}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nEvery integer n (|n| \u2264 40) can be written in balanced ternary, i.e.  \nn = \u03a3 \u03b5\u1d62 3\u1da6 with \u03b5\u1d62 \u2208 {\u20131,0,1}.  \nInterpreting the digit \u03b5\u1d62 = \u20131 (resp. +1) as placing 3\u1da6 oz on the same (resp. opposite)\npan as the gold reproduces (2).  Hence all masses 1,\u2026,40 oz are attainable.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe assessor should own 1-, 3-, 9-, and 27-ounce weights; with four weights this is optimal, and he can measure every whole-number amount of gold dust from 1 ounce up to, but not beyond,\n\n40 ounces.\n\nFinal answer: 40", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.\n**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.\n**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.\n**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.\n*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

{"ID": 148, "Question": "There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?", "Hint": "Divide the coins into 3 groups", "Human Solution": "Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.\nNow let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.\nAnd that's that.

{"ID": 150, "Question": "There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.\nThe lions are special:\n1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.\n2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).\n3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.\n4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.\nNow, here's the kicker:\n5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).\n6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).\nAssumptions:\n1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.\n2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.\n3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.\nSo now the question:\nWill that one sheep get eaten or not and why?", "Hint": "There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint.

Now take the next step.", "Human Solution": "The sheep would remain untouched.\nIn fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.\nHere's the reasoning:\nConsider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.\nNow look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.\nSo now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.\nWe can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.\nYou can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Label by N the number of lions that are on the island together with a single sheep.  \nFor every N we shall determine whether that sheep will be eaten or not, using the\nfact that every lion is perfectly logical and prefers the alternative in which he certainly\nstays alive (eating grass forever) to the alternative in which he is eventually eaten.\n\nStep 1 \u2013 Base cases  \n\u2022 N = 0.  (No lions.)  A sheep is obviously safe.  \n\u2022 N = 1.  One lion may eat the sheep, after which he turns into a sheep himself and\nthere are then 0 lions left.  From the previous line he knows that this new sheep is\nsafe, so he cannot possibly be eaten later.  As fresh meat is preferred to grass, the\nsingle lion surely eats the sheep.  Thus for N = 1 the sheep is eaten.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Inductive observation  \nSuppose a situation with N \u2265 1 lions and 1 sheep confronts any given lion L with\ntwo possibilities:\n\n(a) L eats the sheep.  \n     Immediately afterwards there are (N \u2013 1) lions and L (now a sheep).  \n     L will accept this action only if the new sheep is safe in the\n     configuration with (N \u2013 1) lions.\n\n(b) L does not eat the sheep.  \n     Then the original situation persists for the other lions to analyse in exactly the\n     same way.

To avoid that fate he declines to eat.

Grobi can therefore, in any one jump, jump any distance across the field at or between the 6-72 inch limits.\n6...can jump directly north, south, east, or west only; cannot jump diagonally.\n7...must jump four times in any one direction (N-S-E-W) before changing direction (N-S-E-W) or to continue in the same direction (N-S-E-W).\n8...dines on mushrooms which grow in the field.  The mushrooms grow to a maximum of six inches in diameter and to a height of an inch.\n9...can ingest a mushroom only by landing directly atop the mushroom.\n10...is very adept at precisely determining distances.\nOne day Grobi - happily jumping around in the middle of the field - locates a six-inch diameter mushroom six inches away (center of Grobi to center of mushroom distance) directly west of Grobi.\nGrobi quickly (and accurately) calculates that FOUR jumps is the fastest way to get to the mushroom and eat, which Grobi does.\nDescribe the route taken by Grobi to eat the mushroom including the direction of jumps, each approximate jump-distance, and the specific number of jumps in each direction.", "Hint": "No need to \"invent\" anything new for Grobi such as extraordinary motivating or grasping or ingestion appendages.

Five out of the six pieces are \"Kebabrie\" and the remaining one is \"Chillirella\".\nNorma Leigh-Sobar purchased two pieces of \"Kebabrie\" and Laura Anne-Hardy also purchased some \"Kebabrie\" , but she purchased twice as much in weight than Norma .\nHow much does the remaining \"Chillirella\" weigh?", "Hint": "Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.", "Human Solution": "Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.\nSince Laura bought twice what Norma bought, the total amount of cheese bought by the two together equals 3 times that purchased by Norma alone. Now, the total weight of all the wedges at the grocery divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so the \"Chillirella\" wedge must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. But the only such wedge is the 20 pound wedge, thus the \"Chillirella\" wedge must have weighed 20 pounds.\nThus Norma purchased the 15 and 18 pound pieces which equals 33 pounds and Laura purchased the 16, 19 and 31 pound pieces which equals 66 pounds.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Let the six displayed cheeses weigh  \n\n15 lb, 16 lb, 18 lb, 19 lb, 20 lb and 31 lb.\n\nExactly one of them is Chillirella; the other five are Kebabrie.\nNorma buys two Kebabrie pieces and Laura buys Kebabrie whose total\nweight is twice Norma\u2019s.

There are only a few numbers that will satisfy this:\n11, 12, 16, 21, 22, 23 and 24.\nNow we skip down to clue 8, which tells us there is one 8 only, and it is in the last set.

{"ID": 193, "Question": "It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.\nYou quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...", "Hint": "If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.

No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.\nWhat else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!

The only possible single-man returners are Walter (who must return exactly once) or Zeke himself. If Zeke stays on the destination side, nobody who remains on the starting side can row back alone except Walter, and Walter must save his single rowing for later. Hence Zeke must be the first man to bring the boat back, placing him on the starting side, with the boat, while his passenger is marooned across the river; that makes a second outward trip with Zeke impossible.\n\nCase (b) also fails: if Zeke rows a return trip, he ends up on the starting side while his former passenger is across the river. From that position the last outward trip must carry Walter (who cannot row) and somebody who can row with Walter. That \u201csomebody\u201d cannot be Xavier (he would need Yoshi as passenger), so it would have to be Yoshi. But Yoshi is stranded on the far bank; Zeke cannot bring him back because the boat is already on the starting side. Contradiction.

{"ID": 241, "Question": "In Major League Baseball, the World Series is a best of seven series.  The first team to win four games is the champion.  The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.\nIn this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Los Angeles hosted the first two games.

", "Human Solution": "Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.  It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.\nThe team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.  New York scored five runs in the top of the 13th inning.\nTherefore, the New York Yankees won the World Series, four games to three.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Let us determine which club won Game 7; that will automatically give the Series winner, because a seventh game is played only when the two clubs have split the first six games 3\u20133, and the Game-7 winner becomes champion.\n\n1.

{"ID": 242, "Question": "A tourist group of 86 people broke up into two groups. The smaller group went to the beach, and the bigger group went to see a water mill.

The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then \u00bc(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then \u00bc(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation \u00bc(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.\nIf c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since \"couples\" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.\no+8o=9o.\nSo 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even.

The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).\nGiven the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?", "Hint": "It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.", "Human Solution": "199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.\nAfter dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.\nIn this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.\nCan you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?\nPlayers: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon\nRaces: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre\nOccupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief\nWeapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace\nMonsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs\nSkill levels: range from 10-32\nClues:\n1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.\n2. The paladin isn't an elf.\n3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.\n4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.\n5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.\n6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.\n7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).\n8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.\n9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.\n10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.\n11. Raj's character isn't the elf.\n12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.\n13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.", "Hint": "Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Human Solution": "Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nLeonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow\nHoward's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds.

{"ID": 7, "Question": "Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.\nHere, you are approached by three gods and their herald.\nProblem\nOn the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.\nFirst, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.\nSecond, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.\nFinally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.\nWith your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?", "Hint": "Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?", "Human Solution": "First, ask the god standing in the middle, \"If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?\"\nBy phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (\"would you say ja?\") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.\nIf the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.\nSimilarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.\nThe next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, \"If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?\" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: \"no I would not say yes,\" even though he would; or \"yes I would say no,\" even though he wouldn't.)\nFinally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, \"If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?\" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified).

Each question is addressed to a single god, and each is a yes-or-no question that they can answer with ja or da. No step depends on guessing which word means \u201cyes\u2019\u2019 or on luck with Random\u2019s replies.\n\nFinal answer:  \nAsk the following three questions.\n\n1. To A: \u201cIf I asked you \u2018Are you the Random god?\u2019, would you say ja?\u201d  \n2. To B: \u201cIf I asked you \u2018Are you the Random god?\u2019, would you say ja?\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 The god (if any) who answers ja is Random; if both answer da, then C is Random.  \n3.

On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.\n1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.\n2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.\n3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.\n4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.\n5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip.

{"ID": 20, "Question": "The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?", "Hint": "Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.", "Human Solution": "Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.\nDetective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.\nA prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.\nMr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Final answer: Mr. K", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).\nThe monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: \"white\" or \"black\". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.\nThe monster gives them the whole night to think.\nThe Task:\nDevise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.\nAssumptions:\n1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.\n2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.\n3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional \"white\" or \"black\".\n4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words.

{"ID": 37, "Question": "On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other.

However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.\nEach night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.\nNow, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes.

{"ID": 41, "Question": "In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.\nHow many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party?

He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nIf there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Let R be the (unknown) number of red-hatted dwarves present the first night.\n\nStep 1.

Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.\nOn fourth thought (the economics):\nIf the engineering balance is \"close to equilibrium\", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Final answer: Yes \u2013 the contract is perfectly reasonable, because only one lockful of water (\u2248 7 000 L), not thirteen lockfuls, has to be replaced after each complete passage of the flight.  \n\nReasoning  \n1. When a lock is worked, the water that lifts (or lowers) the boat comes from the pound immediately above the lock and, after the boat has left, is discharged into the pound immediately below.  \n2. Thus every time a boat goes through any single lock, one lock-chamber volume is simply moved down one level; it is not lost from the canal system.  \n3. In a flight of 13 locks the same thing happens successively, so one lockful of water is moved down at each step. After the whole flight has been negotiated, the net result is that exactly one lock-chamber volume has travelled from the summit pound (above the top lock) to the pound below the bottom lock.  \n4. Consequently the only water that has actually left the summit pound and must be brought back is one lockful, 7 000 L, for every through-boat, not 13 \u00d7 7 000 L.  \n5.

{"ID": 57, "Question": "There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.\nHe decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.\nCompany A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, \"Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.\"  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.\nWhy did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?", "Hint": "2 Hints:\n1.

It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.\nEach company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full \u00be pay for \u00be of a bridge ($750,000).\nWhen Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.

{"ID": 61, "Question": "In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.\nThe pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.\nWhat exactly happened there?", "Hint": "Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison", "Human Solution": "The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison. As his own poison he would bring water, which will have no effect on him, but the pharmacist who would drink the water, and then his poison would surely die. When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before. The pharmacist would drink only water, so nothing will happen to him.

What the treasurer had to do  \n\n\u2003\u2022  He knew he could not out-do the pharmacist in producing an extremely strong poison.  \n\u2003\u2022  Therefore the only way he could live was to make the pharmacist\u2019s poison do the work of neutralising a poison that was already in the treasurer\u2019s body.  \n\n\u2003His plan was therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2002a) Some time before the test he secretly swallows a dose of an ordinary (not very strong) poison P.  \n\u2003\u2002b) For the test he puts ordinary water, coloured and flavoured to look like poison, into the bottle that is supposed to be his \u201cstrongest poison\u201d.  \n\n\u2003During the trial the order of drinking would be\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Treasurer first drinks the pharmacist\u2019s poison S (which he assumes will be formidable).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2002S is stronger than the poison P already in the treasurer\u2019s body, so S destroys P and itself in the process \u2013 the treasurer is safe.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The treasurer then drinks the water he brought; water is not a poison, so it does nothing.  \n\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The pharmacist, however, first drinks the treasurer\u2019s \u201cpoison\u201d \u2013 in fact water \u2013 and then drinks his own poison S.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2002Because there is no weaker poison in him, S is not neutralised and kills the pharmacist.  \n\n\u2003Thus, if nothing interfered, the treasurer would live and the pharmacist would die.\n\n2.

Why the king did not get what he wanted  \n\nSince both flasks at the trial contained nothing but water, the king never obtained a sample of a genuine \u201cstrongest poison\u201d.\n\nFinal answer:  \nThe treasurer tried to survive by secretly swallowing a mild poison beforehand and giving the pharmacist only water, counting on the pharmacist\u2019s powerful poison to neutralise the poison already in him.  \nThe pharmacist guessed this, filled his own bottle with water as well, and therefore introduced no stronger poison into the treasurer\u2019s body.

Why won\u2019t any other first stool always work?  \n   If the first person does \u200bnot\u200b sit at an end, at most one end can be taken later (at best the second arrival sits there), so from the inequality 2x + 3y \u2264 25 we obtain x \u2264 1 \u21d2 x + y \u2264 8.  Thus starting anywhere except at an end can never guarantee the maximal 9 seats.\n\nTherefore Jim should decree that the first customer must choose stool 1 or stool 25.

Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.\nWhat numbers does she say they each are holding?", "Hint": "Do casework on what Moe can have.", "Human Solution": "Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.\nFrom Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd.

If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.\nThere are 12 triples for (Manny, Moe, Jack) that satisfy all three statements.

{"ID": 111, "Question": "Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.\nUnfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.\nBut in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.\nBut this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.\nBut the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.\nUnfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.\nLet's sum up the assumptions:\n1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.\n2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.\n3. The flower doesn't want to die.\n4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.\n5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.\n6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n7. The dog is rational.\n8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.\n9. The dog doesn't want to die.\n10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).\n11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.\n13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.\n14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.\n15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.\nSo now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?", "Hint": " 1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.\nHint 2:\nSince the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.", "Human Solution": "The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)\nBut why will the dog eat the flower?\n1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die\n2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.\n3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.\n4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.\n5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.\n6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.\n7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison\nOK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).\n8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous\n9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Because neither side can bluff in any way that the other can detect, the whole situation can be analysed in a few orderly steps.\n\n1.  What would make the flower develop poison?  \n    \u2013  By assumptions 5 & 6 the flower will incur the (undesired) cost of making poison only if that in fact keeps it alive.  \n    \u2013  But the dog (assumptions 12 & 13) will not learn whether poison has been made, so its decision (\u201ceat\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t eat\u201d) cannot depend on that hidden fact.  \n    \u2013  Consequently, once the dog has fixed its decision, the dog will carry that decision out whether or not the flower is poisonous.  \n    \u2013  Therefore producing poison cannot possibly keep the flower from being eaten. It merely adds a cost to the flower and still leaves it dead.  \n    \u2013  A rational flower that realises this gains nothing by producing poison, so it never produces poison.\n\n2.  The dog knows all of the foregoing.  \n    \u2013  It knows the flower is rational (assumption 10) and hence will not waste effort on useless poison.  \n    \u2013  Therefore the dog can be certain that the flower will not be poisonous.\n\n3.  The dog now compares its two real options.  \n    \u2013  Eat the (certainly non-poisonous) flower \u2192 the virus is cured and the dog surely survives.  \n    \u2013  Do not eat \u2192 there remains a 50 % chance of dying from the virus.\n\n4.  Because the dog is rational and prefers certain survival to a 50 % chance of death (assumption 9), it chooses to eat the flower.\n\nThus, in equilibrium the flower never makes poison and the dog eats the flower.\n\nFinal answer: The dog will eat the flower.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all four machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the four switches outside the room to the four machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?", "Hint": "Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room....", "Human Solution": "Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room and, by listening, test all six combinations of two back-up switches to find which two match the two \"machine-on\" switches inside the room.

Now, before returning to the room, leave one \"on\" off and one \"off\" on leaving the other \"on\" on and \"off\" off, that is, only two switches are activated.

{"ID": 129, "Question": "During the California Gold Rush, an assessor in San Francisco used a balance to measure out quantities of gold dust. He had a set of weights to place on the balance.

In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

We know that three of the chapters are, in this order, (Sense, Alex's, Descartes).  Therefore, Alex's chapter can not be the first chapter, or the last.  \"Sense\" can not be the last chapter, and \"Descartes\" can not be the first.  We can also assume that \"Sense\" nor \"Descartes\" is Alex's chapter.\n**Clue #2:  This lets us know that Toby's chapter can not be the first chapter, and that \"Jung\" can not be the last chapter.  We assume \"Jung\" is not Toby's chapter.\n**Clue #3:  If Kiera's chapter is three AFTER \"Freud\", then \"Freud\" can NOT be the 3rd, 4th or 5th chapter.  This also means that Kiera's chapter can not be the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd chapters.\n**Clue #4:  Joan's chapter is not 4th.  If \"Kant\" is 5th, Joan's would be 4th.

This means Alex's chapter is 4th, and \"Sense\" is 3rd.  This also leaves Kiera's as the 5th chapter, which is \"Descartes\".  For hers to be 3 after \"Freud\", \"Freud\" has the be the 2nd chapter.  We know that \"Jung\" comes before Toby's chapter.  This leaves chapters 1 and 4.  If \"Jung\" is chapter 4, Toby's would be 5, but we know that 5 is Kiera's, so \"Jung\" has to be chapter 1.  This makes \"Kant\" chapter 4, and Alex's chapter.  This means that Joans has to be the 3rd or the 5th because of the order between Joan's chapter and \"Kant\" that we were already given, and we already know that Kiera has the 5th chapter.  So we know that Joan has chapter 3, \"Sense.\"   After marking off the chapter numbers by the names, you see that Toby's is chapter 2, \"Freud\" and that leaves Caleb with chapter 1, \"Jung.\"", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Final answer:  \n\nChapter 1 \u2013 \u201cJung At Heart\u201d \u2013 Caleb  \nChapter 2 \u2013 \u201cFreudian Slippers\u201d \u2013 Toby  \nChapter 3 \u2013 \u201cSense of Hume-or\u201d \u2013 Joan  \nChapter 4 \u2013 \u201cI Kant Understand It\u201d \u2013 Alex  \nChapter 5 \u2013 \u201cDescartes Before DesHorse\u201d \u2013 Kiera", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.\nNow let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.\nAnd that's that.

But the answer is still the same", "Human Solution": "HEF Jr's sister is the lead actor.\nFrom fact 4, we know that rooms A and C each border one man's room and one woman's room. So one of rooms B and E is occupied by a man and the other by a woman, and one of rooms B and D is occupied by a man and the other by a woman. If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.\nSince there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.\nSince there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.\nFact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son.

{"ID": 150, "Question": "There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.\nThe lions are special:\n1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.\n2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).\n3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.\n4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.\nNow, here's the kicker:\n5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).\n6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).\nAssumptions:\n1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.\n2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.\n3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.\nSo now the question:\nWill that one sheep get eaten or not and why?", "Hint": "There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:\nHint 1) Use math induction.\nHint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.", "Human Solution": "The sheep would remain untouched.\nIn fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.\nHere's the reasoning:\nConsider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.\nNow look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep.

Five out of the six pieces are \"Kebabrie\" and the remaining one is \"Chillirella\".\nNorma Leigh-Sobar purchased two pieces of \"Kebabrie\" and Laura Anne-Hardy also purchased some \"Kebabrie\" , but she purchased twice as much in weight than Norma .\nHow much does the remaining \"Chillirella\" weigh?", "Hint": "Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.", "Human Solution": "Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.\nSince Laura bought twice what Norma bought, the total amount of cheese bought by the two together equals 3 times that purchased by Norma alone. Now, the total weight of all the wedges at the grocery divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so the \"Chillirella\" wedge must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. But the only such wedge is the 20 pound wedge, thus the \"Chillirella\" wedge must have weighed 20 pounds.\nThus Norma purchased the 15 and 18 pound pieces which equals 33 pounds and Laura purchased the 16, 19 and 31 pound pieces which equals 66 pounds.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Let the two wedges that Norma buys weigh x lb and y lb.\n\nNorma\u2019s total:\u2003N = x + y\n\nLaura buys only Kebabrie and her purchase weighs twice as much:\n\nLaura\u2019s total:\u2003L = 2N\n\nAltogether the five Kebabrie wedges (Norma\u2019s two plus Laura\u2019s three) weigh\n\nN + L = N + 2N = 3N\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nThe six displayed wedges weigh  \n15 + 16 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 31 = 119 lb.\n\nIf the single Chillirella wedge weighs w lb, the total weight of the Kebabrie wedges is 119 \u2013 w.  \nFrom (1):\n\n3N = 119 \u2013 w\u2003\u2003\u21d2\u2003119 \u2013 w is a multiple of 3.\u2003(2)\n\nBecause 119 \u2261 2 (mod 3), condition (2) requires\n\nw \u2261 2  (mod 3).\n\nAmong the six given weights only 20 lb satisfies this congruence, so\n\nChillirella must weigh 20 lb.\n\nNow the five remaining weights {15, 16, 18, 19, 31} are Kebabrie.\n\nFrom (1) with w = 20 we have  \n3N = 119 \u2013 20 = 99 \u21d2 N = 33 lb.\n\nNorma needs two of the five Kebabrie wedges whose weights sum to 33 lb.  \nThe only possible pair is 15 lb + 18 lb.\n\nHence Norma buys the 15-lb and 18-lb wedges (33 lb), and Laura buys the remaining three Kebabrie wedges 16 lb + 19 lb + 31 lb (66 lb = 2 \u00d7 33 lb).\n\nAll conditions are satisfied and the solution is unique.\n\nFinal answer: 20 pounds", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time.

Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.

Identify the victim.  \nJack and Carol are both alive (H and S\u2082 cannot be victims).  \nThus the victim is either Mike or Lily.\n\nBut Lily is alive (she is S\u2081), so the only possible victim is Mike.\n\nStep 5.

This means he could only row the boat on a return trip, which means he rowed on at least one return trip.\nThe man who rowed twice could not have rowed on two trips from the starting side to the destination side, because he would have had to make a third trip by himself back to the starting side. So the man who rowed twice must have made a return trip at least once.\nNow we know that if Walter made two trips, they must both have been return trips, and Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke each rowed for one of the other three trips. If Walter made only one trip, the other person who made a return trip must have been the person who rowed twice (Xavier, Yoshi, or Zeke) and that person would also have made one of the other three trips. So the three trips from the starting side to the destination side must have been rowed by Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke.\nFact 1 tells us that Xavier's trip to the destination side must have had a passenger, and fact 4 tells us that that passenger must have been Yoshi. Yoshi would have had to row back to row his trip to the destination side, or else Yoshi rowed to the destination side, then back to the start, then got rowed across by Xavier.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "First recall the five trips have to be (in order)\nF\u2081 , R\u2081 , F\u2082 , R\u2082 , F\u2083  \nwhere the three F\u2013trips go from the starting side to the destination side with two men in the boat, and the two R\u2013trips go the opposite way with a single man in the boat.\n\nStep 1.  Walter\u2019s (W\u2019s) rowing.  \n\u2022  Fact 3 says W can row only when he is alone, therefore only on an R-trip.  \n\u2022  Fact 5 says every man rows at least once, so W rows one of the two R-trips \u2013 no more and no less (because he can never row an F-trip).\n\nStep 2.  Can Xavier (X) row an R-trip?  \nAssume X rows some R-trip.  Because a return trip starts on the destination side, X first has to be taken to that side.  If X himself rows the preceding F-trip, his passenger must be Yoshi (Y) (Fact 4); if he is a passenger, some other man rows.  After X rows back alone, he is again on the starting side together with W, while Y is on the opposite side.  The only men left on the starting side just before the last crossing would then be W and X, but  \n\u2022  W cannot row an F-trip at all, and  \n\u2022  X cannot row with W as passenger (Fact 4).  \nHence the last crossing would be impossible.  Therefore X never rows an R-trip; he rows exactly one F-trip, and when he does, Y must be his passenger.\n\nStep 3.  Who rows the second R-trip?  \nIt cannot be X (see Step 2).  Suppose Zeke (Z) rows an R-trip.  To do so he must first be ferried to the destination side, and the only way to put him back on the starting side afterward is for him to row there himself.  But when Z arrives back alone, the only men remaining on the starting side for the very last crossing are Z and W.  Again W cannot row an F-trip, so Z would have to row a second time, giving him at least three total trips (two returns and one forward), which is impossible because only one person is allowed to row twice.  Hence Z cannot row any R-trip.\n\nConsequently Y must row the R-trip that W does not row.\n\nStep 4.  Counting the rows.  \nSo far we have  \n\u2022  W\u2003\u2013\u20031 row (an R-trip),  \n\u2022  Y\u2003\u2013\u20031 row (the other R-trip),  \n\u2022  X\u2003\u2013\u20031 row (the single F-trip he is allowed to make, with Y as passenger),  \n\u2022  Z\u2003\u2013\u2003at least 1 row (some F-trip).\n\nThat accounts for four of the five trips.  One F-trip is still unassigned, and the only man who has not yet reached his quota of \u201cat least once\u201d and can still legally row is Y.  Therefore Y must row this remaining F-trip.\n\nThus the totals are  \nW : 1\u2003\u2002X : 1\u2003\u2002Z : 1\u2003\u2002Y : 2.\n\nStep 5.

{"ID": 231, "Question": "There is a famous diamond displayed in a room that measures 15 meters by 15 meters by 15 meters. The room is made entirely of concrete blocks and the floor is covered with a thick carpet. The only thing in the room is the diamond that is housed under a glass cube. The glass cube stands on a one-meter pedestal in the centre of the room. Alarm wires spaced eight centimetres apart and running parallel to each other lie under the carpet. The alarm will trigger if more than four kilograms of pressure is applied to any individual wire. Will Carlo who weighs 74 kilograms was able to steal the famous diamond using the following equipment: a five meter 2 x 4 board, four leather straps (each two meters long and five cm wide), a hammer, and a saw. How could he do it without triggering the alarm?", "Hint": "How can he spread out his weight?", "Human Solution": "Will Carlo stole the diamond in the following manner: First, he cut five meter 2 x 4 boards in half. Then using the available straps, he fastened the two boards to his feet like skies.

{"ID": 241, "Question": "In Major League Baseball, the World Series is a best of seven series.  The first team to win four games is the champion.  The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.\nIn this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Los Angeles hosted the first two games.  The final scores of the games were:\nGame 1:  4 to 3\nGame 2:  6 to 5 (11 innings)\nGame 3:  11 to 7\nGame 4:  16 to 9\nGame 5:  9 to 6 (10 innings)\nGame 6:  2 to 1\nGame 7:  13 to 8 (13 innings)\nWhich team won the World Series?", "Hint": "In baseball, the home team bats last.  ", "Human Solution": "Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.  It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.\nThe team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.

{"ID": 242, "Question": "A tourist group of 86 people broke up into two groups. The smaller group went to the beach, and the bigger group went to see a water mill.

The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then \u00bc(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then \u00bc(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation \u00bc(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.\nIf c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since \"couples\" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.\no+8o=9o.\nSo 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even.

Rules for the prisoners\n\n   Ordinary prisoner P  \n   \u2022 If P has never in his life turned switch A ON and he enters the room when A is OFF,  \n     he must flip A from OFF to ON.  \n     (That is P\u2019s one and only \u201ccontribution\u201d to the count.)  \n   \u2022 In every other situation P must flip switch B.  \n     (In particular, after P has made his one contribution he will never touch A again;  \n     he will always flip B.)\n\n   Leader L  \n   \u2022 If L enters the room and finds switch A ON,  \n     he flips A to OFF and increases an internal counter by 1.  \n   \u2022 If A is already OFF, L flips switch B.  \n   \u2022 When L\u2019s internal counter reaches 22 he immediately tells the warden  \n     \u201cWe have all visited the switch room.\u201d\n\n(Everybody of course flips exactly one switch on every visit, as the warden requires.)\n\nWhy the strategy works\n\n\u2022 Each Ordinary prisoner is allowed to turn A from OFF to ON exactly once.  \n  Therefore every time the Leader finds A = ON, that ON was created by a distinct\n  Ordinary prisoner who had not been counted before.  \n  The Leader alone ever turns A OFF, so the ON signal cannot be lost or created twice.\n\n\u2022 Because the warden keeps bringing every prisoner to the switch room infinitely\n  often (assumption C), each Ordinary prisoner will eventually encounter A in the\n  OFF position and will be able to make his one contribution.\n\n\u2022 Hence, sooner or later the Leader will have seen A ON 22 times and will have\n  reset it to OFF 22 times; at that moment every Ordinary prisoner has certainly\n  visited the room at least once, so everyone has visited.\n\n\u2022 Conversely, the Leader\u2019s counter cannot reach 22 unless each of the 22 Ordinary\n  prisoners has made his single contribution, so the Leader never makes a false\n  declaration.\n\nThus the declaration is made exactly when the condition \u201ceverybody has been in the switch room\u201d is satisfied, and the prisoners are guaranteed to be released.\n\nFinal answer:  The prisoners appoint one Leader and use switch A as a one-time signal that only non-leaders may raise and only the Leader may clear; every other required flip is done on switch B.  When the Leader has cleared switch A 22 times, he can safely proclaim that all 23 prisoners have visited the switch room.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 4, "Question": "Typical \"stars\" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).\nGiven the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?", "Hint": "It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.", "Human Solution": "199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199.

{"ID": 7, "Question": "Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.\nHere, you are approached by three gods and their herald.\nProblem\nOn the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.\nFirst, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.\nSecond, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.\nFinally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.\nWith your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?", "Hint": "Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?", "Human Solution": "First, ask the god standing in the middle, \"If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?\"\nBy phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (\"would you say ja?\") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.\nIf the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.\nSimilarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.\nThe next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, \"If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?\" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: \"no I would not say yes,\" even though he would; or \"yes I would say no,\" even though he wouldn't.)\nFinally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, \"If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?\" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "Let the three gods be A , B , C.  \nExactly one is the truth-teller (True), one always lies (False) and one answers at random (Random).  \nEach answer is a single word, either ja or da, one of which means \u201cyes\u2019\u2019 and the other \u201cno\u2019\u2019 \u2013 we do not know which way round.\n\nTwo technical tricks\n1.

{"ID": 20, "Question": "The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?", "Hint": "Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.", "Human Solution": "Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.\nDetective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.\nA prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.\nMr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "Let  \n\nDining Car  = D  \nPassenger Car = P  \n\nPassengers (10):  \nMs. S, Mr. G, Mr. J, Ms. L, Mr. F, Mr. R, Mr. Q, Ms. P, Mr. K, Ms. W  \n\nStep 1.

{"ID": 22, "Question": "The Situation:\nThere is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:\nIn the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).\nThe monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: \"white\" or \"black\". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess.

The hint fixes that exactly one of Carl or Ivy is the Liar, and that Draco, Xavior and Emma speak the truth in every one of their statements.\n\n2.  Xavior says (truthfully) \u201cI know the Switcher\u201d.  \n    The only roles that automatically identify the Switcher are Detective and Liar.  \n    Because the Liar is Carl / Ivy, Xavior must be the Detective.\n\n3.  Xavior also says (truthfully) \u201cDraco or June is Normal\u201d, so at least one of those two is the unique Normal.\n\n4.  Draco\u2019s two true sentences are\n        \u201cI know someone\u2019s role\u201d\n        \u201cI don\u2019t know the Detective.\u201d\n    Therefore Draco is neither Detective nor Liar, and not the Spy either (he says so truly).  \n    Draco can only be Normal, Cupid or Switcher.  \n    If he is Normal he can still \u201cknow someone\u2019s role\u201d provided Cupid paired him with that player; we keep that possibility open.\n\n5.  Emma is not Spy (Draco states this truly) and she herself truthfully says she does not know who the Spy is, so Emma is not Detective or Liar either.  Hence Emma is Normal, Cupid or Switcher.\n\n6.  Carl can no longer be the Liar (otherwise Ivy would be truthful, contradicting the hint), so Ivy is the Liar.  \n    Ivy\u2019s two statements must therefore be false:\n\n        \u2011 \u201cI wasn\u2019t switched\u201d  \u2192  Ivy WAS switched.\n        \u2011 \u201cI\u2019m the Spy\u201d        \u2192  Ivy is NOT the Spy.\n\n7.  Because Ivy was switched, the Liar role must have belonged to the player she was swapped with, and after the swap passed to Ivy.  Thus the other swapped player was the original Liar.  Call that other player P.\n\n8.  Carl\u2019s first post-swap sentence is \u201cIvy is the Liar\u201d, which is true; therefore Carl is not the Liar now.  The simplest and consistent choice is that P = Carl; i.e. the Switcher exchanged Carl and Ivy right after June\u2019s first statement.  \n    Consequently\n        \u2022 before the switch:\u2003Carl = Liar,\u2003Ivy = R (some other role)  \n        \u2022 after  the switch:\u2003Carl = R,\u2003    Ivy = Liar.\n\n    Because the Switcher may not swap themself, R cannot be the role \u201cSwitcher\u201d.\n\n9.

{"ID": 37, "Question": "On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.\nOf the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.\nEach night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.\nNow, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes.

It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people.

If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people.

Everyone can count how many people are missing the next dawn. Therefore the fact \u201cno one left last night\u201d (or \u201cexactly N people left\u201d) is common knowledge every succeeding morning.\n\nStep 0: Why the guru\u2019s single sentence matters  \nBefore the guru speaks, each islander certainly sees many blue eyes (100 of them, or 99 if he himself is blue). But it is not common knowledge that at least one blue eye exists: an individual cannot rule out the (logically consistent) possibility that every eye he sees is brown and that he himself is the lone blue eye\u2014so perhaps nobody else sees any blue at all.  \nThe statement\n\n    \u201cI see a person with blue eyes.\u201d\n\nis made publicly by an always-truthful being. After it is uttered, the fact\n\n    (\u2203 x)(x has blue eyes)\n\nbecomes common knowledge. That is the crucial new ingredient that starts the inductive chain.\n\nThe induction, worked out completely\n\nBase case: k = 1  \nSuppose there is exactly one blue-eyed person, call him P.  \n\u2022 P looks around and sees 0 blue eyes.  \n\u2022 Everyone else (all brown-eyed) sees 1 blue eye (P).  \nWhen the guru says \u201cI see a person with blue eyes,\u201d P reasons:\n\n    \u201cIf my eyes were not blue, then nobody would have blue eyes at all.\n     Then the guru\u2019s statement would still be true (she sees no blue,\n     therefore her statement would be false!), but crucially every other\n     islander would see 0 blue eyes and would immediately know that he\n     himself must be the blue one. Because I see no blue eyes, that\n     hypothetical person cannot exist. Therefore I myself must be blue.\u201d\n\nSo P is absolutely certain of his own colour and leaves on the very first night.  \nEveryone else sees him leave and is unsurprised.\n\nConclusion for k = 1: the unique blue-eyed islander leaves on night 1.\n\nInductive hypothesis  \nAssume that for some integer k \u2265 1 the following is true:\n\n    If exactly k islanders have blue eyes, then all and only those k\n    blue-eyed islanders leave together on the k-th night, and nobody\n    leaves before.\n\nInductive step: prove the statement for k+1 blue-eyed islanders  \nNow place k+1 blue-eyed people on the island. Pick one of them, call her Q.  \n\u2022 Q sees k other blue eyes.  \n\u2022 Every brown-eyed person also sees k+1 blue eyes.  \n\u2022 Each of the other k blue-eyed people is in the symmetric position of Q.\n\nLogical reasoning carried out by Q (and similarly by every blue-eyed person):\n\n1. \u201cSuppose my own eyes are brown. Then there are exactly k blue-eyed people (the ones I see).  \n2. By the inductive hypothesis, those k people would all leave on night k.  \n3. Therefore, if nobody leaves on night k, my supposition must be wrong, and my eyes cannot be brown; they must be blue.\u201d\n\nWhat actually happens?  \n\u2022 Night 1, 2, \u2026, k: nobody leaves. (Every one of the k+1 blue-eyed people is waiting to see whether the \u2018k\u2019 case will occur.)  \n\u2022 Dawn of day k+1: everyone sees that nobody left. This fact becomes common knowledge.  \n\u2022 Each blue-eyed person now executes step 3 of the reasoning above and becomes certain that he/she is blue.  \n\u2022 That night (night k+1) all k+1 blue-eyed islanders leave simultaneously. No brown-eyed islander can ever deduce his own colour, so they stay forever.\n\nThus the statement is proven for k+1, completing the induction.\n\nApplying the result to the actual island (k = 100)  \nThere are 100 blue-eyed and 100 brown-eyed islanders.\n\n\u2022 Nights 1\u201399: nobody leaves.  \n\u2022 After dawn on day 100, every blue-eyed islander has observed ninety-nine consecutive days on which nobody left, deduces \u201cI must be blue,\u201d and is absolutely certain.  \n\u2022 Night 100: all 100 blue-eyed logicians confidently tell the captain \u201cMy eyes are blue\u201d and sail away.  \n\u2022 All 100 brown-eyed islanders remain behind forever; they never gain certainty about their own eye colour.\n\nAnswer\n\nFinal answer: On the 100-th night after the guru\u2019s announcement, all 100 blue-eyed islanders leave together; no one leaves earlier, and the 100 brown-eyed islanders never leave.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 41, "Question": "In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.\nHow many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)", "Hint": "The number of days depends on the number of red hats.", "Human Solution": "It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nHow this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nIf there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast.

E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.\nLet's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.\nIf I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.\nThis means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.\nThis leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6.

The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the five switches outside the room to the five machines inside.

The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.\nHe decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.\nCompany A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, \"Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.\"  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.

The r\u00f4le of Company A in the plan  \n\nCompany A serves as the Emperor\u2019s guaranteed fall-back: if the Emperor\nopts for choice (a) he fires B, keeps the partly finished material, and\nhands the project to A for its original $800 000 price.

Now examine the colouring BWW.  \n    Player A sees WW and therefore says gWW = W, yet his own colour is B, so\n    A is wrong.

Good: we still have two correct guesses \u2026 or do we?\n\n    But we already fixed gWB = B and gBW = B in the earlier steps, so when\n    the triple is WBW instead of BWB the two \u201cguaranteed\u2019\u2019 correct guesses\n    become impossible:\n\n\u2003\u2003WBW gives exactly the same three speeches as BWB,\n\u2003\u2003yet in WBW the hats are W B W,\n\u2003\u2003so only the middle player is correct, i.e. at most one correct guess.\n\nHence no strategy can ensure two correct guesses even for three people,\nlet alone for 500.

Clue 6: Q and S must vote differently on proposals 1, 2, 3.\n   They already differ on proposal 2 (Q=N, S=A).\n\n8. Proposal 3 has 4 AYEs and 1 NAY.\n   Quincy may not have NAY on two successive proposals (Clue 3),\n   and he is already NAY on proposal 2; therefore Q must be AYE on\n   proposal 3.  To differ from Q, S must be the lone NAY on proposal 3.\n\n   Thus proposal 3 votes: O=A, P=A, Q=A, R=A, S=N.\n\n9. Quincy must not be NAY on proposal 1 as that would put two successive\n   NAYs (1 and 2).  Hence on proposal 1 Q = AYE.\n   To differ from Quincy, S = NAY on proposal 1.\n\n   Since proposal 1 still needs exactly 1 AYE (the only remaining counts\n   are 0,1,5), that solitary AYE must be Quincy\u2019s, so\n   O, P, R are all NAY on proposal 1.\n   Therefore a1 = 1.\n\n10. Proposal 4 cannot have 0 AYEs because Rosina votes AYE there\n    (Clue 5).  The only unused counts left are 0 and 5, so\n    proposal 4 must have 5 AYEs, i.e. everybody votes AYE.\n    Consequently proposal 5 has the last remaining count, 0 AYEs,\n    so everybody votes NAY on proposal 5.\n\n11.

{"ID": 111, "Question": "Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.\nUnfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.\nBut in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.\nBut this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.\nBut the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.\nUnfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.\nLet's sum up the assumptions:\n1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.\n2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.\n3. The flower doesn't want to die.\n4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.\n5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.\n6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n7. The dog is rational.\n8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.\n9. The dog doesn't want to die.\n10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).\n11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.\n13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.\n14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.\n15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.\nSo now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?", "Hint": " 1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.\nHint 2:\nSince the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.", "Human Solution": "The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)\nBut why will the dog eat the flower?\n1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die\n2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.\n3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.\n4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.\n5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.\n6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.\n7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison\nOK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).\n8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous\n9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "We can regard what happens as a two-player game with perfect (common) rationality.\n\nA.

Hence for the flower the move P is strictly worse than NP whenever it anticipates that the dog will eat.\n\n3.  Backward (common-knowledge) reasoning\n\n\u2022   Suppose the dog intended to choose E.  \n    \u2013 The flower foresees that it will then be eaten regardless of its own choice.  \n    \u2013 Avoiding an unnecessary cost, it will choose NP rather than P.  \n\n    Therefore, if the dog chooses E, the dog can deduce that the outcome will be (E,NP) and it will certainly survive.\n\n\u2022   Suppose instead the dog intended to choose N.  \n    \u2013 Then the flower is safe without making poison; it will again select NP so as not to incur the cost \u03b5.  \n\n    Therefore, if the dog chooses N the outcome will be (N,NP) and the dog\u2019s survival probability remains \u00bd.\n\n4.  Comparing the dog\u2019s two possibilities\n\n     Expected utility if it eats        : 1\n     Expected utility if it does not eat: \u00bd\n\nSince 1 > \u00bd, a fully rational dog prefers to eat the flower.\n\n5.  Consistency check\n\nGiven that the dog in fact eats, the flower\u2019s optimal response really is \u201cdo not poison\u201d, so the strategy profile (Dog:E, Flower:NP) is a Nash equilibrium; no player has an incentive to deviate unilaterally.\n\nHence the unique prediction under the stated assumptions is that the dog eats the flower, the flower does not bother to produce poison, the virus is cured, and the dog survives.\n\nFinal answer: The dog will eat the flower, because it realizes the rational flower would not waste effort making poison when poisoning cannot save it from being eaten; therefore eating guarantees survival and is better than the 50 % chance obtained by not eating.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 126, "Question": "The rugby season may be over, but the wheeling and dealing is just reaching a high point. Recently, each of six teams acquired a different, valuable, player to beef up its roster. Each player specializes in a different position (one is a prop), and, coincidentally enough, each was acquired from a different one of the other teams. Each felt a pang of regret at leaving his former team, but is eagerly awaiting the first scrum of the season with his new mates. From the following clues, can you match each player with his position, new team and former team?\n1. The one from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets.\n2. The Mountaineers, Troopers and Typhoons signed the fullback, the player who left the Downers and Cowan, in some order.\n3. The Downers, Scarlets and Jets lost Tuitupou, the center and the player who signed with the Typhoons, in some order.\n4.

The assessor needed to be able to measure out gold dust in exact ounces, no fractions, for every number of ounces starting at 1.\nIf the assessor has four weights, what is the largest number of ounces of gold dust he can measure?\nNote: The answer is not 15 ounces", "Hint": "Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.", "Human Solution": "The maximum weight is 40 ounces.\nThe weights are powers of 3:  1 ounce, 3 ounces, 9 ounces, 27 ounces.\nExample:\n7 ounces \u2013 Plate A: 9 oz. and 1 oz. weights.   Plate B: 3 oz weight and gold\nIn any weighing, each weight can be placed in one of three ways: on the plate with the gold, on the plate without the gold, on the desk next to the balance. So given n weights, there are 3^n possible combinations.\nThrow out the case where all weights are on the table. That leaves 3^n \u2013 1 cases.\nHalf of those cases would weigh negative gold, so eliminate half of these.\nThus, the number of valid combinations for n weights is (3^n \u2013 1) / 2.\nFor four weights, (3^4 \u2013 1) / 2 = (81 \u2013 1) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "Let the four weights have integral masses  \n\n\u2003w\u2081 \u2264 w\u2082 \u2264 w\u2083 \u2264 w\u2084 ,\n\nand let S\u2096 = w\u2081 + \u2026 + w\u2096 be the total of the first k weights.  \nWhen we weigh an unknown mass G on a balance scale we may place each weight\n\n\u2003\u2022 on the same pan as G  \u2003\u2003(coefficient \u20131),  \n\u2003\u2022 on the opposite pan\u2003\u2003\u2003(coefficient +1), or  \n\u2003\u2022 not use it\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(coefficient 0).\n\nHence every positive integer that can be measured must be expressible as  \n\n\u2003G = \u03a3 a\u1d62 w\u1d62 ,\u2003\u2003a\u1d62 \u2208 { \u20131, 0, 1 }.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

What range do these weights cover?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWith the set {1, 3, 9, 27} every integer from \u201340 to +40 can be written in balanced ternary\n(a\u1d62 \u2208 {\u20131,0,1}).  \nConsequently every positive integer from 1 up to\n\n\u20031 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\ncan be weighed exactly.

Why 40 ounces is the absolute maximum\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nSuppose some other four\u2013weight set could measure every integer up to N > 40.\nWorking backwards with inequality (\u2605):\n\n\u2003w\u2081 = 1  \n\u2003w\u2082 \u2264 3  \n\u2003w\u2083 \u2264 9  \n\u2003w\u2084 \u2264 27,\n\nso N \u2264 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, contradicting N > 40.  \nHence no four\u2013weight set can reach past 40 ounces.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nTherefore the assessor, using four weights and allowing them to be placed on either\npan of the balance, can measure every whole-number amount of gold dust from 1 ounce\nup to, and no further than, 40 ounces.\n\nFinal answer: 40 ounces", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.\n**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.\n**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.\n**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.\n*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

Xander says \u201cRed and Callie beat Black\u201d, so Black must be below both Red (1st) and Callie\u2019s team (Blue, 2nd).  \n   Hence Black can only be 4th or 5th.

First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.\nNow let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.\nAnd that's that.

If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men.

And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.\nFact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son.

Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.\n2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.\n3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.\nSo now the question:\nWill that one sheep get eaten or not and why?", "Hint": "There are two hints.

Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.\nNow look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.\nSo now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.\nWe can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.\nYou can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "Step-by-step reasoning\n\n1.

Clue 5 : \u201cJustin married Mary.\u201d  \n    Married couples occur only in generations G (the two grandparents) and P (the two parental couples).  \n    Because one grandparent spot is already Martha, Justin and Mary must be one of the two parental couples in generation P.\n\n3.

Each prisoner will then simultaneously guess which of the two hat colors they have. If every one of them is right, or every one of them is wrong, they will all go free.

Impossible.  \nTherefore blue is the colour worn on four days: Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday.\n\nStep 3.  Build the timetable.\n\nBecause a colour may not be repeated on consecutive days,\n\n\u2003Tuesday may not contain B or K  \u2192  Tuesday uses two of {R,G,Y}.  \n\u2003Wednesday must contain B and not the Tuesday colours.  \n\u2003Thursday must contain G (given) and not Wednesday\u2019s colours.  \n\u2003Friday must contain B, must not contain Y (rule 6) and not Thursday\u2019s colours.  \n\u2003Saturday must not contain B or any colour used on Friday.  \n\u2003Sunday must contain B and avoid Saturday\u2019s colours.\n\nA consistent completion is found as follows:\n\nMonday     B K     (given)  \nTuesday    R G     (no B,K)  \nWednesday  B Y     (B plus a new colour)  \nThursday   G K     (contains G, avoids B,Y)  \nFriday     B R     (contains B, no Y, no G,K)  \nSaturday   Y K     (avoids B,R; new pair)  \nSunday     B G     (contains B, avoids Y,K)\n\nChecks:\n\u2022 No pair repeats.  \n\u2022 No colour appears on consecutive days.  \n\u2022 Blue appears on exactly four days.  \n\u2022 All given day\u2013by\u2013day conditions are met, and R is never paired with K.\n\nStep 4.  Uniqueness of Saturday\u2019s colours.\n\nTrying any other choice on Tuesday or Thursday leads to a contradiction with one of the rules, so the above schedule is the only possible one.

Similarly, if the first leading suit was a spade, the high suit could only have been a diamond, and if the leading suit was a diamond, the high suit could only have been a heart or a spade.\nIf the first leading suit was a heart, the second trick was led by either Paul or Ringo, and the leading suit had to be a spade.

The \u201cleap-frog\u201d walkway  \n   \u2022 Carlo begins just inside the door, places Plank A on the carpet perpendicular to the wires.  \n   \u2022 He steps onto its near end.  \n   \u2022 He now reaches forward and puts Plank B on the carpet, again perpendicular to the wires and overlapping the first plank a little.  \n   \u2022 He walks onto Plank B, picks up Plank A, moves it ahead of Plank B, and so on.  \n   \u2022 In this leap-frog manner he advances the 7.5 m from the doorway to the pedestal in the centre of the 15 m room.  \n   \u2022 At every stage his weight is on one plank only, and that plank is always resting on at least 31 wires, so no single wire is loaded with more than 4 kg.\n\n5. What the other items are for  \n   \u2022 If he wants additional safety he can pass one of the 2-m leather straps forward first; a strap laid cross-wise spans  \n         2 m \u00f7 0.08 m \u2248 25 wires  \n     and carries only 74 kg \u00f7 25 \u2248 3 kg per wire.  The strap can serve as a temporary bridge while he rearranges a plank.  \n   \u2022 The hammer is used at the end to break the glass cube, and the remaining straps let him tie the diamond to his body for the trip back.  \n\n6. Return trip  \n   He retreats exactly the way he came\u2014lay a plank, step on it, move the other plank forward\u2014never putting more than 2.4 kg on any wire.\n\nBecause at every instant each wire carries well under the 4 kg limit, the floor alarm is never triggered and Carlo can walk to the pedestal, take the diamond, and leave undetected.\n\nFinal answer: Carlo saws the 5-m 2 \u00d7 4 into two 2.5-m planks, lays the planks one at a time perpendicular to the alarm wires, and \u201cleap-frogs\u201d them across the room. Each plank rests on about 31 wires, so no wire bears more than about 2.4 kg of his 74 kg weight. In this way he reaches the diamond (and returns) without any wire ever receiving the 4 kg needed to set off the alarm.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.\no+8o=9o.\nSo 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even.
