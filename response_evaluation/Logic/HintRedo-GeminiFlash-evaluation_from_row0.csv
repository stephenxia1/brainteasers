0,"Question: It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

The game of American football is not a collegiate sport outside the United States; the player that passes the ball is the quarterback; there are more than forty players on a football team.
Water polo is a game played in a pool with 7 players on each team; points are scored by throwing the ball into the opponents net, which is guarded by the goal keeper; the ball is moved across the pool either by swimming with it or passing it to another player.
Ivy League schools are located on the East Coast of the United States.  Harvard, Yale and Princeton are all Ivy League schools.
Oxford University is in Oxford, England.
Tokyo University is in Tokyo, Japan.

1,"Question: The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'
""If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.""
*note - the only difference from Scenario B, the original position of the 2 switches are known.
 Hint: Assuming that:
A) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.
B) There is no restriction on the number of time each prisoner can visit the switch room
C) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.","Assuming that:

2.        When a transmitter enter the switch room for the first time, he will flick switch B ON if he sees it in the OFF position.

The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.
3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.

8) 24 is a multiple of 8.
9) 80 is a multiple of 10.
10) 19, 43, and 05 are prime numbers.
A) The sum of digits 0 through 9 is 45.  To satisfy Conditions 1 and 2, a pair of multiples must equal 45.  The only pair that satisfies those conditions are 30 (multiple of 6) and 15 (multiple of 5).  Likewise, to satisfy Conditions 3 and 4, the pair of multiples must be 27 (multiple of 9) and 18 (multiple of 2).
B) Make lists of the multiples of 3, 4, 7, 8, and 10 (for Conditions 5 through 9).  Delete multiples whose digits are the same (33, 44, 66, 77, 88, 99).
C) To satisfy Condition 9, J must be 0.  Delete multiples that require 0 in a different location.  For JA to be prime (Condition 10), A must be: 2, 3, 5, or 7.  Delete multiples of 3 that have another digit for A.
D) For FE and HC to be prime (Condition 10), C and E can not be even or 5.  Delete multiples of 4 and 7 that have another digit for C and E.
E) Per Condition 4, B + D + F + H + J = 18.  D, H, and J must be even (required to form multiples of even numbers).  To attain the sum of 18 (an even number), B and F must either be both odd or both even.  If both are even, then the sum of those five digits would be 20.  B and F must be odd.  Delete multiples of 3 and 7 that have an even digit for B and F.  The only remaining multiple of 7 is 91.  E is 9 and F is 1.  Delete multiples that require 1 or 9 in a different location.
F) The only remaining options for AB contain 7.  Delete multiples that require 7 in a different location.  The only remaining options for CD contain 3.  Delete multiples that require 3 in a different location.

D) For D, only four numbers are still valid: 1, 2, 4, and 8.  Plug each of these numbers into D and check the resulting flow of equations.  If D = 1, then the resulting flow will lead to J having to be both 4 and 0.  If D = 2, then the resulting flow will lead to 2 also being assigned to G.

4,"Question: Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?
 Hint: It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0
5,"Question: I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?
 Hint: The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):
X X Q X A
X X X H X
At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):
K J Q T A
X D X H X
Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

6,"Question: Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.
After dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.
In this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.
Can you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?
Players: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon
Races: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre
Occupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief
Weapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace
Monsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs
Skill levels: range from 10-32
Clues:
1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.
2. The paladin isn't an elf.
3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.
4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.
5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.
6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.
7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).
8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.
9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.
10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.
11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.
 Hint: Start by determining the 5 skill levels.",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,"Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0
7,"Question: Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?
 Hint: Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0
8,"Question: Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.

With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. (5)
He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st.
Humpback is 21st. (2)
Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. (5)
Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)
First day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.
15th then is Bottle.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).
Mouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.
Dolly is 14th or 15th.
Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)
Mayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.
Stonefly is 15th.
Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.
At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)
Stonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.
Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)
Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.

After saying the password, Spy IQ entered the secret lair and found useful gadgets, including Instant Tile Camouflage.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the reasoning to solve the password riddle:

Step 1: Analyze the problem description and the hint.
The problem states that Spy IQ needs a password and the clue is on a strange postcard. The hint specifically directs attention to the P.S. section of the postcard, suggesting it contains a secret message. The provided modified P.S. with capitalized first letters is a strong indicator of how to extract this message.

Step 2: Extract the hidden message from the P.S.
The P.S. is given as:
""Isaac Newton:
Near Orange Bags Lying East.
Gets As Strange Equally Slowly.""

The capitalization of the first letter of each word in the two sentences (as shown in the hint's slightly modified version) is a classic riddle technique for extracting a message. Let's take the first letter of each capitalized word:
From ""Near Orange Bags Lying East"": N, O, B, L, E
From ""Gets As Strange Equally Slowly"": G, A, S, E, S

Step 3: Combine the extracted letters.
Putting these letters together in order yields the phrase: N O B L E G A S E S, which spells ""NOBLE GASES"". This is the secret message hidden in the P.S.

Step 4: Understand the meaning of the secret message.
""Noble Gases"" refers to a group of chemical elements in the periodic table (Group 18): Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), Radon (Rn), and Oganesson (Og). These elements are known for their low chemical reactivity, often referred to as being inert.

Step 5: Search for further clues within the postcard that point to a specific noble gas as the password.
The password is likely one of the noble gases or something related to them. Let's re-examine the P.S. sentences and the main body of the postcard.

Step 6: Examine the P.S. sentences for additional clues.
The first sentence is ""Near Orange Bags Lying East."" The word ""Orange"" is prominent. Neon is famously used in ""Neon signs"" which glow with a reddish-orange light when an electric current is passed through the gas. This provides a strong connection between ""Orange"" and Neon.

Step 7: Consider the attribution ""Isaac Newton:"" in the P.S.
Isaac Newton was a celebrated scientist known for his work on optics and the study of light and color. He demonstrated that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors (ROYGBIV). The use of Neon to produce specific colors of light (particularly orange-red) aligns with Newton's area of study, reinforcing the connection to Neon.

Step 8: Examine the main body of the postcard for supporting clues.
The main body tells a story about a niece and ends with the sentence: ""She always shows a lot of toughness."" The concept of ""toughness"" can be related to the chemical property of noble gases. Noble gases are chemically inert, meaning they are resistant to reacting with other elements. This lack of reactivity can be described as chemical ""toughness"". This clue supports the idea that the password is a noble gas.

Step 9: Synthesize the converging clues.
The P.S. reveals the category ""NOBLE GASES"". Within the P.S., the word ""Orange"" and the name ""Isaac Newton"" (associated with light and color) strongly point towards Neon, which is known for its orange-red light in signs and its connection to the study of light. The main body adds the concept of ""toughness"", which describes the chemical inertness characteristic of all noble gases, including Neon.

Step 10: Conclude the password.
Based on the overwhelming evidence pointing towards Neon from multiple parts of the riddle (P.S. first letters, word ""Orange"" in P.S., ""Isaac Newton"" attribution, and ""toughness"" in the main body), the password is the name of this noble gas.

The password is NEON.

The final answer is $\boxed{NEON}$.",True,0,0,0

11,"Question: Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?
 Hint: Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ",Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.
Summary:
Tomatoes, Five, 27th, North
Peppers, Three, 28th, South
Radishes, Four, 25th, East
Lettuce, one, 29th, West
Broccoli, two, 30th, Northwest",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0
12,"Question: You are given a stack of bingo cards.  Your task is to find a specific card.  Given the following clues, what is the number arrangement of that card?
Columns, left to right, are: B (contains numbers 1 through 15), I (contains numbers 16 through 30), N (contains numbers 31 through 45), G (contains numbers 46 through 60), O (contains numbers 61 through 75).  Rows, top to bottom, are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  An example of coordinate nomenclature: B1 identifies column B row 1.  N3 is a free space (contains no number).  No number appears more than once.
1) Each numeral (0 through 9) appears one time in Row 1.
2) The sum of the numbers in Row 4 is a square number.
3) There is only one two-digit prime number in each row.
4) The range of the numbers in Column N is 8.

1) Per clue 5, eliminate the appropriate numbers in Column G.  Of the remaining numbers, at least one with a tens digit of 5 will have to be used.  Per clues 1 and 11, only one number can have the numeral 5, so that number must be at G1.  Eliminate all numbers that contain a 5 from all other locations.
2) Per clue 6, eliminate all even numbers from Column O.
3) Per clue 1, eliminate any number from Row 1 with only one digit or duplicate digits.  By analyzing combinations of numbers, the following can be determined: B1 contains a 1, delete 30, I1 contains a 2, delete 23, delete 63 and 73, O1 contains a 6.  In conjunction with clue 3, delete 29 and 59.
4) Per clue 10, analyze the various possible sums of Columns G and O.  The only common prime factor is 31.  Each column must sum to a multiple of 31 (based on available numbers: B to 31, I to 124, N to 155, G to 248, and O to 341).  G1 must be 58.  All two-digit prime numbers (clue 3) must be in Columns G and O.  O1 must be 67.  Per clue 1, N1 must be 39.  Per clue 9, G5 must be 46 and O5 must be 61.
5) For Column N, there is only set of numbers that sums to 155, and satisfies clues 4, 8, and 9 (34, 39, 40, 42).  N5 must be 34.
6) For Column I, there are two sets of numbers that sum to 124, and satisfy clues 8 and 9 (16, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 20, 22, 24, 28, 30).  To satisfy clue 1, I1 must be 24.  B1 must be 10.  To satisfy clue 12, G4 must be 48 and B5 must be odd.
7) The column that satisfies clue 7 is Column B.  To satisfy clue 8, B2 must be 9 and B5 must be 1.
8) To satisfy clue 2, the only square number that can be achieved is 196.  B4 must be 3, I4 must be 30, N4 must be 42, and O4 must be 73.
9) B3 must be 8.  N2 must be 40.
10) To satisfy clue 13, O3 must be 69.  This leaves O2 being 71.  To satisfy clue 3, G3 must be 47.  This leaves G2 being 49.
11) To satisfy clue 14, I3 must be 22.  Finally, to achieve a sum of 124 (multiple of 31), I2 must be 28 and I5 must be 20.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0
13,"Question: There is a ten digit mystery number (no leading 0), represented by ABCDEFGHIJ, where each numeral, 0 through 9, is used once.  Given the following clues, what is the number?
1) If A > B, then C = 5 or 7, else C = 0 or 1.
2) If B > C, then D = 1 or 2, else D = 4 or 9.
3) If C > D, then E = 6 or 9, else E = 3 or 5.
4) If D > E, then F = 2 or 4, else F = 1 or 6.
5) If E > F, then G = 5 or 6, else G = 0 or 7.

Brute force methods can be used to arrive at a solution.  However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.  Continue eliminating possibilities in the order shown below.
A) H can not be 8.  C can not be 1.  C can not be 0.  B can not be 9.  D can not be 1.  D can not be 2.  F can not be 1.

5th House: White, Swede, Beer, Dogs, Bluemasters",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, I can definitely solve this riddle using a step-by-step logical deduction process, following the hint to take my time and pay attention to detail.

The riddle provides 5 houses in a row, and for each house, there's a unique color, nationality, beverage, cigar brand, and pet. No two houses share any of these attributes. I need to use the clues to fill in a grid representing the 5 houses. Let's label the houses 1 through 5 from left to right.

Here is the information we need to track for each house:
*   House Number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
*   Color (Red, Green, White, Yellow, Blue)
*   Nationality (Brit, Swede, Dane, Norwegian, German)
*   Beverage (Tea, Coffee, Milk, Water, Beer)
*   Cigar (Pall Mall, Dunhill, Blends, Bluemasters, Prince)
*   Pet (Dogs, Birds, Cats, Horse, Fish)

I will go through the clues and place information directly or note relationships.

1.  The Brit lives in the red house. (Brit - Red)
2.  The Swede keeps dogs as pets. (Swede - Dogs)
3.  The Dane drinks tea. (Dane - Tea)
4.  The green house is on the immediate left of the white house. (Green is House N, White is House N+1)
5.  The green house's owner drinks coffee. (Green - Coffee) - Combined with 4: House N is Green and drinks Coffee, House N+1 is White.
6.  The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds. (Pall Mall - Birds)
7.  The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill. (Yellow - Dunhill)
8.  The owner living in the center house drinks milk. The center house is House 3.
    *   House 3: Beverage = Milk
9.  The Norwegian lives in the first house. The first house is House 1.
    *   House 1: Nationality = Norwegian
10. The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats. (Blends is neighbor of Cats)
11. The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill. (Horse is neighbor of Dunhill)
12. The owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer. (Bluemasters - Beer)
13. The German smokes Prince. (German - Prince)
14. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house. The Norwegian is in House 1. The house next to House 1 is House 2.
    *   House 2: Color = Blue
15. The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who drinks water. (Blends is neighbor of Water)

Let's start filling the grid based on these direct placements and deductions:

| House | Color | Nationality | Beverage | Cigar | Pet |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------|-------|-----|
| 1     |       | Norwegian   |          |       |     |
| 2     | Blue  |             |          |       |     |

| 5     |       |             |          |       |     |

Now let's use Clue 4 and 5: (Green - Coffee) house is immediately left of White house. The possible pairs for (Green, White) are (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5).
*   Cannot be (1,2) because House 2 is Blue.
*   Cannot be (2,3) because House 2 is Blue and House 3 drinks Milk (Clue 5 says Green drinks Coffee).
*   Cannot be (3,4) because House 3 drinks Milk (Clue 5 says Green drinks Coffee).
*   It must be (4,5). So, House 4 is Green and House 5 is White. Also, House 4 drinks Coffee (Clue 5).

| 5     | White |             |          |       |     |

We have placed Blue, Green, White colors. The remaining colors are Red and Yellow. The remaining houses for these colors are 1 and 3.
*   Clue 1 says the Brit lives in the Red house. So, (Brit - Red).
*   Clue 9 says the Norwegian is in House 1. So, the Brit cannot be in House 1.
*   Therefore, the Brit must be in House 3, which is the Red house.
    *   House 3: Nationality = Brit, Color = Red.

| 5     | White |             |          |       |     |

The only remaining color is Yellow, and the only remaining house without a color is House 1.

| 5     | White |             |          |       |     |

Now apply Clue 7: The owner of the yellow house (House 1) smokes Dunhill.
*   House 1: Cigar = Dunhill.

| 4     | Green |             | Coffee   |         |     |
| 5     | White |             |          |         |     |

Apply Clue 11: The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill (House 1). The house next to House 1 is House 2.
*   House 2: Pet = Horse.

| House | Color | Nationality | Beverage | Cigar   | Pet   |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------|---------|-------|
| 1     | Yellow| Norwegian   |          | Dunhill |       |
| 2     | Blue  |             |          |         | Horse |
| 3     | Red   | Brit        | Milk     |         |       |
| 4     | Green |             | Coffee   |         |       |
| 5     | White |             |          |         |       |

Now consider Clue 12 (Bluemasters - Beer) and Clue 3 (Dane - Tea). These pairs must go into different houses that don't already have a beverage or cigar/nationality assigned that conflicts.
*   House 1: Has Dunhill (Cigar).
*   House 2: Has Horse (Pet).
*   House 3: Has Milk (Beverage) and Brit (Nationality).
*   House 4: Has Green (Color) and Coffee (Beverage).
*   House 5: Has White (Color).

Possible houses for (Bluemasters - Beer): Houses 2 and 5 (they are the only ones without an assigned beverage or cigar that conflicts).
Possible houses for (Dane - Tea): Houses 2 and 5 (they are the only ones without an assigned nationality or beverage that conflicts).

If (Bluemasters - Beer) is in House 2, then House 2 drinks Beer and smokes Bluemasters.
If (Dane - Tea) is in House 2, then House 2 is Dane and drinks Tea.
These cannot both be true for House 2.

So, one pair goes in House 2 and the other in House 5.
Let's place (Dane - Tea) in House 2.
*   House 2: Nationality = Dane, Beverage = Tea.

| House | Color | Nationality | Beverage | Cigar   | Pet   |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------|---------|-------|
| 1     | Yellow| Norwegian   |          | Dunhill |       |
| 2     | Blue  | Dane        | Tea      |         | Horse |
| 3     | Red   | Brit        | Milk     |         |       |
| 4     | Green |             | Coffee   |         |       |
| 5     | White |             |          |         |       |

Then (Bluemasters - Beer) must go in House 5.
*   House 5: Beverage = Beer, Cigar = Bluemasters.

*   Where can Prince go? House 2, 3, or 4.
*   Where can German go? House 4 or 5.
*   If German is in House 5, House 5 smokes Prince. But House 5 smokes Bluemasters. So German cannot be in House 5.
*   Therefore, the German must be in House 4.

16,"Question: The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.
 Hint: In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.
The last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.
The last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.","From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).
In summary:
Bart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Jason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.
Roger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat Lila Peach by a Patrol Boat.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

Assume that, typically:  animals have 1 head, snakes have 0 legs, birds have 2 legs, mammals have 4 legs, insects have 6 legs, and spiders have 8 legs.  Zachary has some unusual animals in his zoo.  He has:  a snake with 3 heads, a bird with 2 heads, a mammal with 3 legs, an insect with 4 legs, and a spider with 7 legs.

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.
((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds
((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds
((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds
Of the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.
13, 19, 20, 22, 23 (13 insects & 19 birds)

15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,1
20,"Question: The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.
The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?
 Hint: Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.
Mr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

22,"Question: The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.
 Hint: 1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%.

The answer ""white"" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.
Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1.

23,"Question: ""Congratulations, Great-Aunt Nora!""  The voice of Victor Summ, her eldest nephew, was tired, but exultant.  Her older sister was the first grandparent among the five Shekrie siblings.
""Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.""  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.
Nora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  ""You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?""
""Cogita's doing great, although we had a bit of a shuffle in the maternity ward.  Hi, Professor diNoni -- you'll love this one.""
""Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.""
""It runs in the family,"" he smiled across two time zones.  ""Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ..."" Vic's voice trailed off.
""Except for one interval?""  Corman filled in.
""Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.""
Nora yelped.  ""You had *eleven*,"" then her left brain caught up, ""no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.""
""De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.""
""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!""
""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.""
He took a cleansing breath.  ""On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?""
""I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?""
Vic broke in, ""He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.""
Corman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  ""Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?""
""Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.""
""Got it.""  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.  Can you do the same?

If you need help, search for ""Optimal Rulers"".","There is only one way (plus a mirror-image reflection) to arrange ten different intervals in a span of 11 ten-minute units.

The missing interval is one hour.
Method:
Number the ten time points from 0 to 11 (6:00 to 7:50).  The only ways to arrange them to get ten different intervals for the births are events at points 0, 1, 4, 9, and 11 and the reverse: 11, 10, 7, 2, and 0.  The clue gives three birth times at 6:00, 6:10, and 7:50, so we have the first arrangement.
The clues about alphabetic and reverse-alphabetic order giving five wrong placements mean that Caleb and Derek were not born 2nd, 3rd, or 4th; Adele and Elena were not born first or last, and Brand was not born 2nd or 4th.
The 50-minute interval given at the end means puts Brand and Elena into the 3rd & 4th spots, which leaves 2nd as the place for Adele.
Finally, we have Caleb and Derec to fill the first and last spots.  Caleb and Nora share a birth position.  The first paragraph mentions that Cogita is Nora's older sister, so Caleb cannot be the firstborn.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0
24,"Question: Seven horses in a farm in Kentucky,
Of three blacks, the oldest is a daddy;
Of two browns, the 3 year old male is called BILLY,
And the horse SNOWY is white as a lily.
Of two half-sister mares, the black won in the Derby,
She's a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY;
BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie,
But faster than either ROCKY or SUNNY.
Three of the horses are ready for the Derby,
A horse must be three years to be an entry;
Maybe this year the farm gets lucky,
Their stallion's loss last year was a pity.
CHALLENGE: Describe the horse that lost in last year's Derby.
 Hint: For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.
The Derby is for three year old horses. Therefore only a current four year old horse could have lost last year.
SNOWY is the only horse which could have been three last year (four this year).
The farm is preparing three of the seven horses for this years Derby. There must therefore be at least three 3-year old horses among the seven. BILLY is 3-years old. Necessarily, BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY must be 3 years old both. (They are of the same age).
Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year. This would mean that no horse would be four years old as BEAUTY and LUCKY would be one and a half years old. BEAUTY's mom won in the DERBY as a three year old, she could not win and lose at the same time. (The riddle suggests that the farm did not win last year so the mom must be over 5 years old).
In sum, if BILLY, BEAUTY, and LUCKY are three years old, their aunt must be six. BEAUTY's mom must be five or more. The oldest black must be older than the black mom. Only SNOWY could be four this year.
SNOWY is white (given), 4 years as deduced, and male from the fact that it was a stallion which lost last year.
The names of BEAUTY's mom and aunt and that of the oldest black are immaterial. The same is true with the color of lucky.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

For the product of two numbers to be a prime number (clue #5), one of those two numbers must be 1.  Therefore, either C or H must be 1.
To achieve the required proportion (clue #6), the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations:  931 or 421 or 842.
If [AGC] = 842, then D would have to be 1 (clue #1).  Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.
If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.  Therefore, A = 4 and G = 2.
Since G = 2, then J = 8 (clue #2).  J can not be 1 or 4, since those two numerals are now assigned.
The only remaining letters that can be assigned to 6 are B and I.  D can not be 6, as it would not produce a square number (clue #1).  Neither E nor F can be 6, since that would not produce an odd number (clue #4). H can not be 6, as it would not produce a prime number (clue #5).  Since either B or I must be 6, then 6 must be paired with 0 (clue #3), as the other even numerals have now been assigned.
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then D = 5 (clue #1).
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then E and H must also be separated by 6 (clue #7).  The only remaining numerals that satisfy this requirement are 3 and 9.  This means that F = 7.  This sets H = 3 and  E = 9, which then sets B = 6 and I = 0.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

1: M
2: A
3: N
4: G
5: O
The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.
1: M, C, T
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D, I
The J and B of JABOT must be on pyramids 3 and 4, but the B cannot be with the E, or else one cannot spell BELOW. Also, the W must be on pyramid 1.

3: N, H, F, B
4: G, E, Y, J

The Q cannot be on the same pyramid as the I, in order to spell QUICK, so it is also on pyramid 2. The S cannot be on the same pyramid as the E (QUEST), so is therefore on pyramid 5, and the K is the last letter on pyramid 4.

Switcher - Switches 2 roles after the first statement (cannot switch themselves)
Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)
Spy - Knows who was switched
The following 16 statements were made:
Carl is not Cupid - June
Ivy is the Liar - Carl
I know someone's role - Draco
I know the Switcher - Xavior
Ivy is not Normal - Emma
I wasn't switched - Ivy

Explanation:
Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar
Step 3: Emma is paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June
Step 4: Emma isn't the Cupid or Normal
""Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)""
Cupid can't pair themselves
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Emma can't be Normal
Step 5: Emma isn't the Detective or Spy:
""I don't know the Spy - Emma""
If Emma was the Detective or Spy, then Emma would know the Spy

The four make the statements below.  In total, six statements are true and six false.

There are four suspects: A, B, C, and D. One of them is the car thief.
There are a total of 12 statements (3 from each suspect).
Exactly 6 statements are true, and exactly 6 statements are false.

Let's write down the statements:
Suspect A:
A1: C and I (A) have met many times before today.
A2: B is guilty.
A3: The car thief did not know it was the Inspector's car.

Suspect B:
B1: D did not do it.
B2: D's third statement (D3) is false.
B3: I (B) am innocent.

Suspect C:
C1: I (C) have never met A before today.
C2: B is not guilty.
C3: D knows how to drive.

Suspect D:
D1: B's first statement (B1) is false.
D2: I (D) do not know how to drive.
D3: A did it.

First, let's evaluate statement A3. The problem description says, ""A car thief, who had managed to evade the authorities in the past, unknowingly took the automobile that belonged to Inspector Detweiler."" This means the car thief did not know it was the Inspector's car.
Statement A3 says: The car thief did not know it was the Inspector's car.
This statement is a factual description provided in the problem text, so it is TRUE.
A3 is TRUE.

Now, let's use the hint. The hint points out contradictory statements.
Pair 1: A1 and C1.
A1: C and A have met.
C1: C and A have never met.
These statements are direct contradictions. Thus, one is TRUE and the other is FALSE.

Pair 2: C3 and D2.
C3: D knows how to drive.
D2: D does not know how to drive.
These statements are direct contradictions. Thus, one is TRUE and the other is FALSE.

There are 12 statements in total, with 6 True and 6 False.
From Pair 1 {A1, C1}, we have 1 True and 1 False statement.
From Pair 2 {C3, D2}, we have 1 True and 1 False statement.
So, among these 4 statements {A1, C1, C3, D2}, there are 2 True and 2 False statements.

The remaining 12 - 4 = 8 statements are {A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C2, D1, D3}.
Since there are 6 True statements in total, and we've found 2 True statements among {A1, C1, C3, D2}, the remaining 8 statements must contain 6 - 2 = 4 True statements.
Since there are 6 False statements in total, and we've found 2 False statements among {A1, C1, C3, D2}, the remaining 8 statements must contain 6 - 2 = 4 False statements.
So, among the 8 statements {A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C2, D1, D3}, there are exactly 4 True and 4 False statements.

We already know that A3 is TRUE.
So, among the remaining 7 statements {A2, B1, B2, B3, C2, D1, D3}, there must be 4 - 1 = 3 True statements and 4 - 0 = 4 False statements.

Let's analyze the relationships within this set of 7 statements and evaluate their truth values based on who the thief is.
The statements are about who is guilty or innocent, or refer to the truth value of other statements in this set.
A2: B is guilty.
B3: B is innocent (equivalent to B is not guilty).
C2: B is not guilty.
So, B3 and C2 have the same truth value, and A2 has the opposite truth value of B3 and C2.
If B is guilty, A2 is T, B3 is F, C2 is F (1 T, 2 F).
If B is innocent, A2 is F, B3 is T, C2 is T (2 T, 1 F).

D3: A did it.

32,"Question: These five businessmen represented different companies at a recent trade fair. Unfortunately, the hotel they were all due to stay in had accidentally double booked their rooms. They tried other hotels in the area, but all were fully booked. Consequently, they all agreed to share the only two rooms available in the hotel - one twin and one triple.
From the clues, can you work out each man's name, company and official title?
1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.
2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.
3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.
4. The businessman from Reed Right did not share a room with Thomas.
5. Clarkson, who does not work for Lantel, shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi but not both.
6. Edgar's surname is either Casson or Graves. Edgar did not share with Carl.
7. The businessman from Chiptech shared with the businessman from Lantel.
8. The CEO shared with the IT Analyst.
9. Casson works for either Blue Teeth or Chiptech.
10. Neither Joshua nor Alan works for ABM Inc.
11. Fielder shared with the Director.
12. The Accountant from Blue Teeth shared with the Developer.
First names: Alan, Carl, Edgar, Joshua, Thomas.
Last names: Casson, Clarkson, Fielder, Graves, Grimaldi.
Company: ABM Inc., Blue Teeth, Chiptech, Lantel, Reed
 Hint: To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom","To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom","First Name, Last Name, Company, Position:
Carl Grimaldi, ABM Inc., IT Analyst
Edgar Casson, Chiptech, Director
Joshua Graves, Reed Right, CEO
Alan Clarkson, Blue Teeth, Accountant
Thomas Fielder, Lantel, Developer
To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom. Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:
Room 1
CEO
IT Analyst
ABM delegate
Grimaldi
Carl
Reed Right delegate
Room 2
Edgar
Developer
Thomas
Clarkson
Since the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.
Now this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:
The CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth. Since he is not the Developer (12) he must be the Accountant. This leaves Thomas Fielder who is the Developer for Lantel.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

34,"Question: Patrice and seven of her friends organized the Ultimate Table Tennis Challenge to determine who the best Ping-Pong player among them was. The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.
1. The winner of the match at the Southville YMCA lost at least three games on the indoor table in Uncle Phil's basement before meeting McNeilly in the finals.
2. The first round opponent of the eventual champion was neither Fitzroy (who lost in the first round) nor the person who lost at the Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy.
3. The championship round took the maximum possible number of games in a match.
4. The seven matches, in some order, were: Jamie's first round victory, the match in which White won exactly 2 games, the match at Eastlake Municipal Park, the match that Lottie lost, the only match Diaz played, the match Toskhaya lost and the match in which somebody won exactly one game.
5. Bill never played Dave.
6. Averson didn't play Jamie in the first round.
7. A total of 55 games were played in the whole challenge, 30 of which were the first round matches.
8. McNeilly, who isn't Lottie or Kristin, never played Samuel or Gianelli.
9. The four who advanced to the second round were: White, Lottie, the person who played Regina in the first round and someone whose indoor match was at the Islip Town Hall.
10. McNeilly's opponent in the first round won more games than Diaz.
11. Kristin never played at the Southville YMCA.
12. Regina won more games than the person eliminated at Eastlake Municipal Park.
13. Kristin won more games than Bill, who won at least five.

The final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).
There were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.
This leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.
This means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).
From clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.
Islip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.
From clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).
White is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.
From clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.
From clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.
Since Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.
Lottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.
In the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.
From clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.
From clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.
Regina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.
Regina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.
Kristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.
Lottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.
Lottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).
Bills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

37,"Question: On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""

They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people.

 Hint: When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear. Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear. Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.  Here's how to do it:
First drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.
If the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.
If the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.
Keep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks. If it breaks on the xth dropping you will only need at most 14-x more droppings with the second ball to find the breaking point. By the 11th dropping of the first ball, if you get that far, you will have reached the 99th floor.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0
39,"Question: Every year during his birthday, the Sultan sponsors 3 camel races with the following prizes (listed in order 1st, 2nd, 3rd):
RACE A
$500
300
100
RACE B
$250
150
75
RACE C
$150
100
50
$500 bonus for winning all 3 Races. (SLAM)
$200 bonus for winning 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in any one Race (SWEEP).
ALI BOBO tells you that he owns the 3rd (""Aluminum""), 6th(""Boron""), and 9th(""Copper"") fastest camels. He concedes that KAREEM owns the 1st, 4th, and 7th fastest camels, while SHARIF has the 2nd, 5th, and 8th fastest entries. There are other owners but with far inferior camels.
The Rules
a. Maximum 3 camels per owner.
b. A camel can run only in one race.
c. An owner may enter his camels all in one race or distribute them as he desires.
Last year ALI BOBO's camels won third place in each of the 3 Races. His gross winnings amounted to $225.
ALI BOBO wants a risk-free strategy to increase his total winnings.
QUESTION: What should be ALI BOBO's strategy?
 Hint: Sometimes we must sacrifice some battles to win the war.",Sometimes we must sacrifice some battles to win the war.,"Ali Bobo must enter Copper in Race A, Aluminum in Race B, and Boron in Race C.
SCENARIOS
1. Kareem defends his Slam and fields his camels in RACES A,B, and C according to their speed. Shariff follows that same strategy.
ALI's Aluminum will win in Race B over the K(4th) and S(5th). Boron will win in Race C over K(7th) and S(8th). Copper will still place 3rd in Race A. Total Winnings $500.
2. Kareem defends his SLAM. Shariff follows Ali's strategy.
Aluminum will place second to S(2nd) in Race B. Boron will place second to S(5th) in Race C. Copper will place third to K(1st) and S(8th). Total winnings: $350.
3. Kareem loses his mind and does not go for the grand slam. He enters his 3 camels in Race A. Shariff follows his strategy in Scenario 1.
Copper will not win anything in Race A. Aluminum will win in Race B. Boron will win in Race C. Winnings: $400.
4. Same as Scenario 3 but Shariff has same strategy as Ali.
Copper loses in Race A. Aluminum places second in Race B. Boron places second in Race C. Winnings $250.
5. Kareem camels all in Race A. Shariff's all in race B.
Copper loses in Race A. Aluminum still places second in Race B. Boron wins in Race C. Winnings $300.
6. Kareem defends his slam. Shariff camels all in race B.
Copper will place second in Race A. Aluminum will still be second in Race B. Boron will win over K(7th) Winnings:$600.
7. Kareem and Shariff has same strategy as Ali.
Copper will be third, Aluminum will be third. Boron will be third. Winnings:$225. Same as last year.
There are other scenarios but with the strategy with the worst case scenario for Ali is $225.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step, applying logical reasoning and considering the hint.

1.  **Understand Ali Bobo's Situation:**
    *   Ali Bobo owns the 3rd, 6th, and 9th fastest camels overall. Let's call them A3 (Aluminum, 3rd), B6 (Boron, 6th), and C9 (Copper, 9th).
    *   Kareem owns 1st, 4th, 7th.
    *   Sharif owns 2nd, 5th, 8th.
    *   Other owners have inferior camels (slower than 9th).

2.  **Analyze Last Year's Performance:**
    *   Ali Bobo won 3rd place in each of the 3 races (A, B, C).
    *   Winnings: 3rd in A ($100) + 3rd in B ($75) + 3rd in C ($50) = $225.
    *   This implies he entered one camel in each race.
    *   Given the speeds, the most likely scenario for this outcome is:
        *   Race A: Kareem's 1st, Sharif's 2nd, Ali Bobo's 3rd (A3). Result: 1st K(1), 2nd S(2), 3rd A(3). Ali Bobo gets $100.
        *   Race B: Kareem's 4th, Sharif's 5th, Ali Bobo's 6th (B6). Result: 1st K(4), 2nd S(5), 3rd A(6). Ali Bobo gets $75.
        *   Race C: Kareem's 7th, Sharif's 8th, Ali Bobo's 9th (C9). Result: 1st K(7), 2nd S(8), 3rd A(9). Ali Bobo gets $50.
    *   This confirms last year's strategy and winnings.

3.  **Analyze the Goal:** Ali Bobo wants a *risk-free* strategy to *increase* his total winnings beyond $225. ""Risk-free"" implies the outcome is certain based on the known information (camel speeds) and rules. ""Increase"" means the total must be > $225.

4.  **Examine Potential Sources of Increased Winnings:**
    *   Winning higher places in races: Can Ali Bobo's camels beat Kareem's or Sharif's faster camels? No, based on the rankings. His 3rd fastest cannot beat 1st or 2nd. His 6th cannot beat 4th or 5th. His 9th cannot beat 7th or 8th. In a race with Kareem's and Sharif's faster camels, Ali Bobo's best possible *guaranteed* position in that race is 3rd (if 2 faster camels are present), 6th (if 5 faster camels are present), or 9th (if 8 faster camels are present).
    *   Earning Bonuses:
        *   SLAM ($500): Win all 3 races (1st place in A, B, C). Impossible, as Ali Bobo's fastest camel is 3rd overall.
        *   SWEEP ($200): Win 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in *any one race*.

5.  **Focus on the SWEEP Bonus:** The $200 SWEEP bonus is the only realistic path to significantly increasing winnings, as winning higher places in individual races against faster camels isn't possible.
    *   To win 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in *any* race, Ali Bobo's camels must be the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd fastest *in that specific race*.
    *   Ali Bobo's camels are the 3rd, 6th, and 9th fastest overall.
    *   The *only* way for his 3rd, 6th, and 9th fastest camels to be the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd fastest *within a specific race* is if *no other camels faster than his 9th fastest* (i.e., no camels ranked 1st through 8th overall) are entered into that race.

6.  **Apply the ""Risk-Free"" Constraint and the Hint:**
    *   Is it ""risk-free"" to assume Kareem (1st, 4th, 7th) and Sharif (2nd, 5th, 8th) will *not* enter any of their 6 faster camels (ranks 1 through 8) into a particular race? Not inherently, based purely on rules.
    *   However, the hint ""Sometimes we must sacrifice some battles to win the war"" suggests focusing all effort on one goal (the ""war"") even if it means giving up potential small wins (the ""battles"" in other races). The SWEEP is the clear ""war"" target for Ali Bobo.
    *   How can Ali Bobo make it strategically *advantageous* for Kareem and Sharif to place their faster camels in the *other* races? By concentrating all his camels (including his fastest ones, the 3rd and 6th) into *one* race, Ali Bobo removes potential competition for Kareem's (1st, 4th) and Sharif's (2nd, 5th) fastest camels in the *other two* races (Races A and B, which also have the highest prize money).
    *   If Ali Bobo places all three camels (A3, B6, C9) into *one* race, say Race C (the race with the lowest prize money), he effectively leaves Races A and B open for Kareem and Sharif to compete for the top spots with minimal interference from Ali Bobo's relatively faster camels (3rd and 6th).
    *   Kareem has camels 1st, 4th, 7th. Sharif has camels 2nd, 5th, 8th. They have a total of 6 camels ranked 1st through 8th. They can distribute these 6 camels across Races A and B (e.g., 3 in A, 3 in B, respecting the max 3 per race per owner rule) to compete for the high prizes there. For example:

Name each pair of siblings and their surname and work out how many mistakes each made in their history and geography examination papers.
1. The boy (not Luke) whose sister is Louella made more history errors than Sammy.
2. George did better in history than the boy surnamed O'Connell, who made either one more or one less geography error than the twins surnamed Dean.
3. Anne made either one more or one less geography error than Louella.
4. The twins who made 11 geography errors didn't make exactly 11 history errors.
5. David and his sister made either one more or one less mistake in the history exam than the twins who made 14 geography errors.
6. Edward and his sister did worse at history than the pair who made 15 geography errors. Edward made one more error in the geography exam than Luke.
7. The McCall twins didn't make one less history mistake than the Vole twins.
8. Susan (who made seven history errors) made one less geography error than the girl who made one less history error than Anne.
9. The twins surnamed Waters made one more history mistake than the twins surnamed Seal, who made more geography errors than the McCall twins.
10. Gail made one more geography error than the girl who made one more history error than Louella.
11. Martin made either one more or one less geography error than his best friend and his sister, who made more history mistakes than Diane.
12. Wendy and her brother (who didn't make eight history mistakes) didn't make as many errors in geography as George and his sister.
Brothers are David, Edward, George, Luke, Martin & Sammy.
Sisters are Anne, Diane, Gail, Louella, Susan & Wendy.
Surnames are Dean, McCall, O'Connell, Seal, Vole & Waters.
Geography errors are 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 & 16.
History errors are 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 & 12.
 Hint: Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12.","Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12.","Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12. Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.
Anne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12. If the Seal twins made 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10, then (above) the Dean twins are excluded. Thus Sammy's surname is Seal and David's is Waters. Diane's surname is Vole. Martin's isn't McCall (7), so must be Dean. Luke's is McCall.

Edward - Anne - O'Connell - 11- 12;

41,"Question: In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)
 Hint: The number of days depends on the number of red hats.",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,"It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.
How this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.
If there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

The First Lap:
Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.
In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.
The Second Lap:
Paul slipped on a water puddle and fell back to third place, leaving the person he was right by, way in front. Clark moved up 2 spots, pushing those two people back one place each. Then, Felicia and Anna switched places, and Luke and Brad switched places. The people in 11th and 12th ended up switching places just before the third lap as well.
The Third Lap:
The two people in 10th and 11th place switched spots, the two people in 5th and 6th places switched spots, and the two people in 7th and 8th places switched spots. Brad ended up getting passed by the two people directly behind him, and Jessica was passed by the person directly behind her. Everyone then finished in the order that they are currently in.
Can you figure out which place everyone is in, and what rank they will be after this race?
 Hint: On the first lap the top 4 runners were Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica. Felicia and Brianna weren't far behind which means they were in 5th and 6th place.

2. E is a prime factor of G.
3. F is greater than A.
4. The sum of B and G is equal to H.
5. I is not 1.
 Hint: Start with casework on clue 2.",Start with casework on clue 2.,"A=7, B=1, C=9
D=6, E=2, F=8
G=4, H=5, I=3
From Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.
Let's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.
If I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.
This means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.
This leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6.

Keeping the above groups self-contained, N has 5 slots (2 within FKO, 1 between FKO and H, 1 between FKO and G, 1 beside M). That makes 30 arrangements - 5 for each FKO order.
When N is in certain positions, however, the groups can break up. Unless N is next to M outside GLM, GLM can be GML. If N is between FKO and GLM, GLM can scramble, and G can be anywhere touching FKO, except N cannot touch L. When G-[L/M]-N are consecutive in either direction, FKO can straddle that subgroup. That makes 126 arrangements - 21 for each FKO order.

 Hint: Each time he travels to a continent he has not traveled to.",Each time he travels to a continent he has not traveled to.,Santiago in Chile. He travels to each continent in alphabetical order then to the capital of the country that has the most southern latitude.,GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:

1.  **Identify the visited locations and their continents:**
    *   Cape Town in South Africa: Africa
    *   Jakarta in Indonesia: Asia
    *   Canberra in Australia: Australia/Oceania
    *   Rome in Italy: Europe
    *   Panama City in Panama: North America

2.  **List the continents visited:**
    *   Africa
    *   Asia
    *   Australia/Oceania
    *   Europe
    *   North America

3.  **Apply the hint:** The hint states that Stewart travels to a continent he has not traveled to each time. This means the next destination must be on a continent not in the list above.

4.  **Identify the continents not yet visited:** The commonly recognized continents are Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia/Oceania, Europe, North America, and South America. Comparing this list with the visited continents, the unvisited continents are:
    *   South America
    *   Antarctica

5.  **Determine the likely next continent:** The previous destinations are all major cities with significant populations (except perhaps Canberra, but it's a capital). Antarctica primarily has research stations and very few permanent residents. A world traveler is more likely to visit a major populated continent next. Therefore, South America is the most probable next continent.

6.  **Look for patterns in the visited cities/countries:** The list of destinations is:
    *   Cape Town, South Africa
    *   Jakarta, Indonesia
    *   Canberra, Australia
    *   Rome, Italy
    *   Panama City, Panama

7.  **Examine the first letters of the cities:** The first letters of the cities are C, J, C, R, P. This is a sequence of five letters.

8.  **Hypothesize a pattern for the sequence of first letters:** A common pattern for a sequence of a fixed length is repetition. If the sequence C, J, C, R, P repeats, the next letter in the sequence would be C.

9.  **Hypothesize a pattern based on the continents:** Let's examine the spelling of the continent names visited: Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America. And the unvisited ones: South America, Antarctica.
    *   Continents containing the letter 'A': Africa, Asia, Australia, North America, South America, Antarctica.
    *   Continents not containing the letter 'A': Europe.

10. **Compare continent spelling with city names:** Let's check if the chosen city's name contains the letter 'A' based on whether the continent's name contains 'A'.
    *   Africa (contains 'A') -> Cape Town (contains 'A'). Pattern holds.
    *   Asia (contains 'A') -> Jakarta (contains 'A'). Pattern holds.
    *   Australia (contains 'A') -> Canberra (contains 'A'). Pattern holds.

47,"Question: The boffins from NASA have received and decoded a digital message from the Galactic Council, informing them that four alien ambassadors from the solar system are due to visit Earth in the next 24 hours. The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?
 Hint: Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.",Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.,"ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy and so, is the Assassin.
Looking at clue 2 we know that both the ambassadors standing next to Agurgle from Uranus are not green. Also, from the body of the teaser, we also know only one alien is green, tentacled and slimy. So there are two deductions to be made: (Note the key is - Alien (Green, Tentacled, Un-Slimey). Where ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. ""?"" denotes unknown, and each set of braces[] indicates a booth)
Either Deduction A
[ N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [ N, ?, ?] [ ?, ?, ?]
Or Deduction B
[N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, ?][ N, ?, ?] [Y, Y, N]
You can see that either Agurgle from Uranus or the alien at the extreme right hand booth is green, tentacled and slimy.
Now taking clue 3, you can work out that ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to a slimy alien AND each of the other aliens' booths are next to precisely one slimy alien.
So, based on the first set of deductions, you can infer the following.
Deduction A (ii):
[ChimChim from Pluto N, ?, N] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [N, ?, Y] [?, ?, Y]
Or Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
You can then use clue 1 to eliminate one of these deductions: Wym-Inar from Venus is the only alien in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien. But in Deduction A(ii), ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to exactly one tentacled alien.  Therefore, Deduction A (ii) is not possible and Deduction B (ii) is the correct one.
Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, looking again at clues 2 and 3, there are a further 2 possible deductions to be made.
Deduction A (iii)
[Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus] [?, N, Y] [Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
Deduction B (iii)
[Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, Y][Agurgle from Uranus ?, Y, Y][Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy, and is therefore our Neptunian Assassin.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

50,"Question: In a wood-cutting factory, five large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are five back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the five switches outside the room to the five machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?
 Hint: Aside from sight, use other senses.","Aside from sight, use other senses.","1) Turn off two machines while inside. Let's call those two machines turned off with inside switch 'inactive', and call remaining three machines 'active'.
2) Go outside.

To do that, try all of following ten combinations, where 'x' represents turned-off outside switch, while 'O' represent turned on switch: xxx00,xx0x0,x0xx0,0xxx0,xx00x,x0x0x,0xx0x,x00xx,0x0xx,00xxx . Only one of these combinations is a 'silent' combination that eliminates all sound, by turning off all three active machines.

7) Wait enough time for machine connected to C switch to cool off, and then turn B off, too.

11) Turn inside switches on for both 'inactive' machines. The one that starts working is connected to outside switch E. The one that is still not working is connected to outside switch D.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break down this classic logic puzzle step-by-step, using the hint provided.

1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The brother needs to identify which *outside* backup switch controls which *inside* machine. He can't see the machines from outside, and he has to figure it out by operating switches and making just *one* trip into the room where he can interact with/observe the machines.

2.  **Initial State:** All five machines inside are working. This means for each machine, its internal switch is ON, and its corresponding backup switch outside is also ON.

3.  **The Challenge:** When the brother is outside, he sees five backup switches (let's call them B1, B2, B3, B4, B5). He knows these control the machines (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5) inside, but he doesn't know the mapping (e.g., does B1 control M3? Does B2 control M1?). Simply turning a switch OFF outside and entering the room won't fully solve it for all five. If he turns B1 OFF, he'll find one machine OFF inside. He knows B1 controls *that* machine, but that leaves four unknown switches and four unknown machines. Turning multiple switches OFF at once would just result in multiple machines being OFF inside, without knowing which outside switch caused which inside machine to turn off.

4.  **Leveraging the Hint:** The hint says ""Aside from sight, use other senses."" What other senses can tell you something about a machine, especially whether it's been running?
    *   **Sound:** A machine makes noise when running. Turning it OFF makes it silent. This is essentially equivalent to sight (seeing it move vs. stopped) for determining the ON/OFF state *right now*.
    *   **Touch/Heat:** A machine that has been running gets hot. When it's turned OFF, it starts to cool down. The longer it has been off, the cooler it will be. This provides a state that *persists* after the machine might be turned back ON, and can indicate *how long* it has been in a certain state (OFF).
    *   **Vibration:** Similar to sound, a running machine vibrates. Touching it can tell you if it's running *right now*.

5.  **Developing a Strategy using Heat/Time:** The key must be to create *different, detectable states* for each machine using the backup switches *before* entering the room. The heat/cooling property allows for more than just two states (ON/OFF). A machine can be:
    *   ON and Hot (has been running for a while).
    *   OFF and Cooling (was running, now off).
    *   ON but Cooler (was off for a while, now back on and warming up, but not yet fully hot).

6.  **Implementing the Strategy:** The brother goes outside. He has the five backup switches B1, B2, B3, B4, B5. He needs to perform actions that will result in five distinct states inside the room.

    *   **Action 1 (for Switch B1):** Turn B1 OFF. Leave it OFF. The machine connected to B1 will stop running and begin cooling down.
    *   **Action 2 (for Switch B2):** Turn B2 OFF. Wait for a significant amount of time (say, 15-20 minutes - long enough for it to cool noticeably). Then turn B2 back ON. The machine connected to B2 was OFF and cooling, but is now ON and starting to heat up again.
    *   **Action 3 (for Switch B3):** Turn B3 OFF. Wait for a shorter amount of time than for B2 (say, 5-10 minutes). Then turn B3 back ON. The machine connected to B3 was OFF for less time than the machine controlled by B2; it will have cooled less and will be warmer than the machine controlled by B2.
    *   **Action 4 (for Switch B4):** Turn B4 OFF. Wait for a very short amount of time (say, 1-2 minutes). Then turn B4 back ON. The machine connected to B4 was OFF for only a brief period; it will have cooled only slightly and will be significantly warmer than the machines controlled by B2 or B3.
    *   **Action 5 (for Switch B5):** Leave B5 ON the entire time. The machine connected to B5 will continue running and remain hot.

7.  **Entering the Room:** After performing these actions outside and waiting for sufficient time for the temperature differences to become distinct, the brother enters the room. All internal switches (S1-S5) were left ON.

8.  **Observing and Deducing Inside the Room:** Inside the room, the brother goes to each of the five machines (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5). For each machine, he checks its state using sound (is it running?) and touch (what is its temperature?). He will find:

    *   **Machine A:** Is OFF (no sound) and relatively cool to the touch. This machine must be the one connected to the switch that was turned OFF and left OFF (B1).
    *   **Machine B:** Is ON (sound) and is the hottest machine in the room. This machine must be the one connected to the switch that was left ON the entire time (B5).
    *   **Machines C, D, E:** Are ON (sound), but are at different temperatures, all cooler than Machine B.
        *   **Machine C:** Is the coolest among the ON machines. This machine must be the one connected to the switch that was turned OFF for the *longest* period before being turned back ON (B2).
        *   **Machine D:** Is warmer than Machine C but cooler than Machine E. This machine must be the one connected to the switch that was turned OFF for a *medium* period before being turned back ON (B3).
        *   **Machine E:** Is the warmest among the ON machines (but cooler than Machine B). This machine must be the one connected to the switch that was turned OFF for the *shortest* period before being turned back ON (B4).

9.  **Mapping the Switches:** By identifying which machine corresponds to which state, the brother can now match the backup switches outside to the machines inside:
    *   Backup Switch B1 controls Machine A (OFF/Cool).
    *   Backup Switch B5 controls Machine B (ON/Hottest).
    *   Backup Switch B2 controls Machine C (ON/Coolest).
    *   Backup Switch B3 controls Machine D (ON/Medium Warm).
    *   Backup Switch B4 controls Machine E (ON/Warmest).

He has now successfully determined the mapping for all five switches in a single trip into the room, using the states he created by manipulating the switches outside, and detecting those states inside using sound and touch/temperature.

Final answer: The brother manipulates the backup switches outside the room to create different states detectable by touch (temperature) when he enters the room. Starting with all machines ON and hot, he turns one backup switch OFF permanently (machine will be OFF and cool). He turns another backup switch OFF for a significant duration before turning it back ON (machine will be ON but noticeably cooler, warming up). He turns a third backup switch OFF for a shorter duration before turning it back ON (machine will be ON and warmer than the previous one, warming up). He turns a fourth backup switch OFF for a very brief duration before turning it back ON (machine will be ON and only slightly cooler than one that stayed on, warming up quickly). He leaves the fifth backup switch ON continuously (machine stays ON and hot). After waiting, he enters the room and checks each machine. By feeling their temperature and noting whether they are running (sound), he can uniquely identify which machine corresponds to which state created by the outside switch manipulation, thereby matching each backup switch to its machine.",True,0,0,1

Certainly, each lock loses 7,000 litres, but it takes the water from the level above!
Hence, by succession, we only lose 7,000 litres from the top level, no matter how many locks we have!
The balance, then, is 22,000 litres - 7,000 litres = 15,000 litres: the contract is worth it!
On third thought (the engineering approach):
Unfortunately, waterways ""lose"" water in a continuous manner: by evaporation, by ""leaks"" to the underground water table, by ""leaks"" through the locks.
Now come two more factors: the length of the canal (which determines the evaporation and leaks to underground), and the TIME it takes to bring the water upstream.
If the whole of the canal loses 3,000 litres/hour and it takes the boat 5 hours to reach the top, the exercise is pointless (just maintaining the levels).  Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.
On fourth thought (the economics):
If the engineering balance is ""close to equilibrium"", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the reasoning to determine if the contract is reasonable, following the hint:

1.  **Understanding Canal Locks and Water Movement:** A canal lock is essentially a chamber with gates at either end used to raise or lower boats between different water levels (pounds) of the canal. To move a boat *up* through a lock, water is let *into* the chamber from the upper level, raising the boat. To move a boat *down* through a lock, water is let *out* of the chamber into the lower level, lowering the boat.

2.  **Interpreting ""Water Loss"":** The problem states, ""Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used."" The hint asks, ""Where are the water losses?"" This large volume of 7000 L per usage strongly suggests this refers to the volume of water transferred between the canal pounds during a lock operation, rather than leakage or evaporation (which would be continuous and generally much smaller per *single* lock usage).
    *   When a boat goes *down* a lock, a volume of water equal to the lock chamber's capacity (approximately 7000 L in this case) is released from the upper pound into the lower pound. From the perspective of the *upper* pound, this water is ""lost"" because it's gone to a lower level.
    *   When a boat goes *up* a lock, a volume of water equal to the lock chamber's capacity (7000 L) is drawn from the upper pound into the lock chamber to fill it and raise the boat, and then the boat proceeds into the upper pound. This water comes from the upper pound itself (or the pound above the lock).

3.  **Identifying the Net Effect of Lock Usage:** Over time, especially with traffic going both up and down, there is a net movement of water down the canal system due to lock operations. Every boat passing *down* transfers a lock-full of water downwards. Every boat passing *up* uses a lock-full of water *from the level above*. The primary way water is depleted from the *highest* levels of a canal is by boats going *down* the system, moving water from higher pounds to lower pounds. Evaporation and seepage are also losses, but the 7000 L figure points to operational transfer.

4.  **Tracing the ""Lost"" Water:** The water that is ""lost"" from the upper levels by going downstream during lock usage doesn't disappear from the canal system. It simply accumulates in the lower pounds of the canal. This water eventually makes its way down the 13 locks to the very bottom of the canal system.

5.  **Evaluating the Proposed Solution:** The contract proposes renting a truck to bring water *from the bottom* of the canal *to the top*. The water at the bottom of the canal is precisely the water that has moved down from the upper levels through lock operations (and potentially other sources/losses in the lower levels).

6.  **Assessing Reasonableness:** Why would you take water *out* of the canal at the bottom, load it onto a truck, drive the truck alongside the canal (presumably on roads, which are external to the waterway system), and then dump the water *back into* the canal at the top?
    *   The water you need at the top (to compensate for water moved downstream) is *already in the canal system*, just at a lower elevation.
    *   Moving water uphill using a truck and road transport is extremely inefficient and expensive compared to methods internal to the canal system, such as:
        *   Drawing water from natural sources at higher elevations (rivers, reservoirs) - the problem states there's ""no water supply at the top,"" but this is the ideal scenario.
        *   Pumping water from lower pounds back up to higher pounds using fixed or portable pumping stations within the canal structure. This uses energy (electricity, fuel) but avoids the logistical overhead of trucking.

7.  **Considering the Truck Capacity:** The truck can carry 22 tons, which is approximately 22,000 L (since 1 ton of water is about 1000 kg, and 1 kg of water is about 1 L). This capacity is roughly equivalent to carrying 3 lock-fulls (22000 L / 7000 L ≈ 3.14) per trip. While this tells us *how much* water *could* be moved per trip, it doesn't justify the *method* itself. The method is flawed regardless of the truck's size.

8.  **Conclusion on Reasonableness:** The contract is *not* reasonable because it proposes a highly inefficient and illogical method for replenishing water levels in the upper pounds of the canal. The water that needs to be replenished at the top is the same water that was moved downstream through lock operations and is now available at the bottom. Trucking this water from the bottom to the top using external road transport is fundamentally irrational when the water is already connected within the canal system and could potentially be moved uphill by more appropriate methods like pumping within the waterway infrastructure itself. It's like bailing water out of the deep end of a swimming pool, carrying it around the deck, and pouring it back into the shallow end, when the water is already part of the same interconnected body.

The final answer is $\boxed{The contract is not reasonable}$.",True,0,0,0

57,"Question: There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.
He decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.
Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?

He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.
Each company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full ¾ pay for ¾ of a bridge ($750,000).
When Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.

58,"Question: A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?
 Hint: Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG. Continue from there by writing everything else mathematically","Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG. Continue from there by writing everything else mathematically","There were a total of 6 friends. Each end up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.
The number of Golden kebab tokens is evenly divisible by the number of friends as well as the number of families.
Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG
If the Golden kebab tokens had been divided by families rather than by individuals, the number of recipients would be (G - 2) and each share would be (N + 5).
Again, total number of Golden kebab tokens = (N + 5)(G - 2)
But, the total number of the Golden kebab tokens is the same.
NG = (N + 5)(G - 2)
NG = NG -2N +5G -10
2N = 5G -10
N = (5/2)G - 5
Now, N and G are the positive integers and also total number of Golden kebab tokens must be divisible by G, (G-1) and (G-2). This is because initially there were G friends; then since it was divided family wise, the total number of units, the coins were to be divided would be (G-2) (as two groups had two sisters, so two friends got combined as one group, one per group); and after Wendy Boatkumsin backed out, there were (G-1) friends.
Now trying different EVEN values for G, starting with 2; there were total 6 friends and 60 Golden kebab tokens. The Golden kebab tokens are divided among 5 friends and hence each friend ends up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is a step-by-step solution following the hint provided.

Let G be the total number of friends in the group.
Let N be the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially.

From the problem statement, we know that G < 10.
The total number of Golden kebab tokens is the number of friends multiplied by the tokens each friend received initially, which is G * N. This matches the hint.

Next, let's consider the hypothetical re-division by families.
There are two groups with two sisters each, totaling 4 friends who are sisters. These form 2 families.
Norha Bone is one of the friends, and she is not in either group of sisters.
The rest of the friends are unrelated to each other.
Let's determine the total number of families. Out of G friends, 4 are sisters. So, G - 4 friends are not sisters. One of these G - 4 friends is Norha. The remaining (G - 4) - 1 = G - 5 friends are unrelated individuals.
The families are:
1. Two families consisting of two sisters each (2 families).
2. Norha Bone, who forms a family of size 1 (1 family).
3. The remaining G - 5 friends, each forming a family of size 1 (G - 5 families).
The total number of families is 2 + 1 + (G - 5) = G - 2.
For there to be families of sisters and Norha (who is not a sister), there must be at least 4 sisters + 1 Norha = 5 friends. So G must be at least 5.
Thus, the number of friends G must satisfy 5 <= G < 10. Possible values for G are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

In the hypothetical family division, the tokens per family would be N + 5 (5 more than the initial tokens per friend).
The total number of tokens (NG) would be divided among the G - 2 families.
So, we have the equation:
Total Tokens = (Number of Families) * (Tokens per Family)
NG = (G - 2) * (N + 5)

Let's expand and simplify this equation:
NG = GN + 5G - 2N - 10
Subtract NG from both sides:
0 = 5G - 2N - 10
Rearrange the terms to express 2N in terms of G:
2N + 10 = 5G
2N = 5G - 10

Now, let's consider the third scenario, where Wendy Boatkumsin withdraws.
Wendy is one of the G friends. She decides not to take any tokens. Her initial share was N tokens.
Her share (N tokens) is equally divided among the other friends. There are G - 1 other friends.
The problem states this division is done ""without breaking/cutting any Kebab token"", which means N must be perfectly divisible by G - 1.
So, N is a multiple of G - 1. We can write this as N = k * (G - 1) for some positive integer k (since N must be positive).

We now have two conditions that N and G must satisfy:
1. 2N = 5G - 10
2. N is a multiple of G - 1 (N = k(G - 1) for integer k > 0)
And G is an integer such that 5 <= G < 10.

Let's test the possible integer values for G (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) using the equation 2N = 5G - 10 and checking if N is a multiple of G - 1.

Case G = 5:
2N = 5(5) - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15
N = 15 / 2 = 7.5. N must be an integer (number of tokens). So G cannot be 5.

Case G = 6:
2N = 5(6) - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20
N = 20 / 2 = 10. N is an integer.
Now check if N is a multiple of G - 1. G - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5.
Is 10 a multiple of 5? Yes, 10 = 2 * 5. So k = 2.
This case (G = 6, N = 10) is consistent with all conditions so far.

Case G = 7:
2N = 5(7) - 10 = 35 - 10 = 25
N = 25 / 2 = 12.5. Not an integer. So G cannot be 7.

Case G = 8:
2N = 5(8) - 10 = 40 - 10 = 30
N = 30 / 2 = 15. N is an integer.
Now check if N is a multiple of G - 1. G - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7.
Is 15 a multiple of 7? No. So G cannot be 8.

Case G = 9:
2N = 5(9) - 10 = 45 - 10 = 35
N = 35 / 2 = 17.5. Not an integer. So G cannot be 9.

The only value of G that satisfies all conditions is G = 6, which gives N = 10.

So, there were initially 6 friends, and each friend initially received 10 Golden kebab tokens. The total number of tokens is 6 * 10 = 60.

Finally, let's determine how many Golden kebab tokens each friend ended up with.
The story describes a final state after Wendy withdraws.
There are G = 6 friends in total.
Wendy Boatkumsin, one of the friends, decided she did not want any tokens. She ended up with 0 tokens.
Her share was N = 10 tokens.
This share was equally divided among the other G - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 friends.
Each of these 5 friends received an additional amount of N / (G - 1) = 10 / 5 = 2 tokens.
Each of these 5 friends had initially received N = 10 tokens.
So, each of these 5 friends ended up with their initial share plus the distributed amount: 10 + 2 = 12 tokens.

The question asks: ""How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?""
There were 6 friends in the group.
In the final state, one friend (Wendy) had 0 tokens, and the other five friends had 12 tokens each. The phrasing ""each friend"" in the second part of the question, in the context of the final distribution among ""the other friends"", refers to the amount received by each friend who participated in receiving tokens in the final step.

So, the number of friends was 6, and each of the friends who received tokens ended up with 12 tokens.

Final Answer needs to state the number of friends and the tokens each friend ended up with.
Number of friends = 6.
Number of tokens each friend ended up with = 12 (this applies to the 5 friends who received tokens).

Let's verify the entire scenario with G=6 and N=10:
- 6 friends, G < 10. (Yes)
- Initially divided equally: 10 tokens each (N=10). Total 60. (Yes)
- Family division (hypothetical): G=6. Families = G-2 = 4. Tokens per family = N+5 = 10+5 = 15. Total = 4*15 = 60. Matches initial total. (Yes)
- Wendy withdraws (share=10). Share divided among G-1=5 friends. 10/5 = 2 per friend. (Yes)
- Final state: Wendy gets 0. 5 friends get 10+2 = 12. (Yes)

The question structure asks for a single value for ""each friend"". This value applies to the friends who ended up with tokens.

Final Answer: There were 6 friends. Each friend (referring to the friends who received tokens in the final distribution) ended up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.

Let's re-read the question again. ""How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?"". It seems to ask for two quantities. The first quantity is the total number of friends. The second quantity is the number of tokens per friend in the final state. As the final state involves different amounts for different friends, the phrasing is slightly ambiguous. However, the most reasonable interpretation is the amount received by the friends who were still part of the distribution after Wendy's withdrawal.

Number of friends = 6.
Tokens per friend (for the 5 friends who received tokens) = 12.

Let's format the answer as requested.

The final answer is $\boxed{6 \text{ friends and } 12 \text{ Golden kebab tokens each}}$.",True,1,0,1

61,"Question: In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.
The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies.

This neutralization happens when the stronger poison is drunk *after* the weaker one. Drinking a weaker poison after a stronger one does not help. Drinking only poison is fatal.

2.  **Analyze the Test Procedure:**
    *   Person 1 (Treasurer, T) drinks Person 2's (Pharmacist's, P's) poison, then their own. Order: $P_p$, then $P_t$.
    *   Person 2 (Pharmacist, P) drinks Person 1's (Treasurer's, T's) poison, then their own. Order: $P_t$, then $P_p$.

3.  **Analyze the Desired Outcome (from the King's perspective):** The king wants to identify the *single* strongest poison. In the context of the test, the survivor is deemed to have had the stronger poison. If P survives and T dies, $P_p$ is the strongest. If T survives and P dies, $P_t$ is the strongest. If both die, neither was strong enough (or they were equal). If both survive, the test is inconclusive in finding a *single* strongest poison based on the described rules.

4.  **Analyze the Actual Outcome:** The Treasurer died, the Pharmacist survived, and the King didn't get what he wanted.

5.  **Apply the Core Rule to the Actual Outcome (Initial Hypothesis based *only* on the rule):**
    *   P survived, T died. According to the simple rule, this would imply $P_p$ was stronger than $P_t$.
    *   Let's check if this fits the test:
        *   T drinks $P_p$, then $P_t$. If $P_p > P_t$, drinking $P_t$ after $P_p$ does not neutralize $P_p$. T dies from $P_p$. This fits T dying.
        *   P drinks $P_t$, then $P_p$. If $P_p > P_t$, drinking $P_p$ after $P_t$ neutralizes $P_t$. P survives. This fits P surviving.
    *   So, if $P_p$ was simply stronger than $P_t$, the outcome (T dies, P survives) is perfectly explained by the core rule.

6.  **Introduce the Complicating Factors (The Narrative Details):**
    *   The Treasurer knew he couldn't win by making a stronger *poison*. This strongly suggests $P_t$ is *not* stronger than $P_p$.
    *   The Treasurer made a *plan* to survive. This plan must involve something other than simply making a stronger poison.
    *   The Pharmacist realized the Treasurer's plan and made a *counter-plan*.
    *   The King didn't get what he wanted. This is the *critical* piece of information that tells us the simple ""stronger poison neutralizes weaker poison"" explanation from step 5 is *insufficient* or *incorrect* for the *actual* substances involved. If P survived because $P_p$ was simply the strongest poison that neutralized $P_t$, the King *would* have gotten what he wanted – identification of the strongest poison ($P_p$).

7.  **Brainstorm Treasurer's Likely Plan:** Since T couldn't make a stronger poison, the only way for T to survive drinking P's (likely strong) poison first is if T's concoction *neutralizes* P's poison, but not through the ""stronger poison"" mechanism. The most logical substance for this is an *antidote*. Let's assume T made an antidote (let's call it A) designed to counter a strong poison like the one P would make.

8.  **Analyze Treasurer's Plan with the Test Sequence:**
    *   T's test: Drink P's poison ($P_p$), then T's concoction (A).
    *   If A is an effective antidote to $P_p$, T *should* survive this sequence, *assuming* the antidote works even when taken second. This contradicts T dying in the actual outcome.

9.  **Brainstorm Pharmacist's Counter-Plan:** P knows T suspects P will make a strong poison and might use a non-standard approach like an antidote. P needs to make $P_p$ such that T dies (drinking $P_p$ then A), but P survives (drinking A then $P_p$). The order of drinking is key here.

10. **Connect Pharmacist's Counter-Plan to the Outcome and Order:** P survived drinking A *then* $P_p$. T died drinking $P_p$ *then* A. This implies that drinking A *before* $P_p$ is protective or neutralizing, while drinking A *after* $P_p$ is *not* protective, or perhaps even detrimental in that specific order.

11. **Hypothesize the Nature of $P_p$ and A based on the Sequence Dependency:**
    *   A (T's concoction) works as an antidote or protective agent against $P_p$ (P's concoction), but *only if taken first*. Let's call this a prophylactic antidote or a pre-treatment.
    *   $P_p$ (P's concoction) is a strong poison that is lethal *unless* the specific pre-treatment (A) is taken beforehand.

12. **Formulate the Step-by-Step Events:**
    *   **Pharmacist:** Acknowledging the Treasurer's inferior skill in poison-making, anticipates that the Treasurer's plan must involve something *other* than a stronger poison – most likely, an antidote (A). The Pharmacist then designs their poison ($P_p$) to be effective (lethal) unless it is preceded by this specific antidote (A). Essentially, $P_p$ is a poison that requires a specific pre-treatment (A) to be survivable.
    *   **Treasurer:** Unable to create a stronger poison, the Treasurer creates an antidote (A) hoping it will neutralize the Pharmacist's poison, even when drunk second. The Treasurer might not fully understand the required timing or interaction of the substances.
    *   **The Test - Treasurer's Turn:** The Treasurer drinks the Pharmacist's concoction ($P_p$), which is a strong poison requiring pre-treatment. Then the Treasurer drinks their own concoction (A), the antidote. Since the antidote (A) was taken *after* the poison ($P_p$), it was ineffective as a pre-treatment. The strong poison ($P_p$) acts, and the Treasurer dies.
    *   **The Test - Pharmacist's Turn:** The Pharmacist drinks the Treasurer's concoction (A), which is the specific antidote pre-treatment designed by the Pharmacist's counter-plan. Then the Pharmacist drinks their own concoction ($P_p$), the strong poison. Since the antidote (A) was taken *before* the poison ($P_p$), the pre-treatment works, protecting the Pharmacist. The Pharmacist survives.

13. **Verify Against All Conditions:**
    *   T died, P survived: Yes, explained by the timing of the antidote pre-treatment.
    *   Stronger neutralizes weaker rule: This wasn't the mechanism of survival. P survived because of a pre-treatment (A), not because $P_p$ neutralized A by being stronger. T died because $P_p$ was not neutralized by A when taken second, not because $P_p$ was simply stronger and couldn't be neutralized. The rule was bypassed or subverted.
    *   King didn't get what he wanted: Yes. The King wanted to find the single strongest poison he could drink *after* any other poison. $P_p$ isn't that. $P_p$ is a poison survivable *only with a specific substance taken beforehand*. The test didn't identify a universally strongest poison using the stated rule; it revealed a complex interaction based on the order of ingestion and the nature of the substances (poison requiring pre-treatment vs. pre-treatment/antidote).

This chain of reasoning, especially focusing on why the simple ""stronger neutralizes weaker"" rule *couldn't* be the full explanation (because the king was dissatisfied) and how the order of drinking provides the necessary clue, leads directly to the pre-treatment/poison hypothesis.

**Final Answer:**
The Treasurer, knowing he could not make a stronger poison than the Pharmacist, made an antidote (let's call it substance A) instead. He hoped this antidote, taken after the Pharmacist's poison, would save him.

The Pharmacist, realizing the Treasurer's predicament and likely plan, concocted a special poison (let's call it substance P) that was lethal unless a very specific substance (which the Pharmacist correctly predicted would be the Treasurer's antidote, A) was taken *before* it. Substance P is, in essence, a poison requiring a specific pre-treatment (A) to be survivable.

When the time came:
1.  The Treasurer drank the Pharmacist's substance (P). This was the strong poison requiring pre-treatment.
2.  The Treasurer then drank his own substance (A), the antidote/pre-treatment. Since A was taken *after* the poison P, it could not function as the necessary pre-treatment or wasn't effective in neutralizing the poison once it was already acting. The Treasurer died from poison P.
3.  The Pharmacist drank the Treasurer's substance (A), which was the specific antidote pre-treatment.
4.  The Pharmacist then drank his own substance (P), the strong poison. Because the Pharmacist had taken the pre-treatment substance A *before* the poison P, he was protected and survived.

The King did not get what he wanted because the test did not identify the *single* strongest poison that could neutralize any weaker poison drunk before it. Instead, the Pharmacist survived through a clever counter-strategy involving a poison that was only survivable with a specific substance taken beforehand, a substance the Pharmacist knew the Treasurer would provide. The ""stronger neutralizes weaker"" rule was not the mechanism that determined the survivor.

Final answer: The Treasurer made an antidote, hoping it would save him. The Pharmacist anticipated this and made a poison that was only survivable if the Treasurer's antidote was taken first. The Treasurer took the antidote second and died; the Pharmacist took the antidote first and survived. The king didn't find a universally strongest poison because survival depended on a specific pre-treatment, not on one poison neutralizing another taken previously according to the standard rule.",True,0,0,0
62,"Question: Edgar, Frank, and George are regulars at a pub. All three of them have been regulars since before this month.
1. One regular goes to the pub every two days, one goes every three days, and one goes every seven days.
2. The first day of a certain month that Edgar went to the bar was a Monday. The first day of the same month that Frank went to the bar was a Wednesday. The first day of the same month that George went to the bar was a Friday.
3. There was only one day in that month that all three men went to the pub.
On which day of that month did all three men go to the bar?
 Hint: From fact 1, the first day the two-day man went to the pub was either the 1st or the 2nd of the month, and the first day the three-day man went was either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.","From fact 1, the first day the two-day man went to the pub was either the 1st or the 2nd of the month, and the first day the three-day man went was either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.","All three men went on the 27th.
From fact 1, the first day the two-day man went to the pub was either the 1st or the 2nd of the month, and the first day the three-day man went was either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. But from fact 2, they could not have gone on consecutive days, so from fact 3, the two-day man must have first gone on the 1st and the three-day man must have first gone on the 3rd. This gives us two possible scenarios:
1. Edgar went to the pub on Monday the 1st and every two days thereafter, Frank went on Wednesday the 3rd and every three days thereafter, and George went on Friday the 5th and every seven days thereafter.
2. Frank went on Wednesday the 1st and every two days thereafter, George went on Friday the 3rd and every three days thereafter, and Edgar went on Monday the 6th and every seven days thereafter.
If scenario 1 is true, then Edgar went on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, 19th, 21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th, and, depending on the length of the month, the 29th and 31st, Frank went on the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 18th, 21st, 24th, 27th, and depending on the length of the month, the 30th, and George went on the 5th, 12th, 19th, and 26th. But now there was no day when all three men went to the pub. So this cannot work.
This means that scenario 2 is true. Edgar went on the 6th, 13th, 20th, and 27th. Frank went on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, 19th, 21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th, and, depending on the length of the month, the 29th and 31st. George went on the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 18th, 21st, 24th, 27th, and depending on the length of the month, the 30th. So all three men went on the 27th.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0
63,"Question: The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.
[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.
[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.
[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.
The Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).
Based on this information, which of these statements is accurate?
1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.
3. The World Series winner is uncertain.

 Hint: : In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.",": In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.

Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.","The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.
[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying ""there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.""
[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:
Prime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]
Square - 0,4,9 [2 games each]
Neither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]
Since all of the ""neither prime nor square"" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 ""prime or square"" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.
[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.
We now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd. So Detroit did not score less than 3 in any game, which means the Reds could have won a maximum of just three games: those in which they scored 7, 9, 12.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

D) To satisfy equation #3, C and E must be 5 greater than F and I, respectively.  C and E must each be one of the following: 5, 7, 8, 9.  F and I must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4.
E) For equation #4, there are six possibilities for B and four possibilities for I, creating 24 possible equations.  Eliminate any equation where A is not 1 or 2.  Eliminate any equation where J is not 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  Eliminate any equation where any digit is duplicated.  B must be: 6, 7, 8, 9.  I must be: 2, 3, 4.  J must be: 6, 7, 8.
F) Returning to equations #2 and #3, eliminate additional possibilities.  E must be: 7, 8, 9.  G must be: 3, 4, 5.  H must be: 3, 4, 5, 6.  This results in F = 0 and C = 5.
G) Since H can not be 5, B can not be 8.  Since G can not be 5, J can not be 8.  Going back to equation #4, eliminate those equations where either B or J is 8.  B = 9, I = 3, A = 2, and J = 7.

Can you tell who is the truth teller, the liar and the unreliable man by asking just three questions?  Each question is directed to a single person.
 Hint: Ask someone a question about someone else. ",Ask someone a question about someone else. ,"First ask Alex, ""Does Bob sometimes tell the truth and sometimes lie?""
A ""yes"" answer means one of the following must be true:
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is unreliable;
2) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller;
3) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the liar.
A ""no"" answer means one of these must be true:
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is the liar;
2) Alex is the liar and Bob is unreliable;
3) Alex is unreliable and is telling the truth and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is telling the truth and Bob is the liar.
If the answer is ""yes"", you ask Alex ""Is Bob the liar?""; if the answer is ""no"", you ask Alex ""Is Bob the truth teller?""
Depending on the answers to the first two questions, you know one of the following:
A) If the answer to both questions was ""yes"" then either
1) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller; or
2) Alex is unreliable and lied on the first question and Bob is the liar.
B) If the answer to both questions is ""no"" then either
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is the liar; or
2) Alex is unreliable and Bob is the truth teller.
C) If the answer to the first question was ""yes"" and the second question was ""no"" then either
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is unreliable; or
2) Alex is unreliable and lied on the first question and Bob is the truth teller.
In either case, Chuck is the liar.
D) If the answer to the first question was ""no"" and the second question was ""yes"" then either
1) Alex is the liar and Bob is unreliable; or
2) Alex is unreliable and Bob is the liar.
In either case, Chuck is the truth teller.
In cases A & B you've identified one person as either the liar or the truth teller and you've identified another person as either not the liar or not the truth teller.  In these cases you ask the person who is neither the liar or the truth teller a question you know the answer to.  In cases C & D you've identified Chuck as either the liar or truth teller.  At this point you simply ask Chuck a question to identify either Alex or Bob.
So the final question and results for each case are:
A) You ask Bob ""Is Alex the truth teller?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is unreliable, Bob is the liar and Chuck is the truth teller;
""no"" means that
Alex is the liar, Bob is the truth teller and Chuck is unreliable.
B) You ask Bob ""Is Alex the liar?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is the truth teller, Bob is the liar and Chuck is unreliable;
""no"" means that
Alex is unreliable, Bob is the truth teller and Chuck is the liar.
C) You ask Chuck ""Is Alex the truth teller?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is unreliable, Bob is the truth teller and Chuck is the liar;
""no"" means that
Alex is the truth teller, Bob is unreliable and Chuck is the liar.
D) You ask Chuck ""Is Alex the liar?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is the liar, Bob is unreliable and Chuck is the truth teller;

Once again there are four blocks, each with a different letter on each side, making a total of 24 letters altogether.

BOXY,
BUCK,

OGRE,
OKAY,
PAWN,
ZEST
Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and once more missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on Kebabs.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?
 Hint: Start by deducing something about the vowels A, E, O","Start by deducing something about the vowels A, E, O","Block 1: A, B, F, J, R, and S.
Block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
Block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
Block 4: G, H, K, P, T, and X.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that E and A are not on the same block.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that E and O are not on the same block.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that A and O are not on the same block.
Combining these, we conclude that A, E, and O are on different blocks. Assume that A is on block 1, E is on block 2, and O is on block 3.
From the words BOXY and EXAM, we conclude that X is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and O (block 3), so X is on block 4.
From the words BOXY and OKAY, we conclude that Y is not on the same block as A (block 1), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so Y is on block 2.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that M is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and X (block 4), so M is on block 3.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that K is not on the same block as A (block 1), Y (block 2), and O (block 3), so K is on block 4.
From the word BOXY, we conclude that B is not on the same block as Y (block 2), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so B is on block 1.
From the words BUCK and JUMP, we conclude that U is not on the same block as B (block 1), M (block 3), and K (block 4), so U is on block 2.
From the words PAWN and JUMP, we conclude that P is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and M (block 3), so P is on block 4.
From the word JUMP, we conclude that J is not on the same block as U (block 2), M (block 3), and P (block 4), so J is on block 1.
From the words CHAW and BUCK, we conclude that C is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and K (block 4), so C is on block 3.
From the words CHAW and PAWN, we conclude that W is not on the same block as A (block 1), C (block 3), and P (block 4), so W is on block 2.
From the word CHAW, we conclude that H is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and C (block 3), so H is on block 4.
From the word PAWN, we conclude that N is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and P (block 4), so N is on block 3.
Now, we must still have three letters for block 1, and two letters for each of the blocks 2, 3, and 4. We have the following letters left:
D, F, G, I, L, R, S, T, Z
From the words DIGS, FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as D, F, G, L, R, S, and T, so I is on the same block as Z. Furthermore, I and Z are on block 2, 3, or 4.
From the word ZEST, we conclude that Z is not on the same block as E (block 2), so Z is on block 3 or 4.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that G and R are not on the same block as E (block 2), and O (block 3), so G and R are on block 1 or 4, but not on the same block.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 or 4), so I is on block 2 or 3. Since Z is on block 3 or 4, I and Z must be on block 3. Now we have all six letters of block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that L is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 and 4), so L is on block 2.
From the words FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that F, G, L, R, and T are not on the same block as L (block 2), and from the word ZEST, we conclude that S is not on the same block as E (block 2). So D must be on block 2.
Now we have all six letters of block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
From the words GIRL and DIGS, we conclude that G is not on the same block as R and S.
From the words FLIT and ZEST, we conclude that T is not on the same block as F and S.
Combining this, F, R, and S must be on the same block (block 1), and G and T must be on the same block (block 4).",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

76,"Question: With the death of Arthur Minit, the legendary country of MADADIA's only clock maker, no one else had much experience yet with making clocks. The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.
The Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?
 Hint: Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way.

One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes. The fast hand then has progressed 60+x minutes. For the time x that passed, then holds: (60+x)/12 = x. This means that x = 5 5/11 minutes.

4, 3, 6, 2, 6 = ? points
 Hint: Think about how you spell the numbers",Think about how you spell the numbers,7 points. You get one point per vowel.,GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the reasoning to solve the problem:

1.  **Understand the Problem:** We are given several examples of rolling five dice and the corresponding points. We need to find the rule that determines the points based on the dice roll and apply it to a new roll.

2.  **Analyze the Examples:**
    *   5, 3, 2, 1, 6 -> 8 points
    *   2, 2, 3, 5, 1 -> 8 points
    *   6, 5, 4, 3, 2 -> 8 points
    *   1, 2, 6, 6, 6 -> 6 points
    *   2, 2, 5, 6, 6 -> 6 points
    *   4, 3, 6, 2, 6 -> ? points

3.  **Consider the Hint:** The hint is ""Think about how you spell the numbers"". This suggests that the points are related to the English spelling of the numbers rolled on the dice (one, two, three, four, five, six).

4.  **List the Spellings:** Let's write down the English spelling for each possible number on a die (1 through 6).
    *   1: O N E
    *   2: T W O
    *   3: T H R E E
    *   4: F O U R
    *   5: F I V E
    *   6: S I X

5.  **Look for a Pattern in the Spellings:** The points seem to be relatively small numbers (6 or 8). This might relate to counting something within the spellings. Let's consider counting letters.
    *   one: 3 letters
    *   two: 3 letters
    *   three: 5 letters
    *   four: 4 letters
    *   five: 4 letters
    *   six: 3 letters

    Let's sum the letter counts for the first example roll (5, 3, 2, 1, 6): 4 (five) + 5 (three) + 3 (two) + 3 (one) + 3 (six) = 18. The points are 8. The sum of letter counts doesn't match the points directly.

6.  **Refine the Pattern Search (using the hint):** The hint points to the *spelling* specifically. Maybe we should count specific types of letters, like vowels (A, E, I, O, U). Let's count the vowels in the spelling of each number:
    *   1 (O N E): Vowels are O, E. Count = 2.
    *   2 (T W O): Vowel is O. Count = 1.
    *   3 (T H R E E): Vowels are E, E. Count = 2.
    *   4 (F O U R): Vowels are O, U. Count = 2.
    *   5 (F I V E): Vowels are I, E. Count = 2.
    *   6 (S I X): Vowel is I. Count = 1.

    Let's list the vowel counts per number:
    1 -> 2 vowels
    2 -> 1 vowel
    3 -> 2 vowels
    4 -> 2 vowels
    5 -> 2 vowels
    6 -> 1 vowel

7.  **Test the Vowel Count Hypothesis:** Let's try summing the vowel counts for the numbers in each roll and see if it matches the points.

    *   **Roll 1: 5, 3, 2, 1, 6**
        *   Vowel counts: 5(2) + 3(2) + 2(1) + 1(2) + 6(1) = 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8.
        *   Points: 8. Match!

    *   **Roll 2: 2, 2, 3, 5, 1**
        *   Vowel counts: 2(1) + 2(1) + 3(2) + 5(2) + 1(2) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.
        *   Points: 8. Match!

    *   **Roll 3: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2**
        *   Vowel counts: 6(1) + 5(2) + 4(2) + 3(2) + 2(1) = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8.
        *   Points: 8. Match!

    *   **Roll 4: 1, 2, 6, 6, 6**
        *   Vowel counts: 1(2) + 2(1) + 6(1) + 6(1) + 6(1) = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6.
        *   Points: 6. Match!

    *   **Roll 5: 2, 2, 5, 6, 6**
        *   Vowel counts: 2(1) + 2(1) + 5(2) + 6(1) + 6(1) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.
        *   Points: 6. Match!

8.  **Confirm the Rule:** The hypothesis holds true for all given examples. The rule is: The points are the sum of the number of vowels in the English spelling of each of the five numbers rolled on the dice.

9.  **Apply the Rule to the Final Roll:** The final roll is 4, 3, 6, 2, 6.

    *   Find the vowel count for each number in the roll:
        *   4 (F O U R) -> 2 vowels (O, U)
        *   3 (T H R E E) -> 2 vowels (E, E)

78,"Question: Five pirates are trying to split up 1000 gold pieces.  The rules are as follows:
Pirate #1 must divide the gold up in such a way that a majority of the pirates (including himself) agree to.  If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.
 Hint: Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?",Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?,"Like the hint says, start backwards:
If there are two pirates left (#4 & #5), #4 has no options.  No matter what he proposes, pirate #5 will disagree, resulting in a 1-1 vote (no majority).  #5 will kill #4 and will keep all of the gold.
Now say there are 3 pirates left.  #4 has to agree with whatever #3 decides, because if he doesn't #3 will be killed (because #5 won't vote for #3's proposal no matter what it is).  #3 will just propose that he keep all of the gold and will get a 2-1 vote in his favor.
Now if there are 4 pirates left:
#3 won't vote for #2's proposal because if #2's fails, #3 will get all of the gold. #4 and #5 know that they will get nothing if the decision goes to #3, so they will vote for #2's proposal if he gives them one gold piece each. Therefore, #2 would keep 998 gold, and #4 and #5 would each get one gold.
So let's wrap this up:
Pirate #1 needs 2 other votes.  He will not get a vote from #2 because #2 will get 998 gold if #1's plan fails.
#1 offers #3 one gold piece to vote for him, which #3 will accept (if it gets to #2's plan, #3 will get nothing).
#1 then offers #4 or #5 (doesn't matter which) two gold pieces, which is more than they would get with #2's plan.
So #1 can end up with 997 gold pieces, with #3 getting one piece and #4 or #5 getting two pieces.

 Hint: nan",,"Using VECTORS
i.e. 3 m North + 4 m East
= 5 metres North East
3^2 = 9
4^2 = 16
9 + 16 = 25
SQ Root of 25 = 5",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"In standard arithmetic, the statement 3 + 4 = 5 is incorrect, as 3 + 4 equals 7.

However, the statement can be considered true in certain non-standard contexts or interpretations of the symbols. The most common interpretation relates to geometry, specifically the properties of right-angled triangles and the Pythagorean theorem.

Here is the reasoning:

1.  **Standard Arithmetic:** In the arithmetic we typically learn, the '+' symbol represents addition. When we add the numbers 3 and 4, the result is 7. So, 3 + 4 = 7. The statement 3 + 4 = 5 contradicts this fundamental rule of standard arithmetic.

2.  **Seeking an Alternative Context:** Since the statement is presented as a possibility (""How is it possible""), it implies there is a specific context or a different meaning assigned to the numbers or the operation '+' that makes the equation valid.

3.  **Geometric Interpretation (Pythagorean Theorem):** Consider a right-angled triangle. The lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle are related by the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle, usually denoted by 'c') is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs, usually denoted by 'a' and 'b'). The theorem is expressed as: a² + b² = c².

4.  **Applying the Theorem to 3, 4, and 5:** The numbers 3, 4, and 5 form a well-known Pythagorean triple because they satisfy the Pythagorean theorem:
    *   Let a = 3 and b = 4.
    *   Calculate the sum of their squares: 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25.
    *   Now, consider the number 5. The square of 5 is 5² = 25.
    *   Since 3² + 4² = 25 and 5² = 25, we have 3² + 4² = 5².

5.  **Reinterpreting the Equation 3 + 4 = 5:** The equation 3 + 4 = 5 can be interpreted in this geometric context where:
    *   '3' represents the length of one leg of a right triangle.
    *   '4' represents the length of the other leg of the same right triangle.
    *   The operation '+' represents the process of finding the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by legs of lengths 3 and 4.
    *   '5' represents the resulting length of the hypotenuse.

In essence, the equation 3 + 4 = 5, in this specific context, is a shorthand way of stating that if you form a right triangle with legs measuring 3 units and 4 units, the hypotenuse will measure 5 units, following the relationship derived from the Pythagorean theorem (3² + 4² = 5²).

This interpretation uses the '+' symbol not for standard arithmetic addition of scalar values but for a geometric combination (like vector addition of orthogonal components whose magnitudes are 3 and 4, yielding a resultant vector whose magnitude is 5).

The hint ""nan"" does not appear to be relevant to this mathematical or geometric explanation.

Therefore, it is possible that 3 + 4 = 5 if the numbers 3 and 4 represent the lengths of the perpendicular sides of a right triangle and the number 5 represents the length of the hypotenuse, and the '+' symbol represents the operation of finding the hypotenuse length from the leg lengths via the Pythagorean relationship.

Final answer: It is possible that 3 + 4 = 5 if the numbers 3 and 4 represent the lengths of the legs of a right-angled triangle, and 5 represents the length of the hypotenuse. This is based on the Pythagorean theorem (3² + 4² = 5²), where the operation '+' in the original equation is interpreted not as standard arithmetic addition, but as a way to relate the leg lengths to the hypotenuse length.",True,1,0,0

 Hint: Roman numerals",Roman numerals,"CIVIL.
L (50) multiplied by 2 equal C (100).
Divide C by 20 and you have V. Divide V by 5 and you have I.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step, using the hint about Roman numerals.

1.  **Understand the Word Structure:** The word has five letters. Let's call them L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5 in order from first to fifth.

2.  **Translate the Clues into Equations:**
    *   Clue 2: Multiply my fifth by two and you have my first.
        *   L5 * 2 = L1
    *   Clue 3: Divide my first by twenty and you have my third.
        *   L1 / 20 = L3
    *   Clue 4: Divide my third by five and you have my second or fourth.
        *   L3 / 5 = L2 (or L4)

3.  **Incorporate the Hint: Roman Numerals:** The letters must correspond to Roman numerals or values derived from them. The common Roman numerals and their values are I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C (100), D (500), M (1000). Since the operations involve multiplication by 2 and division by 20 and 5, the values involved are likely to be from the smaller end of this list, or numbers that result from these operations and still correspond to these letters/values.

4.  **Analyze the Equations for Relationships:**
    *   From L1 / 20 = L3, we know L1 = 20 * L3.
    *   Substitute this into the first equation: L5 * 2 = L1 becomes L5 * 2 = 20 * L3.
    *   Simplify this new equation: L5 = 10 * L3.
    *   So we have two main relationships:
        *   L1 = 20 * L3
        *   L5 = 10 * L3
        *   L3 / 5 = L2 or L4

5.  **Test Possible Values for L3 using Roman Numerals:** Let's try assigning numerical values to L3 based on Roman numerals and see if they lead to valid Roman numerals for L1, L5, L2, and L4.

    *   **Possibility A: L3 = 1 (I)**
        *   L1 = 20 * 1 = 20 (XX - this isn't a single standard Roman numeral letter from the basic set I, V, X, L, C, D, M). This doesn't seem promising for a letter in a word. Let's discard this path for now.

    *   **Possibility B: L3 = 5 (V)**
        *   L1 = 20 * 5 = 100 (C - this is a single Roman numeral letter). This looks promising.
        *   L5 = 10 * 5 = 50 (L - this is a single Roman numeral letter). This also looks promising.
        *   Now check L2/L4: L3 / 5 = 5 / 5 = 1 (I - this is a single Roman numeral letter). This is also promising.

    *   **Possibility C: L3 = 10 (X)**
        *   L1 = 20 * 10 = 200 (CC - not a single letter). Discard.

    *   Other values for L3 (50, 100, etc.) would make L1 and L5 even larger numbers, quickly moving away from single-letter Roman numerals.

6.  **Confirm the Promising Possibility (L3 = 5):**
    Our analysis of Possibility B gives us the numerical values for the letters:
    *   L1 = 100
    *   L3 = 5
    *   L5 = 50
    *   L2 or L4 = 1

    Let's assign the Roman numeral letters based on these values:
    *   L1 corresponds to 100, which is C.
    *   L3 corresponds to 5, which is V.
    *   L5 corresponds to 50, which is L.
    *   L2 and L4 must both correspond to 1, which is I.

7.  **Assemble the Word:** The letters of the five-letter word, in order, are:
    *   L1: C
    *   L2: I
    *   L3: V
    *   L4: I
    *   L5: L

    Putting them together, we get the word C I V I L.

8.  **Final Verification:**
    *   Is CIVIL a five-letter word? Yes.
    *   Let's check the clues with the letter values (C=100, I=1, V=5, L=50):
        *   ""Multiply my fifth (L, value 50) by two and you have my first (C, value 100)."" -> 50 * 2 = 100. Correct.
        *   ""Divide my first (C, value 100) by twenty and you have my third (V, value 5)."" -> 100 / 20 = 5. Correct.
        *   ""Divide my third (V, value 5) by five and you have my second (I, value 1) or fourth (I, value 1)."" -> 5 / 5 = 1. Correct, as both the second and fourth letters have the value 1.

The word CIVIL perfectly fits all the conditions using the numerical values of its letters as Roman numerals.

Each guest lives in a different town in the region (including Corte Madera), and each has a different talent or interest that was the focus of his or her segment. The segments began at 6:45, 7:00, 7:15, 7:30, 7:45 and 8:00. Discover, for each time, the full name of the featured guest, where he or she lives and his or her special interest.

2. Damien's segment was sometime before Lautremont's segment.
3. Krieger's segment began at 7:45.
4. Alice appeared after the person from Oakland and before the person surnamed Morley.
5. The people from Berkeley and Daly City aren't of the same sex.
6. The six guests were: Cathy, the person whose first name is Damien, the person whose last name is Novak, the person from Daly City, the person from Palo Alto and the bungee jumper.
7. The last name of the financial adviser is either Lautremont or Novak.
8. Jaspersen's segment began exactly 45 minutes after the beekeeper's segment.
9. The crepe chef went on sometime before the person from Sausalito and sometime after Brandon.

7:45, Evan Krieger, Daly City, Crepe Chef
8:00 Francine Novak, Sausalito, Financial Adviser
The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15 (10). Jaspersen's segment was in the second half (8). The beekeeper was in the first half, and was either 6:45 or 7:00 (8). Since Krieger was at 7:45 (3), then Jaspersen was at 7:30. This leaves the beekeeper at 6:45 (8). The antique car collector has to be at 7:00 (1).
The financial adviser isn't Jaspersen or Kreiger (7), and is therefore on during the 8:00 segment. Likewise, Morley can't be at 8:00 (7), or in the first two segments (4); thus Morley has to be at 7:15. This puts Alice at 7:00 and Oakland at 6:45 (4). This also puts Ivens at 6:45 and Berkeley at 7:15 (1).
The two guests in the 6:45 and 7:15 segments are neither Novak, from Daly City or Palo Alto, or interested in bungee jumping. Therefore, these guests must be Cathy and Damien (6). Therefore, Brandon is at 7:30, the chef at 7:45, and the guest from Sausalito at 8:00 (9). The bungee jumper, who must be at 7:30, cannot be from Daly City or Palo Alto, and so is from Corte Madera (6). Alice must be from either Daly City or Palo Alto, so cannot have a last name of Novak (6).
Therefore, Lautremont is in the 7:00 time slot and Novak is the 8:00 time slot. Damien was at 6:45 (2), leaving Cathy at 7:15.
Since Cathy is from Berkeley, Alice cannot be from Daly City (5), and is therefore from Palo Alto. Likewise, Kreiger, who must be from Daly City, cannot be Francine, and must be named Evan. This leaves Francine at 8:00.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

97,"Question: Fred Farley spent his summers up north in a cottage on Stoney Lake. There, he often debated with his friends what type of bait was best to use for the fish in the waters.  He decided one year to hold a fishing tournament with the best fishers on the lake, each using a different casting lure.  5 men competed (Fred Farley was NOT one of them) and points were awarded in four categories to determine a winner:
Greatest total Weight of fish caught: 4 points
Greatest Number of fish caught: 3 points
Largest Fish: 2 points
Second-largest fish: 1 point
Winning more than one category: 1 bonus point
Two fishermen did not win any of the categories and first place ended up being a tie between two men who received the same amount of points.
From the statements below, determine the first and last name of each of the contestants, what casting lure was used, and who won each category.
1. Mike (who was one of the category winners), Mr. Black (who is not Terry), and the one that used the plastic worm live near each other.
2. Vick, who did not win the total weight category, did not use the spinner bait; nor did Mr. McNess.
3. The one that used the weighted jig, who was not Terry, did not win any of the categories.
4. Neither Sam nor Mr. Larson live near any of the other three contestants, nor did either use a spinner bait or deep-running crank bait.
5. The fisherman who won the largest-fish category, who was not Mr. Smith, used spinner bait.
6. Mr. Jones, who caught the most fish, did not use a deep-running crank bait.
7. Both Mr. McNess (who did not use a deep running crank bait) and Terry (who did not use a plastic worm) had boat trouble and started after the others.
8. A wounded-minnow was used as one of the casting lures, and Kevin was one of the contestants.
 Hint: Since only 3 of the contestants won the 4 categories, one of them won two and earned a bonus point.  Since there were two first places, the only possible outcome was that they both received 4 points.

From 2:  Vick is not Mr. Mc Ness, did not win total weight and did not use the spinner bait. Mr. McNess did not use the spinner bait.
From 3: Terry did not use the weighted jig. The weighted jig won no category.
From 4: Sam is not Larson or Black, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.  Mr. Larson is not Mike, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.
From 5: Mr. Smith did not win the largest fish or use the spinner bait. The largest fish was caught using the spinner bait.
Since Vick and Sam did not use the spinner, they did not win the largest fish category.  Since Mike won a category, he did not use the jig.
From 6: Mr. Jones won the most fish and, therefore, did not use the spinner bait, did not use the deep running crank bait either. Therefore, Black used the spinner and was the largest fish winner. Since Vick did not win the largest fish, by elimination, Kevin is Mr. Black.
From 7: Mr. McNess is not Terry and did not use a deep running crank bait. Therefore, Smith could have only used the crank bait.  Terry did not use a worm. Therefore, Vick used the worm and Sam used the weighted jig (and therefore won no category).
The worm (used by Vick) was thereby only used by either McNess or Jones, and since 2 says Vick is not Mc Ness, Vick is therefore Jones.
Terry, then, is Larson and won no category. Mike then wins the total weight category.

2. Winn was taller than Edvo, who was taller but younger than Frer.
3. Tolo, who was not the second oldest, was older than Har, and shorter than Frer.
4. The one who was 13 hands tall was the oldest.
5. Har was taller and older than Winn and Tolo.
6. The fourth oldest was taller than Tolo, but shorter than Edvo, who was older than Winn.

When going through all the statements, it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true. (3 says Tolo is older than Har while 5 says Har is older than Tolo.) 2 gives the order of height as Winn, Edvo, and Frer. If 5 is true, then Har must be the tallest, but this contradicts 1, therefore 5 is false.
From 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the order of height is Winn, Edvo, Frer, and Tolo - with Har somewhere in between but not the shortest or tallest. Therefore Winn is 16 hands, and Tolo is 12.
Since Har is not the oldest, he is not 13 hands, which makes Frer 13 hands and the oldest.
From 3 and 6, Tolo is not the 2nd or 4th oldest and is not the youngest. Therefore he becomes 120 years. Also from 6, Edvo is not the 4th oldest or youngest. Therefore he is 130 years.
Since the 4th oldest is shorter than Edvo, Har must be it at 110 years. And Winn is the youngest. Since the 4th oldest was shorter than Edvo, Har is 14 hands and Edvo is 15 hands.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

This works because the ""tails"" that you grab while making your subset of 128 will equal the ""heads"" that are left in the original pile.  Once you flip your 128 coins over, these ""tails"" will turn into ""heads"" and the two groups will have a matching number of heads-up coins.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

We have a large number of pennies, and we know exactly 128 of them are heads up (H) and the rest are tails up (T). We are blindfolded, so we cannot see which pennies are which. We need to create two subgroups, each containing the same number of heads-up pennies. The hint tells us we can flip pennies.

The key information is the *total* number of heads (128).

Let's devise a strategy based on picking a specific number of pennies for one subgroup and then manipulating it.

1.  **Choose the size of the first subgroup:** The crucial number in the problem is 128 (the total number of heads). Let's choose to create a first subgroup containing exactly 128 pennies. Since we are blindfolded, we can't choose *which* 128 pennies based on whether they are heads or tails. We simply reach out and pick up any 128 pennies by feel, counting them as we do so.

2.  **Separate the subgroups:** Once we have picked up 128 pennies, we set them aside to form our first subgroup (let's call this Subgroup A). The remaining pennies on the table form the second subgroup (Subgroup B).

3.  **Analyze the initial state (before flipping):**
    *   Let `H_total` be the total number of heads initially on the table. We know `H_total = 128`.
    *   Let `N_A` be the number of pennies in Subgroup A. We chose `N_A = 128`.
    *   Let `h_A` be the number of heads in Subgroup A *before* we do anything further. We don't know the value of `h_A` (it could be anywhere from 0 to 128, depending on which pennies we randomly picked).
    *   Let `t_A` be the number of tails in Subgroup A *before* we do anything further. We know `h_A + t_A = N_A = 128`. So, `t_A = 128 - h_A`.
    *   Now consider Subgroup B. The total number of heads was `H_total = 128`. If `h_A` heads were in Subgroup A, then the remaining heads must be in Subgroup B.
    *   Let `h_B` be the number of heads in Subgroup B. We know `h_B = H_total - h_A = 128 - h_A`.

4.  **Perform the flipping action (as suggested by the hint):** The hint says we can flip some subgroup. Let's flip all the pennies in Subgroup A.

5.  **Analyze the state after flipping Subgroup A:**
    *   We took Subgroup A, which initially had `h_A` heads and `t_A` tails.
    *   We flipped every single penny in Subgroup A.
    *   The original `h_A` heads in Subgroup A now become tails.
    *   The original `t_A` tails in Subgroup A now become heads.
    *   So, after flipping, the new number of heads in Subgroup A is `t_A`.

6.  **Substitute and Compare:**
    *   We know `t_A = 128 - h_A`.
    *   So, after flipping, the number of heads in Subgroup A is `128 - h_A`.
    *   The number of heads in Subgroup B (which we didn't touch after separating it) is `h_B = 128 - h_A`.

7.  **Conclusion:** After picking 128 pennies (Subgroup A), separating them from the rest (Subgroup B), and flipping all the pennies in Subgroup A, Subgroup A contains `128 - h_A` heads, and Subgroup B contains `128 - h_A` heads. The number of heads in both subgroups is the same, regardless of the initial unknown value of `h_A`.

**The procedure:**

1.  Reach onto the table and gather any 128 pennies. You can count them by feel.
2.  Separate these 128 pennies into one group (Subgroup A). The large number of remaining pennies form the second group (Subgroup B).
3.  Take Subgroup A (the 128 pennies) and, one by one, flip every single penny in this group over.
4.  You now have two subgroups: Subgroup A (the 128 pennies you flipped) and Subgroup B (the original remaining pennies). Both subgroups contain the same number of heads facing up.

Final answer: Reach onto the table and separate any 128 pennies to form the first subgroup. The remaining pennies form the second subgroup. Flip over every single penny in the first subgroup of 128 pennies. The number of heads in this subgroup will now be equal to the number of heads in the second subgroup.",True,1,0,0
104,"Question: Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
Manny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, ""I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.""
Moe answers, ""IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.""
Jack thinks for a bit, and then says, ""Now I know all of our numbers.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.
What numbers does she say they each are holding?
 Hint: Do casework on what Moe can have.",Do casework on what Moe can have.,"Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.
From Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.
There are 12 triples for (Manny, Moe, Jack) that satisfy all three statements. They are:
(1, 2, 11)
(1, 6, 7)
(1, 10, 3)
(3, 2, 9)
(3, 6, 5)
(3, 10, 1)
(5, 2, 7)
(5, 6, 3)
(7, 2, 5)
(7, 6, 1)
(9, 2, 3)
(11, 2, 1)
Since Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.

The puzzle requires finding 10 words where the last two letters of word N form the first two letters of word N+1, and the last two letters of word 10 form the first two letters of word 1.

The hint suggests finding the most obvious one first. Looking at the descriptions:
1. To prevent by fear
2. One of the muses
3. Often on the breakfast table
4. Steps for passing over a fence
5. Lawful
6. Solitary
7. A musical Roman emperor
8. A bird
9. To bury
10. To eat into

Description 7, ""A musical Roman emperor,"" is quite specific. The most famous Roman emperor associated with music (though often apocryphally linked to the fiddle while Rome burned) is Nero. Let's assume Word 7 is ""Nero"".

Step 1: Start with Word 7 based on the hint.
Word 7: Nero
The last two letters are 'ro'.

Step 2: Use the last two letters of Word 7 ('ro') as the first two letters of Word 8.
Word 8: A bird starting with 'ro'. A common bird name starting with 'ro' is ""Robin"".
Word 8: Robin
The last two letters are 'in'.

Step 3: Use the last two letters of Word 8 ('in') as the first two letters of Word 9.
Word 9: To bury starting with 'in'. A common word for burying is ""Inter"".
Word 9: Inter
The last two letters are 'er'.

Step 4: Use the last two letters of Word 9 ('er') as the first two letters of Word 10.
Word 10: To eat into starting with 'er'. This description fits words like ""Erode"".
Word 10: Erode
The last two letters are 'de'.

Step 5: Use the last two letters of Word 10 ('de') as the first two letters of Word 1.
Word 1: To prevent by fear starting with 'de'. This description fits words like ""Deter"".
Word 1: Deter
The last two letters are 'er'.

Step 6: Use the last two letters of Word 1 ('er') as the first two letters of Word 2.
Word 2: One of the muses starting with 'er'. The muses are Calliope, Clio, Erato, Euterpe, Melpomene, Polyhymnia, Terpsichore, Thalia, Urania. Both ""Erato"" and ""Euterpe"" start with 'er'. Let's try ""Erato"".
Word 2: Erato
The last two letters are 'to'.

Step 7: Use the last two letters of Word 2 ('to') as the first two letters of Word 3.
Word 3: Often on the breakfast table starting with 'to'. This description fits words like ""Toast"".
Word 3: Toast
The last two letters are 'st'.

Step 8: Use the last two letters of Word 3 ('st') as the first two letters of Word 4.
Word 4: Steps for passing over a fence starting with 'st'. This description fits the word ""Stile"".
Word 4: Stile
The last two letters are 'le'.

Step 9: Use the last two letters of Word 4 ('le') as the first two letters of Word 5.
Word 5: Lawful starting with 'le'. This description fits the word ""Legal"".
Word 5: Legal
The last two letters are 'al'.

Step 10: Use the last two letters of Word 5 ('al') as the first two letters of Word 6.
Word 6: Solitary starting with 'al'. This description fits the word ""Alone"".
Word 6: Alone
The last two letters are 'ne'.

Step 11: Use the last two letters of Word 6 ('ne') as the first two letters of Word 7.
Word 7: A musical Roman emperor starting with 'ne'. This leads us back to ""Nero"", which was our starting point.

Let's verify the complete sequence:
1. Deter (er)
2. Erato (to)
3. Toast (st)
4. Stile (le)
5. Legal (al)
6. Alone (ne)
7. Nero (ro)
8. Robin (in)
9. Inter (er)
10. Erode (de)
1. Deter (de) - The last two letters of Word 10 ('de') correctly form the first two letters of Word 1 ('Deter').

All words fit their descriptions and the chaining rule is satisfied for all 10 words, completing the cycle.

The words are:
1. Deter
2. Erato
3. Toast
4. Stile
5. Legal
6. Alone
7. Nero
8. Robin
9. Inter
10. Erode

Final check:
1. Deter (To prevent by fear) - Yes
2. Erato (One of the muses) - Yes
3. Toast (Often on the breakfast table) - Yes
4. Stile (Steps for passing over a fence) - Yes
5. Legal (Lawful) - Yes
6. Alone (Solitary) - Yes
7. Nero (A musical Roman emperor) - Yes
8. Robin (A bird) - Yes
9. Inter (To bury) - Yes
10. Erode (To eat into) - Yes

The chain:
Deter(er) -> Erato(to) -> Toast(st) -> Stile(le) -> Legal(al) -> Alone(ne) -> Nero(ro) -> Robin(in) -> Inter(er) -> Erode(de) -> Deter.

The reasoning is complete and the solution is consistent with all constraints.

Final answer:

108,"Question: In the legendary land of MADADIA,  Stu Pidfule, the inventor of dehydrated water, died in a freak Kebab wrestling accident. In his will, he left a provision of money to each of his three children, Derek, Eric and Monkeyboy. Derek invested his money wisely. Eric spent his money wildly. Monkeyboy spent all his on some magic beans that didn't grow. Stu Pidfule had been determined to treat each child equally, and in a way he did, even though Derek, Eric and Monkeyboy all got different amounts.
How could this be?
 Hint: nan",,He had left each of them the same thing. An amount equal to one year of their annual salary.  So in reality he left them all the same thing.,GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break down this riddle step by step, using the provided hint.

1.  **Analyze the Riddle:** The core of the riddle is a paradox: Stu Pidfule wanted to treat his three children (Derek, Eric, and Monkeyboy) equally, and in a way he *did* treat them equally, *even though* they received different amounts of money. This means the definition of ""equally treated"" must be something other than ""received the same numerical amount of money"".

2.  **Consider the Hint:** The hint is ""nan"". In mathematics and computing, ""NaN"" stands for ""Not a Number"". This is a special value representing an undefined or unrepresentable result, such as the result of dividing zero by zero (0/0).

3.  **Connect the Hint to the Paradox:** How can the concept of ""Not a Number"" relate to receiving money equally, yet getting different amounts?
    *   The key is that Stu treated them equally *by specifying the amount they would receive* in a particular way.
    *   The ""different amounts"" are the actual numerical values they ended up with.
    *   The ""equal treatment"" must relate to the specification itself.

4.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** What if Stu, in his will, specified the amount of money each child was to receive using a term or a calculation that results in ""Not a Number""? Since this specification was the same for each child, they were treated equally in the *method* of determining their inheritance.

5.  **Elaborate on the Hypothesis:** Let's take the mathematical concept of ""Not a Number"" (NaN) as the specified amount. Imagine the will read something like this:
    *   To Derek: ""an amount equivalent to Not a Number dollars""
    *   To Eric: ""an amount equivalent to Not a Number dollars""
    *   To Monkeyboy: ""an amount equivalent to Not a Number dollars""

6.  **Consider a Common Way to Get ""Not a Number"":** A common mathematical expression that results in ""Not a Number"" is 0 divided by 0. So, perhaps the will actually stated a formula:
    *   To Derek: ""0/0 dollars""
    *   To Eric: ""0/0 dollars""
    *   To Monkeyboy: ""0/0 dollars""

7.  **Explain the Outcome:** In this scenario, Stu treated each child equally because he specified the *exact same undefined amount* (Not a Number, or 0/0) for each of them in his will. However, since ""Not a Number"" is not a specific, quantifiable numerical value, the actual execution of the will would face a problem. How do you give someone ""Not a Number"" dollars? You can't.
    *   When faced with an undefined or impossible bequest like this, the legal system or the executors of the will would have to determine what to do. This might involve the bequest being deemed invalid, the money falling into the residual estate (which might then be distributed according to other rules), or perhaps interpreted in different ways depending on the specifics of the will and the applicable laws.
    *   Because the specified amount was undefined, there was no single, equal numerical value that *had* to be distributed to each child based *on that specific bequest*. This allowed, or perhaps forced, the actual numerical amounts they ultimately received to be different. The ""equality"" was in the *specification* of the same undefined value, not in the numerical *result* of that specification.

8.  **Synthesize the Reasoning:** Stu treated his children equally by leaving them each the same amount: an amount equivalent to ""Not a Number"". Since ""Not a Number"" does not correspond to a specific numerical value, the actual amount of money each child received ended up being different.

Final answer: Stu treated his children equally by leaving each of them an amount that was ""Not a Number"". Since ""Not a Number"" (NaN), such as the result of a calculation like 0 divided by 0, does not represent a specific numerical value, the actual amount of money each child received ended up being different. The equality was in the specification of the undefined amount, not in the numerical outcome.",True,0,0,0

So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.
But this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.
But the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.
Unfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.
Let's sum up the assumptions:
1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.
2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.
3. The flower doesn't want to die.
4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.
5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.
6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
7. The dog is rational.
8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.
9. The dog doesn't want to die.
10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).
11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.
13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.
14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.
15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.
So now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?
 Hint:  1:
We know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.
Hint 2:
Since the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower."," 1:

(As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)
But why will the dog eat the flower?
1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die
2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.
3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.
4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.
5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.
6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.
7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison
OK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).
8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous
9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

The RELIGIOUS FIGURES consist of the Pope, Mother Teresa and Gandhi.
The STOOGES, of course, are none other than Moe, Larry and Curly.
The Stooges decide to play a game with the rest of the group. The game is called Untouchable. The Stooges start the game by tapping certain ones on the shoulder a specific number of times. The object of the game is for the other groups to figure out the pattern the Stooges set (that is, why they tap certain individuals a certain number of times), and to follow the pattern they set.
The only stipulation to the game is that people belonging to the RELIGIOUS FIGURES group do not tap anyone; however, they can be tapped.

2, For each ball potted, the player will receive one point.
3, They all will play each other once.
4, A game will end when all the balls are potted.
5, The winner will be the player who scored the most points.
OUTCOMES
1, Hayden Seek finished with 18 points.
2, Al Gore-Rhythm finished with odd number of points.
3, Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points in the match between them.
4, There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm.
5, Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game.
6, Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff.
7, Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome.
Who won the competition?
How many points did each player score?
 Hint: Take large advantage of the 15 balls total rule",Take large advantage of the 15 balls total rule,"1) Hayden Seek finished with 18 points. - This was a given so my answer needs no explanation.
3) Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points. - Therefore, the score was 10 Dan Druff and 5 Hayden Seek; because there is only 15 balls which equals 15 points per game
There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm. - The final score had to be 7 and 8 and since Al Gore-Rhythm finished with an odd score, If you trialed both numbers you will notice Al Gore-Rhythm equaled out to have the 8 points therefore, Annie Buddyhome had the 7 points.
Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game. - Al Gore-Rhythm equaled 10 points and Dan Druff equaled 5 points so the score would be double winner and half for the loser.
Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff. Since the score was 10/5 with Dan Druff winning, that means that Hayden Seek scored 4 points in this game because of one point less.
Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome- Once again 15 points and the game is over, Dan Druff scores 7 and Annie Buddyhome scores 8.
By process of elimination; since Hayden Seek scores 18 points total and you can figure out the 5 points against Dan Druff and the 4 points against Al Gore-Rhythm 9 points was the only number that would fit into the equation.
Thus the scores are Al Gore-Rhythm 8 and Annie Buddyhome 7
Annie Buddyhome 8 and Dan Druff 7
Dan Druff 10 and Hayden Seek 5
Hayden Seek 4 and Al Gore-Rhythm 11
Al Gore-Rhythm 10 and Dan Druff 5
Annie Buddyhome 6 and Hayden Seek 9
Al Gore-Rhythm 11+10+8= 29 points (odd)
Annie Buddyhome 8+7+6=21 points
Hayden Seek 5+4+9=18 points (given)
Dan Druff 7+10+5=22 points

Let $P_X$ be the total points scored by player X in the competition.
Let $S_{XY}$ be the points scored by player X in the match against player Y.

According to the rules:
1. There are 4 players. They all play each other once. The number of matches is $\binom{4}{2} = 6$.
2. In each match, all 15 balls are potted. This means the sum of points scored by the two players in any match is 15. So, for any two players X and Y, $S_{XY} + S_{YX} = 15$.
3. The total points scored in the entire competition is the sum of points from all 6 matches. Since each match totals 15 points, the total points available are $6 \times 15 = 90$. Thus, $P_A + P_B + P_C + P_D = 90$.

We are given the following outcomes:
1.  Hayden Seek finished with 18 points: $P_D = 18$.
2.  Al Gore-Rhythm finished with an odd number of points: $P_A$ is odd.
3.  Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points in the match between them: $S_{CD} - S_{DC} = 5$.
    Using $S_{CD} + S_{DC} = 15$, we solve the system:
    $(S_{CD} - S_{DC}) + (S_{CD} + S_{DC}) = 5 + 15 \implies 2 S_{CD} = 20 \implies S_{CD} = 10$.
    Then $S_{DC} = 15 - S_{CD} = 15 - 10 = 5$.
    So, $S_{CD} = 10$ and $S_{DC} = 5$.

4.  There was one point difference in the match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm: $|S_{AB} - S_{BA}| = 1$.
    Using $S_{AB} + S_{BA} = 15$, this implies either $S_{AB} - S_{BA} = 1$ or $S_{AB} - S_{BA} = -1$.
    Case 1: $S_{AB} - S_{BA} = 1$. Adding $S_{AB} + S_{BA} = 15$, we get $2 S_{AB} = 16 \implies S_{AB} = 8$. Then $S_{BA} = 15 - 8 = 7$.
    Case 2: $S_{AB} - S_{BA} = -1$. Adding $S_{AB} + S_{BA} = 15$, we get $2 S_{AB} = 14 \implies S_{AB} = 7$. Then $S_{BA} = 15 - 7 = 8$.
    So, $(S_{AB}, S_{BA})$ is either (8, 7) or (7, 8).

5.  Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game: $S_{AC} = 2 S_{CA}$.
    Using $S_{AC} + S_{CA} = 15$, we substitute $S_{AC}$: $2 S_{CA} + S_{CA} = 15 \implies 3 S_{CA} = 15 \implies S_{CA} = 5$.
    Then $S_{AC} = 2 \times 5 = 10$.
    So, $S_{AC} = 10$ and $S_{CA} = 5$.

6.  Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff: $S_{DA} = S_{DC} - 1$.
    From outcome 3, we know $S_{DC} = 5$.
    So, $S_{DA} = 5 - 1 = 4$.
    Using $S_{AD} + S_{DA} = 15$, we get $S_{AD} + 4 = 15 \implies S_{AD} = 11$.
    So, $S_{DA} = 4$ and $S_{AD} = 11$.

7.  Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome: $S_{CB} = 7$.
    Using $S_{BC} + S_{CB} = 15$, we get $S_{BC} + 7 = 15 \implies S_{BC} = 8$.
    So, $S_{CB} = 7$ and $S_{BC} = 8$.

Let's list the known match scores:
$S_{CD} = 10, S_{DC} = 5$
$S_{AC} = 10, S_{CA} = 5$
$S_{AD} = 11, S_{DA} = 4$
$S_{CB} = 7, S_{BC} = 8$

The total points for each player are the sum of points from their three matches:
$P_A = S_{AB} + S_{AC} + S_{AD}$
$P_B = S_{BA} + S_{BC} + S_{BD}$
$P_C = S_{CA} + S_{CB} + S_{CD}$
$P_D = S_{DA} + S_{DB} + S_{DC}$

Substitute the known values:
$P_A = S_{AB} + 10 + 11 = S_{AB} + 21$
$P_B = S_{BA} + 8 + S_{BD}$
$P_C = 5 + 7 + 10 = 22$
$P_D = 4 + S_{DB} + 5 = S_{DB} + 9$

From outcome 1, $P_D = 18$.
$18 = S_{DB} + 9 \implies S_{DB} = 9$.
Using $S_{BD} + S_{DB} = 15$, we get $S_{BD} + 9 = 15 \implies S_{BD} = 6$.
So, $S_{DB} = 9$ and $S_{BD} = 6$.

Now we have all match scores determined except for $S_{AB}$ and $S_{BA}$:
$S_{CD} = 10, S_{DC} = 5$
$S_{AC} = 10, S_{CA} = 5$
$S_{AD} = 11, S_{DA} = 4$
$S_{CB} = 7, S_{BC} = 8$
$S_{DB} = 9, S_{BD} = 6$

We use outcome 4, which states that $(S_{AB}, S_{BA})$ is either (8, 7) or (7, 8).
Let's calculate $P_A$ for each possibility:
If $(S_{AB}, S_{BA}) = (8, 7)$:
$P_A = S_{AB} + 21 = 8 + 21 = 29$.
If $(S_{AB}, S_{BA}) = (7, 8)$:
$P_A = S_{AB} + 21 = 7 + 21 = 28$.

Now we use outcome 2, which states that $P_A$ is an odd number.
$P_A = 29$ is odd, while $P_A = 28$ is even.
Therefore, the correct values are $S_{AB} = 8$, $S_{BA} = 7$, and $P_A = 29$.

Now we can calculate the total points for all players using the determined match scores:
$P_A = S_{AB} + S_{AC} + S_{AD} = 8 + 10 + 11 = 29$.
$P_B = S_{BA} + S_{BC} + S_{BD} = 7 + 8 + 6 = 21$.
$P_C = S_{CA} + S_{CB} + S_{CD} = 5 + 7 + 10 = 22$.
$P_D = S_{DA} + S_{DB} + S_{DC} = 4 + 9 + 5 = 18$.

Let's verify the sum of total points: $P_A + P_B + P_C + P_D = 29 + 21 + 22 + 18 = 90$. This matches the total points available in the competition ($6 \times 15 = 90$).

The points scored by each player are:
Al Gore-Rhythm (A): 29 points
Annie Buddyhome (B): 21 points
Dan Druff (C): 22 points
Hayden Seek (D): 18 points

The winner of the competition is the player who scored the most points. Comparing the points: 29, 21, 22, 18.
The highest score is 29, which was achieved by Al Gore-Rhythm.

So, Al Gore-Rhythm won the competition.

The final answer is $\boxed{Al Gore-Rhythm won the competition. Al Gore-Rhythm scored 29 points, Annie Buddyhome scored 21 points, Dan Druff scored 22 points, and Hayden Seek scored 18 points.}$.",True,1,0,0

 Hint: Use the Number System",Use the Number System,"The number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0 on a US keyboard when you hold the shift button down.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break down this riddle using the hint ""Use the Number System"". We will examine each clue and see how it relates to concepts within mathematics, geometry, data, or systems that rely on numbers.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1.  **Analyze the Hint:** The hint tells us the answer is likely related to or part of a number system, or something that uses numbers extensively. This could be a mathematical concept, a geometric element, a computational idea, or something similar.

2.  **Examine Each Clue Individually and Connect to the Hint:**

    *   **Clue 1: I am always excited**
        *   This is a bit anthropomorphic. In a number system context, how could something be ""excited""? Perhaps it's a point of interest, a significant location, or represents data that is changing or notable (like peaks in a graph). It could also be wordplay. Let's keep this in mind but look for stronger connections first.

    *   **Clue 2: I tell people where things are at**
        *   Numbers are fundamentally used for location and position. This could refer to coordinates (like on a map or graph), addresses, indices in a list, or other ways of defining position using numbers.

    *   **Clue 3: You can play a game on me**
        *   Many games are played on grids (like chess, checkers, Battleship, Go) or involve positions defined by numbers or coordinates. This reinforces the idea of a structured space or system where locations are important.

    *   **Clue 4: I'm very rich**
        *   ""Rich"" could mean having a lot of something. In a numerical system, this could mean holding a lot of data, information, or possibilities. A location (defined by numbers) can be associated with a lot of descriptive data.

    *   **Clue 5: I give percentages**
        *   Percentages are numerical values, often representing parts of a whole (out of 100). While not directly a location, percentages are often *associated* with data points or locations (e.g., percentage change at a specific time or place). This strongly links the concept to numerical data.

    *   **Clue 6: I am always looking up**
        *   ""Looking up"" can mean searching for information at a specific place (like looking up a value in a table or database using a key/index). In a geometric context, the y-axis is often considered ""up"", so a position might be defined by its ""upward"" value (its y-coordinate). Or it could relate to searching/retrieval.

    *   **Clue 7: And.........**
        *   This seems like a pause or transition before more clues.

    *   **Clue 8: I look like a light in the sky**
        *   What looks like a light in the sky? A star. What does a star look like from Earth? A point of light. This suggests the answer might be visually represented as a small dot or mark.

    *   **Clue 9: I keep things arranged that are to my right**
        *   This suggests order and relative position within a system. If the answer is a specific entity, things to its ""right"" are arranged relative to it. This fits concepts like sequences, lists, arrays, or elements in a grid where items have neighbors to the left and right.

    *   **Clue 10: I keep things arranged that are to my left**
        *   Similar to clue 9, this reinforces the idea of order, sequence, and defined position relative to other elements in a structure or system.

3.  **Synthesize Clues and Identify the Core Concept:**
    *   Clues 2, 3, 9, and 10 strongly point towards something that defines *location*, *position*, and *arrangement* within a structure or system that uses numbers (like a grid, list, coordinate system, or data structure).
    *   Clue 8 suggests a small, distinct visual element like a ""point"".
    *   Clues 4, 5, and 6 suggest that this entity can hold or be associated with data (richness, percentages, looking up values).

4.  **Connect to ""Number System"" Concepts:** The concept of a ""Point"" fits very well within geometry (a point has coordinates), data analysis (a data point on a graph), and computer science (a point in space, a point in a sequence/list/array). These are all heavily reliant on number systems.

    Let's re-evaluate the clues with ""Point"" in mind:
    *   1. Excited: A point of interest, a critical data point. (Plausible interpretation)
    *   2. Tell where things are: A point's coordinates define a location. (Strong fit)
    *   3. Play a game on me: Games are played on grids or maps, made up of points (intersections or squares). Battleship involves targeting points. (Strong fit)
    *   4. Rich: A data point can be ""rich"" with associated information. (Good fit)
    *   5. Give percentages: Data points often represent percentages or are used in percentage calculations. (Good fit)
    *   6. Looking up: Looking up a value at a specific point (in a table or graph). A point on a graph often has a y-value (""up"" value). (Good fit)
    *   7. And...
    *   8. Looks like a light in the sky: A star is a point of light. Plotting data points on a chart can resemble points of light. (Strong fit)
    *   9. Arranged to my right: In a sequence or grid, points have neighbors to their right, defining order. (Strong fit)
    *   10. Arranged to my left: Similar to the right, points define the arrangement of elements to their left. (Strong fit)

5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the strong fit of ""Point"" with multiple clues, especially those related to position, arrangement, visual representation, and data association within the context of a ""Number System"", this is the most likely answer.

The final answer is $\boxed{A Point}$.",True,0,0,0

124,"Question: A plain white cube has gone through 4 steps to become what it is now. The steps (not necessarily in order) are:
a) The whole cube being painted red
b) A white circle being painted on every face except for the top and back
c) The front and back faces being painted black
d) The top, back, and bottom being painted blue
All of the following facts about painting the cube are true:
1. After the last of the four steps, the top face was all purple, the left and right faces were red with a pink circle in each of their centers, the front black with a gray circle, the bottom purple with a light blue circle, and the back completely dark blue.
2. Color mixing goes as follows:
-Red+Blue=Purple
-Black+White=Gray
-Red+White=Pink
-Blue+White=Light Blue
-Red+Black=Maroon
-Blue+Black=Dark Blue
3. Once black is added to a face, it will mix with the colors on the face if possible, but it cannot be changed at all afterwards. This is not true with white.
4. Any area where two colors have been mixed cannot change color.
5. Exactly one of the following is true:
-Black was added first.
-Red was added before blue.
-Blue was added after white.
-White was added last.
In what order were the colors added?
 Hint: If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","White, blue, black, red.
Because there are both gray and dark blue regions, black was added after both white and blue. This means black was not first, and neither blue nor white was last.
Black has to have been added before red, because if it wasn't, the front face would be maroon with a pink center. So black was not last, and red was not first.
Since neither blue, black, nor white was last, red had to be added last. Combining this with other facts, white and blue could not be added third. So black was third.
Going back to the statements of which one is true, we can now figure out the lies. Red was added last, so statement 4 is false. Black was added third, so statement 1 is false. Red was not added before any other colors, so statement 2 is false. This makes statement 3 true. White was added before blue, so white is first, and blue is second.

125,"Question: A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote thirteen pairs of letters on a rock:
A-V
B-W
C-Q
D-M
E-K
F-U
G-N
H-P
I-O
J-R
L-X
S-T
Y-Z
""These thirteen pairs consist of all 26 letters of the alphabet,"" said the troll. ""The password contains thirteen letters, no two of which are the same. Each pair consists of one letter that is in the password and one other letter. If you wrote out the ""other"" letters in alphabetical order and then wrote each ""password"" letter under each one's corresponding ""other"" letter, you would have the correct spelling of the password.""
Then the troll wrote five short words on the rock: FACE, QUEST, QUICK, SWITCH, and WORLD. ""Each short word contains exactly the same number of letters with the password,"" he said.
So, what is the password?
 Hint: Q cannot exist in the password without U.",Q cannot exist in the password without U.,"The password is UNPREDICTABLY.
Exactly one of S and T must be in the password. So QUEST, and so each word, must have at least one letter in common with the password.
Suppose each word has one common letter . Then none of Q, U, and E can be in the word, so C, F, and K must be in the word. But now FACE has at least two letters in common.
Suppose each word has two common letters. The second common letter in QUEST cannot be Q. Suppose it is U. Then C and K must be in the password and F cannot. But now QUICK has at least three common letters.
Suppose the second common letter in QUEST is E. Then C and F must be in the password and K cannot. But now FACE has at least three common letters.
Suppose each word has four common letters. Then Q, U, and E must be in the password, and C, F, and K cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So each word has three common letters. The second and third common letters in QUEST cannot be Q and E. Suppose they are Q and U. Then K must be in the password, and C and F cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So the second and third common letters in QUEST must be U and E. Then C must be in the password, and F and K cannot. The third common letter in FACE must be A, so V cannot. The third common letter in QUICK must be I, so O cannot.
Like QUEST, SWITCH contains both S and T. I and C are in the password, so W and H cannot. Since neither W nor O can be in the password, the three common letters in WORLD must be R, L, and D, so J, X, and M cannot.
Writing each determined ""other"" letter in alphabetical order, and writing each ""password"" letter under its corresponding ""other"" letter, we get:
F H J K M O Q V W X
U P R E D  I  C A B L
The pairs S-T and Y-Z can each only be placed in one spot here:

126,"Question: The rugby season may be over, but the wheeling and dealing is just reaching a high point. Recently, each of six teams acquired a different, valuable, player to beef up its roster. Each player specializes in a different position (one is a prop), and, coincidentally enough, each was acquired from a different one of the other teams. Each felt a pang of regret at leaving his former team, but is eagerly awaiting the first scrum of the season with his new mates. From the following clues, can you match each player with his position, new team and former team?
1. The one from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets.
2. The Mountaineers, Troopers and Typhoons signed the fullback, the player who left the Downers and Cowan, in some order.
3. The Downers, Scarlets and Jets lost Tuitupou, the center and the player who signed with the Typhoons, in some order.
4. Jeeper and the center signed with the Downers and the Typhoons, in some order.
5. Rokocoko and McGuyver left the Mountaineers and the Troopers, in some order.
6. The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets.
7. The hooker cleared his stuff out of his former Downer locker last week.
8. Rokocoko isn't the fullback.
9. The wing's wife was delighted that her husband signed with the Scarlets.
10. Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets.
11. The fly half, who isn't going to the Mountaineers, isn't Cowan.
 Hint: The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).","The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).","The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).
The wing signed with the Scarlets. Since the player from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 1), this is a fourth player.
Cowan is neither the hooker who left the Downers nor the wing who signed with the Scarlets (clue 2), so he is a fifth player.
Cowan is not the fullback (clue 2) or the fly half (clue 11).
The center cannot have signed with the Typhoons (clue 3), so the center must have signed with the Downers while Jeeper signed with the Typhoons (clue 4). This means that Cowan cannot be the center (clue 2), and must therefore be the prop.
The center didn't leave the Troopers or the Mountaineers (clue 3), so he is the 6th player, leaving Rokocoko and McGuyver as the fullback and the fly half, in some order.
At this point we know the following information about the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) the hooker, left the Downers
4) the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) the center
Since Jeeper signed with the Typhoons, he is one of the three people listed in clue 2: he obviously isn't Cowan, so he is either the fullback or the player who left the Downers, ie the hooker (clue 7). We've established that Jeeper cannot be the fullback, so he is the hooker.
Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 10), so he is the center. This leaves Tuitupou as the wing.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers
The player that left the Mountaineers couldn't have also signed with the Mountaineers, so Cowan signed with the Mountaineers, and the player that left the Mountaineers signed with the Troopers.
The fullback didn't sign with the Jets (clue 2), so the fullback signed with the Troopers and the fly half signed with the Jets.
Rokocoko isn't the fullback (clue 8), so McGuyver is the fullback and Rokocoko is the fly half.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, signed with the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers.
Tuitupou left the Downers, the Scarlets or the Jets (clue 3). We've established that Jeeper left the Downers, and since Tuitupou signed with the Scarlets, he must have left the Jets.
The Scarlets, therefore, lost the center (clue 3).
By process of elimination, Cowan left the Typhoons.
So these are the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, left the Jets for the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, left the Typhoons for the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, left the Scarlets for the Downers.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

In any weighing, each weight can be placed in one of three ways: on the plate with the gold, on the plate without the gold, on the desk next to the balance. So given n weights, there are 3^n possible combinations.
Throw out the case where all weights are on the table. That leaves 3^n – 1 cases.
Half of those cases would weigh negative gold, so eliminate half of these.
Thus, the number of valid combinations for n weights is (3^n – 1) / 2.

130,"Question: Five young ladies (Liz, Marge, Sam, Ella and Jenny) went on five different hiking adventures. Each walked a distance of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 kilometers (random order). Each were able to take an extraordinary wildlife photograph in different locations (forest, meadow, mountain, river side and bushes) of different animals (rabbit, bird, deer, fox and bear cubs).  From the clues below determine where and of what each girl took a photograph of, and the distance each travelled.
1.  Liz walked twice as far as the girl who saw the deer.  The girl who got a shot of the fox travelled one kilometer less than Jenny.  The girl in the bushes was not the one who walked 5 kilometers.  The girl on the riverside walked either one kilometer more or less than the one who was in the bushes.
2.  The girl who was quick enough to capture the rabbit on film walked farther than Marge, but not as far as the one who got the bear cubs.  The girl who hiked up the mountain walked farther than at least one other girl, but not the farthest.  Either Ella or Sam walked more than one kilometer farther than the other.  Sam did not get a picture of the bird.  The mountain climber walked either one kilometer more or less than Marge.
3.  The meadow explorer was not the one to take a picture of the bird.  The bear cubs and the fox were not captured in the forest.  Ella hiked farther than the mountain climber. The girl in the meadow walked one kilometer more or less than the mountain climber.

132,"Question: Madadia is split, like other countries, into cities, towns and villages. Some are large and some are small. Postman Patel delivers the mail in the village of ""Lardville"".
Now Lardville is so small there is only one street with only ten houses, numbered from 1 to 10.
In a certain week, Patel did not deliver any mail at two houses in the village; at the other houses he delivered mail three times each. Each working day he delivered mail at exactly four houses.
The sums of the house numbers where he delivered mail were:
on Monday: 18
on Tuesday: 12
on Wednesday: 23
on Thursday: 19
on Friday: 32
on Saturday: 25
on Sunday: he never works just in case any murder suspects try to use this as an excuse.
Can you work out which two houses received no mail this week?
 Hint: If postman Patel would have delivered mail three times at each house, then the total sum of the house numbers per day would be (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)x3=165.

The following combinations are possible:
2+10

3rd balance:  Balance the two L's against each other.  If unequal, the lighter side is a light ball.  If equal, the H is a heavy ball.
b) If the 2nd balance is not equal, then either the 2H has the heavy ball or the opposing L is light.
3rd balance: Balance the two H balls from the heavier side against each other.  If equal, then L is a light ball.  If not, the heavier H is a heavy ball.

He wondered how many ways are there of arranging the sixteen black or white pieces of the chess set on the first two rows of the board?
Obviously, Mad Ade did not bother working it out as the Kebab shop opened almost immediately as he thought about it.
What would have been the answer if Mad Ade wasn't so greedy and had worked it out?
Given that each pawn is identical and each rook, knight and bishop is identical to its pair.
 Hint: Treat them as non-duplicate, then divide to account for duplicates","Treat them as non-duplicate, then divide to account for duplicates","For 16 pieces that are all different the answer is 16! (!=factorial ie. 16x15x14...x1)
But, we have duplicate combinations because there are identical pieces being used. The number of duplicate combinations is =
2 (for Rooks) x 2 (for Knights) x 2(for Bishops) x 8! (for Pawns).
This gives 8x8! = 322560.
Dividing 16! by 322560 gives us the number of unique combinations for a normal chess set = 64864800 different ways.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step, just as Mad Ade *would* have if he hadn't been distracted by the call of the Kebab shop.

1.  **Identify the Task:** The problem asks for the number of ways to arrange the sixteen pieces of *one* color (either black or white, the structure of the set is the same for both) on the first two rows of a standard chessboard.

2.  **Determine the Space:** The first two rows of a chessboard consist of 8 squares in the first row and 8 squares in the second row. This gives a total of 8 + 8 = 16 squares.

3.  **Determine the Pieces:** A standard chess set for one color (say, white) consists of:
    *   8 Pawns (P)
    *   2 Rooks (R)
    *   2 Knights (N)
    *   2 Bishops (B)
    *   1 Queen (Q)
    *   1 King (K)

    Let's count the pieces: 8 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 16 pieces.
    So, we are arranging exactly 16 pieces onto exactly 16 specific squares. This is a permutation problem.

4.  **Consider the Identical Pieces:** The problem states that pawns are identical, rooks are identical, knights are identical, and bishops are identical. The Queen and King are unique pieces (each appears only once in the set).
    *   We have 8 identical Pawns.
    *   We have 2 identical Rooks.
    *   We have 2 identical Knights.
    *   We have 2 identical Bishops.
    *   We have 1 unique Queen.
    *   We have 1 unique King.

5.  **Apply the Hint:** The hint says, ""Treat them as non-duplicate, then divide to account for duplicates.""
    *   If all 16 pieces were unique (like having labels P1, P2, ..., P8, R1, R2, etc.), the number of ways to arrange 16 distinct items on 16 distinct squares would be the total number of permutations of 16 items, which is 16!.

    *   However, since some pieces are identical, swapping identical pieces does not create a new, distinguishable arrangement. We have overcounted. To correct for this overcounting, we need to divide the total permutations (16!) by the number of ways the identical pieces can be arranged among themselves for each set of identical pieces.
        *   For the 8 identical pawns, there are 8! ways to arrange them among the positions they occupy.
        *   For the 2 identical rooks, there are 2! ways to arrange them.
        *   For the 2 identical knights, there are 2! ways to arrange them.
        *   For the 2 identical bishops, there are 2! ways to arrange them.
        *   For the 1 queen, there is 1! way to arrange it (1! = 1).
        *   For the 1 king, there is 1! way to arrange it (1! = 1).

    The formula for permutations with repetitions is:
    Number of arrangements = (Total number of items)! / [(count of item type 1)! * (count of item type 2)! * ...]

    In this case:
    Number of arrangements = 16! / (8! * 2! * 2! * 2! * 1! * 1!)

6.  **Calculate the Value:**
    *   16! = 20,922,789,888,000
    *   8! = 40,320
    *   2! = 2
    *   1! = 1

    The denominator is 8! * 2! * 2! * 2! * 1! * 1! = 40,320 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 40,320 * 8 = 322,560.

    So, the number of arrangements is 16! / (8! * 2! * 2! * 2!)
    = 16! / (8! * 8)

    Let's simplify the calculation by writing out the factorials and cancelling terms:
    16! / (8! * 8) = (16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * 8)
    Cancel out the 8! term from the numerator and the denominator:
    = (16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / 8

    Now, divide 16 by 8:
    = (16/8) * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9
    = 2 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9

    Now, perform the multiplication:
    = 30 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9
    = 420 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9
    = 5460 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9
    = 65520 * 11 * 10 * 9
    = 720720 * 10 * 9
    = 7207200 * 9
    = 64,864,800

7.  **Final Answer:** The number of ways to arrange the sixteen pieces on the first two rows according to the rules is 64,864,800.

**Clue #1:  If she received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, she could not have received 1 message on Thursday as the day she cleaned her room would have to be 0, which is not an option.  She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.
**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.
**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.
**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.
*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

| Day     | Room                      | Messages                  |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Monday  | B, LR, Ba, D, K           | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5             |
| Tuesday | B, LR, Ba, D, K           | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5             |
| Wednesday| B, LR, Ba, D, K           | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5             |
| Thursday| B, LR, Ba, D, K           | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5             |
| Friday  | B, LR, Ba, D, K           | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5             |

We also implicitly have relationships between Room and Messages, Room and Day, and Messages and Day.

**Step 1: Apply Clue #4.**
*   Clue #4: Emily cleaned the kitchen on Wednesday.
*   This gives us a direct assignment: Wednesday = Kitchen.
*   Update tables:
    *   Wednesday's Room is Kitchen.
    *   No other day can be Kitchen.
    *   Wednesday cannot be any other room.

| Day     | Room                      | Messages                  |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Monday  | B, LR, Ba, D, ~~K~~       | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5             |
| Tuesday | B, LR, Ba, D, ~~K~~       | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5             |
| Wednesday| ~~B, LR, Ba, D,~~ K       | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5             |
| Thursday| B, LR, Ba, D, ~~K~~       | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5             |
| Friday  | B, LR, Ba, D, ~~K~~       | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5             |

**Step 2: Apply Clue #2 and combine with Step 1.**
*   Clue #2: Emily cleaned the bathroom on the day after receiving just one message and one day before she cleaned the den.
*   This describes a sequence of three consecutive days: (Day with 1 message) -> (Bathroom day) -> (Den day).
*   The possible consecutive day sequences are: (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday), (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday), (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday).
*   Let's test these sequences:
    *   If the sequence is (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday): Monday has 1 message, Tuesday is Bathroom, Wednesday is Den. This contradicts Clue 4 which says Wednesday is Kitchen. So, this is not the correct sequence.
    *   If the sequence is (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday): Tuesday has 1 message, Wednesday is Bathroom, Thursday is Den. This contradicts Clue 4 which says Wednesday is Kitchen. So, this is not the correct sequence.
    *   If the sequence is (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday): Wednesday has 1 message, Thursday is Bathroom, Friday is Den. Let's check consistency with Clue 4. Clue 4 says Wednesday is Kitchen. So, if this sequence is correct, Wednesday (Kitchen) must have 1 message, Thursday must be Bathroom, and Friday must be Den. This is consistent.
*   Therefore, we deduce:
    *   Wednesday has 1 message and is Kitchen. (Confirms Clue 4 and assigns message)
    *   Thursday is Bathroom.
    *   Friday is Den.

*   Update tables based on these new assignments:
    *   Wednesday: Kitchen, 1 message
    *   Thursday: Bathroom
    *   Friday: Den

| Day     | Room        | Messages |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Monday  | B, LR       | 2, 3, 4, 5 | (Remaining rooms/messages)
| Tuesday | B, LR       | 2, 3, 4, 5 | (Remaining rooms/messages)
| Wednesday| Kitchen     | 1        |
| Thursday| Bathroom    | 2, 3, 4, 5 |
| Friday  | Den         | 2, 3, 4, 5 |

*   We also know:
    *   Kitchen = 1 message
    *   Bathroom = Thursday's messages
    *   Den = Friday's messages
    *   1 message = Wednesday (Kitchen)

**Step 3: Apply Clue #1 and deduce remaining rooms.**
*   Clue #1: Emily received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, but fewer than on Tuesday.
*   Let M_Thu be messages on Thursday, M_Bed be messages on the Bedroom day, and M_Tue be messages on Tuesday.
*   The clue states: M_Bed < M_Thu < M_Tue.
*   We know Thursday is Bathroom (from Step 2). So M_Thu = Messages on Bathroom day.
*   We know Tuesday's room is either Bedroom or Living Room (remaining options).
*   We know the Bedroom day is either Monday or Tuesday (remaining options for Bedroom).

*   Let's consider Tuesday's room:
    *   If Tuesday is the Bedroom day: Then M_Tue = M_Bed. The inequality M_Bed < M_Thu < M_Tue becomes M_Bed < M_Thu < M_Bed, which is impossible. So, Tuesday is NOT the Bedroom day.
    *   If Tuesday is NOT the Bedroom day, then Monday must be the Bedroom day (as Bedroom is one of the remaining rooms for Monday/Tuesday). If Monday is Bedroom, then Tuesday must be Living Room (the only remaining room).
*   This fixes the remaining Day-Room assignments: Monday = Bedroom, Tuesday = Living Room.

*   Update Day-Room pairings:
    *   Monday: Bedroom
    *   Tuesday: Living Room
    *   Wednesday: Kitchen (confirmed)
    *   Thursday: Bathroom (confirmed)
    *   Friday: Den (confirmed)

| Day     | Room        | Messages |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Monday  | Bedroom     | 2, 3, 4, 5 |
| Tuesday | Living Room | 2, 3, 4, 5 |
| Wednesday| Kitchen     | 1        |
| Thursday| Bathroom    | 2, 3, 4, 5 |
| Friday  | Den         | 2, 3, 4, 5 |

*   Now, restate Clue 1 using the specific days: Messages on Monday < Messages on Thursday < Messages on Tuesday.
*   Let M_Mon, M_Thu, M_Tue be the message counts. M_Mon < M_Thu < M_Tue.
*   The available messages for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday are {2, 3, 4, 5}.
*   M_Mon, M_Thu, and M_Tue must be three distinct numbers from {2, 3, 4, 5} that satisfy the inequality.
*   Possible ordered triplets (M_Mon, M_Thu, M_Tue) from {2, 3, 4, 5}:
    *   (2, 3, 4)
    *   (2, 3, 5)
    *   (2, 4, 5)
    *   (3, 4, 5)

**Step 4: Apply Clue #3 and find the specific message counts.**
*   Clue #3: She received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den.
*   Bedroom day is Monday (from Step 3). Den day is Friday (from Step 2).
*   So, M_Mon > M_Fri.
*   M_Fri is the message count for Friday. For each possible triplet (M_Mon, M_Thu, M_Tue) identified in Step 3, the remaining number in the set {2, 3, 4, 5} is M_Fri. We then check if M_Mon > M_Fri.

*   Let's check each possibility:
    *   Triplet (2, 3, 4): M_Mon = 2, M_Thu = 3, M_Tue = 4. The remaining number in {2, 3, 4, 5} is 5. So M_Fri = 5.
        *   Check Clue 3: M_Mon > M_Fri? Is 2 > 5? No. Eliminate this possibility.
    *   Triplet (2, 3, 5): M_Mon = 2, M_Thu = 3, M_Tue = 5. The remaining number is 4. So M_Fri = 4.
        *   Check Clue 3: M_Mon > M_Fri? Is 2 > 4? No. Eliminate this possibility.
    *   Triplet (2, 4, 5): M_Mon = 2, M_Thu = 4, M_Tue = 5. The remaining number is 3. So M_Fri = 3.
        *   Check Clue 3: M_Mon > M_Fri? Is 2 > 3? No. Eliminate this possibility.
    *   Triplet (3, 4, 5): M_Mon = 3, M_Thu = 4, M_Tue = 5. The remaining number is 2. So M_Fri = 2.
        *   Check Clue 3: M_Mon > M_Fri? Is 3 > 2? Yes. This possibility is consistent with all clues.

*   This uniquely determines the message counts:
    *   M_Mon (Monday) = 3
    *   M_Tue (Tuesday) = 5
    *   M_Wed (Wednesday) = 1 (from Step 2)
    *   M_Thu (Thursday) = 4
    *   M_Fri (Friday) = 2

**Step 5: Consolidate the final answer.**
Combine the Day-Room pairings from Step 3 and the Day-Message pairings from Step 4.

| Day     | Room        | Messages |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Monday  | Bedroom     | 3        |
| Tuesday | Living Room | 5        |
| Wednesday| Kitchen     | 1        |
| Thursday| Bathroom    | 4        |
| Friday  | Den         | 2        |

Let's do a final check against all clues:
*   #1) Messages on Thursday (4) > Messages on Bedroom day (Monday, 3). (4 > 3 = Yes). Messages on Thursday (4) < Messages on Tuesday (5). (4 < 5 = Yes). Clue 1 holds (3 < 4 < 5).
*   #2) Bathroom (Thursday) is the day after receiving 1 message (Wednesday had 1). Yes. Bathroom (Thursday) is one day before Den (Friday). Yes. Clue 2 holds.
*   #3) Messages on Bedroom day (Monday, 3) > Messages on Den day (Friday, 2). (3 > 2 = Yes). Clue 3 holds.
*   #4) Kitchen on Wednesday. Yes. Clue 4 holds.

All clues are satisfied. The solution is consistent.

Final answer:
Monday: Bedroom, 3 messages
Tuesday: Living Room, 5 messages
Wednesday: Kitchen, 1 message
Thursday: Bathroom, 4 messages
Friday: Den, 2 messages",True,1,0,0
139,"Question: In order to best use his study time, Caleb has enlisted the help of four other students in his philosophy class by forming a study group.  Each of the five students is assigned to read one of the first 5 chapters of their text Great Minds Don't Necessarily Think Alike, and prepare a summary of the chapter to present to the group.  Can you determine the title of each of the five chapters, as well as the student responsible for reading it?
Given:
Chapters -- 		1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Chapter Titles --		Descartes Before DesHorse, Freudian Slippers, I Kant Understand It, Jung At Heart, Sense of Hume-or
Student Names -- 	Alex, Caleb, Joan, Kiera, Toby
Clues:
#1) Alex's chapter immediately follows ""Sense of Hume-or"" and immediately precedes ""Descartes Before DesHorse.""
#2) ""Jung At Heart"" is the name of a chapter that comes somewhere before the chapter assigned to Toby.
#3) Kiera's chapter is three chapters after ""Freudian Slippers.""
#4) Two consecutive chapters, in one order or the another, are ""I Kant Understand It"" and Joan's chapter (which isn't chapter four)

Chapter 2 -- ""Freudian Slippers"" -- Toby
Chapter 3 -- ""Sense of Hume-or"" -- Joan
Chapter 4 -- ""I Kant Understand It"" -- Alex
Chapter 5 -- ""Descartes Before DesHorse"" -- Kiera
**Clue #1:  This gives us an order.  We know that three of the chapters are, in this order, (Sense, Alex's, Descartes).  Therefore, Alex's chapter can not be the first chapter, or the last.  ""Sense"" can not be the last chapter, and ""Descartes"" can not be the first.  We can also assume that ""Sense"" nor ""Descartes"" is Alex's chapter.
**Clue #2:  This lets us know that Toby's chapter can not be the first chapter, and that ""Jung"" can not be the last chapter.  We assume ""Jung"" is not Toby's chapter.
**Clue #3:  If Kiera's chapter is three AFTER ""Freud"", then ""Freud"" can NOT be the 3rd, 4th or 5th chapter.  This also means that Kiera's chapter can not be the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd chapters.
**Clue #4:  Joan's chapter is not 4th.  If ""Kant"" is 5th, Joan's would be 4th.  So we know that ""Kant"" is not the 5th chapter.  That leaves ""Descartes"" as the 5th chapter.  Assume Joan's chapter is not ""Kant.""
*********Recall the order given in Clue 1.  This means Alex's chapter is 4th, and ""Sense"" is 3rd.  This also leaves Kiera's as the 5th chapter, which is ""Descartes"".  For hers to be 3 after ""Freud"", ""Freud"" has the be the 2nd chapter.  We know that ""Jung"" comes before Toby's chapter.  This leaves chapters 1 and 4.  If ""Jung"" is chapter 4, Toby's would be 5, but we know that 5 is Kiera's, so ""Jung"" has to be chapter 1.  This makes ""Kant"" chapter 4, and Alex's chapter.  This means that Joans has to be the 3rd or the 5th because of the order between Joan's chapter and ""Kant"" that we were already given, and we already know that Kiera has the 5th chapter.  So we know that Joan has chapter 3, ""Sense.""   After marking off the chapter numbers by the names, you see that Toby's is chapter 2, ""Freud"" and that leaves Caleb with chapter 1, ""Jung.""",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

From (1) and (3), the house number must be from 50 to 59 or 70 to 79. Take any number. It will be either a multiple of 3 or not. Also, a number multiple of 6 is always a multiple of 3. Hence, the house number can be 51, 54, 57, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76, 77 or 79.
From (2), if the house number is not a multiple of 4, then it is a number from 60 through 69. There is not a single number between 60 and 69 in short-listed numbers above. Hence, the house number must be a multiple of 4 i.e. 76.
Hence, Mad Ade's house number is 76.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $H$ be Mad Ade's house number. The problem gives three conditional statements about $H$. Let's represent the conditions and ranges:
$C_1$: $H$ is a multiple of 3.
$C_2$: $H$ is a multiple of 4.
$C_3$: $H$ is a multiple of 6.
$R_1$: $50 \le H \le 59$.
$R_2$: $60 \le H \le 69$.
$R_3$: $70 \le H \le 79$.

The three statements given by Mad Ade are:
(1) $C_1 \implies R_1$
(2) $\neg C_2 \implies R_2$
(3) $\neg C_3 \implies R_3$

We are given that all three statements are true for Mad Ade's house number $H$.

Let's use the hint, which states that from (1) and (3), the house number must be from 50 to 59 or 70 to 79. We can verify this.
The contrapositive of statement (1) is $\neg R_1 \implies \neg C_1$. This means if $H$ is not in the range [50, 59], then $H$ is not a multiple of 3.
The contrapositive of statement (3) is $\neg R_3 \implies \neg (\neg C_3)$, which simplifies to $\neg R_3 \implies C_3$. This means if $H$ is not in the range [70, 79], then $H$ is a multiple of 6.

Let's consider the possibility that $H$ is not in $R_1$ and not in $R_3$. This means $H \notin R_1 \cup R_3$.
If $H \notin R_1$, then by the contrapositive of (1), $H$ is not a multiple of 3.
If $H \notin R_3$, then by the contrapositive of (3), $H$ is a multiple of 6.
So, if $H \notin R_1 \cup R_3$, then $H$ is a multiple of 6 and $H$ is not a multiple of 3.
However, any multiple of 6 is also a multiple of 3 (since $6k = 3 \times (2k)$). So, a number cannot be a multiple of 6 and not a multiple of 3 simultaneously.
This means the assumption that $H \notin R_1 \cup R_3$ must be false.
Therefore, $H$ must be in $R_1 \cup R_3$.
$H \in \{H \in \mathbb{Z} \mid 50 \le H \le 59 \text{ or } 70 \le H \le 79\}$.

Now let's consider statement (2): $\neg C_2 \implies R_2$.
The contrapositive of statement (2) is $\neg R_2 \implies \neg (\neg C_2)$, which simplifies to $\neg R_2 \implies C_2$. This means if $H$ is not in the range [60, 69], then $H$ is a multiple of 4.

From our deduction using statements (1) and (3), $H$ is either in $R_1$ or $R_3$.
If $H \in R_1$ ($50 \le H \le 59$), then $H < 60$. Thus, $H \notin R_2$.
If $H \in R_3$ ($70 \le H \le 79$), then $H > 69$. Thus, $H \notin R_2$.
In both possible cases for $H$, $H \notin R_2$.
Since $\neg R_2$ is true for $H$, the implication $\neg R_2 \implies C_2$ requires $C_2$ to be true.
So, $H$ must be a multiple of 4.

Combining the results: $H$ must be in the range [50, 59] or [70, 79], AND $H$ must be a multiple of 4.
Let's list the multiples of 4 in these ranges:
In [50, 59]: $52 = 4 \times 13$, $56 = 4 \times 14$.
In [70, 79]: $72 = 4 \times 18$, $76 = 4 \times 19$.
So the possible values for $H$ are $\{52, 56, 72, 76\}$.

Now we must check each of these candidates against all three original statements to find the unique house number.

Candidate 1: $H = 52$.
$C_1$: 52 is not a multiple of 3 (5+2=7). $C_1$ is False.
$R_1$: $50 \le 52 \le 59$. $R_1$ is True.
Statement (1): $C_1 \implies R_1$ is $False \implies True$, which is True. Statement (1) holds for $H=52$.

$C_2$: 52 is a multiple of 4 (52=4x13). $C_2$ is True. $\neg C_2$ is False.

 Hint: Try a phone.",Try a phone.,Imagination!  Look on a telephone; the first row is what number to look on.  The second row is which letter to look at!,GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem using the hint.

1.  **Understand the Problem:** The input is a group of numbers presented in two lines, each containing 11 digits. This group of numbers encodes an 11-letter word. The goal is to decode the numbers to reveal the word.

2.  **Analyze the Hint:** The hint is ""Try a phone"". This strongly suggests using a standard phone keypad as the basis for decoding the numbers into letters. A standard phone keypad assigns letters to digits 2 through 9.

    *   2: A, B, C
    *   3: D, E, F
    *   4: G, H, I
    *   5: J, K, L
    *   6: M, N, O
    *   7: P, Q, R, S
    *   8: T, U, V
    *   9: W, X, Y, Z
    *   1, 0: Typically have no letters, or sometimes special characters or limited letters (like QZ on 1).

3.  **Analyze the Number Structure:** There are two lines of 11 digits. Since the problem states the numbers represent *an* 11-letter word, it is likely that each corresponding pair of digits (one from the first line, one from the second line) encodes a single letter in the word's sequence. For example, the first letter is encoded by (4, 3), the second by (6, 1), the third by (2, 1), and so on, up to the eleventh letter encoded by (6, 2).

4.  **Hypothesize the Decoding Method:** Given the phone keypad layout and the two numbers per letter position, a plausible method is that the first number in each pair indicates the digit pressed on the keypad, and the second number indicates which letter associated with that digit is the correct one (e.g., 1st letter, 2nd letter, or 3rd letter).

5.  **Apply the Decoding Method to Each Position:** Let's apply this hypothesis to each of the 11 pairs of numbers:

    *   **Position 1:** (4, 3)
        *   Digit 4 corresponds to letters G, H, I.
        *   The second number is 3, indicating the 3rd letter.
        *   The 3rd letter on digit 4 is **I**.

    *   **Position 2:** (6, 1)
        *   Digit 6 corresponds to letters M, N, O.
        *   The second number is 1, indicating the 1st letter.
        *   The 1st letter on digit 6 is **M**.

    *   **Position 3:** (2, 1)
        *   Digit 2 corresponds to letters A, B, C.
        *   The second number is 1, indicating the 1st letter.
        *   The 1st letter on digit 2 is **A**.

    *   **Position 4:** (4, 1)
        *   Digit 4 corresponds to letters G, H, I.
        *   The second number is 1, indicating the 1st letter.
        *   The 1st letter on digit 4 is **G**.

    *   **Position 5:** (4, 3)
        *   Digit 4 corresponds to letters G, H, I.
        *   The second number is 3, indicating the 3rd letter.
        *   The 3rd letter on digit 4 is **I**.

    *   **Position 6:** (6, 2)
        *   Digit 6 corresponds to letters M, N, O.
        *   The second number is 2, indicating the 2nd letter.
        *   The 2nd letter on digit 6 is **N**.

    *   **Position 7:** (2, 1)
        *   Digit 2 corresponds to letters A, B, C.
        *   The second number is 1, indicating the 1st letter.
        *   The 1st letter on digit 2 is **A**.

    *   **Position 8:** (8, 1)
        *   Digit 8 corresponds to letters T, U, V.
        *   The second number is 1, indicating the 1st letter.
        *   The 1st letter on digit 8 is **T**.

    *   **Position 9:** (4, 3)
        *   Digit 4 corresponds to letters G, H, I.
        *   The second number is 3, indicating the 3rd letter.
        *   The 3rd letter on digit 4 is **I**.

    *   **Position 10:** (6, 3)
        *   Digit 6 corresponds to letters M, N, O.
        *   The second number is 3, indicating the 3rd letter.
        *   The 3rd letter on digit 6 is **O**.

    *   **Position 11:** (6, 2)
        *   Digit 6 corresponds to letters M, N, O.
        *   The second number is 2, indicating the 2nd letter.
        *   The 2nd letter on digit 6 is **N**.

6.  **Assemble the Letters:** Combining the decoded letters in order gives:
    I M A G I N A T I O N

7.  **Verify the Result:** The resulting sequence of letters is ""IMAGINATION"". This is a valid 11-letter English word, which fits the problem description. The decoding method using the phone keypad is consistent and yields a meaningful word.

The first line of numbers (46244628466) represents the sequence of phone buttons pressed for each letter. The second line of numbers (31113211332) represents the position of the desired letter on that specific button (1st, 2nd, or 3rd letter).

The word encoded by the numbers is IMAGINATION.

148,"Question: There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?
 Hint: Divide the coins into 3 groups",Divide the coins into 3 groups,"Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.
Now let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.

149,"Question: Hans Ernest Froopaloop, Jr. is in a play with four relatives: his sister, mother, son, and daughter. Each of the five has a different dressing room:

Room C: large, borders rooms B and D
Room D: small, borders rooms B, C, and E

1. The rooms of the lead actor in the play and his or her sibling border the same number of rooms.
2. The lead's room and his or her parent's room are the same size.
3. HEF Jr's room and his daughter's room do not border each other.
4. Each room borders at least one man's room and at least one woman's room.
Who is the lead actor?
 Hint: There are multiple possible final arrangements. But the answer is still the same",There are multiple possible final arrangements. But the answer is still the same,"HEF Jr's sister is the lead actor.
From fact 4, we know that rooms A and C each border one man's room and one woman's room. So one of rooms B and E is occupied by a man and the other by a woman, and one of rooms B and D is occupied by a man and the other by a woman. If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.
Since there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.
Since there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.
Fact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son. Therefore, the siblings in rooms A and C must be HEF Jr. and his sister, and one of them must be the lead actor. From fact 3, we have these two scenarios:
1.

150,"Question: There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:
1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.
2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).
3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.
4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.
Now, here's the kicker:
5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).
6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).
Assumptions:
1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.
2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.
3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.
So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?
 Hint: There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","The sheep would remain untouched.
In fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.
Here's the reasoning:
Consider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.
Now look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.
So now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.
We can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.
You can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $N$ be the number of lions and $S$ be the number of sheep. We start with $N=100$ and $S=1$. The question is whether the sheep will be eaten by the first lion that reaches it.

A lion is infinitely logical and wants to survive. Lions prefer eating sheep to grass, but they absolutely want to avoid being eaten. If a lion eats a sheep, it turns into a sheep itself and could then be eaten by other lions. A lion will only eat the sheep if it is certain that it will not be eaten after turning into a sheep.

We can solve this problem using backward induction, starting with the simplest case and building up. Let's analyze the situation for small values of $N$.

Case $N=1$:
There is 1 lion and 1 sheep. The lion considers eating the sheep.
If the lion eats the sheep, it turns into a sheep. There are now 0 lions remaining. Since there are no other lions, the lion-turned-sheep cannot be eaten.
The lion prefers eating sheep to grass, and there is no risk of being eaten.
Therefore, the lion eats the sheep.
Conclusion for $N=1$: The sheep is eaten.

Case $N=2$:
There are 2 lions (L1, L2) and 1 sheep. Let L1 be the first lion to reach the sheep. L1 considers eating the sheep.
If L1 eats the sheep, L1 turns into a sheep (S'). The situation becomes 1 lion (L2) and 1 sheep (S').
L1 is infinitely logical and knows the outcome of the $N=1$ case. In the $N=1$ case, a lion eats the sheep. So, L1 knows that if it turns into S', the remaining lion (L2) will eat S'.
L1 knows that if it eats the original sheep, it will be eaten by L2.
Rule 6 states that a lion would rather eat grass all its life than be eaten by another lion.
Therefore, L1 will not eat the sheep. L1 will eat grass instead.
Conclusion for $N=2$: The sheep is not eaten.

Case $N=3$:
There are 3 lions (L1, L2, L3) and 1 sheep. Let L1 be the first lion. L1 considers eating the sheep.
If L1 eats the sheep, L1 turns into a sheep (S'). The situation becomes 2 lions (L2, L3) and 1 sheep (S').
L1 knows the outcome of the $N=2$ case. In the $N=2$ case, the sheep is not eaten. So, L1 knows that if it turns into S', the remaining 2 lions (L2, L3) will not eat S'.
L1 knows that if it eats the original sheep, it will not be eaten by L2 or L3.
L1 prefers eating sheep to grass, and the condition (not being eaten) is met.
Therefore, L1 eats the sheep.
Conclusion for $N=3$: The sheep is eaten.

Case $N=4$:
There are 4 lions (L1, L2, L3, L4) and 1 sheep. Let L1 be the first lion. L1 considers eating the sheep.
If L1 eats the sheep, L1 turns into a sheep (S'). The situation becomes 3 lions (L2, L3, L4) and 1 sheep (S').
L1 knows the outcome of the $N=3$ case. In the $N=3$ case, the sheep is eaten. So, L1 knows that if it turns into S', one of the remaining 3 lions will eat S'.
L1 knows that if it eats the original sheep, it will be eaten.
Rule 6 states that a lion would rather eat grass than be eaten.
Therefore, L1 will not eat the sheep. L1 will eat grass.
Conclusion for $N=4$: The sheep is not eaten.

We can see a pattern emerging:
- If $N=1$ (odd), the sheep is eaten.
- If $N=2$ (even), the sheep is not eaten.
- If $N=3$ (odd), the sheep is eaten.
- If $N=4$ (even), the sheep is not eaten.

The hypothesis is: The sheep is eaten if the number of lions $N$ is odd, and the sheep is not eaten if the number of lions $N$ is even.

We can prove this hypothesis using mathematical induction.
Let $P(N)$ be the statement: ""With $N$ lions and 1 sheep, the sheep is eaten if $N$ is odd, and not eaten if $N$ is even.""

Base case: $N=1$. $N$ is odd. We showed that with 1 lion, the sheep is eaten. $P(1)$ is true.

Inductive Hypothesis: Assume that $P(k)$ is true for all integers $k < N$. That is, for any number of lions $k$ less than $N$, the sheep is eaten if $k$ is odd, and not eaten if $k$ is even.

Inductive Step: Consider the case with $N$ lions and 1 sheep. The first lion (L1) considers eating the sheep.
If L1 eats the sheep, it turns into a sheep. The situation becomes $N-1$ lions and 1 sheep (L1 turned sheep).
L1 is infinitely logical, so it knows the outcome for the $N-1$ lion scenario based on our inductive hypothesis. L1 will eat the original sheep if and only if it knows it will *not* be eaten in the $N-1$ lion scenario. According to the rules, L1 (as a sheep) will be eaten in the $N-1$ lion scenario if and only if the sheep is eaten in a scenario with $N-1$ lions and 1 sheep.

- If $N$ is odd: Then $N-1$ is even. By the inductive hypothesis, for $N-1$ lions (an even number), the sheep is *not* eaten.
  L1 knows that if it eats the original sheep and turns into a sheep, the remaining $N-1$ lions will not eat it.
  Since L1 prefers eating sheep and knows it won't be eaten, L1 eats the sheep.
  So, if $N$ is odd, the sheep is eaten. This part of $P(N)$ is true.

- If $N$ is even: Then $N-1$ is odd. By the inductive hypothesis, for $N-1$ lions (an odd number), the sheep *is* eaten.
  L1 knows that if it eats the original sheep and turns into a sheep, one of the remaining $N-1$ lions will eat it.
  Rule 6 states that L1 would rather eat grass than be eaten.
  Therefore, L1 will not eat the sheep. L1 eats grass instead.
  So, if $N$ is even, the sheep is not eaten. This part of $P(N)$ is true.

The inductive step is complete. The hypothesis $P(N)$ is true for all $N \ge 1$.

The problem asks about the case with $N=100$ lions and 1 sheep.
100 is an even number.
According to our proven pattern, if the number of lions is even, the sheep is not eaten.

Therefore, with 100 lions and 1 sheep, the first lion will determine that eating the sheep would lead to it being eaten in the subsequent 99-lion scenario (since 99 is odd), and thus the first lion will refrain from eating the sheep. All other lions, being equally logical, would make the same calculation if they were the first to reach the sheep. Since the first lion chooses not to eat the sheep, the sheep survives.

The final answer is $\boxed{Not eaten}$.",True,1,0,0

He pretended to hold a vote for who was the cleverest person, where people had to nominate other villagers to go up to the vote. Everyone in the village would know of everyone nominated except themselves, and they all knew that at least one person got nominated.
Once the nominations were over the leader announced his plan. He said that the first person to come forward and say that they were nominated with proof would be the cleverest person in the village. He told them to go to the village hall at exactly 7:00 pm once they had worked it out. None of the people told each other if they got nominated, as they all wanted to win.
After the first night nobody had come forward. Nobody came forward on the second night either. Nor the third, fourth fifth etc. Eventually on the 30th night a certain number of people came forward claiming to have been nominated. They were all right.
How many people came forward on the 30th night and why? (Assume that they all were clever enough to work the method out).

Any person nominated would know of N-1 people nominated, as they would not know that they themselves were nominated. If there was 1 person nominated, the nominee would know of nobody who was nominated, and therefore would know that they were nominated.

Using the same logic, anyone on the second night who knew of one person nominated would then be able to work out that they were nominated as there was at least two people. Because nobody came forward on the second night there was at least three.
This carries on all the way up. Nobody came forward on the 29th night, meaning there was at least thirty.

4.  **Action Time:** People come forward at 7:00 pm on the day they work it out.
5.  **Key Information:** Nobody came forward on nights 1 through 29. People *did* come forward on night 30.

**The Logic (Using Induction)**

Let's consider the number of people who were *actually* nominated. Let this number be $N$. Everyone who was nominated is one of the clever people trying to deduce they were nominated.

*   **Base Case: If $N=1$**
    *   Assume exactly one person was nominated. Let's call her Alice.
    *   Every other villager knows Alice was nominated.
    *   Alice doesn't know directly if she was nominated.
    *   However, Alice knows that *at least one* person was nominated.
    *   Alice looks around and sees the nominations. If she doesn't see *anyone else* being nominated, and she knows *someone* must have been nominated, the *only* logical conclusion is that *she herself* must be the nominated person.
    *   This deduction is immediate. Alice would realize this as soon as she processed the information.
    *   Since Alice is clever, she would work this out on the first day.
    *   She would come forward at 7:00 pm on the 1st night.
    *   **Conclusion for N=1:** If only one person was nominated, that person would have come forward on the 1st night.

*   **Connecting Base Case to the Problem:** The problem states that *nobody* came forward on the 1st night. This means that the situation $N=1$ is impossible. There must have been *more than one* person nominated. This is a piece of information that *all* the clever villagers can deduce from the silence on the first night.

*   **Inductive Hypothesis: Assume that if exactly $k$ people were nominated, they would all deduce this and come forward on the $k$th night.**
    *   This means that the silence on night $k$ implies that the number of nominees is *not* $k$.

*   **Inductive Step: Prove that if exactly $k+1$ people were nominated, they would all deduce this and come forward on the $(k+1)$th night.**
    *   Assume exactly $k+1$ people were nominated. Let's call them P1, P2, ..., P(k+1).
    *   Consider one of these nominated people, say P1.
    *   P1, like everyone else, knows all nominations *except their own*. So, P1 sees that P2, P3, ..., P(k+1) were nominated. That's a group of *k* people whom P1 *knows* were nominated.
    *   P1 thinks: ""What if I (P1) was *not* nominated? In that case, the total number of nominated people would be exactly $k$ (the group P2, ..., P(k+1) that I can see).
    *   ""If there were exactly $k$ nominees (P2, ..., P(k+1)), then according to the inductive hypothesis, they would all figure this out and come forward on the *k*th night.""
    *   ""So, if I am *not* nominated, I expect P2, ..., P(k+1) to come forward at 7:00 pm on the $k$th night.""
    *   Now, imagine P1 on the morning of the $(k+1)$th day. P1 knows that nobody came forward on the $k$th night.
    *   P1 reasons: ""Nobody came forward last night (night $k$). This means the situation where there were exactly $k$ nominees (P2, ..., P(k+1)) did *not* occur. If it had, they would have come forward.""
    *   ""I know that *at least* $k$ people (P2, ..., P(k+1)) were nominated, because I saw those nominations. The fact that the scenario with *exactly* $k$ nominees didn't happen means there must be *more than k* nominees in total.""
    *   ""Since I can see $k$ nominated people (P2, ..., P(k+1)), the *only* way for the total number of nominees to be more than $k$ is if I myself was also nominated.""
    *   This deduction happens on the morning of the $(k+1)$th day.
    *   Crucially, this exact same line of reasoning applies to *every single one* of the $k+1$ nominated people. Each of them sees the other $k$ nominated people and, upon observing the silence on night $k$, deduces on day $k+1$ that they themselves must also be part of the nominated group.
    *   Therefore, all $k+1$ nominated people will independently deduce they were nominated on the $(k+1)$th day and come forward at 7:00 pm on the $(k+1)$th night.

**Applying to the Problem's Specifics**

*   We know nobody came forward on night 1. This implies $N \neq 1$.
*   Everyone deduces $N > 1$.
*   We know nobody came forward on night 2. If $N=2$, they would have come forward on night 2 (based on the $N=1$ failure). The silence on night 2 implies $N \neq 2$.
*   Everyone deduces $N > 2$.
*   ...
*   We know nobody came forward on night 29. If $N=29$, they would have come forward on night 29 (based on the inductive logic from $N=1, 2, \ldots, 28$). The silence on night 29 implies $N \neq 29$.
*   Everyone deduces $N > 29$.
*   We know that on the 30th night, a certain number of people *did* come forward.
*   According to our inductive logic, if $N=30$, all 30 nominated people would deduce this on the 30th day and come forward on the 30th night.
*   The fact that nobody came forward *until* the 30th night, and people *did* come forward on the 30th night, is the signal that the number of nominated people is exactly 30.

**The Answer**

*   The 29 nights of silence allowed everyone to deduce that the number of nominated people must be greater than 29.
*   On the 30th day, each of the nominated people, seeing the other 29 and knowing no one came forward on night 29, realized that the only way the group of 29 they could see didn't come forward on night 29 was if there were *more* than 29 nominees, meaning they themselves must also be nominated.
*   This deduction happened simultaneously for all the nominated people on the 30th day.
*   Therefore, the number of people who came forward on the 30th night is the total number of nominated people, which is 30.

*   **How many people came forward on the 30th night?** 30 people.
*   **Why?** Because there were exactly 30 nominated people. Each of the 30 nominated people independently deduced on the 30th day that they must be one of the nominated based on the fact that no one (specifically, the group of the other 29 nominees they could see) came forward on the previous 29 nights. The silence on night 29 eliminated the possibility of there being exactly 29 nominees, leading the 30 nominees to conclude they themselves must be the 30th.

Final answer: 30 people came forward on the 30th night. They came forward on the 30th night because there were exactly 30 people nominated. Each of the 30 nominated people deduced that they must have been nominated on the morning of the 30th day, based on the shared knowledge and the fact that no one came forward on the previous 29 nights (which proved the total number of nominees was greater than 29).Final answer: 30 people came forward on the 30th night. They came forward on the 30th night because there were exactly 30 people nominated. Each of the 30 nominated people independently deduced that they must have been nominated on the morning of the 30th day, based on the shared knowledge and the fact that no one came forward on the previous 29 nights (which proved the total number of nominees was greater than 29).",True,1,0,0
154,"Question: One day three kids decide to wreak havoc in town-again (this is the third time this month). This time they run into an old man's grocery store and steal quite a few items. They hit the wrong spot this time, because this was Old Man Justice's place (he's notorious for meting out his own brand of 'justice'). Old Man Justice chases the kids through town, and during the chase, they drop the goods, turn around, and start chasing him. Unfortunately, the old man falls into a ditch and is badly hurt. A month later after he recovers he is able to identify the culprits, and Old Man Justice calls in his 'support team,' (2 of which were also victims of the thieves), and has the perpetrators rounded up for justice. At a dinner later that evening, dubbed the 'Repast of Right' the old man begins with these words:
'To do what we've done took moxie and nerve,
But alas! As we eat, our justice is served.
As we've judged these few, let's render to each their due,
Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'
(What we see as JUST, is JUST what we do.)
Neither trial, nor jury, should these ones receive,
No more to trouble us, for no more shall they breathe!
So drink wine of success, and not of defeat,
Justice is waiting, so friends let us eat.'
Question:
Provided that Old Man Justice and those in his group are not cannibals, how are these three guilty kids punished by the people at the dinner?
 Hint: ""Kids"" can mean something else","""Kids"" can mean something else","The Old man and his group certainly did EAT THE KIDS, (as implied by the words of Old Man Justice), but they were of course young goats, and not young delinquent children.
Notice that justice is going to be 'served' along with this meal. Also, this extreme justice is also going to result in the kids not-breathing, (meaning they will die), and thus won't be any more trouble. It is not an 'eye for eye' but more like 'one for two' because Old Man Justice was only injured, not killed, therefore the 'justice' is not proportionate to the crime. It also took guts and nerve for these seniors to hunt down someone's livestock and kill it, without the benefit of due process, or discussion w/ the owner in the least.
As they were good for a meal, I suppose the kids weren't so rotten after all!",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step, following the logic and using the hint provided.

1.  **Analyze the Setup:**
    *   Three culprits (""kids"") steal from Old Man Justice.
    *   There's a chase, injury to the old man, recovery, identification.
    *   The culprits are rounded up.
    *   A dinner (""Repast of Right"") is held.
    *   The poem indicates the culprits have been ""judged"" and will ""no more shall they breathe!"" meaning they are killed.
    *   The key line describing the punishment is: ""Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'""
    *   The people at the dinner are *not* cannibals.
    *   The dinner is happening *after* the culprits are killed.

2.  **Consider the Constraint and the Dinner:**
    *   The poem explicitly states the culprits are killed (""no more shall they breathe!"").
    *   The dinner is called the ""Repast of Right,"" suggesting that the ""justice"" *is* what they are eating.
    *   The people at the dinner are *not* cannibals.

3.  **Apply the Hint:**
    *   The hint is: ""`Kids` can mean something else.""
    *   The most common alternative meaning for ""kids"" is young goats.
    *   If the culprits were human children, and they were killed and then eaten at the dinner, this would be cannibalism.
    *   Since the people are explicitly stated *not* to be cannibals, the culprits cannot be human children.
    *   Therefore, applying the hint and the constraint, the culprits must be *young goats*.

4.  **Re-interpret the Story with ""Kids"" as Goats:**
    *   Three young goats steal from Old Man Justice's grocery store (perhaps eating produce).
    *   The rest of the chase and injury sequence still makes sense, even if slightly comical. Goats can certainly cause trouble and make someone fall.
    *   Old Man Justice and his team round up the three guilty goats.
    *   The goats are executed (""no more shall they breathe!"").
    *   The ""Repast of Right"" is a dinner where these executed goats are served and eaten. Since they are goats, eating them is *not* cannibalism.

5.  **Interpret the Punishment Phrase: ""Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'""**
    *   ""Eye for an eye"" means equivalent retaliation.
    *   ""One for two"" must describe the specific method of ""justice"" applied to these goats after they were killed.
    *   What happens to animals after they are killed for food? They are typically butchered or prepared.
    *   Think about how animals are often cut. A common way to prepare an animal carcass (like a goat, lamb, or pig) is to split it down the backbone. This results in two ""halves"" or ""sides"" from the original ""one"" animal.
    *   Therefore, ""one for two"" describes the act of butchering each of the three killed goats (the ""one"") into two halves or sides (the ""two"").

6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**
    *   The culprits were not human children but young goats, as indicated by the hint and the fact that they were eaten at the dinner but the people were not cannibals.
    *   The goats were killed as punishment (""no more shall they breathe!"").
    *   The phrase ""one for two"" describes how the killed goats were prepared for the dinner: each goat (""one"") was butchered into two halves or sides (""two"").
    *   The goats, prepared in this manner, were then served and eaten at the dinner. This is the ""justice"" that was ""served.""

Therefore, the three guilty ""kids"" (young goats) are punished by being killed, butchered into two halves each, and then eaten by Old Man Justice and his group at the dinner.

Final answer: The three guilty ""kids"" (young goats) are punished by being killed and then butchered into two halves each (""one for two"") before being cooked and eaten by Old Man Justice and his group at the dinner.",True,0,0,0

A clock has 60 lines, one at each minute interval. We measure the position of the hands in terms of these minute intervals, starting from the 12 o'clock position (which is line 0).

Let the time be $T$ hours and $m$ minutes, where $T$ is an integer from 0 to 11 (representing 12, 1, 2, ..., 11 o'clock) and $m$ is a value in the range $[0, 60)$.

The position of the minute hand, measured in minute intervals from 12, is simply $m$.
The position of the hour hand is more complex. In $T$ hours, the hour hand moves $T \times 5$ minute intervals (since there are 60 intervals in 12 hours, or 5 intervals per hour). In addition, in $m$ minutes, the hour hand moves further. Since the hour hand moves 5 intervals in 60 minutes, it moves $5/60 = 1/12$ of an interval per minute. So, in $m$ minutes, it moves $m/12$ intervals.
The total position of the hour hand in minute intervals from 12 is $T \times 5 + \frac{m}{12}$.

The problem states that the hour hand is exactly on one line. The lines are at integer minute intervals (0, 1, 2, ..., 59). This means the position of the hour hand must be an integer.
$T \times 5 + \frac{m}{12} = k_h$, where $k_h$ is an integer (the line number).

160,"Question: Biggie Nuff, Baron of Grey Matter, now living in Shapeless, Mass., was dying from a newly developed allergy to water, and wanted his will to reflect the common inheritance law of his father's native country.  Biggie's wife, Faerie, was pregnant at the time with what would be the first child for either of them.  Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.
In due time, Biggie died, and the authorities read his will, holding dispensation of the estate until the child was born.  Five months after Biggie's death, Faerie delivered ... normal, healthy twins, a boy (whom she named Manny) and a girl (whom she named Goodie).
The estate's executor immediately appealed to the Shapeless magistrate to rule on the proper division for the estate.  After a great deal of arguing and deep thought, plus several failed attempts to raise Biggie's spirit with a seance, the judge rendered a fair decision.
How did they divide Biggie's estate?
 Hint: The fraction is in sevenths",The fraction is in sevenths,"The judge reasoned that Biggie intended to give his wife half as much as a son, or twice as much as a daughter.  Therefore, he ruled that Manny gets 4/7 of the estate, Faerie gets 2/7, and Goodie gets 1/7.
(This is supposedly a real decision in Massachusetts, according to the Reader's Digest puzzle book in which I first read this, copyright 1967.  Obviously, I've changed the names).",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem based on the provided information and hint:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal is to divide Biggie Nuff's estate fairly among his widow (Faerie), his son (Manny), and his daughter (Goodie), based on the principles outlined in his will, which was written assuming only one child.

2.  **Analyze the Will's Provisions:** The will specifies how the estate (let's call its total value E) should be divided in two hypothetical scenarios:
    *   **Scenario 1: If the child is a boy:** The son gets 2/3 of the estate, and the widow gets 1/3. This establishes a ratio of Son's share (S) to Widow's share (W) as S:W = (2/3)E : (1/3)E = 2:1. In other words, the son's share is twice the widow's share in this scenario (S = 2W).
    *   **Scenario 2: If the child is a girl:** The widow gets 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter gets 1/3. This establishes a ratio of Widow's share (W) to Daughter's share (D) as W:D = (2/3)E : (1/3)E = 2:1. In other words, the widow's share is twice the daughter's share in this scenario (W = 2D).

3.  **Identify the Conflict:** The actual outcome is the birth of twins, a boy and a girl. This situation is not directly addressed by the will, which was written assuming a single child. A ""fair"" division must interpret the will's underlying principles to cover this unforeseen circumstance.

4.  **Infer the Underlying Principles:** The will establishes a hierarchy of inheritance preference and proportional relationships:
    *   A son is favored over the widow (S:W = 2:1).
    *   The widow is favored over a daughter (W:D = 2:1).
    This suggests a relative valuation where a son's claim is considered stronger than the widow's, and the widow's claim is considered stronger than a daughter's. The specific ratios (2:1) quantify these relative strengths.

5.  **Apply Principles to the Actual Situation:** When a widow, a son, and a daughter are all present, a fair interpretation is to maintain the proportional relationships established in the will. We assume that the son's share should still be twice the widow's share (S = 2W) and the widow's share should still be twice the daughter's share (W = 2D), based on the proportional values implied by the will's specific scenarios.

6.  **Determine the Relative Shares:** We have two equations relating the shares:
    *   S = 2W
    *   W = 2D
    We can express all shares in terms of a single variable, for example, D.
    From W = 2D, the widow's share is twice the daughter's share.
    From S = 2W, the son's share is twice the widow's share. Substituting W = 2D into this equation, we get S = 2 * (2D) = 4D.
    So, the shares of the Son, Widow, and Daughter are in the ratio S : W : D = 4D : 2D : D = 4 : 2 : 1.

7.  **Calculate the Fractional Shares:** The total estate E must be divided among the three beneficiaries according to the ratio 4:2:1. The total number of ""parts"" in this ratio is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.
    *   The Son's share (S) is 4 parts out of 7, so S = 4/7 * E.
    *   The Widow's share (W) is 2 parts out of 7, so W = 2/7 * E.
    *   The Daughter's share (D) is 1 part out of 7, so D = 1/7 * E.

8.  **Verify the Solution:**
    *   Do the shares sum to the total estate? S + W + D = (4/7)E + (2/7)E + (1/7)E = (4+2+1)/7 E = 7/7 E = E. Yes, they do.
    *   Do the proportional relationships from the will hold?
        *   S:W = (4/7)E : (2/7)E = 4:2 = 2:1. Yes, this matches the boy-case ratio.
        *   W:D = (2/7)E : (1/7)E = 2:1. Yes, this matches the girl-case ratio.
    *   Are the fractions in sevenths? Yes, they are 4/7, 2/7, and 1/7. This aligns with the hint.

9.  **State the Final Division:** The estate is divided with the son receiving 4/7, the widow receiving 2/7, and the daughter receiving 1/7 of the total estate.

The ""fair decision"" rendered by the judge is based on interpreting the will's relative proportional values for the beneficiaries and applying them consistently to the actual situation of having both a son and a daughter.

The division is:
Manny (son): 4/7 of the estate
Faerie (widow): 2/7 of the estate
Goodie (daughter): 1/7 of the estate

Final answer confirmation: The shares are 4/7, 2/7, and 1/7, they sum to 7/7 = 1, and they maintain the ratios S:W = 2:1 and W:D = 2:1, as implied by the original will.

Final answer: The estate was divided such that the son received 4/7, the widow received 2/7, and the daughter received 1/7 of the estate.",True,1,0,0

162,"Question: At the annual Pottstown Rose Show, Mr. Tom Thorne, an avid rose grower, entered his six best new hybrid roses.  He did extremely well, taking home 28 ribbons.  From the following clues, can you figure out how many blue ribbons and how many red ribbons each rose received?
Names of Roses are:  Pretty in Pink, Ravishing Red, Simply Silver, Mrs. Thelma Thorne, Very Violet and Yummy Yellow.
1.  No two roses won the same total number of ribbons.
2.  ""Pretty in Pink"" won one-quarter of the total amount, which was the same amount as the number that ""Ravishing Red"", ""Yummy Yellow"" and ""Simply Silver"" won together.
3.  ""Very Violet"" won the same number of ribbons as both ""Mrs.Thelma Thorne"" and ""Simply Silver"" together.
4.  Three-quarters of ""Ravishing Red's"" ribbons were red.
5.  One-third of ""Mrs. Thelma Thorne's"" ribbons were blue; ""Yummy Yellow"" won just one blue ribbon.
6.  ""Simply Silver"" won an equal number of blue and red ribbons.
7.  ""Very Violet"" won the same number of blue ribbons as ""Pretty in Pink"".
8.  ""Very Violet"" won as many red ribbons as were won by ""Mrs. Thelma Thorne"" and ""Ravishing Red"" together.
 Hint: Yummy yellow didn't win any red ribbons.",Yummy yellow didn't win any red ribbons.,"Pretty in Pink - 1 Blue - 6 Red
Ravishing Red - 1 Blue - 3 Red
Simply Silver - 1 Blue - 1 Red
Mrs. Thelma Thorne - 2 Blue - 4 Red
Very Violet - 1 Blue - 7 red
Yummy Yellow - 1 Blue only",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $T_X$, $B_X$, and $R_X$ represent the total number of ribbons, the number of blue ribbons, and the number of red ribbons for rose X, respectively. The roses are Pretty in Pink (PP), Ravishing Red (RR), Simply Silver (SS), Mrs. Thelma Thorne (MT), Very Violet (VV), and Yummy Yellow (YY). We know $T_X = B_X + R_X$ for each rose, and $B_X \ge 0$, $R_X \ge 0$.

The total number of ribbons is 28:
$T_{PP} + T_{RR} + T_{SS} + T_{MT} + T_{VV} + T_{YY} = 28$.

Clue 1: No two roses won the same total number of ribbons.
$T_X$ are distinct non-negative integers.

Clue 2: ""Pretty in Pink"" won one-quarter of the total amount, which was the same amount as the number that ""Ravishing Red"", ""Yummy Yellow"" and ""Simply Silver"" won together.
$T_{PP} = \frac{1}{4} \times 28 = 7$.
$T_{PP} = T_{RR} + T_{YY} + T_{SS}$.
So, $T_{RR} + T_{YY} + T_{SS} = 7$.

From the total sum, the sum of the remaining roses' totals is $T_{MT} + T_{VV} = 28 - T_{PP} - (T_{RR} + T_{YY} + T_{SS}) = 28 - 7 - 7 = 14$.
$T_{MT} + T_{VV} = 14$.

Clue 3: ""Very Violet"" won the same number of ribbons as both ""Mrs.Thelma Thorne"" and ""Simply Silver"" together.
$T_{VV} = T_{MT} + T_{SS}$.
Since $T_{SS}$ is a number of ribbons, $T_{SS} \ge 0$. If $T_{SS} = 0$, then $T_{VV} = T_{MT}$, which contradicts Clue 1 that all total numbers are distinct. Thus, $T_{SS} > 0$. This implies $T_{VV} > T_{MT}$.

Substitute $T_{VV} = T_{MT} + T_{SS}$ into $T_{MT} + T_{VV} = 14$:
$T_{MT} + (T_{MT} + T_{SS}) = 14 \implies 2T_{MT} + T_{SS} = 14$.

We have $T_{PP} = 7$, $T_{SS} > 0$, $T_{MT}$, $T_{VV}$ are distinct positive integers such that $T_{MT} + T_{VV} = 14$ and $T_{VV} = T_{MT} + T_{SS}$. This implies $T_{MT} < T_{VV}$.
Also, $T_{RR}, T_{YY}, T_{SS}$ are distinct non-negative integers that sum to 7. $T_{SS}$ must be one of the values in this set.
The six total values $\{T_{PP}, T_{RR}, T_{YY}, T_{SS}, T_{MT}, T_{VV}\}$ must be distinct.

Let's test possible values for $T_{MT}$ and $T_{VV}$ such that $T_{MT} < T_{VV}$ and $T_{MT} + T_{VV} = 14$:
Possible pairs $(T_{MT}, T_{VV})$ are (0, 14), (1, 13), (2, 12), (3, 11), (4, 10), (5, 9), (6, 8).
For each pair, calculate $T_{SS}$ using $2T_{MT} + T_{SS} = 14$.
- If $(T_{MT}, T_{VV}) = (0, 14)$: $2(0) + T_{SS} = 14 \implies T_{SS} = 14$. Totals so far: $\{7, 14, 0, 14\}$. $T_{SS}=14, T_{VV}=14$, not distinct. Invalid.
- If $(T_{MT}, T_{VV}) = (1, 13)$: $2(1) + T_{SS} = 14 \implies T_{SS} = 12$. Totals so far: $\{7, 12, 1, 13\}$. $T_{RR} + T_{YY} + T_{SS} = 7 \implies T_{RR} + T_{YY} + 12 = 7$. $T_{RR} + T_{YY} = -5$. Impossible for non-negative ribbons. Invalid.
- If $(T_{MT}, T_{VV}) = (2, 12)$: $2(2) + T_{SS} = 14 \implies T_{SS} = 10$. Totals: $\{7, 10, 2, 12\}$. $T_{RR} + T_{YY} + 10 = 7$. $T_{RR} + T_{YY} = -3$. Impossible. Invalid.
- If $(T_{MT}, T_{VV}) = (3, 11)$: $2(3) + T_{SS} = 14 \implies T_{SS} = 8$. Totals: $\{7, 8, 3, 11\}$. $T_{RR} + T_{YY} + 8 = 7$. $T_{RR} + T_{YY} = -1$. Impossible. Invalid.
- If $(T_{MT}, T_{VV}) = (4, 10)$: $2(4) + T_{SS} = 14 \implies T_{SS} = 6$. Totals: $\{7, 6, 4, 10\}$. Remaining values for $T_{RR}, T_{YY}$ must be distinct non-negative, not in $\{4, 6, 7, 10\}$, and satisfy $T_{RR} + T_{YY} + T_{SS} = 7 \implies T_{RR} + T_{YY} + 6 = 7 \implies T_{RR} + T_{YY} = 1$. Possible $(T_{RR}, T_{YY})$ are $(0, 1)$ or $(1, 0)$. The set of totals is $\{7, 6, 4, 10\} \cup \{0, 1\} = \{0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 10\}$. These are 6 distinct non-negative integers. This is a possible set of totals.
- If $(T_{MT}, T_{VV}) = (5, 9)$: $2(5) + T_{SS} = 14 \implies T_{SS} = 4$. Totals: $\{7, 4, 5, 9\}$. $T_{RR} + T_{YY} + 4 = 7 \implies T_{RR} + T_{YY} = 3$. Possible $(T_{RR}, T_{YY})$ are $(0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0)$. The set of totals is $\{7, 4, 5, 9\} \cup \{0, 3\} = \{0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$ or $\{7, 4, 5, 9\} \cup \{1, 2\} = \{1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$. Both are sets of 6 distinct non-negative integers. These are possible sets of totals.
- If $(T_{MT}, T_{VV}) = (6, 8)$: $2(6) + T_{SS} = 14 \implies T_{SS} = 2$. Totals: $\{7, 2, 6, 8\}$. $T_{RR} + T_{YY} + 2 = 7 \implies T_{RR} + T_{YY} = 5$. Possible $(T_{RR}, T_{YY})$ are $(0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0)$. Need to exclude values already in $\{2, 6, 7, 8\}$.
  - $(0, 5)$: $\{0, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8\}$. Distinct. Possible.
  - $(1, 4)$: $\{1, 4, 2, 6, 7, 8\}$. Distinct. Possible.
  - $(2, 3)$: $T_{SS}=2$, so $T_{RR}$ or $T_{YY}$ cannot be 2. Invalid.
  - $(3, 2)$: $T_{SS}=2$, so $T_{RR}$ or $T_{YY}$ cannot be 2. Invalid.
  - $(4, 1)$: $\{1, 4, 2, 6, 7, 8\}$. Distinct. Possible.
  - $(5, 0)$: $\{0, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8\}$. Distinct. Possible.

So the possible sets of total ribbons are:
Set A: $\{0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 10\}$. Assignment: $T_{PP}=7, T_{SS}=6, T_{MT}=4, T_{VV}=10, \{T_{RR}, T_{YY}\} = \{0, 1\}$.

163,"Question: Well... The Winning Combination is back.. but with a twist!  You are a millionaire... but you have now become very greedy and a cheater.  You spend lots of money on selfish things, and are finding yourself very short of money.  The show has refused to let you back on after you meanly insulted the host.
But you are sneakier than that.  Now, your son has applied to be a contestant and has successfully made it on.  He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.
He is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!
You grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.
The combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.  A 'set' refers to a set of two numbers.
""OK, Dad...
1. The sum of the digits in the third set is less than 14 but greater than 10.
2. The third set of numbers is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
3. If you multiply the second set of numbers by 2 and add 7, then you will get the first set of numbers.
4. The sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.
5. There are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination.  Every other number is in the combination.
6. The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).
Hurry, Dad, hurry!""
 Hint: The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.",The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.,"The solution is 49-21-75-88.
First of all, we know that there are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination and that every other digit appears at least once (clue 5).
OK, we'll start on the first set.
We know it's a square number (clue 6).
The only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:
25
49
81
Now, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.
So you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.
81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.
25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.
So that leaves with 49.
49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.
Now we know this much:
49-21-??-??
Now we must work on the last two sets.
Clue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
Here are the possible combinations:
11-24
12-25
14-27
15-28
28-41
29-42
41-54
42-55
44-57
45-58
58-71
59-72
71-84
72-85
74-87
75-88
78-91
79-92
81-94
82-95
84-97
85-98
Now, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.
Currently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.
So now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:
58-71
75-88
72-85
Now, we read clue 4.  This tells us the sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.  The sum of the digits in the first set is 13 (4 + 9), and so the only one greater than that is the 75-88 combination (8 + 8 = 16).
So there we have it.
49-21-75-88.

Each of these three books belongs to exactly one of the students. As I wanted to know the names of the respective owners of the books I asked them about the owners of the books. The following are the answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy.
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.

Which of the following statements can then be concluded?
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement can be concluded. One or more statements can be concluded.
 Hint: Start with casework on if Anu tells the truth",Start with casework on if Anu tells the truth,"All the three given statements can be concluded.
The given statements are
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
The answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy to my query about the owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books are as follows :-
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Case 1 : Let us assume that Anu always tells the truth.
Then according to Anu's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Maths book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Anu's reply with that of Bob's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy lies three times when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 1, Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie and Coy always lies. Also in this case the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Case 2 : Let us assume that Bob always tells the truth.
Then according to Bob's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Bob's reply with that of Anu's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Anu speaks the truth, lies and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Coy lies, speaks the truth and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 2, Bob always speaks the truth, Anu and Coy alternate between truth and lie and hence this case is not possible since it is given that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Case 3 : Let us assume that Coy always tells the truth. Here we can again make two sub cases.
a) According to Coy's answer,
Maths book belongs to Anu.
Physics book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
b) According to Coy's answer,
Chemistry book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Physics book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is also not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
Hence among the three cases, only Case 1 can be considered to be a valid case wherein Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie, Coy always lies and the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.

166,"Question: Grobi is a very unique creature.
Grobi:
1...is round in shape.
2...is six inches in diameter.
3...lives on an acre-sized flat field.
4...moves only by jumping; cannot walk, crawl, fly, or move in any manner other than jumping.
5...can jump, in any one jump, a minimum of 6 inches or a maximum of 72 inches (6 feet) across the field (cannot jump straight up-down).  Grobi can therefore, in any one jump, jump any distance across the field at or between the 6-72 inch limits.
6...can jump directly north, south, east, or west only; cannot jump diagonally.
7...must jump four times in any one direction (N-S-E-W) before changing direction (N-S-E-W) or to continue in the same direction (N-S-E-W).
8...dines on mushrooms which grow in the field.  The mushrooms grow to a maximum of six inches in diameter and to a height of an inch.
9...can ingest a mushroom only by landing directly atop the mushroom.
10...is very adept at precisely determining distances.
One day Grobi - happily jumping around in the middle of the field - locates a six-inch diameter mushroom six inches away (center of Grobi to center of mushroom distance) directly west of Grobi.
Grobi quickly (and accurately) calculates that FOUR jumps is the fastest way to get to the mushroom and eat, which Grobi does.

2.  If Grobi had been jumping north or south (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series) then four additional jumps (even if able to change direction) would have put Grobi out of alignment with the mushroom.

Looking at the second statement (which must be a lie, as there can at most be one true statement and we have one), the first day cannot be Wednesday, Friday or Saturday. Therefore, the first statement cannot be true, since the third cannot refer to it by day. Therefore, the third statement is true, and must (from the first statement) be a Monday or Tuesday. Statement two, however, rules out Monday, leaving only Tuesday as the 'day of truth'. Thus: 'one day' is a Sunday; on the third day (Tuesday) Steve is truthful.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step, following the logic and using the hint provided.

**Core Information:**
*   Steve tells the truth on exactly one day of the week.
*   On the other six days, Steve lies.

**Statements and the days they were said:**
*   Day 1 (D1): ""I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays."" (Statement 1 - S1)
*   Day 2 (D2 = D1 + 1 day): ""Today is either Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday."" (Statement 2 - S2)
*   Day 3 (D3 = D1 + 2 days): ""I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays."" (Statement 3 - S3)

**Analyzing the Truthfulness of the Statements:**

1.  **Statement 1 (S1): ""I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays.""**
    *   This statement is true if and only if Steve lies on Monday *and* Steve lies on Tuesday.
    *   If S1 is true on Day 1 (D1), then D1 must be Steve's truth day. And, according to S1, Steve lies on Monday and Tuesday. This means his truth day (D1) cannot be Monday or Tuesday. So, if S1 is true on D1, the truth day is one of {Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun}.
    *   If S1 is false on Day 1 (D1), then D1 must be one of Steve's lie days. The statement ""I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays"" is false. This means it is *not* true that he lies on both Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, he must tell the truth on Monday *or* he must tell the truth on Tuesday (or both, but he only tells the truth on one day total). So, if S1 is false on D1, the truth day is one of {Mon, Tue}.

2.  **Statement 3 (S3): ""I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays.""**
    *   This statement is true if and only if Steve lies on Friday *and* Steve lies on Wednesday.
    *   If S3 is true on Day 3 (D3), then D3 must be Steve's truth day. And, according to S3, Steve lies on Friday and Wednesday. This means his truth day (D3) cannot be Friday or Wednesday. So, if S3 is true on D3, the truth day is one of {Mon, Tue, Thu, Sat, Sun}.
    *   If S3 is false on Day 3 (D3), then D3 must be one of Steve's lie days. The statement ""I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays"" is false. This means it is *not* true that he lies on both Friday and Wednesday. Therefore, he must tell the truth on Friday *or* he must tell the truth on Wednesday (or both, but he only tells the truth on one day total). So, if S3 is false on D3, the truth day is one of {Fri, Wed}.

**Using the Hint:** ""The first and third statements are incompatible.""
*   This means that S1 being true on D1 and S3 being true on D3 cannot both happen.
*   It is *not* the case that (S1 is true on D1 AND S3 is true on D3).
*   This means (S1 is false on D1) OR (S3 is false on D3).
*   From our analysis above:
    *   If S1 is false on D1, the truth day is {Mon, Tue}.
    *   If S3 is false on D3, the truth day is {Fri, Wed}.
*   So, (Truth day is {Mon, Tue}) OR (Truth day is {Fri, Wed}).
*   This implies the truth day must be one of {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday}.
*   The truth day cannot be Thursday, Saturday, or Sunday.

**Testing the Possible Truth Days (Mon, Tue, Wed, Fri):**

Let T be the truth day.

*   **Case 1: T is Monday.**
    *   Steve tells the truth on Monday, lies Tue-Sun.
    *   S1 (""I lie on Mon and Tue"") is said on D1. Is it true or false? Steve lies on Tue, but *doesn't* lie on Mon (he tells the truth). So S1 is False (not ""lie on Mon AND lie on Tue""). Since S1 is false, D1 must be a lie day. Possible D1: {Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun}.
    *   S3 (""I lie on Fri and Wed"") is said on D3. Is it true or false? Steve lies on Fri and lies on Wed. So S3 is True. Since S3 is true, D3 must be the truth day (Monday).
    *   D3 = D1 + 2 days. If D3 is Monday, D1 must be Saturday.
    *   Is D1=Saturday consistent with D1 being a lie day if T=Monday? Yes, Saturday is a lie day when T=Monday.
    *   Now check S2 (""Today is Sun, Sat, or Thu"") said on D2 (which is Sunday, since D1=Saturday). Is S2 true or false on Sunday? ""Today is Sun..."" is true. So S2 is True.
    *   Since S2 is true, D2 must be the truth day. D2 is Sunday. This means Sunday must be the truth day.
    *   This contradicts our assumption that T is Monday. So T cannot be Monday.

*   **Case 2: T is Tuesday.**
    *   Steve tells the truth on Tuesday, lies Mon, Wed-Sun.
    *   S1 (""I lie on Mon and Tue"") is said on D1. Is it true or false? Steve lies on Mon, but *doesn't* lie on Tue (he tells the truth). So S1 is False. Since S1 is false, D1 must be a lie day. Possible D1: {Mon, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun}.
    *   S3 (""I lie on Fri and Wed"") is said on D3. Is it true or false? Steve lies on Fri and lies on Wed. So S3 is True. Since S3 is true, D3 must be the truth day (Tuesday).
    *   D3 = D1 + 2 days. If D3 is Tuesday, D1 must be Sunday.
    *   Is D1=Sunday consistent with D1 being a lie day if T=Tuesday? Yes, Sunday is a lie day when T=Tuesday.
    *   Now check S2 (""Today is Sun, Sat, or Thu"") said on D2 (which is Monday, since D1=Sunday). Is S2 true or false on Monday? ""Today is Sun, Sat, or Thu"" is False (Monday is none of these).
    *   Since S2 is false, D2 must be a lie day. D2 is Monday. Is Monday a lie day if T=Tuesday? Yes, Monday is a lie day.
    *   This is consistent. D1=Sunday (lie day, S1 false), D2=Monday (lie day, S2 false), D3=Tuesday (truth day, S3 true). D3 = D1+2 (Sun + 2 days = Tue). This fits.
    *   It seems Tuesday is the truth day. Let's check the remaining possibilities to be sure.

*   **Case 3: T is Wednesday.**
    *   Steve tells the truth on Wednesday, lies Mon, Tue, Thu-Sun.
    *   S1 (""I lie on Mon and Tue"") is said on D1. Is it true or false? Steve lies on Mon and lies on Tue. So S1 is True. Since S1 is true, D1 must be the truth day (Wednesday).
    *   S3 (""I lie on Fri and Wed"") is said on D3. Is it true or false? Steve lies on Fri, but *doesn't* lie on Wed (he tells the truth). So S3 is False. Since S3 is false, D3 must be a lie day. Possible D3: {Mon, Tue, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun}.
    *   D3 = D1 + 2 days. If D1 is Wednesday, D3 must be Friday.
    *   Is D3=Friday consistent with D3 being a lie day if T=Wednesday? Yes, Friday is a lie day when T=Wednesday.
    *   Now check S2 (""Today is Sun, Sat, or Thu"") said on D2 (which is Thursday, since D1=Wednesday). Is S2 true or false on Thursday? ""...or Thu"" is true. So S2 is True.
    *   Since S2 is true, D2 must be the truth day. D2 is Thursday. This means Thursday must be the truth day.
    *   This contradicts our assumption that T is Wednesday. So T cannot be Wednesday.

*   **Case 4: T is Friday.**
    *   Steve tells the truth on Friday, lies Mon-Thu, Sat, Sun.
    *   S1 (""I lie on Mon and Tue"") is said on D1. Is it true or false? Steve lies on Mon and lies on Tue. So S1 is True. Since S1 is true, D1 must be the truth day (Friday).
    *   S3 (""I lie on Fri and Wed"") is said on D3. Is it true or false? Steve *doesn't* lie on Fri (he tells the truth), but lies on Wed. So S3 is False. Since S3 is false, D3 must be a lie day. Possible D3: {Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Sat, Sun}.
    *   D3 = D1 + 2 days. If D1 is Friday, D3 must be Sunday.
    *   Is D3=Sunday consistent with D3 being a lie day if T=Friday? Yes, Sunday is a lie day when T=Friday.
    *   Now check S2 (""Today is Sun, Sat, or Thu"") said on D2 (which is Saturday, since D1=Friday). Is S2 true or false on Saturday? ""...or Saturday"" is true. So S2 is True.
    *   Since S2 is true, D2 must be the truth day. D2 is Saturday. This means Saturday must be the truth day.
    *   This contradicts our assumption that T is Friday. So T cannot be Friday.

**Conclusion:**

We have systematically tested all possible truth days (constrained by the hint) and found that only Tuesday is consistent with all three statements and the conditions under which they were made.

Specifically, if Tuesday is the truth day:
*   On Sunday (D1), Steve lies. S1 (""I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays"") is false (he lies on Mon but not Tue). This is consistent.
*   On Monday (D2), Steve lies. S2 (""Today is either Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday"") is false (Today is Monday). This is consistent.
*   On Tuesday (D3), Steve tells the truth. S3 (""I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays"") is true (he lies on both Fri and Wed). This is consistent.
*   The sequence of days D1, D2, D3 is Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, which works correctly.

The final answer is $\boxed{Tuesday}$.",True,1,0,0
170,"Question: The last contestant has just completed the cycling leg of the triathlon.  The 15 clues that follow are with respect to this point in the race.  From the clues you must determine:  the color of shorts each runner is wearing, the positions at the end of the cycling leg, and the final standings.
Contestants in the race:  Alvin, Brian, Chuck, David, Ethan, Frank
Colors of their shorts:  red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet
1) Brian moved up two places, now just behind the runner in the red shorts.
2) The runner in the yellow shorts fell down, lost an even number of positions, and was now in last place.
3) Frank moved ahead of the runner who wore the blue shorts.
4) The runner in the orange shorts took over the lead.
5) Ethan and the runner in the green shorts switched places.
6) David moved ahead of Brian, who was not wearing the blue shorts.
7) Chuck stubbed his toe, lost one position, and was now just ahead of Alvin.
8) Ethan and Brian, neither one who wore the violet shorts, switched places.
9) Alvin moved ahead of the runners who wore the green and orange shorts.
10) David dropped behind the runners who wore the blue and violet shorts.
11) The runner in the yellow shorts moved ahead of David.
12) Chuck moved ahead of the runner who wore the orange shorts.
13) With a burst of speed, David moved ahead of Ethan, Frank, and the runner in the yellow shorts.
14) Ethan moved ahead of the runner who wore the red shorts.
15) Out of breath, the runner wearing the green shorts fell behind Brian, who now trailed the runner wearing the yellow shorts.  No further position changes occur.  The race ends.

From the clues, mark off combinations that can not exist.  ","Set up a grid of names versus colors.  From the clues, mark off combinations that can not exist.  From this, it can be found that Brian wears orange.  This leaves Ethan wearing blue.  From Clue 7 and Clue 9, Chuck can only be orange or green.  From Clue 12, Chuck can not be orange, therefore he must be green.  This leaves David wearing red, Frank wearing violet, and Alvin wearing yellow.  This establishes:  Alvin = yellow, Brian = orange, Chuck = green, David = red, Ethan = blue, Frank = violet
To determine the final results, work backward, substituting names for colors.  From Clue 15, Alvin beats Brian beats Chuck.  From Clue 14, Ethan beats David.  From Clue 13, David beats Frank beats Alvin.  This establishes the final results as:  Ethan, David, Frank, Alvin, Brian, Chuck.

171,"Question: Mad Ade's Great Uncle Gaseous O' Windpants owned the Madadian Grocery store ""The Beggars Can't Be Choosers"". Madadia was well renowned for its pungent cheeses, especially its ""Kebabrie"" and ""Chillirella"".
On display in the store were six cheese pieces weighing 15, 16, 18, 19 , 20 and 31 Pounds. Five out of the six pieces are ""Kebabrie"" and the remaining one is ""Chillirella"".
Norma Leigh-Sobar purchased two pieces of ""Kebabrie"" and Laura Anne-Hardy also purchased some ""Kebabrie"" , but she purchased twice as much in weight than Norma .
How much does the remaining ""Chillirella"" weigh?
 Hint: Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.",Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.,"Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.
Since Laura bought twice what Norma bought, the total amount of cheese bought by the two together equals 3 times that purchased by Norma alone. Now, the total weight of all the wedges at the grocery divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so the ""Chillirella"" wedge must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. But the only such wedge is the 20 pound wedge, thus the ""Chillirella"" wedge must have weighed 20 pounds.
Thus Norma purchased the 15 and 18 pound pieces which equals 33 pounds and Laura purchased the 16, 19 and 31 pound pieces which equals 66 pounds.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0
172,"Question: Twelve men are in a room, some of them always tell lies, while the others always tell the truth.
The first man says: ""None of us is a truthteller.""
The second man says: ""At most one of us is a truthteller.""

...
The twelfth and last man says: ""At most eleven of us are truthtellers.""

 Hint: It's OK to use trial and error, however, there might exist better methods.","It's OK to use trial and error, however, there might exist better methods.","If there are exactly N liars, then the last N men are truthtellers, leaving the first (12-N) men to be liars.
Therefore, N=12-N, N=6. The first 6 men are liars, and the last 6 men are truthtellers.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $N = 12$ be the number of men in the room.
Let $T$ be the number of truthtellers among the 12 men. $T$ must be an integer between 0 and 12.
Let $M_i$ denote the $i$-th man, for $i = 1, 2, \dots, 12$.
Each man is either a truthteller (always tells the truth) or a liar (always tells lies).

The statement made by the $i$-th man $M_i$ is $S_i$. Let's write down the statements:
$S_1$: ""None of us is a truthteller."" This means the number of truthtellers $T$ is 0, i.e., $T=0$. This can be written as $T \le 0$.
$S_2$: ""At most one of us is a truthteller."" This means $T \le 1$.
$S_3$: ""At most two of us are truthtellers."" This means $T \le 2$.
Following this pattern, the statement made by the $i$-th man $M_i$ is $S_i$: ""At most $i-1$ of us are truthtellers."" This can be written as $T \le i-1$.
Let's verify this for the last man:
$S_{12}$: ""At most eleven of us are truthtellers."" This means $T \le 11$. If the $i$-th man's statement is $T \le i-1$, then for $i=12$, the statement is $T \le 12-1 = 11$, which matches.

So, for $i = 1, 2, \dots, 12$, the statement of man $M_i$ is $S_i: ""T \le i-1""$.

By definition, a truthteller always tells the truth, and a liar always lies.
Thus, man $M_i$ is a truthteller if and only if his statement $S_i$ is true.
Man $M_i$ is a liar if and only if his statement $S_i$ is false.

Applying this to the statements $S_i$:
$M_i$ is a truthteller $\iff S_i$ is true $\iff T \le i-1$.
$M_i$ is a liar $\iff S_i$ is false $\iff T > i-1$.

Let $T$ be the actual number of truthtellers. We are looking for a value of $T$ that is consistent with the above conditions.
According to the condition ""$M_i$ is a truthteller $\iff T \le i-1$"", the men who are truthtellers are precisely those $M_i$ for whom $i-1 \ge T$, which is equivalent to $i \ge T+1$.
The indices $i$ that satisfy $i \ge T+1$ (up to 12) are $T+1, T+2, \dots, 12$.
The men corresponding to these indices are $M_{T+1}, M_{T+2}, \dots, M_{12}$.
The number of such men is $12 - (T+1) + 1 = 12 - T$.

Since these are precisely the truthtellers, the number of these men must be equal to the total number of truthtellers, $T$.
So, we have the equation:
$T = 12 - T$

Now we solve this equation for $T$:
$2T = 12$
$T = 6$

This implies that if a consistent solution exists, there must be exactly 6 truthtellers.
Let's verify if $T=6$ is indeed a consistent solution.
If $T=6$, then the condition for $M_i$ to be a truthteller is $6 \le i-1$, which means $i \ge 7$.
The men $M_i$ with $i \ge 7$ are $M_7, M_8, M_9, M_{10}, M_{11}, M_{12}$.
There are $12 - 7 + 1 = 6$ such men. This number is consistent with our assumption that $T=6$. So, if there are 6 truthtellers, they must be $M_7, M_8, M_9, M_{10}, M_{11}, M_{12}$.

The liars are the men who are not truthtellers. If $T=6$, the truthtellers are $M_7$ through $M_{12}$. The remaining men are $M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, M_5, M_6$. These must be the liars. There are $12 - 6 = 6$ liars.
Let's verify that these men's statements are false, given $T=6$.
According to the condition ""$M_i$ is a liar $\iff T > i-1$"", the men $M_i$ with $T > i-1$ are liars. With $T=6$, this condition is $6 > i-1$.
Let's check this for $i = 1, 2, \dots, 6$:
For $i=1$: $6 > 1-1 = 0$. This is true. So $M_1$ is a liar. Consistent.
For $i=2$: $6 > 2-1 = 1$. This is true. So $M_2$ is a liar. Consistent.

From 2 and 3, the Jones are definitely one of the sisters, and from 6, the Williams are definitely on the 3rd generation. Looking at 1 and 4, the Johnson's are on the 2nd generation and since the Smiths have a daughter, they are on the 1st or 2nd generation. But since the Jones must be one of the sisters, the Smiths cannot fall in the 2nd generation with the Johnson's. Therefore the Smiths are the grandparents.
From 6, Mrs. Williams' partner is Mr. Smith.  From 1 and 6, Mrs. Johnston and Mrs. Williams both have male partners, therefore from 5, Mrs. Smith's partner could have only been Mrs. Jones. Which also means that Jones and Johnson are the pair of sisters.

PQ - R - VW
PQ - R - WU
Hence,  8 different groups are possible.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step, keeping the ""Draw it out!"" hint in mind by systematically listing and considering the possibilities.

**1. Understand the Requirements:**
Major Steve needs to form a five-person team with specific roles:
*   1 Leader (L)
*   2 Bomb-experts (BE)
*   2 Soldiers (S)
Total members = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.

**2. List the Available Personnel for Each Role:**
*   Possible Leaders (L): {R, S, T} - (3 candidates)
*   Possible Bomb-experts (BE): {P, Q, R} - (3 candidates)
*   Possible Soldiers (S): {U, V, W} - (3 candidates)

**3. Identify the Constraints:**
*   Constraint 1: P and R prefer to work with each other in the same team. This means if P is selected for any role they are eligible for (only BE), then R must also be selected for any role they are eligible for (L or BE), and vice versa. Essentially, P is in the group IFF (If and Only If) R is in the group.
*   Constraint 2: T prefers to work only if V works. This means if T is selected as the Leader, V must be selected as one of the Soldiers.

**4. Identify Potential Conflicts/Complexities:**
*   R is listed as both a possible Leader and a possible Bomb-expert. A person can only fill one role in the team. So, R can be *either* the Leader *or* one of the Bomb-experts, but not both.
*   Constraint 1 (P/R) interacts with R's dual eligibility. If R is in the group, P must be in the group (as a BE).

**5. Structure the Problem by Cases based on R's Involvement (as R's role or absence is key):**

*   **Case 1: R is the Leader (L).**
    *   The group must have: R (as L), 2 BEs, 2 Ss.
    *   Since R is in the group (as L), Constraint 1 (P/R) dictates that P must also be in the group. P is only eligible as a Bomb-expert. So, P *must* be one of the two Bomb-experts.
    *   Let's select the team members for this case:
        *   **Leader:** R is chosen. (1 choice)
        *   **Bomb-experts:** P must be one BE. We need one more BE. R is the Leader, so R is not available as a BE. The available BE candidates (excluding R) are {P, Q}. Since P is already chosen, the other BE must be Q. So the 2 BEs are {P, Q}. (1 choice for the pair {P, Q})
        *   **Soldiers:** We need 2 Soldiers from {U, V, W}. The number of ways to choose 2 soldiers from 3 is C(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * 1!) = 3. The possible pairs are {U, V}, {U, W}, {V, W}. (3 choices)
    *   Check Constraint 2 (T/V): T is *not* the Leader in this case (R is the Leader). So, this constraint does not apply.
    *   Total possible groups in Case 1: (1 choice for L) * (1 choice for BEs) * (3 choices for Ss) = 1 * 1 * 3 = **3 groups**.
    *   These groups are: {R(L), P(BE), Q(BE), U(S), V(S)}, {R(L), P(BE), Q(BE), U(S), W(S)}, {R(L), P(BE), Q(BE), V(S), W(S)}.

*   **Case 2: R is a Bomb-expert (BE).**
    *   The group must have: 1 L, R (as one BE), 1 more BE, 2 Ss.
    *   Since R is in the group (as BE), Constraint 1 (P/R) dictates that P must also be in the group. P is only eligible as a Bomb-expert. So, P *must* be the other Bomb-expert.
    *   Let's select the team members for this case:
        *   **Bomb-experts:** R is one BE. P must be the other BE. So the 2 BEs are {R, P}. (1 choice for the pair {R, P})
        *   **Leader:** We need 1 Leader. R is a BE, so R is not available as a Leader. The available Leader candidates are {S, T}. We need to choose 1 from these 2. (2 choices: S or T)
        *   **Soldiers:** We need 2 Soldiers from {U, V, W}. (3 choices initially: {U, V}, {U, W}, {V, W})
    *   Check Constraint 2 (T/V): This constraint applies *if* T is chosen as the Leader. We need to split this case further based on the Leader choice.
        *   **Subcase 2a: S is the Leader.**
            *   Leader: S is chosen. (1 choice)
            *   Bomb-experts: {R, P} are chosen. (1 choice)
            *   Soldiers: Need 2 from {U, V, W}. C(3, 2) = 3 choices.
            *   Constraint 2 (T/V): T is not the Leader. Constraint does not apply.
            *   Total possible groups in Subcase 2a: (1 choice for L) * (1 choice for BEs) * (3 choices for Ss) = 1 * 1 * 3 = **3 groups**.
            *   These groups are: {S(L), R(BE), P(BE), U(S), V(S)}, {S(L), R(BE), P(BE), U(S), W(S)}, {S(L), R(BE), P(BE), V(S), W(S)}.
        *   **Subcase 2b: T is the Leader.**
            *   Leader: T is chosen. (1 choice)
            *   Bomb-experts: {R, P} are chosen. (1 choice)
            *   Soldiers: Need 2 from {U, V, W}. Constraint 2 applies: Since T is the Leader, V *must* be one of the Soldiers. So, one Soldier is V. We need one more Soldier from the remaining available Soldiers {U, W}. The number of ways to choose 1 more Soldier from 2 is C(2, 1) = 2! / (1! * 1!) = 2. The possible pairs of Soldiers including V are {U, V} and {V, W}. (2 choices)
            *   Total possible groups in Subcase 2b: (1 choice for L) * (1 choice for BEs) * (2 choices for Ss) = 1 * 1 * 2 = **2 groups**.
            *   These groups are: {T(L), R(BE), P(BE), U(S), V(S)}, {T(L), R(BE), P(BE), V(S), W(S)}.
    *   Total possible groups in Case 2: (Groups with S as L) + (Groups with T as L) = 3 + 2 = **5 groups**.

*   **Case 3: R is not in the group.**
    *   The group must have: 1 L, 2 BEs, 2 Ss.
    *   Constraint 1 (P/R) dictates that if R is *not* in the group, P must *not* be in the group either.
    *   Let's select the team members for this case:
        *   **Leader:** R is not available as L. Available Leaders are {S, T}. We need 1. (2 choices: S or T)
        *   **Bomb-experts:** P and R are not available as BEs. The only available BE candidate is {Q}. We need 2 BEs, but only 1 is available. This is impossible.
    *   This case yields **0 groups**.

**6. Calculate the Total Number of Different Possible Groups:**
The total number of groups is the sum of the possibilities from all valid cases.
Total = (Groups from Case 1: R is L) + (Groups from Case 2: R is BE) + (Groups from Case 3: R is not in group)
Total = 3 + 5 + 0 = 8 groups.

We have considered all possibilities for R's involvement and applied both constraints in each relevant scenario. The ""Draw it out"" hint was useful for systematically listing the team compositions within each subcase and verifying that the constraints were met for the specific members chosen.

The 8 possible groups are:
1. {R(L), P(BE), Q(BE), U(S), V(S)}
2. {R(L), P(BE), Q(BE), U(S), W(S)}
3. {R(L), P(BE), Q(BE), V(S), W(S)}
4. {S(L), R(BE), P(BE), U(S), V(S)}
5. {S(L), R(BE), P(BE), U(S), W(S)}
6. {S(L), R(BE), P(BE), V(S), W(S)}
7. {T(L), R(BE), P(BE), U(S), V(S)} (V is included because T is Leader)
8. {T(L), R(BE), P(BE), V(S), W(S)} (V is included because T is Leader)

Final confirmation checks:
*   All groups have 1L, 2BE, 2S.
*   Members are from the correct pools (R,S,T for L; P,Q,R for BE; U,V,W for S).
*   P and R are together in all 8 groups.
*   In groups 7 & 8, T is Leader, and V is included as a Soldier. In groups 1-6, T is not the Leader, so the T/V constraint doesn't impose any restriction on V.

The logic holds.

The final answer is $\boxed{8}$.",True,1,0,0

The first row requires two straight lines to make. (LTVX)
The Second row requires three straight lines to make.  (AFHKNZ)
Following the pattern, the next row should have four straight lines to make, and the only letters that do that are EMW.
(Also everything has been so far in alphabetical order so it has to be ""EMW"", not EWM, MEW, MWE, WME, or WEM.)",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is my step-by-step reasoning process to solve this problem:

1.  **Analyze the Input:**
    I am given two rows of letters and a third row with three blanks:
    LTVX
    AFHKNZ
    _ _ _
    I need to find the three letters that fill the blanks.

2.  **Examine the Hints:**
    *   Hint 1: ""The title has a partial clue."" The ""title"" is the problem statement itself, specifically the letters LTVX and AFHKNZ. This suggests the letters themselves or their arrangement contain information relevant to the pattern. The clue is ""partial"", meaning it might not tell the whole story but points in the right direction.
    *   Hint 2: ""Look down."" This strongly suggests looking at the relationship between letters in the same vertical column across the rows.
    *   Hint 3: ""They are grouped horizontally."" This tells me the final answer should be presented as a sequence of three letters written side-by-side in the third row. This describes the format of the output, not directly how to find the pattern.

3.  **Apply Hint 2 (""Look down"") to the structure:**
    Let's align the letters vertically:
    L T V X
    A F H K N Z
    ? ? ?

    The blanks are positioned under the first three columns. So I need to find the third letter in the columns starting with (L, A), (T, F), and (V, H).

    Col 1: L, A, ?
    Col 2: T, F, ?
    Col 3: V, H, ?
    Col 4: X, K
    Col 5: -, N
    Col 6: -, Z

4.  **Combine Hint 1 (""Partial clue in the title"") and Hint 2 (""Look down""):**
    The letters L, T, V, X, A, F, H, K, N, Z must contain a clue when viewed vertically. Let's examine the properties of these letters.

    Consider the shapes of the letters. Are they curves or straight lines?
    A: Straight lines only
    F: Straight lines only
    H: Straight lines only
    K: Straight lines only
    L: Straight lines only
    N: Straight lines only
    T: Straight lines only
    V: Straight lines only
    X: Straight lines only
    Z: Straight lines only

    All the letters provided are composed entirely of straight lines. This seems significant and likely is the ""partial clue"" from the title. The pattern might be related to the visual structure of the letters.

5.  **Develop a hypothesis based on letter structure:**
    Let's count the number of straight lines in each letter (using standard block capital forms):
    L: 2 lines
    T: 2 lines
    V: 2 lines
    X: 2 lines

    A: 3 lines
    F: 3 lines
    H: 3 lines
    K: 3 lines
    N: 3 lines
    Z: 3 lines

6.  **Analyze the rows based on the hypothesis:**
    Row 1: L(2), T(2), V(2), X(2). All letters in Row 1 have exactly 2 straight lines.
    Row 2: A(3), F(3), H(3), K(3), N(3), Z(3). All letters in Row 2 have exactly 3 straight lines.

7.  **Extend the pattern to the third row:**
    Following the pattern observed by ""looking down"" across the rows, it appears the pattern is based on the number of straight lines in the letters, increasing from 2 to 3. The logical continuation of this pattern for the third row is that its letters should have 4 straight lines.

8.  **Identify letters fitting the pattern for the third row:**
    I need to find letters composed only of straight lines that have exactly 4 lines. The standard block capital letters fitting this description are:
    E (4 lines)
    M (4 lines)
    W (4 lines)

    Are there any others made *only* of straight lines? No, E, M, and W are the primary ones composed solely of 4 straight segments in common block print.

9.  **Determine which letters go into the blanks:**
    The blanks are under the first three columns. Since the pattern for the third row is ""letters with 4 lines"", the letters filling the blanks must be E, M, and W. The order is not specified by the column pattern itself (as columns 1, 2, 3 just indicate *where* the blanks are), but conventionally, lists of letters are ordered alphabetically unless another order is indicated. The letters E, M, W are in alphabetical order.

    Therefore, the three letters are E, M, W.

10. **Verify against the hints:**
    *   ""The title has a partial clue."" Yes, all the letters in the input are made of straight lines, hinting at the pattern based on visual form and line count.
    *   ""Look down."" Yes, the pattern is the progression of the number of lines (2 -> 3 -> 4) when looking down the columns.
    *   ""They are grouped horizontally."" Yes, the answer is EMW in a row.

    The pattern is consistent and all hints are satisfied.

The three letters that fill the blanks are E, M, and W.

The final answer is $\boxed{EMW}$.",True,1,0,0

1.  **Identify the people involved:** There are 10 people: Tommy Tombstone (T), Lance Lamers (L), Brett Brown (B), Mitch Monday (M), Peter Poultry (P), Daniel Dusk (D), Sam Sunny (S), Keri Kernel (K), Jack Jill (J), and Harry Hills (H).

2.  **Translate the statements into relative orderings:** We use the notation A < B to mean ""A finished before B"" or ""B finished after A"".

    *   Statement 1: T finished after L and B, but before M.
        L < T and B < T and T < M.
    *   Statement 2: P finished before D and L.
        P < D and P < L.
    *   Statement 3: S finished after P and before J and H.

    *   Statement 10: H finished before M but after L, J, and T.
        H < M and L < H and J < H and T < H.

3.  **Consolidate the ""finished after"" relationships for each person:** This helps identify who could potentially be the first finisher.
    *   T finished after L (1), B (1), D (8, since S<D<T), S (8). So T > L, T > B, T > D, T > S.
    *   L finished after B (5), D (5), S (chain S<D<L), P (chain P<L). So L > B, L > D, L > S, L > P.
    *   M finished after T (1), L (5), S (6), B (6), J (9, since J<M), H (10, since H<M), D (chain D<L<M or D<J<M), P (chain P<S<M or P<J<M or P<L<M or P<D<L<M...). So M > T, M > L, M > S, M > B, M > J, M > H, M > D, M > P.
    *   P is not stated to finish after anyone in the original statements. Let's check the ""finished before"" statements. B < P (7), S > P (3). So P finished after B and before S, D, L, J, K.
    *   D finished after S (8), P (chain P<S<D). So D > S, D > P.
    *   S finished after P (3). So S > P.
    *   K finished after P (4), M (4), T (4). Since M and T are after many people, K is likely very late.
    *   J finished after P (9), D (9), S (chain S<D<J or P<S<J or P<D<J). So J > P, J > D, J > S.
    *   H finished after L (10), J (10), T (10), S (chain S<J<H or S<T<H or S<L<H or S<D<L<H or P<S<...<H). So H > L, H > J, H > T, H > S.

4.  **Identify the potential first finisher (using the hint):** The person who finished first must not have finished after anyone else. Looking at the list above, every person except Brett Brown (B) is explicitly stated to have finished after at least one other person. For B, Statement 7 says B < J, B < M, B < P. Statements 1, 5, 6 also say T>B, L>B, M>B, S<M, B<M. All statements indicate B finished *before* others or others finished *after* B. No statement says anyone finished *before* B. Thus, Brett Brown is the first finisher.
    Position 1: Brett Brown (B)

Taking Sildenafil without taking Citrate, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective.

Obviously only one conclusion is true at most. Let us suppose that all conclusions are false. This would mean that each hypothesis is also false.

186,"Question: Two friends, Joe and Smoe, were born in May, one in 1932, the other a year later. Each had an antique grandfather clock of which he was extremely proud. Both of the clocks worked fairly well considering their age, but one clock gained ten seconds per hour while the other one lost ten seconds per hour. On a day in January, the two friends set both clocks correctly at 12:00 noon. ""Do you realize,"" asked Joe, ""that the next time both of our clocks will show exactly the same time will be on your 47th birthday?"" Smoe agreed. Who is older, Joe or Smoe?
 Hint: To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again","To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again","To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again. This is when the slow clock loses six hours, and the fast one gains six hours. This will take 90 days. In 90 days they will come together at 6:00. On a calendar, there are 90 days between noon January 31, and noon May 1 in years with no leap year. If Smoe had been born in 1933, his 47th birthday would have been in 1980, a leap year. This means that Smoe must be older, born in 1932, and the time of this problem is 1979.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step, following the hint.

1.  **Analyze the Clocks' Performance:**
    *   Clock 1 gains 10 seconds per hour.
    *   Clock 2 loses 10 seconds per hour.
    *   The difference between the two clocks' indicated times changes by 10 seconds (gained by one) - (-10 seconds) (lost by the other) = 20 seconds per hour.

2.  **Determine When the Clocks Show the Same Time Again:**
    *   The clocks start at exactly the same time (12:00 noon).
    *   They will show the *same time reading* again when the accumulated *difference* between their times is a multiple of 12 hours. This is because a standard analog clock dial repeats every 12 hours. If one clock is 12 hours ahead and the other is 12 hours behind, they will both show the same reading as a standard clock, and thus the same reading as each other.
    *   12 hours = 12 * 60 minutes = 720 minutes.
    *   12 hours = 720 * 60 seconds = 43200 seconds.
    *   The difference between the clocks accumulates at a rate of 20 seconds per hour.
    *   To find out how many hours it takes for the difference to accumulate to 43200 seconds, we divide the total difference needed by the rate of difference:
        Time = Total difference / Rate of difference
        Time = 43200 seconds / (20 seconds/hour)
        Time = 2160 hours.

3.  **Convert the Time Duration to Days:**
    *   There are 24 hours in a day.
    *   Time in days = 2160 hours / (24 hours/day)
    *   Time in days = 90 days.
    *   So, the clocks will show exactly the same time again after precisely 90 days.

4.  **Connect the Time Duration to the Birthday Information:**
    *   The clocks were set correctly on a day in January.
    *   The next time they showed the same time was 90 days later.
    *   This date, 90 days after the starting day in January, is one of the friends' 47th birthday.
    *   The friends were born in May, one in 1932, the other in 1933.
    *   Their 47th birthdays would be in the year 1932 + 47 = 1979, or 1933 + 47 = 1980.
    *   The conversation and the setting of the clocks happen on a day in January *before* this 47th birthday.
    *   So, the starting day in January must be in 1979 if the birthday is in May 1979, or in 1980 if the birthday is in May 1980.

5.  **Calculate the End Date Based on the 90-Day Interval:**
    *   Let J be the day in January when the clocks were set (1 ≤ J ≤ 31).
    *   Let B be the day in May when the birthday occurs (1 ≤ B ≤ 31).
    *   The interval is 90 days.
    *   Days remaining in January = 31 - J.
    *   Days in February = depends on whether the year is a leap year.
    *   Days in March = 31.
    *   Days in April = 30.
    *   Days in May until the birthday = B.
    *   Total days = (31 - J) + Days in February + 31 + 30 + B = 90.

6.  **Consider the Possible Years (1979 and 1980):**
    *   **Case 1: The 47th birthday is in May 1979.**
        *   The clocks were set in January 1979.
        *   1979 is not a leap year (1979 divided by 4 is not a whole number). So, February 1979 has 28 days.
        *   The equation is: (31 - J) + 28 + 31 + 30 + B = 90.
        *   (31 - J) + 89 + B = 90.
        *   120 - J + B = 90.
        *   B - J = 90 - 120.
        *   B - J = -30.
        *   B = J - 30.
        *   Since B must be at least 1 (a day in May), J - 30 ≥ 1, so J ≥ 31.
        *   Since J must be a day in January (1 ≤ J ≤ 31), the only possible value for J is 31.
        *   If J = 31, then B = 31 - 30 = 1.
        *   This gives a valid date: The clocks were set on January 31st, 1979, and the 90-day interval ends on May 1st, 1979.

    *   **Case 2: The 47th birthday is in May 1980.**
        *   The clocks were set in January 1980.
        *   1980 is a leap year (1980 divided by 4 is a whole number). So, February 1980 has 29 days.
        *   The equation is: (31 - J) + 29 + 31 + 30 + B = 90.
        *   (31 - J) + 90 + B = 90.
        *   121 - J + B = 90.
        *   B - J = 90 - 121.
        *   B - J = -31.
        *   B = J - 31.
        *   Since B must be at least 1, J - 31 ≥ 1, so J ≥ 32.
        *   Since J must be a day in January (1 ≤ J ≤ 31), there is no possible value for J that is 32 or greater.
        *   This case is impossible.

7.  **Identify the Scenario:**
    *   The only possible scenario is that the clocks were set on January 31st, 1979, and the next time they showed the same time was on May 1st, 1979.
    *   May 1st, 1979, is the 47th birthday of one of the friends.

8.  **Determine the Birth Year of the Birthday Person:**
    *   If May 1st, 1979, is a person's 47th birthday, they were born in the year 1979 - 47 = 1932.

9.  **Identify Who Was Born in 1932:**
    *   The friends were born in May, one in 1932, the other in 1933.
    *   Joe said to Smoe, ""the next time both of our clocks will show exactly the same time will be on *your* 47th birthday.""
    *   This means the 47th birthday that occurred on May 1st, 1979, is Smoe's birthday.
    *   Therefore, Smoe was born in 1932.

10. **Identify Joe's Birth Year and Determine Who is Older:**
    *   Smoe was born in 1932.
    *   The other friend (Joe) was born a year later.
    *   Joe was born in 1933.
    *   The person born in an earlier year is older.
    *   Smoe was born in 1932, and Joe was born in 1933.
    *   Smoe is older than Joe.

Final answer: Smoe is older.",True,1,0,0

Sue was in blue and made nine spinning tops.
Jane was in red and made five balls.
Spry Johnny was in green and made three racing cars.
Cher was in yellow and made six trains.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break down this logic puzzle step by step using the clues and the hint.

**1. Identify the Key Components:**
Based on the poem and the hint, we know there are 5 elves, 5 different colors, 5 different toys, and 5 different numbers of toys made. The total number of toys is 30. Each elf made more than two toys.

**2. List the Known Facts Directly from the Poem:**
*   Total toys: 30
*   Number of elves: 5
*   Each elf made a distinct number of toys (> 2).
*   Each elf has a distinct color.
*   Each elf made a distinct toy.
*   Jane made 5 toys.
*   Johnny Elf made racing cars.
*   Marcia elf was dressed in orange.
*   The elf who dressed in yellow suits made trains.
*   One elf dressed in blue.
*   The elf who made the spinning tops made the most toys.
*   The elf who dressed in green made one-third as many as Sue.
*   Cher made 1 more toy than the elf in reds.
*   Cher made 1 less toy than the elf who made the sleds.

**3. Deduce the Set of Numbers:**
*   We need 5 distinct integers, each greater than 2, that sum to 30.
*   One of these numbers is 5 (Jane's amount).
*   Let the 5 numbers be {n1, n2, n3, n4, n5}. One of these is 5.
*   The sum of the other four numbers is 30 - 5 = 25.
*   From the clues about Cher, the elf in reds, and the elf who made sleds, there must be three consecutive numbers in our set (R, C, S where C = R+1 and S = C+1). Since the amounts are distinct, these three numbers must be part of the set.
*   From the clue about the green elf and Sue, one number in the set (Sue's amount, U) must be a multiple of 3, and another number in the set (Green's amount, G) must be U/3.

Let's list sets of 5 distinct integers > 2 summing to 30 and check the conditions:
*   Start with the smallest possible numbers > 2: 3, 4, 6, 7, 10 (Sum = 30). Contains 5? No. Contains 3 consecutive numbers? No (4, 6, 7 are not consecutive). Green=Sue/3? 3=10/3(no), 4=??, 6=??, 7=??. No.
*   Try other combinations...
*   Let's focus on the consecutive numbers clue (R, C, S). These must be in the set.
*   Let's focus on the G=U/3 clue. A number U and U/3 must be in the set. U must be a multiple of 3, and U/3 must be > 2. Possible pairs (G, U) where both > 2: (3, 9), (4, 12), (5, 15), etc.

Let's try a set containing 5 and checking the consecutive/G=U/3 rules:
*   If the consecutive sequence is 4, 5, 6: Then C=5. But Jane made 5 toys, and amounts must be distinct. So Cher cannot have made 5 toys. Thus, the consecutive sequence cannot have 5 as the middle number.
*   If the consecutive sequence is 5, 6, 7: Then C=6, R=5, S=7. The Red elf made 5 toys. Jane made 5 toys. This means Jane is the Red elf. The Sleds elf made 7 toys. Cher made 6 toys. This set {..., 5, 6, 7, ...} works with Jane=5 and the Cher/Red/Sleds clues.
*   So, our set of numbers must contain 5, 6, and 7. The set looks like {n1, n2, 5, 6, 7} or {5, 6, 7, n4, n5}. The sum must be 30. 5+6+7 = 18. The sum of the remaining two numbers must be 30 - 18 = 12.
*   We need two distinct numbers > 2, not 5, 6, or 7, that sum to 12.
    *   Possible pairs summing to 12: (3, 9), (4, 8).
*   Possible sets of 5 numbers:
    *   Set A: {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}. Let's check: All distinct? Yes. All > 2? Yes. Sum = 3+5+6+7+9 = 30. Yes. Contains 5? Yes. Contains consecutive 5, 6, 7? Yes. Contains a G=U/3 pair? Yes, (3, 9) where G=3, U=9. This set works!
    *   Set B: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Let's check: All distinct? Yes. All > 2? Yes. Sum = 4+5+6+7+8 = 30. Yes. Contains 5? Yes. Contains consecutive 5, 6, 7? Yes. Contains a G=U/3 pair? 4=8/2(no), 5=??, 6=??, 7=??, 8=??. No pair (G, U) where G=U/3 and both are in the set. This set does not work.

*   Therefore, the set of amounts of toys made by the 5 elves is {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}.

**4. Assign Numbers Based on Clues:**
*   Jane made 5 toys. (Given)
*   The set of amounts is {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}.
*   Consecutive numbers 5, 6, 7 mean R=5, C=6, S=7.
    *   The elf in Red made 5 toys. Since Jane made 5 toys, **Jane is the elf in Red.**
    *   Cher made 6 toys. **Cher made 6 toys.**
    *   The elf who made Sleds made 7 toys. **The Sleds elf made 7 toys.**
*   G=U/3 pair (3, 9). Green made 3 toys, Sue made 9 toys. **The Green elf made 3 toys.** **Sue made 9 toys.**
*   The elf who made the Spinning Tops made the most toys. The largest number in {3, 5, 6, 7, 9} is 9. Sue made 9 toys. **Sue made Spinning Tops.**

**5. Summarize Known Assignments:**
*   Jane: Red, 5 toys
*   Cher: 6 toys
*   Sue: 9 toys, Spinning Tops
*   Green elf: 3 toys
*   Sleds elf: 7 toys
*   Johnny: Racing Cars
*   Marcia: Orange
*   Yellow elf: Trains
*   Blue elf: ?
*   Balls elf: ?

**6. Deduce More Assignments:**
*   Numbers assigned: Jane (5), Cher (6), Sue (9), Green (3), Sleds (7).
*   The elf who made 3 toys is the Green elf. The possible elves are Cher, Johnny, Marcia. Cher made 6, Sue made 9, Jane made 5. So the Green elf is either Johnny or Marcia. Their amounts are 3 and 7.
*   The elf who made 7 toys made Sleds. The possible elves are Cher, Johnny, Marcia, Sue. Cher made 6, Sue made 9, Jane made 5. So the Sleds elf is either Johnny or Marcia. Their amounts are 3 and 7.

*   Let's consider Johnny and Marcia. Their amounts are 3 and 7.
    *   If Johnny made 3 toys, then Johnny is the Green elf. If Johnny made Racing Cars, then the Green elf made Racing Cars and 3 toys.
    *   If Johnny made 7 toys, then Johnny is the Sleds elf. If Johnny made Racing Cars, then the Sleds elf made Racing Cars and 7 toys.

    *   Let's consider Marcia. She is Orange. Her amount is 3 or 7.
    *   If Marcia made 3 toys, then Marcia is the Green elf. But Marcia is Orange. An elf can only have one color. So Marcia cannot be Green. This means Marcia cannot have made 3 toys.
    *   Therefore, **Marcia must have made 7 toys.**
    *   If Marcia made 7 toys, and the Sleds elf made 7 toys, then **Marcia made Sleds.**
    *   This also means **Johnny must have made 3 toys.**
    *   If Johnny made 3 toys, and the Green elf made 3 toys, then **Johnny is the Green elf.**

**7. Update Summarized Assignments:**
*   Jane: Red, 5 toys
*   Cher: 6 toys
*   Sue: 9 toys, Spinning Tops
*   Johnny: Green, 3 toys, Racing Cars
*   Marcia: Orange, 7 toys, Sleds

**8. Fill in Remaining Gaps:**
*   Elves: All 5 named and placed.
*   Numbers: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 assigned.
*   Colors: Red (Jane), Green (Johnny), Orange (Marcia) assigned. Remaining colors: Yellow, Blue. Remaining elves needing colors: Cher, Sue.
*   Toys: Spinning Tops (Sue), Racing Cars (Johnny), Sleds (Marcia) assigned. Remaining toys: Trains, Balls. Remaining elves needing toys: Cher, Jane.

*   We know the Yellow elf made Trains.
*   The remaining elves needing colors are Cher and Sue.
    *   Can Sue be Yellow? If Sue is Yellow, she made Trains. But Sue made Spinning Tops. So Sue cannot be Yellow.
    *   Therefore, **Cher is the Yellow elf.**
    *   The Yellow elf made Trains. So, **Cher made Trains.**

*   Remaining color: Blue. Remaining elf needing color: Sue. So, **Sue is the Blue elf.** (Confirmed by earlier deduction based on Green=Sue/3 and Yellow=Trains).

*   Remaining toys: Balls. Remaining elf needing a toy: Jane. So, **Jane made Balls.**

**9. Final Table of Assignments:**

| Elf     | Color   | Toy           | Number |
| :------ | :------ | :------------ | :----- |
| Cher    | Yellow  | Trains        | 6      |
| Johnny  | Green   | Racing Cars   | 3      |

| Sue     | Blue    | Spinning Tops | 9      |
| Marcia  | Orange  | Sleds         | 7      |

**10. Final Verification:**
*   5 elves, 5 colors, 5 toys, 5 numbers {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}. All distinct. All numbers > 2. Sum = 30.

189,"Question: You are back on the same game show with four other contestants. You didn't realise last time that the winner gets another appearance on the show! You now have another chance to win half a million dollars and become a millionaire! The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues. The first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. When adding the first number of the third set with the second number of the second set, you will get a number below 8.
2. The only digits not used in the code are 5 and 7.
3. When adding the two digits of the first set together, you will not get 10.
4. If you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed.
5. No set has a number above 90.
6. The product of both the digits in the first set is below 30 but above 20.
7. One of the number sets is 66.
8. There is only one 8 in the combination, and it is in the last set.
Now, get cracking!

 Hint: ??-??-66-??",??-??-66-??,"The set is 39-21-66-48.
First of all, the second clue tells you there are no 5's or 7's in the combination.
Now we go to the fourth clue. It tells you that if you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed. There are only a few numbers that will satisfy this:
11, 12, 16, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
Now we skip down to clue 8, which tells us there is one 8 only, and it is in the last set. It could either be the first digit or the second digit.
However, this eliminates these numbers from being in the second set: 11, 16, 23 and 24. Now, only 12, 21 and 22 are the possibilities for being in the second set.
Now, let's look at clue 7. This tells us that 66 is one of the four number sets. We know it can't be in the second, or fourth, and since clue six tells us the product of the two numbers in the first set ranges from 21-29, 66 must go in the third set.
??-??-66-??
Now we must look at the first clue. The first number of the third set (6) plus the second number of the second set will get a number below 8. This means it cannot be 12 or 22, because they would both total 8. This means that the second set of numbers is 21. Making good progress!
??-21-66-??
Now, we come back to clue 4 which tells us the second set multiplied by 4 equals the fourth set reversed. 21 multiplied by 4 is 84, which when reversed is 48!
??-21-66-48
Now, we come back to clue 6, which tells us the product of the digits in the first set is above 20 but below 30. These are the only numbers that satisfy that condition - and remember, no 5's, 7's or 8's are left in the combination:
39 (3 * 9 = 27)
46 (4 * 6 = 24)
64 (6 * 4 = 24)
93 (9 * 3 = 27)
Now, we look at clue 5. This eliminates 93. Now, come to clue 3. This tells us the sum of the two digits in the first set does not equal 10. This eliminates 46 and 64. The only number left is.... 39!
Now you have your answer;
39-21-66-48
Congratulations!!! You won, again!! You are over the moon! You have become the first millionaire in five generations of your family history!!",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step using the clues and the provided hint.

The safe combination is in the format ??-??-??-??. It consists of 8 digits.
A digit can be used more than once.
There are no zeroes. This means the allowed digits are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let the combination be $d_{11}d_{12}-d_{21}d_{22}-d_{31}d_{32}-d_{41}d_{42}$, where $d_{ij}$ is the j-th digit of the i-th set. Let $N_i$ be the number represented by the i-th set ($N_i = 10d_{i1} + d_{i2}$).

The hint is ??-??-66-??. This tells us the third set is 66 ($N_3 = 66$).
This matches Clue 7 (One of the number sets is 66).
From this, we know $d_{31} = 6$ and $d_{32} = 6$.

Now, let's use the clues in a logical order:

1.  **Clue 2:** The only digits *not* used in the code are 5 and 7.
    This is a crucial constraint. All 8 digits in the combination must come from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}.
    Our current digits (from $N_3=66$) are 6 and 6, which are in this allowed set.

2.  **Clue 1:** When adding the first number of the third set with the second number of the second set, you will get a number below 8.
    This means $d_{31} + d_{22} < 8$.
    We know $d_{31} = 6$. So, $6 + d_{22} < 8$.
    This implies $d_{22} < 2$.
    Since $d_{22}$ must be an allowed digit from {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}, the only digit less than 2 in this set is 1.
    So, $d_{22} = 1$.
    Our combination is now ??-$d_{21}$1-66-??.

3.  **Clue 8:** There is only one 8 in the combination, and it is in the last set ($N_4$).
    This tells us two things:
    a) Out of the 8 digits in the combination, exactly one is an 8.
    b) This single 8 must be either $d_{41}$ or $d_{42}$.
    This means no 8 is allowed in the first set ($N_1$), the second set ($N_2$), or the third set ($N_3$).
    We currently have digits {1, 6, 6} determined. None of these are 8, which is consistent.
    The digit $d_{21}$ (the remaining unknown digit in $N_2$) must not be 8.
    The digits $d_{11}$ and $d_{12}$ (in $N_1$) must not be 8.

4.  **Clue 6:** The product of both the digits in the first set is below 30 but above 20.
    $20 < d_{11} \times d_{12} < 30$.
    The digits $d_{11}$ and $d_{12}$ must be from the allowed set {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}, and neither can be 8 (from Clue 8).
    So, $d_{11}, d_{12} \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9\}$.
    Let's list products of pairs from this set that fall between 20 and 30:
    - $1 \times anything$ (max 9) - too small
    - $2 \times anything$ (max $2 \times 9 = 18$) - too small
    - $3 \times 1=3, 3 \times 2=6, 3 \times 3=9, 3 \times 4=12, 3 \times 6=18$ - too small
    - $3 \times 9 = 27$. This product is between 20 and 30. The digits are {3, 9}.
    - $4 \times 1=4, 4 \times 2=8, 4 \times 3=12, 4 \times 4=16$ - too small
    - $4 \times 6 = 24$. This product is between 20 and 30. The digits are {4, 6}.
    - $4 \times 9 = 36$ - too large
    - $6 \times 1=6, \ldots, 6 \times 4=24$ (already found)
    - $6 \times 6 = 36$ - too large
    - $6 \times 9 = 54$ - too large
    - $9 \times anything$ - will be larger than 27 or too small.
    So, the digits in the first set ($d_{11}, d_{12}$) must be either {3, 9} or {4, 6}.

5.  **Clue 3:** When adding the two digits of the first set together, you will not get 10.
    $d_{11} + d_{12} \neq 10$.
    Let's check the sums of the possible pairs from Clue 6:
    - Digits {3, 9}: $3 + 9 = 12$. $12 \neq 10$. This pair is possible.
    - Digits {4, 6}: $4 + 6 = 10$. $10 = 10$. This pair is *not* possible.
    Therefore, the digits in the first set ($N_1$) must be 3 and 9. The first set is either 39 or 93.

6.  We now have the digits for $N_1$ ({3, 9}), $d_{22}=1$, and $N_3=66$.
    The combination is either 39-$d_{21}$1-66-?? or 93-$d_{21}$1-66-??.
    The digit $d_{21}$ must be from the allowed set {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9} and cannot be 8 (from Clue 8).
    So, possible values for $d_{21}$ are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}.
    The digits for $N_4$ must be from the allowed set {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9} and contain exactly one 8.

7.  **Clue 4:** If you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed.
    $4 \times N_2 = 10 d_{42} + d_{41}$ (reversed $N_4$).
    $N_2 = 10 d_{21} + d_{22} = 10 d_{21} + 1$.
    So, $4 \times (10 d_{21} + 1) = 10 d_{42} + d_{41}$.
    Let's test the possible values for $d_{21}$ ({1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}) and see what values we get for $10 d_{42} + d_{41}$. We then check if the resulting digits ($d_{41}, d_{42}$) are allowed and satisfy Clue 8 (exactly one 8 in $N_4$).

    - If $d_{21}=1$: $4 \times (10 \times 1 + 1) = 4 \times 11 = 44$.
      Reversed $N_4 = 44$. This means $d_{42}=4, d_{41}=4$. The digits for $N_4$ are {4, 4}.
      Are these allowed? Yes (4 is in {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}).
      Exactly one 8 in $N_4$? No (zero 8s). This case is not possible.

    - If $d_{21}=2$: $4 \times (10 \times 2 + 1) = 4 \times 21 = 84$.
      Reversed $N_4 = 84$. This means $d_{42}=8, d_{41}=4$. The digits for $N_4$ are {4, 8}.
      Are these allowed? Yes (4 and 8 are in {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}).
      Exactly one 8 in $N_4$? Yes ($d_{42}=8, d_{41}=4$). This satisfies Clue 8.
      This gives $N_4 = 10d_{41} + d_{42} = 10(4) + 8 = 48$. This is a possible solution for $N_4$.

    - If $d_{21}=3$: $4 \times (10 \times 3 + 1) = 4 \times 31 = 124$.
      Reversed $N_4 = 124$. A two-digit number $10 d_{42} + d_{41}$ formed by digits from {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9} can be at most $10(9)+9=99$. 124 is too large. This case is not possible.

    - If $d_{21}=4$: $4 \times (10 \times 4 + 1) = 4 \times 41 = 164$. Too large. Not possible.

    - If $d_{21}=6$: $4 \times (10 \times 6 + 1) = 4 \times 61 = 244$. Too large. Not possible.

    - If $d_{21}=9$: $4 \times (10 \times 9 + 1) = 4 \times 91 = 364$. Too large. Not possible.

    The only possible value for $d_{21}$ is 2. This means $N_2 = 21$ and $N_4 = 48$.

8.  Putting it all together:
    - $N_1$ digits are {3, 9} (either 39 or 93).
    - $N_2 = 21$.
    - $N_3 = 66$.
    - $N_4 = 48$.

    The two potential combinations are:
    a) 39-21-66-48
    b) 93-21-66-48

9.  **Clue 5:** No set has a number above 90.
    Let's check this for both potential combinations:
    a) 39-21-66-48:
    $N_1=39 \le 90$. Yes.
    $N_2=21 \le 90$. Yes.
    $N_3=6",True,0,0,0
190,"Question: A warden at a prison decides to give some prisoners a chance to escape by working together to solve a puzzle. He prepares a colored hat for every one of them and tells them the rules. The hats can be either black or white and will be placed on everyone's head.  The prisoners will get a chance to discuss a strategy together, which they will all follow, then they will be marched out into a large room where they will see everybody else's hat color. Each prisoner will then simultaneously guess which of the two hat colors they have. If every one of them is right, or every one of them is wrong, they will all go free. However, the prisoners will not be allowed to communicate in any way during this process. Also, the warden will hear their strategy and place hats any way he can to prevent them from going free. What strategy do they use to escape?
 Hint: Think about it for two people and then three people. What will be the difference between what a white hatted person sees and a black hatted person sees?",Think about it for two people and then three people. What will be the difference between what a white hatted person sees and a black hatted person sees?,"Every prisoner should count up how many black hats they see. If they count an odd number of black hats, they say that they have a black hat. If they count an even number of black hats, then they say that they have a white hat.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this classic puzzle down step by step, following the hint to consider smaller numbers of prisoners first.

**Understanding the Core Challenge**

The prisoners cannot communicate after the hats are placed. Each prisoner sees everyone else's hat but not their own. They must all guess simultaneously. The success condition is strict: *either* everyone is correct, *or* everyone is incorrect. The warden knows their strategy and will try to choose hat colors to make them fail (meaning some are right and some are wrong).

The key insight must come from what a prisoner *can* deduce from the hats they see, and how that deduction changes based on the color of the hat they *cannot* see (their own).

**Applying the Hint: Two Prisoners (N=2)**

Let the two prisoners be P1 and P2. The possible hat configurations are (B, B), (B, W), (W, B), (W, W).
*   P1 sees P2's hat.
*   P2 sees P1's hat.

Let's think about what P1 sees and what P2 sees in each case:
1.  **(B, B)**: P1 sees B, P2 sees B.
2.  **(B, W)**: P1 sees W, P2 sees B.
3.  **(W, B)**: P1 sees B, P2 sees W.
4.  **(W, W)**: P1 sees W, P2 sees W.

How can they devise a strategy based on this limited information? The hint asks about the ""difference between what a white hatted person sees and a black hatted person sees"".

Consider the *parity* (whether it's even or odd) of the number of black hats seen by each prisoner.

*   **(B, B)**: Total Black = 2 (Even). P1 (B) sees 1 B (Odd). P2 (B) sees 1 B (Odd).
*   **(B, W)**: Total Black = 1 (Odd). P1 (B) sees 1 B (Odd). P2 (W) sees 0 B (Even).
*   **(W, B)**: Total Black = 1 (Odd). P1 (W) sees 1 B (Odd). P2 (B) sees 0 B (Even).
*   **(W, W)**: Total Black = 0 (Even). P1 (W) sees 0 B (Even). P2 (W) sees 0 B (Even).

Let's summarize the observed parity of black hats:

| Config | Total B Parity | P1 (hat color) Sees B Parity | P2 (hat color) Sees B Parity |
| :----- | :------------- | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| BB     | Even           | Odd (B)                      | Odd (B)                      |
| BW     | Odd            | Odd (B)                      | Even (W)                     |
| WB     | Odd            | Odd (W)                      | Even (B)                     |
| WW     | Even           | Even (W)                     | Even (W)                     |

Look closely at the relationship between a prisoner's *own* hat color and the parity of black hats they *see*, relative to the *total* parity of black hats.

*   If a prisoner has a **White** hat, the number of black hats they see is equal to the total number of black hats. So, the parity of black hats they see is the **same** as the total parity.
*   If a prisoner has a **Black** hat, the number of black hats they see is one less than the total number of black hats. So, the parity of black hats they see is the **opposite** of the total parity.

This is the crucial observation! A prisoner cannot know the total number of black hats, but they know how the number of black hats they *see* relates to the total number based on their own hat color.

**The Strategy for N Prisoners (Including 2 and 3)**

The prisoners can agree on a convention beforehand. This convention will be a shared assumption about the *parity* of the *total* number of black hats among *all* prisoners. For example, they can agree to assume that ""the total number of black hats is even"".

Let's outline the strategy based on this convention (assuming the total number of black hats is even):

1.  **Convention (agreed beforehand):** We will assume the total number of black hats on everyone's heads is *even*.
2.  **Each Prisoner's Action:**
    *   Look at all the other prisoners' hats.
    *   Count the number of black hats you see.
    *   If the number of black hats you see is **even**: Guess that your own hat is **White**. (Because if your hat were Black, the total number of black hats would be odd, contradicting our assumption).
    *   If the number of black hats you see is **odd**: Guess that your own hat is **Black**. (Because if your hat were White, the total number of black hats would be odd, contradicting our assumption).

**Why This Strategy Guarantees Escape**

Let's analyze this strategy based on the actual total number of black hats ($T_B$):

**Case 1: The actual total number of black hats ($T_B$) is Even (matches the assumption).**
*   Any prisoner with a **White** hat sees $T_B$ black hats. Since $T_B$ is even, they see an even number of black hats. According to the strategy, they guess White. This is **correct**.
*   Any prisoner with a **Black** hat sees $T_B - 1$ black hats. Since $T_B$ is even, $T_B - 1$ is odd. They see an odd number of black hats. According to the strategy, they guess Black. This is **correct**.
*   In this case, *every single prisoner* guesses their hat color correctly. They all go free.

**Case 2: The actual total number of black hats ($T_B$) is Odd (does not match the assumption).**
*   Any prisoner with a **White** hat sees $T_B$ black hats. Since $T_B$ is odd, they see an odd number of black hats. According to the strategy (see odd -> guess Black), they guess Black. This is **incorrect**.
*   Any prisoner with a **Black** hat sees $T_B - 1$ black hats. Since $T_B$ is odd, $T_B - 1$ is even. They see an even number of black hats. According to the strategy (see even -> guess White), they guess White. This is **incorrect**.
*   In this case, *every single prisoner* guesses their hat color incorrectly. They all go free.

Since these are the only two possibilities for the actual total number of black hats (it's either even or odd), the strategy guarantees that *either* everyone is correct *or* everyone is incorrect, regardless of the hat configuration chosen by the warden. The warden cannot create a scenario where some are right and some are wrong.

**Conclusion**

The prisoners agree beforehand on a convention regarding the parity of the total number of black hats (e.g., ""the total is even""). Each prisoner then counts the black hats they can see on the others. If this count has the same parity as the agreed-upon total parity, they guess White. If the count has the opposite parity, they guess Black. This strategy ensures that the outcome is always either all correct or all incorrect, leading to their escape.

Final answer: The prisoners agree beforehand on a parity (even or odd) for the total number of black hats among them. Each prisoner counts the number of black hats they can see on the other prisoners. If this count matches the agreed-upon parity, they guess that their own hat is White. If the count does not match the agreed-upon parity, they guess that their own hat is Black. This strategy ensures that either all prisoners guess correctly (if the actual total number of black hats matches the agreed-upon parity) or all prisoners guess incorrectly (if the actual total number of black hats does not match the agreed-upon parity), satisfying the condition for their escape.",True,1,0,0

193,"Question: It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.
You quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...
 Hint: If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.

For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.
What else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!

S1: M + C = 9
S2: W = C + 2
S3: M * W = 24
S4: (M=4 or W=4 or C=4)
S5: (M=6 or W=6 or C=6)
S6: (M=8 or W=8 or C=8)

Exactly one of these six statements is false.

The hint asks: Can S4, S5, S6 all be true at the same time?
If S4, S5, and S6 are all true, then the numbers M, W, and C must be a permutation of the set {4, 6, 8}.
Let's examine the possible assignments of M, W, C to the values 4, 6, 8 and check if they satisfy statements S1, S2, and S3. If S4, S5, S6 are true, then the single false statement must be one of S1, S2, or S3. This means that exactly two of S1, S2, S3 must be true.

Let's check the 3! = 6 permutations of (4, 6, 8) for (M, W, C):
1. (M, W, C) = (4, 6, 8):
S1: M + C = 4 + 8 = 12. S1 says 9. False.
S2: W = C + 2. 6 = 8 + 2 = 10. S2 says 6. False.
S3: M * W = 4 * 6 = 24. S3 says 24. True.
In this case, S1 and S2 are false. If S4, S5, S6 are true, and S1 and S2 are false, the total number of false statements is 2+0=2. This contradicts the condition that exactly one statement is false.

2. (M, W, C) = (4, 8, 6):
S1: M + C = 4 + 6 = 10. S1 says 9. False.
S2: W = C + 2. 8 = 6 + 2 = 8. S2 says 8. True.
S3: M * W = 4 * 8 = 32. S3 says 24. False.
In this case, S1 and S3 are false. Total false statements = 2. Contradiction.

3. (M, W, C) = (6, 4, 8):
S1: M + C = 6 + 8 = 14. S1 says 9. False.
S2: W = C + 2. 4 = 8 + 2 = 10. S2 says 4. False.
S3: M * W = 6 * 4 = 24. S3 says 24. True.
In this case, S1 and S2 are false. Total false statements = 2. Contradiction.

4. (M, W, C) = (6, 8, 4):
S1: M + C = 6 + 4 = 10. S1 says 9. False.
S2: W = C + 2. 8 = 4 + 2 = 6. S2 says 8. False.
S3: M * W = 6 * 8 = 48. S3 says 24. False.
In this case, S1, S2, and S3 are false. Total false statements = 3. Contradiction.

5. (M, W, C) = (8, 4, 6):
S1: M + C = 8 + 6 = 14. S1 says 9. False.
S2: W = C + 2. 4 = 6 + 2 = 8. S2 says 4. False.
S3: M * W = 8 * 4 = 32. S3 says 24. False.
In this case, S1, S2, and S3 are false. Total false statements = 3. Contradiction.

6. (M, W, C) = (8, 6, 4):
S1: M + C = 8 + 4 = 12. S1 says 9. False.
S2: W = C + 2. 6 = 4 + 2 = 6. S2 says 6. True.
S3: M * W = 8 * 6 = 48. S3 says 24. False.
In this case, S1 and S3 are false. Total false statements = 2. Contradiction.

In every permutation of {4, 6, 8} for (M, W, C), at least two of the statements S1, S2, S3 are false. If S4, S5, S6 were all true, the total number of false statements would be at least 2. This contradicts the problem statement that exactly one statement is false.
Therefore, statements S4, S5, and S6 cannot all be true simultaneously.

Since exactly one statement is false out of the six, and it cannot be that S4, S5, S6 are all true, the single false statement must be one of S4, S5, or S6.
This implies that statements S1, S2, and S3 must all be true.

Let's solve the system of equations assuming S1, S2, and S3 are true:
S1: M + C = 9
S2: W = C + 2
S3: M * W = 24

From S1, we can express C as C = 9 - M.
Substitute this into S2: W = (9 - M) + 2 = 11 - M.
Substitute this expression for W into S3: M * (11 - M) = 24.
11M - M^2 = 24
M^2 - 11M + 24 = 0
Factor the quadratic equation: (M - 3)(M - 8) = 0.
The possible integer values for M are 3 or 8.

Case 1: M = 3
If M = 3, then from S1: 3 + C = 9 => C = 6.
From S2: W = C + 2 => W = 6 + 2 = 8.
Let's check S3: M * W = 3 * 8 = 24. This is consistent with S3.
So, (M, W, C) = (3, 8, 6) is a possible solution if S1, S2, S3 are true.
Let's check this solution against S4, S5, S6:
S4: (M=4 or W=4 or C=4)? Is 3=4 or 8=4 or 6=4? No. S4 is false.
S5: (M=6 or W=6 or C=6)? Is 3=6 or 8=6 or 6=6? Yes, C=6. S5 is true.
S6: (M=8 or W=8 or C=8)? Is 3=8 or 8=8 or 6=8? Yes, W=8. S6 is true.
In this case, S1, S2, S3 are true, S4 is false, S5 is true, S6 is true. This gives exactly one false statement (S4), which matches the problem condition.

Case 2: M = 8
If M = 8, then from S1: 8 + C = 9 => C = 1.
From S2: W = C + 2 => W = 1 + 2 = 3.
Let's check S3: M * W = 8 * 3 = 24. This is consistent with S3.
So, (M, W, C)",True,1,0,0

After you have done this, can you tell me which letter comes just above the letter which comes between the letter just before the letter just below B and the letter just before the letter just above Y?
 Hint: One step at a time",One step at a time,"The letter is G.
The two letters to initially find are F & S. The letter above the one which is between them is G.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step, as the hint suggests.

First, we need to construct the 5x5 letter square according to the rules.
*   It's a 5x5 grid.
*   It uses the alphabet minus the letter Q (25 letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
*   A is in the upper left-hand corner.
*   Z is in the lower right-hand corner.

Filling the grid sequentially, row by row:

Row 1: A B C D E
Row 2: F G H I J
Row 3: K L M N O
Row 4: P R S T U
Row 5: V W X Y Z

This is our 5x5 letter square.

Now, let's break down the question: ""which letter comes just above the letter which comes between the letter just before the letter just below B and the letter just before the letter just above Y?""

We will work from the innermost part outwards.

1.  **""the letter just below B""**:
    *   In our grid, B is in the first row, second column.
    *   The letter just below B is in the second row, second column.
    *   Looking at the grid, the letter at Row 2, Column 2 is **G**.

2.  **""the letter just before the letter just below B""**:
    *   This is ""the letter just before **G**"".
    *   Looking at our alphabet sequence (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, ...), the letter just before G is **F**.

3.  **""the letter just above Y""**:
    *   In our grid, Y is in the fifth row, fourth column.
    *   The letter just above Y is in the fourth row, fourth column.
    *   Looking at the grid, the letter at Row 4, Column 4 is **T**.

4.  **""the letter just before the letter just above Y""**:
    *   This is ""the letter just before **T**"".
    *   Looking at our alphabet sequence (..., P, R, S, T, U, ...), the letter just before T is **S**.

5.  **""the letter which comes between the letter just before the letter just below B and the letter just before the letter just above Y""**:
    *   This is ""the letter which comes between **F** and **S**"".
    *   The phrase ""comes between"" in this context refers to the sequence of letters used to fill the grid (A, B, C, ..., Z excluding Q). We need to find the letter that is sequentially in the middle of F and S in this list.
    *   Let's list the letters from F to S (inclusive) in our sequence: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S.
    *   There are 13 letters in this list. The middle letter is the 7th letter (since (13+1)/2 = 7).
    *   Counting through the list: F(1), G(2), H(3), I(4), J(5), K(6), L(7), M(8), N(9), O(10), P(11), R(12), S(13).
    *   The 7th letter is **L**.
    *   Alternatively, we could consider the spatial ""between"" in the grid. F is at [2,1] and S is at [4,3]. The cell exactly in the middle of these coordinates is ([2+4]/2, [1+3]/2) = (3, 2). The letter at [3,2] is L. Both interpretations lead to L.

6.  **""which letter comes just above the letter which comes between F and S""**:
    *   This is ""which letter comes just above **L**"".
    *   In our grid, L is in the third row, second column.
    *   The letter just above L is in the second row, second column.
    *   Looking at the grid, the letter at Row 2, Column 2 is **G**.

So, the final answer is G.

If the first boy is at location 4, then there could only be two boys in the first row.  The first boy must be located before position 4, therefore a girl must occupy: 28 (clue 7).  The second boy can not be at position 4 (clue 6).  The earliest position that the third boy could occupy is position 5.  Therefore, a girl must occupy: 4.
B) If boys are at positions 1 (a corner) and 25 (clue 7), then a boy would have to be at either position 7 or 22 (clue 9).

199,"Question: I woke up late that morning to welcome a bright sunny day after a long and hectic week. It was a holiday and I was determined to spend the day playing cards with my friend Tweeto. Tweeto's favorite card game was the Romankachi card game.
The rules of the game are as follows :-
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
We started off with 5 cards each and I served in the first round.
At the end of three rounds if I had exactly 4 cards then which of the following statements must be true:-
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement is true. One or more statements may be true.
 Hint: First, think about what possible results could lead to you having 4 cards?","First, think about what possible results could lead to you having 4 cards?","Statements A and C must be true.
The rules of the Romankachi card game are given below.
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.

3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.

5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
The given statements are
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
Since we started the card game with 5 cards each and I started of the first round, at the end of three rounds I can have 4 cards due to any one of the following two results.
First Result :
I served in the first round and won. Hence I served in the second round but lost. Tweeto served in the third round and again I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.
The number of cards with me and Tweeto is tabulated below.

Hence it is clear from both the results that statements A and C must be true for me to end up with 4 cards at the end of three rounds.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.

1.  **Understand the Rules:**
    *   Starting cards: I have 5, Tweeto has 5.
    *   Round 1 server: I serve.
    *   Card changes based on server, receiver, win/loss:
        *   Server wins: +2 cards for server, -2 for receiver.
        *   Server loses: -1 card for server, +1 for receiver.
        *   Receiver wins: +1 card for receiver, -1 for server.
        *   Receiver loses: -2 cards for receiver, +2 for server.
    *   The winner of a round serves the next round.
    *   The game stops if a player loses all cards (card count becomes $\le 0$ at the end of a round). However, the problem states the game continued for three full rounds, implying no one ran out of cards in rounds 1 or 2.

2.  **Track Card Counts Through Rounds:**
    Let $M_k$ and $T_k$ be my and Tweeto's card counts after round $k$. $M_0=5, T_0=5$.
    There are three rounds. We need to find the sequences of wins that result in $M_3=4$.

    *   **Round 1:** I serve ($S_1 = I$, $R_1 = T$).
        *   Case 1: I win Round 1 ($W_1 = I$).

200,"Question: Phil Fegit was sitting in his bedroom watching the torrential rain pour down on his home town of MADADIA.  The water had caused floods throughout the town and water over six feet deep had forced people to abandon the downstairs of their homes and they had to retreat to the upstairs rooms. The yearly Kebab harvest had been washed away as the downpour had continued unabated for a full month.
Just at that moment Phil's wife, Norma, walked into the bedroom and he commented upon the rain. She replied that she could really care less. No matter how much Phil tried to stress the importance of the rain falling in Madadia, she refused to take it seriously.
How come?
 Hint: nan",,"Phil was watching a news report about his home town on TV, he had recently moved away from the area and it was sunny where he was.
His wife wasn't from Madadia, hence she didn't care what happened there.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, I will break down the reasoning step by step based on the provided text and the hint.

1.  **Analyze the Situation:** The story sets a dramatic scene: torrential rain, severe flooding (over six feet deep), people retreating upstairs, and even an absurd detail about a ""Kebab harvest"" being washed away. Phil is very concerned about this extreme weather in his hometown of MADADIA.

2.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question is ""How come?"" Phil's wife, Norma, doesn't care about the rain and floods in Madadia, despite their severity.

3.  **Examine Norma's Reaction:** Norma explicitly states she ""could really care less"" and ""refused to take it seriously"" about the rain in Madadia. This is the central mystery to be explained.

4.  **Examine the Hint:** The hint provided is ""nan"".

5.  **Look for Clues in the Text and Hint:**
    *   The town name is MADADIA. Let's look at it closely: M-A-D-A-D-I-A. If you read it backward: A-I-D-A-D-A-M. Wait, let me double-check. M-A-D-A-D-I-A -> A-I-D-A-D-A-M. Ah, upon closer inspection, the spelling in the text is M A D A D I A. Reading it backward is A I D A D A M. My mistake. Let me check the spelling again from the user prompt: ""MADADIA"". M-A-D-A-D-I-A. Forwards: MADADIA. Backwards: AIDADAM. Okay, MADADIA is *not* a palindrome as written.
    *   Let's re-evaluate the name and hint. Perhaps I misread the hint or the name? No, the text says ""MADADIA"" and the hint is ""nan"".
    *   Let's look at the hint ""nan"". Is ""nan"" a word? Yes, it can be a term for grandmother in some dialects. Is it an acronym? Maybe. Does it relate to rain or not caring? Not obviously.
    *   Let's check if ""nan"" is a palindrome: N-A-N reads N-A-N forwards and backwards. Yes, ""nan"" *is* a palindrome.

6.  **Connect the Hint ""nan"" to the Story:** The hint is a palindrome. The question is about why Norma doesn't care about the rain in MADADIA. Is there a connection between the hint being a palindrome and Norma's attitude?

7.  **Consider Concepts Related to Palindromes:** Palindromes are words or phrases that read the same forwards and backwards. This relates to symmetry, reversal, or things being the same from different perspectives.

8.  **Apply the Palindrome Concept to the Story:**
    *   The hint is a palindrome (""nan"").
    *   Norma doesn't care about a physical event (rain/flood).
    *   What kind of entity wouldn't be affected by rain and floods, and could be linked to the concept of reversal or symmetry?
    *   A *reflection* is an image that is reversed (left-to-right). Reflections are not physically present and are not affected by physical phenomena like rain.

9.  **Evaluate the ""Reflection"" Hypothesis:** If Norma is a reflection, it perfectly explains why she wouldn't care about the rain or floods. Rain doesn't make a reflection wet, and floods don't reach it.

10. **Connect the ""Reflection"" Hypothesis to the Hint ""nan"":** The hint ""nan"" is a palindrome. Palindromes are related to reversal and symmetry, just as reflections are. The hint, being a palindrome, subtly points towards the concept of reflection, which explains Norma's situation. The name MADADIA might have seemed like a potential palindrome initially, perhaps intended to strengthen this theme, but even if it isn't a perfect palindrome, the hint ""nan"" alone is sufficient to introduce the concept.

11. **Synthesize the Reasoning:** The riddle describes severe rain and flooding in a town and a woman who is completely indifferent. The hint is the word ""nan"", which is a palindrome. Palindromes are structurally related to reversal, which is a key characteristic of a reflection. A reflection is not a physical entity and is therefore unaffected by physical events like rain and floods. Norma's complete lack of concern strongly suggests she is not a physical person experiencing the rain. The hint ""nan"", through its palindromic nature, points towards the concept of a reflection. Therefore, Norma does not care about the rain because she is a reflection.

The final answer is that Norma is a reflection.

Final answer: Norma is a reflection.",True,0,0,0

 Hint: Assume each statement, in turn, to be true.  Then examine the truth or otherwise of the others.
Or check the statements in the light of each of the six possibilities.","Assume each statement, in turn, to be true.  Then examine the truth or otherwise of the others.
Or check the statements in the light of each of the six possibilities.","It was a tax increase.
Solution:
Remember that only one statement can be true.
If (1) is true then either (2) or (3) will be true as well.  So (1) is a lie.
If (3) is true, either (1) or (2) would be also true.  So (3) is a lie.
If (2) is true, it must be either wages or taxes going up or (1) would be true.  It cannot be wages, making (3) true, so taxes are increasing.
There are other ways of deducing this gloomy news.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let the three possible subjects of the announcement be Wages (W), Subsidies (S), or Tax levels (T). Let the two possible directions of change be Increase (U) or Decrease (D). There are $3 \times 2 = 6$ possible announcements:
1.  Wages Up (WU)
2.  Wages Down (WD)
3.  Subsidies Up (SU)
4.  Subsidies Down (SD)
5.  Tax levels Up (TU)
6.  Tax levels Down (TD)

The Minister made three statements, which we label $S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_3$:
$S_1$: ""Well, I can tell you that it's about subsidies.""
$S_2$: ""Nothing is going down.""
$S_3$: ""Either subsidies are going down or there will be a wage increase.""

It is stated that the Minister told the truth exactly once in every three statements. This means that out of $S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_3$, exactly one is true and the other two are false.

Let's determine the truth condition for each statement based on the 6 possible announcements:
-   $S_1$ is true if the announcement is about subsidies (SU or SD). $S_1$ is false otherwise (WU, WD, TU, TD).
-   $S_2$ is true if nothing is going down. This means the change is an Increase (U) for any subject. So $S_2$ is true if the announcement is WU, SU, or TU. $S_2$ is false otherwise (WD, SD, TD).
-   $S_3$ is a disjunction: ""subsidies are going down"" (SD) OR ""there will be a wage increase"" (WU). $S_3$ is true if the announcement is SD or WU. $S_3$ is false otherwise (WD, SU, TU, TD).

Now, let's evaluate the truth value of each statement for each of the 6 possible announcements. We denote the truth value as T (True) or F (False).

| Announcement | $S_1$: About Subsidies (SU or SD) | $S_2$: Nothing Down (WU or SU or TU) | $S_3$: SD or WU | Truth values ($S_1, S_2, S_3$) | Number of True Statements |

| SD           | T                                 | F                                | T              | (T, F, T)                   | 2                         |
| TU           | F                                 | T                                | F              | (F, T, F)                   | 1                         |
| TD           | F                                 | F                                | F              | (F, F, F)                   | 0                         |

The problem states that exactly one of the three statements is true. Looking at the ""Number of True Statements"" column, we see that only one announcement possibility results in exactly one true statement: Tax levels Up (TU).

Let's verify this result using the hint's first suggestion: Assume each statement, in turn, to be true (meaning only that statement is true). This corresponds to checking the three possible truth combinations that have exactly one True: (T, F, F), (F, T, F), and (F, F, T).

Case 1: Assume $S_1$ is true, and $S_2, S_3$ are false.
-   $S_1$ is true $\implies$ Announcement is SU or SD.
-   $S_2$ is false $\implies$ Announcement is WD, SD, or TD.
-   $S_3$ is false $\implies$ Announcement is WD, SU, TU, or TD.
For all three conditions to hold, the announcement must be in the intersection of {SU, SD}, {WD, SD, TD}, and {WD, SU, TU, TD}. The intersection is {SD}.
If the announcement is SD, the truth values are (T, F, T), as shown in the table. This contradicts the assumption of (T, F, F). So, this case is not possible.

Case 2: Assume $S_2$ is true, and $S_1, S_3$ are false.
-   $S_1$ is false $\implies$ Announcement is WU, WD, TU, or TD.
-   $S_2$ is true $\implies$ Announcement is WU, SU, or TU.
-   $S_3$ is false $\implies$ Announcement is WD, SU, TU, or TD.
For all three conditions to hold, the announcement must be in the intersection of {WU, WD, TU, TD}, {WU, SU, TU}, and {WD, SU, TU, TD}. The intersection is {TU}.
If the announcement is TU, the truth values are (F, T, F), as shown in the table. This matches the assumption of (F, T, F). So, this case is possible and identifies the announcement as TU.

Case 3: Assume $S_3$ is true, and $S_1, S_2$ are false.
-   $S_1$ is false $\implies$ Announcement is WU, WD, TU, or TD.
-   $S_2$ is false $\implies$ Announcement is WD, SD, or TD.
-   $S_3$ is true $\implies$ Announcement is SD or WU.
For all three conditions to hold, the announcement must be in the intersection of {WU, WD, TU, TD}, {WD, SD, TD}, and {SD, WU}. The intersection is empty.
There is no announcement that satisfies all three conditions simultaneously. So, this case is not possible.

The only possibility consistent with the Minister telling the truth exactly once is that $S_2$ is true and $S_1, S_3$ are false, which means the announcement must be Tax levels Up (TU).

The deduction is unique and consistent. The truth that can be deduced is the specific announcement made by the Minister.

The final answer is $\boxed{Tax levels are going up}$.",True,1,1,0

O Q L H R
I J F E Q
--------------
F G F C ?
 Hint: Think mathematically.",Think mathematically.,"The missing letter is A.
Number the letters in order eg: A=1 B=2 C=3 etc.. then subtract the middle from the top, to give the bottom number. Assign that number to the appropriate letter to give the answer.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step, using the hint to guide us.

1.  **Understand the Structure:** We have two rows of letters above a line and one row below. This suggests some relationship or operation between the top two rows produces the bottom row.

    Row 1: O Q L H R
    Row 2: I J F E Q
    ----------------
    Row 3: F G F C ?

2.  **Apply the Hint: ""Think mathematically.""** When dealing with letters mathematically, the most common approach is to assign them numerical values based on their position in the alphabet. Let's use the standard A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26 system.

3.  **Convert Letters to Numbers:**
    *   Row 1:
        O = 15
        Q = 17
        L = 12
        H = 8
        R = 18
        Numerical Row 1: 15, 17, 12, 8, 18

    *   Row 2:
        I = 9
        J = 10
        F = 6
        E = 5
        Q = 17
        Numerical Row 2: 9, 10, 6, 5, 17

    *   Row 3 (partially known):
        F = 6
        G = 7
        F = 6
        C = 3
        ? = ?
        Numerical Row 3: 6, 7, 6, 3, ?

4.  **Look for a Mathematical Relationship Column by Column:** Now let's examine the numerical values in each column to see how the numbers in Row 1 and Row 2 might produce the number in Row 3.

    *   **Column 1:**
        Row 1: 15
        Row 2: 9
        Row 3: 6
        Relationship? 15 - 9 = 6. Subtraction seems like a possibility.

    *   **Column 2:**
        Row 1: 17
        Row 2: 10
        Row 3: 7
        Let's test the subtraction idea: 17 - 10 = 7. This fits!

    *   **Column 3:**
        Row 1: 12
        Row 2: 6
        Row 3: 6
        Let's test subtraction again: 12 - 6 = 6. This also fits!

    *   **Column 4:**
        Row 1: 8
        Row 2: 5
        Row 3: 3
        Testing subtraction: 8 - 5 = 3. This fits as well!

5.  **Identify the Pattern:** The consistent pattern across the first four columns is that the numerical value of the letter in Row 1 minus the numerical value of the letter in Row 2 equals the numerical value of the letter in Row 3.

6.  **Apply the Pattern to the Missing Column (Column 5):**
    *   Row 1 value: 18 (R)
    *   Row 2 value: 17 (Q)
    *   Row 3 value: ?

    Using the pattern: Row 3 value = Row 1 value - Row 2 value
    Row 3 value = 18 - 17 = 1

7.  **Convert the Resulting Number Back to a Letter:** The numerical value for the missing letter is 1.
    The letter corresponding to the value 1 is A.

Therefore, the missing letter is A.

Cyril was born over 3000 years before Ben, who in turn was born 619 years before Adam.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step, following the logic and the hint.

1.  **Analyze the Given Information:**
    *   Adam, Ben, and Cyril were born in consecutive years (1309, 1310, 1311). This means they were roughly contemporaries.
    *   They were born on the ""same road"" in old Jerusalem. This implies physical proximity or shared space.
    *   They lived their ""whole life there"" (in old Jerusalem) and lived ""over 60"". This means they had a significant period of overlap in their lives (from roughly 1311/1312 until at least the 1370s or later, all within Jerusalem).
    *   They had a ""full active life"". This suggests they weren't shut-ins; they were presumably moving around the area where they lived and interacting with their communities.
    *   **Crucially:** They ""never crossed paths with each other"".

2.  **Identify the Core Problem:** How is it possible for three people, born around the same time, living on the same road in a relatively confined historical city for over 60 years with active lives, to *never* meet? This seems highly improbable under normal circumstances where people share space.

3.  **Consider the Hint:** The hint is ""Calendar differences?"". What does this suggest?
    *   Jerusalem around 1300 was a diverse city. It was significant to three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
    *   Each of these religions had (and still has) its own distinct calendar system:
        *   Judaism: The Hebrew calendar.
        *   Christianity: Primarily the Julian calendar in that era (the Gregorian calendar was not introduced until much later).
        *   Islam: The Islamic (Hijri) calendar.
    *   The hint strongly implies that the reason they didn't meet is related to these different calendars.

4.  **Connect the Hint to the Problem:** How could using different calendars prevent people from meeting physically? The calendar itself doesn't create a physical barrier. However, the different calendars are markers of different religious and cultural communities. In historical cities like Jerusalem, these different communities often lived in distinct, separate quarters.

5.  **Formulate the Explanation:**
    *   Assume that Adam, Ben, and Cyril represent individuals from the three major religious communities present in Jerusalem at that time: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim.
    *   These communities used different calendars, as suggested by the hint.
    *   In historical Jerusalem, these communities did not live mixed together randomly. Instead, they typically inhabited distinct, often walled or clearly defined, quarters of the city (the Jewish Quarter, Christian Quarter, Muslim Quarter, Armenian Quarter, etc.).
    *   Therefore, even if the ""same road"" was a significant thoroughfare that perhaps bordered or ran through parts of multiple quarters, or if ""same road"" refers to their general vicinity, the people of each community primarily lived, worked, socialized, and conducted their daily lives *within their own quarter*.
    *   Interaction *between* quarters, especially on a personal level for regular people going about their daily routines over 60+ years, might have been minimal or non-existent depending on the specific historical period and social strictures. While there might have been some limited interaction for trade or specific purposes, the vast majority of their lives would have been spent among members of their own community, within their own quarter.
    *   Thus, Adam lived his active life within the Jewish Quarter, Ben within the Christian Quarter, and Cyril within the Muslim Quarter (or other permutations of this). They were born in consecutive years and lived for a long time, but their lives, though spatially near in the city as a whole, were lived out in effectively separate social and physical environments due to the segregation of communities. The ""calendar differences"" serve as a clue pointing to these distinct communal identities and the resulting physical and social separation.

6.  **Synthesize the Reasoning:** The fact that they never met, despite living on the ""same road"" in the same city for over 60 years, is explained by the social structure of Old Jerusalem. The hint about ""calendar differences"" points to their differing religious identities (Jewish, Christian, Muslim), and these communities lived in strictly segregated quarters. Although the road might have been geographically shared or nearby in a general sense, their active lives were confined within their respective communal areas, preventing their paths from ever crossing over six decades.

Final answer: The reason Adam, Ben, and Cyril never crossed paths is related to the hint about calendar differences. In old Jerusalem around the 14th century, different religious communities (Jewish, Christian, and Muslim) used different calendars (Hebrew, Julian, and Hijri, respectively). These communities typically lived in distinct, segregated quarters of the city. Therefore, Adam, Ben, and Cyril likely belonged to different religious communities and lived their entire active lives confined primarily within their respective quarters. Even if the ""same road"" bordered or ran through parts of these different quarters, their daily lives, social interactions, and activities would have kept them separate within their own communal areas, preventing them from ever physically meeting each other over their many decades of life.",True,0,0,0

Then I used statements 4 and 8 to put Donna and Judy in the younger generation, as sisters.  Statement 7 puts Ben in the younger generation.  If Christopher is also in the younger generation, then Ben must be Donna and Judy's brother and either Ben or Donna says statement 2.

214,"Question: John, Paul, George, and Ringo were playing a card game. Each player had three cards, one of the four suits was the ""high suit."" When each player played one card, this was a ""trick."" The first card played in a trick was the ""leading suit."" Here are the cards in each man's hand:
John: club, heart, diamond
Paul: club, spade, spade
George: club, heart, heart
Ringo: spade, diamond, diamond
If possible, each player had to play the leading suit for each trick. If they couldn't do that, they had to play the high suit. And if they couldn't do that, they could play any card. A player who won a trick had to lead the next trick. Each of the three tricks consisted of the leading card, exactly one other card of the same suit, exactly one card of the high suit which won its player the trick, and exactly one other card. Which suit was the high suit?
 Hint: This makes the puzzle too easy. Please stop reading if you don't want it to be too easy.
Lucy in the sky with...","This makes the puzzle too easy. Please stop reading if you don't want it to be too easy.
Lucy in the sky with...","The high suit is diamonds.
The first trick obviously required two cards of the leading suit, and since everyone had to play the leading suit if possible, there had to be two people who had at least one card of the first leading suit. But since John, Paul, and George each had a club, the first leading suit could not have been a club.
If the first leading suit was a heart, then the high suit had to be a card of which only one of Paul and Ringo had. This means it could only have been a club or a diamond. Similarly, if the first leading suit was a spade, the high suit could only have been a diamond, and if the leading suit was a diamond, the high suit could only have been a heart or a spade.
If the first leading suit was a heart, the second trick was led by either Paul or Ringo, and the leading suit had to be a spade. If the first leading suit was a spade, the second trick was led by John, and the leading suit could have been a club or a heart. If the first leading suit was a diamond, the second trick was led by either Paul or George, and the leading suit was a club. Now we can deduce the six possible leading suits and high suits for the whole game:
1. heart, heart, club
spade, spade, club
diamond, diamond, club
2. heart, heart, diamond
spade, spade, diamond
club, club, diamond
3. spade, spade, diamond
club, club, diamond

4. spade, spade, diamond
heart, heart, diamond
club, club, diamond
5. diamond, diamond, heart
club, club, heart
spade, spade, heart
6. diamond, diamond, spade
club, club, spade
heart, heart, spade
Game 1 cannot be possible because Paul would have led the spade and John and George would both have played a club, making two cards of the high suit.

Assuming the acquaintance relationship is symmetric (i.e., if you are acquainted with someone, that person is also acquainted with you), then how many people did your spouse know prior to the party? How many people did you know?
 Hint: Start with the assumption that everybody knows their own spouses -- which means that everybody there knew at least one person.",Start with the assumption that everybody knows their own spouses -- which means that everybody there knew at least one person.,"Start with the assumption that everybody knows their own spouses -- which means that everybody there knew at least one person.

Number the people (besides yourself) according to how many people they know, so that person 1 is the one who knows one person, person 2 is the one who knows two people, etc.
Now pair up people with their spouses. If person 9 knows everybody else, s/he must be the only person who knows person 1, because person 1 only knows one person. So they must be married. Person 8 knows everybody except for person 1. Person 2 therefore knows person 8 and person 9. Person 9 is married to person 1, so person 2's spouse must be person 8. Person 7 knows everybody except for persons 1 and 2. Person 3 therefore knows persons 7, 8, and 9. Persons 8 and 9 are married to persons 2 and 1 respectively, so person 3's spouse must be person 7. Person 6 knows everybody except for persons 1, 2, and 3. Person 4 therefore knows persons 6, 7, 8, and 9.

218,"Question: Nick has always wanted one, so he goes out and buys a brand new one for £5000.  Unfortunately the next day he breaks it, so he goes out again and gets another brand new one. This time however, it only costs him £25. The next day someone offers to buy it off of him for £6000.
What is it ?
 Hint: nan",,A personalised number plate.,GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break down this riddle step by step using the hint provided.

1.  **Analyze the Riddle:** The riddle describes an item that is bought for £5000, broken the next day, bought *brand new* again for £25, and then receives a £6000 offer the day after that. This is a highly unusual sequence of prices for a standard physical object. A brand new item of the same type wouldn't typically drop from £5000 to £25 overnight, nor would its value suddenly jump to £6000. This suggests the ""item"" is not a typical consumer product with a stable market price. It's likely something abstract, a concept, a sound, or a performance.

2.  **Consider the Unusual Pricing:** The sequence is High Value (£5000) -> Broken -> Very Low Value (£25) -> High Value (£6000 Offer). This pattern is key. It's something expensive to *initialise* or *acquire* in a specific way, cheap to *replicate* or *restart*, and potentially very valuable *if successful*.

3.  **Examine the Hint:** The hint is ""nan"". This sounds like ""na"".

4.  **Connect the Hint to the Riddle:** How does ""nan"" or ""na"" relate to something that fits the strange pricing pattern?
    *   ""Na-na-na"" is a common vocalisation used in music, often as a placeholder lyric or a simple melody.
    *   The hint ""nan"" strongly suggests something related to sound or music.

5.  **Hypothesize based on Hint and Pattern:** If the item is related to sound or music (suggested by ""nan""), does it fit the price pattern? Let's consider ""a song"" or ""a musical performance"".
    *   **Initial Purchase (£5000):** This could represent the significant cost of composing, recording, producing, or initially performing a song at a high level (e.g., studio time, hiring musicians, initial rights acquisition, a major concert performance).
    *   **Broken the Next Day:** The song/performance is flawed, the recording is corrupted, the performance goes wrong, it fails to resonate, etc. It's essentially unusable or unsuccessful in its initial form.
    *   **Second Purchase (£25):** Getting ""another brand new one"" for £25. This could represent buying a copy of the song cheaply (like a digital download or streaming subscription part), or simply singing the song again oneself (which costs next to nothing, maybe £25 for a cheap microphone or just vocal effort). It's cheap to reproduce or redo the core sound.
    *   **£6000 Offer:** The song, now reproduced or performed successfully, becomes popular, hits the charts, gets licensed, or is highly valued by someone. Its perceived value skyrockets.

6.  **Evaluate the Fit:** The concept of a song perfectly fits the description:
    *   It's something Nick would ""always want"".
    *   It can be ""bought"" (created, recorded, acquired rights to).
    *   It can be ""broken"" (a bad recording, a failed performance, a corrupted file).
    *   It can be acquired ""brand new"" again cheaply (buy a copy, sing it again).
    *   Its value can vary wildly from initial high cost to low reproduction cost, and then potentially to very high value if successful.
    *   The hint ""nan"" relates directly to sounds associated with singing and music (""na-na-na"").

7.  **Conclusion:** Based on the unusual pricing structure pointing away from a physical object, the ability for the item to be ""broken"" and cheaply replaced, and the hint ""nan"" suggesting sound or music, the most logical answer is a song.

The final answer is $\boxed{A song}$.",True,0,0,0

221,"Question: When world-famous Madadian philosopher Torks G'Arbage was imprisoned for being a disturbing influence and relieving himself in a public place, he was held in high esteem by his guards, many of whom had followed Torks' teachings. All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would facilitate his escape. One evening, the guard who was on duty accidentally on purpose left the cell door open so that Torks G'Arbage could leave for distant parts.
Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape, as it was his philosophy that if you accept society's rules, you must also accept its punishments. However, the open door was considered by the Madadian authorities to be a serious matter. It was not clear which guard was on that evening. When questioned, the four guards made the following statements in their defence:
Norris McDim:
A) I did not leave the door open.
B) Morris was the one who did it.
Nobby Shifty:
A) I was not the one who was on duty that evening.
B) Norris was on duty.

The one truth given is that all 4 guards hoped that Torks G'Arbage would escape, so statement B from Morris is a truth.
There are only 3 truthful statements.
If Norris had done it, then Nobby made 2 truthful statements and Robby's statement A would be true; making a total of 4 truths, so it can't be Norris.
If Nobby had done it, statement A from Norris would be true, both of Morris's statements would be true, and Robby's statement A would be true; again a total of 4, so it can't be Nobby.
If Morris had left the cell open, both of Norris's statements would be true, as would Nobby's statement A, Morris's statement B, and Robby's statement A; a total of 5 truths.
In Robby's case, in detail:

B False
Nobby A True
B False
Morris A False
B True
Dave A False
B False (why did he bother to leave the
cell door open?)",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the reasoning process to solve the problem:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal is to identify the guard who was on duty and left the cell door open (the guilty guard).
2.  **Analyze the Conditions:**
    *   There are four guards: Norris McDim (N), Nobby Shifty (S), Morris the Daft (M), and Robby O'Mental (R).
    *   Each guard made two statements, for a total of 8 statements.
    *   Exactly one guard was on duty and left the door open. This guard is the guilty one.
    *   In total, exactly 3 statements are true, and 5 statements are false.
3.  **List the Statements and Their Meaning:** Let P(X) represent the proposition ""Guard X was on duty and left the door open"" (i.e., X is the guilty guard).
    *   Norris McDim:
        *   NA: ""I did not leave the door open."" -> This means Norris is not guilty. So, NA is True if NOT P(N), and False if P(N).
        *   NB: ""Morris was the one who did it."" -> This means Morris is guilty. So, NB is True if P(M), and False if NOT P(M).
    *   Nobby Shifty:
        *   SA: ""I was not the one who was on duty that evening."" -> This means Nobby is not guilty. So, SA is True if NOT P(S), and False if P(S).
        *   SB: ""Norris was on duty."" -> This means Norris is guilty. So, SB is True if P(N), and False if NOT P(N).
    *   Morris the Daft:
        *   MA: ""Nobby was the one on duty that evening."" -> This means Nobby is guilty. So, MA is True if P(S), and False if NOT P(S).
        *   MB: ""I hoped Torks G'Arbage would escape."" -> The problem states, ""All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would facilitate his escape."" This makes MB always True.
    *   Robby O'Mental:
        *   RA: ""I did not leave the door open."" -> This means Robby is not guilty. So, RA is True if NOT P(R), and False if P(R).
        *   RB: ""I was not surprised that Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape."" -> Torks did not escape due to his philosophy. Whether Robby was surprised or not is his personal state, not directly tied to who is guilty. Its truth value is not fixed by the guilt assignment initially, but it *must* be consistent with the total count of true/false statements.

4.  **Utilize the Total True/False Count:** We know there are 3 True and 5 False statements out of 8 total. We also know MB is always True.
    *   So, from the remaining 7 statements (NA, NB, SA, SB, MA, RA, RB), there must be 3 - 1 = 2 True statements.
    *   And there must be 5 - 0 = 5 False statements from these 7.

5.  **Apply the Hint: Test Each Guard as Guilty:** We will assume each guard is the one who is guilty (P(X) is True for one X, and False for others) and check if the conditions (3 True, 5 False total statements) are met.

    *   **Case 1: Assume Norris (N) is Guilty.**
        *   P(N)=T, P(S)=F, P(M)=F, P(R)=F.
        *   Evaluate the truth values of the statements based on this:
            *   NA: NOT P(N) -> False
            *   NB: P(M) -> False
            *   SA: NOT P(S) -> True
            *   SB: P(N) -> True

        *   Number of True statements fixed so far: SA, SB, MB, RA (4 statements).

Her son lives with me, my 3 other sisters, my mom, and step dad.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step using the information provided and the hint.

1.  **Identify the members of the immediate family:** The immediate family living in the house consists of 7 people.
    *   We know the narrator is one person. (1)
    *   The narrator has 4 sisters. These 4 sisters also live in the house as part of the immediate family. (4)
    *   The total so far is 1 (narrator) + 4 (sisters) = 5 people.
    *   The hint says, ""My nephew lives with me"". So the nephew is another person living in the house. (1)
    *   The total so far is 5 + 1 = 6 people.
    *   Since the immediate family living in the house consists of 7 people, there is one more person in the house. (1)
    *   Who is the 7th person? Given the context of ""dads"" and sisters, the remaining person is most likely the mother.

2.  **List the 7 people in the house:**
    *   The narrator
    *   The narrator's mother
    *   The narrator's 4 sisters
    *   The narrator's nephew (who is the child of one of the sisters)

3.  **Address the ""3 dads"" and ""2 dads"" situation:** The puzzle lies in how the narrator can have 3 dads, while two of the sisters only have 2 dads, within this family structure. This points to a blended family situation involving multiple marriages.

4.  **Construct a plausible family history:**
    *   Let's assume the ""dads"" refer to the biological fathers and stepfathers from the mother's marriages who are relevant father figures in the children's lives.
    *   For the narrator to have 3 dads, their mother must have been married multiple times. Let's say the mother has been married three times to three different men: Dad 1, Dad 2, and Dad 3.
    *   If the narrator was born during the mother's first marriage (to Dad 1), and the mother later married Dad 2 and Dad 3, then the narrator would consider Dad 1 (biological father), Dad 2 (stepfather), and Dad 3 (stepfather) as their three dads.

5.  **Explain why two sisters have only 2 dads:** This means two of the sisters were born during a later marriage, and thus didn't have the same sequence of stepfathers as the narrator.
    *   Let's assume the mother married Dad 1 first, had the narrator and some sisters with him.
    *   Then she married Dad 2 and had more children (sisters).
    *   Then she married Dad 3.
    *   Consider the children born during the second marriage (to Dad 2). Their biological father is Dad 2. Their mother's first husband (Dad 1) is not typically considered a stepfather unless he maintains a parental role, which is less common than a subsequent husband becoming a stepfather. Their mother's third husband (Dad 3) *would* be their stepfather.
    *   So, children from the second marriage (Mother + Dad 2) would have Dad 2 (bio) and Dad 3 (step) as their dads. This gives them 2 dads.
    *   Let's assign the sisters:
        *   Sisters born from the first marriage (Mother + Dad 1): They have Dad 1 (bio), Dad 2 (step), Dad 3 (step) = 3 dads. Let's say there are two such sisters, plus the narrator.
        *   Sisters born from the second marriage (Mother + Dad 2): They have Dad 2 (bio), Dad 3 (step) = 2 dads. Let's say there are two such sisters.

6.  **Verify the numbers and relationships:**
    *   The household has 7 people: Mother, Narrator, 4 Sisters, Nephew.
    *   The 4 sisters consist of: 2 sisters from Mother's first marriage (who have 3 dads) and 2 sisters from Mother's second marriage (who have 2 dads). This adds up to 4 sisters, and fits the condition that ""two of my sisters only have 2 dads"".
    *   The narrator is a child of the first marriage, and thus has 3 dads (Dad 1, Dad 2, Dad 3). This fits the condition ""I have 3 dads"".
    *   The nephew lives in the house; he is the child of one of the sisters (presumably one of the older sisters from the first marriage, or possibly the second marriage, it doesn't affect the dad count for the narrator/sisters).
    *   The narrator is the middle child among 5 siblings (Narrator + 4 sisters). This is possible based on the birth order across the marriages.

7.  **Formulate the answer:** Combine these points into a coherent explanation. The key is the blended family structure where the mother's children from different marriages have different sets of biological and stepfathers.

This explanation satisfies all the conditions: the number of people in the household, the number of sisters, the number of dads the narrator has, the number of dads two of the sisters have, and the presence of the nephew, all within a logical family structure.

Final Answer: The seven people living in the house are the narrator, the narrator's mother, the narrator's four sisters, and the narrator's nephew. This is possible because the narrator's mother has been married three times. The narrator and two of the sisters are children from the mother's first marriage, so they have their biological father (the first husband) and two stepfathers (the second and third husbands), totaling 3 dads. The other two sisters are children from the mother's second marriage. They have their biological father (the second husband) and one stepfather (the third husband), but the mother's first husband was married to her before they were born and is not their father or stepfather, giving them only 2 dads. The nephew is the child of one of the sisters.",True,0,0,0

We now have three possible scenarios:
1. Al is the younger boxer and Ben is the older boxer.
2. Ben is the older boxer and Carl is the younger boxer.
3. Al is the older boxer and Carl is the younger boxer.
If scenario 1 is true, fact 1 tells us that Ben is shorter than Al.

2. Ben is the older, shorter boxer, and Carl is the younger, taller boxer.
3. Al is the older, shorter boxer, and Carl is the younger, taller boxer.
Scenario 2 cannot be possible because it contradicts fact 2 by making the younger of Ben and Carl the taller boxer.

A position is losing if every possible move from it leads to a winning position for the other player. Conversely, a position is winning if there is at least one move to a losing position for the other player. The player who is about to move from a losing position will lose if the other player plays optimally. The player who is about to move from a winning position can win if they play optimally.

The game ends when a player says 50. The player who says 50 wins. Let's determine the losing positions by working backwards from 50.

Let $N=50$ be the target number. The allowed move is to add a number from 1 to 10 to the current number.
A player wins if they can say 50.
So, if the current number is $k$, and a player can say 50, then $k$ is a winning position for the player whose turn it is. This happens if $k+1 \le 50 \le k+10$, which means $40 \le k \le 49$.

231,"Question: There is a famous diamond displayed in a room that measures 15 meters by 15 meters by 15 meters. The room is made entirely of concrete blocks and the floor is covered with a thick carpet. The only thing in the room is the diamond that is housed under a glass cube. The glass cube stands on a one-meter pedestal in the centre of the room. Alarm wires spaced eight centimetres apart and running parallel to each other lie under the carpet. The alarm will trigger if more than four kilograms of pressure is applied to any individual wire. Will Carlo who weighs 74 kilograms was able to steal the famous diamond using the following equipment: a five meter 2 x 4 board, four leather straps (each two meters long and five cm wide), a hammer, and a saw. How could he do it without triggering the alarm?
 Hint: How can he spread out his weight?",How can he spread out his weight?,"Will Carlo stole the diamond in the following manner: First, he cut five meter 2 x 4 boards in half. Then using the available straps, he fastened the two boards to his feet like skies. With the boards strapped to his feet, his weight was displacing enough so that he did not exceed the wire's weight tolerance and triggers the alarm. Carlo then slowly and carefully walked to the centre of the room, smashed the glass cube with the hammer, took the diamond and returned the same way he came in.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step using the hint provided.

1.  **Understand the Goal:** Carlo needs to reach the diamond in the center of the room and retrieve it without triggering the alarm system.

2.  **Understand the Constraint:** The alarm triggers if more than 4 kilograms of pressure is applied to any *individual* wire. Carlo weighs 74 kilograms. Simply walking on the carpet will almost certainly concentrate his weight onto a few wires, triggering the alarm. His weight (74 kg) is much higher than the threshold (4 kg).

3.  **Understand the Hint:** The hint ""How can he spread out his weight?"" is crucial. This tells us the solution involves distributing Carlo's 74 kg weight over a larger area of the carpet, thus engaging more wires simultaneously, so that the pressure on *each* wire is 4 kg or less.

4.  **Evaluate the Available Equipment:**
    *   **5-meter 2x4 board:** This is a long, rigid object. It's the primary tool for distributing weight. If placed on the floor, it will spread the weight applied to it over its length and width.
    *   **Four leather straps (each two meters long and five cm wide):** These are flexible and can be used for tying or pulling.
    *   **Hammer:** Useful for striking things, potentially breaking the glass cube.
    *   **Saw:** Useful for cutting the board.

5.  **Develop the Weight Distribution Strategy:** The board is key. If Carlo places the board on the carpet and applies his weight to the board, the board will rest on many alarm wires beneath the carpet, distributing his weight.

6.  **Calculate the Required Distribution:** Carlo weighs 74 kg. Each wire can withstand 4 kg. To distribute 74 kg safely, he needs to engage enough wires so that 74 kg / (Number of wires) ≤ 4 kg/wire.
    *   Rearranging this: Number of wires ≥ 74 kg / 4 kg/wire = 18.5 wires.
    *   Since he must engage a whole number of wires, he needs to distribute his weight over at least 19 wires simultaneously.

7.  **Relate Distribution to the Board:** The alarm wires are 8 cm apart and run parallel. To engage multiple wires, the board must lie across them. Let's assume the wires run parallel to one pair of walls, so the board must be placed perpendicular to those walls to cross the wires.
    *   To span 19 wires, the board needs to cover the space of 18 gaps between wires.
    *   Distance covered = 18 gaps * 8 cm/gap = 144 cm = 1.44 meters.
    *   Any length of board greater than 1.44 meters will, if weight is evenly distributed along that length, span enough wires to potentially keep the pressure below 4 kg *if* Carlo's weight is spread effectively along that length.

8.  **Analyze Movement towards the Center:** The room is 15m x 15m. The diamond is in the exact center, which is 7.5 meters from any wall edge. The 5-meter board is not long enough to reach the center from the edge in a single step. Carlo needs a way to move across the room while maintaining weight distribution.

9.  **Refine the Strategy with Movement:** The best way to move across a distance greater than the board length, while always being supported by the board, is a ""leapfrogging"" technique. This requires at least two pieces of board. The saw is essential here.

10. **The Leapfrog Strategy:**
    *   Carlo uses the saw to cut the 5-meter board into two equal pieces, each 2.5 meters long. (Note: Other lengths could work, but 2.5m is convenient as 2 * 2.5m = 5m, covering half the distance to the center in two board lengths).
    *   Let's calculate the distribution for a 2.5-meter board: 2.5m = 250 cm.
    *   Number of wires spanned by a 2.5m board (approximately, assuming it starts on a wire) = 250 cm / 8 cm/wire ≈ 31.25 wires. So the board spans about 32 wires.
    *   If Carlo's 74 kg weight is distributed over this 2.5m length (e.g., by lying or crawling on the board), the pressure per wire would be approximately 74 kg / 32 wires ≈ 2.31 kg/wire.
    *   2.31 kg is less than the 4 kg threshold per wire. This confirms that distributing his weight over a 2.5m length of the board is safe.

11. **Step-by-Step Execution:**
    *   **Step 1: Preparation:** Carlo uses the saw to cut the 5-meter board into two pieces, each 2.5 meters long.
    *   **Step 2: Initial Placement:** Standing at the edge of the room (presumably where he enters), Carlo places one 2.5-meter board piece on the carpet, extending towards the center of the room.
    *   **Step 3: Move onto the First Board:** Carlo carefully gets onto the first board piece, lying down or crawling to distribute his 74 kg weight along its 2.5-meter length. His weight is now safely spread over approximately 32 wires (≈ 2.31 kg/wire), well below the alarm threshold.
    *   **Step 4: Place the Second Board:** While still on the first board, he places the second 2.5-meter board piece on the carpet immediately in front of the first board, extending further towards the center.
    *   **Step 5: Move onto the Second Board:** He carefully transfers himself from the first board piece to the second board piece, ensuring his weight is distributed along the second board.
    *   **Step 6: Leapfrog:** Once he is safely on the second board, he reaches back (while staying on the second board) and pulls the first board piece forward, placing it on the carpet immediately in front of the second board.
    *   **Step 7: Repeat:** Carlo repeats steps 5 and 6, leapfrogging forward with the two board pieces. Each ""leap"" moves him 2.5 meters further into the room, always keeping his weight distributed over a board resting on the carpet.
    *   **Step 8: Reaching the Center:** The center of the room is 7.5 meters from the edge. Since each leapfrog step (moving from the back board to the front board and then moving the back board forward) effectively advances him by 2.5 meters, he will reach the center after three such movements (2.5m + 2.5m + 2.5m = 7.5m). He will arrive at the center of the room safely supported by one of the 2.5-meter boards.
    *   **Step 9: Accessing the Diamond:** Once at the center and safely on a board next to the 1-meter pedestal, Carlo can carefully stand up *while still on the board* if necessary, or reach the glass cube. He can use the hammer to break the glass cube covering the diamond.
    *   **Step 10: Retrieve and Exit:** He can then retrieve the diamond. To exit, he simply reverses the leapfrogging process, safely moving back to the entrance on his two board pieces.

12. **Role of Other Equipment:** The hammer is used to break the glass cube. The saw is essential for cutting the board into two pieces for the leapfrog. The leather straps are not strictly necessary for the movement strategy outlined but *could* potentially be used to help pull the boards forward while Carlo is lying down, or perhaps to secure the diamond once stolen. However, the core mechanism for avoiding the alarm relies on the board and the saw.

13. **Conclusion:** Yes, Carlo can steal the diamond without triggering the alarm by using the saw to cut the board and then using the two pieces in a leapfrogging motion, always distributing his weight over the board resting on the carpet.

Final answer: Yes, Carlo would be able to steal the famous diamond without triggering the alarm. He can use the saw to cut the five-meter 2x4 board into two pieces, each 2.5 meters long. The wires under the carpet are spaced 8 cm apart. A 2.5-meter board spans approximately 250 cm / 8 cm = 31.25 wire gaps, resting on about 32 wires. Carlo weighs 74 kg. If he distributes his weight along the 2.5-meter board (by lying or crawling on it), the pressure on each wire is roughly 74 kg / 32 wires ≈ 2.31 kg, which is well below the 4 kg threshold per wire. He can place the first 2.5-meter board on the carpet at the entrance, carefully get onto it, and then place the second 2.5-meter board in front of the first. By carefully moving onto the second board and then reaching back to pull the first board forward, he can leapfrog across the room, always supported by a board that distributes his weight over a safe number of wires. The center of the room is 7.5 meters from the edge. Each leapfrog step advances him 2.5 meters. After three such steps (3 * 2.5m = 7.5m), he will reach the center of the room, safely supported by a board next to the pedestal. Once at the pedestal, he can use the hammer to break the glass cube and retrieve the diamond. He can then reverse the leapfrogging process to safely exit the room. The leather straps could potentially assist in moving the boards while lying down, but the core strategy relies on the board and saw for weight distribution and movement.",True,1,0,0

Now, let's process the clues:

**Hint:** Mordor and Lothlorien must be at the edges of the sequence.
This means Mordor and Lothlorien occupy positions 1 and 4.
So, {Mordor, Lothlorien} = {1st, 4th}.
This implies the other two lands, Narnia and Malacandra, occupy the middle positions: {Narnia, Malacandra} = {2nd, 3rd}.

**Clue 1:** Narnia is to the left of Lothlorien, which is to the right of the Balrog.
*   Narnia < Lothlorien (where '<' means ""is to the left of"").
*   Balrog < Lothlorien.
*   Lothlorien is either 1st or 4th (from the Hint). If Lothlorien were 1st, nothing could be to its left, which contradicts Narnia < Lothlorien. Therefore, Lothlorien must be in the 4th position.
*   Since Lothlorien is 4th, Mordor must be in the 1st position (from the Hint).
*   So the Land order starts: Mordor (1st), ?, ?, Lothlorien (4th).
*   Now Narnia must be to the left of Lothlorien (4th), so Narnia is either 2nd or 3rd.
*   The Balrog must be to the left of Lothlorien (4th), so the Balrog is 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

*Table Update:*
| Position | 1st      | 2nd  | 3rd  | 4th      |
|----------|----------|------|------|----------|
| Land     | Mordor   |      |      | Lothlorien |
| Castle   |          |      |      |          |
| Creature |          |      |      |          |
| Wig      |          |      |      |          |
*Deduction: {Narnia, Malacandra} = {2nd, 3rd}. Balrog is 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.*

**Clue 4:** The Balrog is not in Lothlorien, but he stays at the Stone Castle.
*   Balrog is NOT in the 4th position (Lothlorien). This aligns with Balrog being 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
*   The Creature and Castle in the Balrog's location are Balrog and Stone. So, wherever the Balrog is, the Stone Castle is there too.

**Clue 2:** The Stone Castle is to the right of the Wig, and is placed at either Malacandra or Lothlorien.
*   Wig < Stone Castle.
*   The Stone Castle is in Malacandra or Lothlorien.
*   From Clue 4, the Stone Castle is where the Balrog is. So, the Balrog is in Malacandra or Lothlorien.
*   We know Lothlorien is 4th. Clue 4 says the Balrog is NOT in Lothlorien.
*   Therefore, the Balrog (and the Stone Castle) must be in Malacandra.
*   So, the Land where the Balrog and Stone Castle are is Malacandra.

*Combining deductions:*
*   The set (Creature=Balrog, Castle=Stone, Land=Malacandra) occupy the same position.
*   This position is 1st, 2nd, or 3rd (Balrog's possible positions).
*   The Land is Malacandra. Malacandra is either 2nd or 3rd.
*   So the set (Balrog, Stone, Malacandra) is either in the 2nd or 3rd position.

**Clue 6:** Mordor is to the left of the Dragon, who stays at the second place.
*   Mordor < Dragon. Mordor is 1st, so the Dragon must be to its right (2nd, 3rd, or 4th). This is consistent.
*   The **Dragon is in the 2nd position.**
*   So the Creature in the 2nd position is Dragon.

*Now we know the Creature in 2nd is Dragon. The set (Balrog, Stone, Malacandra) cannot be in 2nd place because the Creature there is Dragon, not Balrog.*
*Therefore, the set (Balrog, Stone, Malacandra) must be in the 3rd position.*
* **The Balrog is in the 3rd position.**
* **The Stone Castle is in the 3rd position.**
* **Malacandra is in the 3rd position.**

*Deduction: Narnia is the remaining land for position 2.*

**Based on Land positions:** Mordor (1st), Narnia (2nd), Malacandra (3rd), Lothlorien (4th).

*Remaining Creatures: Troll, Giant. Remaining Castles: Gold, Glass, Silver.*

**Clue 3:** The Giant is not at Lothlorien and is not in the same place as the wig.
*   The Giant is NOT in the 4th position (Lothlorien).
*   The remaining creatures for positions 1 and 4 are Giant and Troll. Since Giant is not in 4th, the Giant must be in the 1st position.
*   **The Giant is in the 1st position.**
*   This means the Troll is in the 4th position.
*   **The Troll is in the 4th position.**
*   Also, the Wig is NOT in the same place as the Giant. The Giant is in the 1st position. So the Wig is NOT in the 1st position.

*Deduction: Wig is NOT in 1st.*

**Clue 7:** The Troll is not at the Silver Castle, which is 1 fantasyland to the left of the wig.
*   Troll is NOT at the Silver Castle. The Troll is in the 4th position, so the Castle in the 4th position is NOT Silver.
*   The Silver Castle is 1 position to the left of the Wig. So Wig is 1 position to the right of the Silver Castle.
*   Silver Castle < Wig.
*   Possible Wig positions (not 1st): 2nd, 3rd, 4th.
    *   If Wig is 2nd, Silver Castle is 1st.
    *   If Wig is 3rd, Silver Castle is 2nd.
    *   If Wig is 4th, Silver Castle is 3rd.

**Clue 5:** The Troll doesn't live at the Golden Castle, which is to the left of where the Balrog stays and to the right of the Silver Castle.
*   Troll is NOT at the Golden Castle. The Troll is in the 4th position, so the Castle in the 4th position is NOT Golden.
*   The Balrog is in the 3rd position (Stone Castle).
*   Golden Castle is to the left of the Balrog (3rd). So the Golden Castle is in the 1st or 2nd position.
*   Silver Castle < Golden Castle.

*Combining Castle Clues (5 & 7):*
*   Castle 3rd = Stone.
*   Castle 4th is NOT Silver (Clue 7) and NOT Golden (Clue 5).
*   Remaining Castles are Gold, Glass, Silver for positions 1, 2, 4 (Stone is 3rd).
*   Since Castle 4th is not Silver and not Golden, it must be Glass.
*   **The Glass Castle is in the 4th position.**
*   Remaining Castles for 1st and 2nd are Silver and Golden.
*   Golden Castle is in 1st or 2nd (Clue 5).
*   Silver Castle < Golden Castle (Clue 5).
*   If Golden was 1st, Silver couldn't be to its left. So Golden cannot be 1st.
*   **The Golden Castle is in the 2nd position.**
*   **The Silver Castle is in the 1st position.**

*This table is complete for Land, Castle, and Creature positions.*

*Finally, let's place the Wig:*
*   Wig is NOT in 1st (Clue 3).
*   Wig < Stone Castle (3rd) (Clue 2). This means Wig is in 1st or 2nd. Since it's not 1st, **the Wig must be in the 2nd position.**
*   Let's check this against Clue 7: Silver Castle (1st) is 1 fantasyland to the left of the wig. If the Wig is 2nd, Silver Castle is 1st. This matches our deduced castle positions.

*Final Table:*
| Position | 1st    | 2nd    | 3rd        | 4th      |

| Wig      |        | Wig    |            |          |

Let's summarize the findings:
*   The lands in order are: 1st Mordor, 2nd Narnia, 3rd Malacandra, 4th Lothlorien.
*   The castles are: Silver Castle in Mordor, Golden Castle in Narnia, Stone Castle in Malacandra, Glass Castle in Lothlorien.
*   The creatures are: Giant in Mordor, Dragon in Narnia, Balrog in Malacandra, Troll in Lothlorien.
*   The Wig is located in the 2nd position. This means the Wig is in Narnia, at the Golden Castle, and guarded by the Dragon.

The order of the lands is Mordor, Narnia, Malacandra, Lothlorien.
The castles are Silver, Golden, Stone, Glass respectively.
The creatures are Giant, Dragon, Balrog, Troll respectively.
The Wig is in the 2nd position.

Let's double-check all clues:
1.  Narnia (2nd) is to the left of Lothlorien (4th). Yes. Lothlorien (4th) is to the right of the Balrog (3rd). Yes.
2.  The Stone Castle (3rd) is to the right of the Wig (2nd). Yes. Stone Castle (3rd) is placed at either Malacandra (3rd) or Lothlorien (4th). It is at Malacandra (3rd). Yes.
3.  The Giant (1st) is not at Lothlorien (4th). Yes. The Giant (1st) is not in the same place as the wig (2nd). Yes.
4.  The Balrog (3rd) is not in Lothlorien (4th). Yes. He stays at the Stone Castle (3rd). Yes.
5.  The Troll (4th) doesn't live at the Golden Castle (2nd). Yes. Golden Castle (2nd) is to the left of where the Balrog (3rd) stays. Yes. Golden Castle (2nd) is to the right of the Silver Castle (1st). Yes.
6.  Mordor (1st) is to the left of the Dragon (2nd). Yes. Dragon stays at the second place (2nd). Yes.
7.  The Troll (4th) is not at the Silver Castle (1st). Yes. Silver Castle (1st) is 1 fantasyland to the left of the wig (2nd). Yes.

All clues are satisfied. The Wig is in the 2nd fantasyland.

The diagram reflecting the final table would look like this:

235,"Question: Just before the end of the term four high school students were discussing their chances for certain grades. The following remarks contain the gist of their hopes and fears.
Jack: We'll all get different grades. If I get an A, then Lucy will get a D.
Jean: If Lucy gets a C, then Jack will get a D. Jack will get a better grade than Paul.
Lucy: If Jean doesn't get an A, then Jack will get a C. If I get a B, then Paul won't get a D.
Paul: If Lucy gets an A, then I'll get a B. if Jean doesn't get a B, I won't either.
When the final examinations were graded and the term marks made out each of the four passed, and strange as it may seem, each received a grade that checked exactly with all the ideas they had previously expressed.
What grade did each receive?
 Hint: Is it possible for Jack to get an A? Also note that Paul is below Jack",Is it possible for Jack to get an A? Also note that Paul is below Jack,"Jack, Jean, Lucy, and Paul received B, A, D, and C, respectively.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let the grades of the four students be G_J (Jack), G_Jean (Jean), G_L (Lucy), and G_P (Paul). The possible grades are A, B, C, and D, and they are all distinct for the four students. So, {G_J, G_Jean, G_L, G_P} = {A, B, C, D}. The grades are ordered A > B > C > D.

We can translate the students' remarks into logical statements:
1.  Jack: ""We'll all get different grades."" (This is given in the problem statement).
2.  Jack: ""If I get an A, then Lucy will get a D."" (G_J = A) => (G_L = D) (J1)
3.  Jean: ""If Lucy gets a C, then Jack will get a D."" (G_L = C) => (G_J = D) (J2)
4.  Jean: ""Jack will get a better grade than Paul."" G_J > G_P (J3)
5.  Lucy: ""If Jean doesn't get an A, then Jack will get a C."" (G_Jean != A) => (G_J = C) (L1)
6.  Lucy: ""If I get a B, then Paul won't get a D."" (G_L = B) => (G_P != D) (L2)
7.  Paul: ""If Lucy gets an A, then I'll get a B."" (G_L = A) => (G_P = B) (P1)
8.  Paul: ""if Jean doesn't get a B, I won't either."" (G_Jean != B) => (G_P != B). This is logically equivalent to (G_P = B) => (G_Jean = B) (P2)

From (J3), G_J > G_P. Since the grades are distinct and from {A, B, C, D}, G_J cannot be D (as there is no grade lower than D).

Let's use the hint and test if Jack can get an A (G_J = A).
Assume G_J = A.
From (J1): If G_J = A, then G_L = D. So G_L = D.
The grades for Jack and Lucy are G_J = A and G_L = D. Since all grades are distinct and from {A, B, C, D}, the remaining grades for Jean and Paul must be from {B, C}. So {G_Jean, G_P} = {B, C}.
From (L1): If G_Jean != A, then G_J = C. We are assuming G_J = A. Since A != C, the consequence (G_J = C) is false. For the implication (G_Jean != A) => (G_J = C) to be true, the premise (G_Jean != A) must be false. This means G_Jean = A.
However, G_J = A, and the grades are distinct, so G_Jean cannot be A. This is a contradiction (G_Jean = A and G_Jean != A).
Therefore, our assumption G_J = A must be false. Jack cannot get an A.

So, G_J must be B or C (since G_J != A and G_J != D).

Case 1: G_J = B.
From (J3): G_J > G_P, so B > G_P. This means G_P must be C or D.
From (J2): G_L = C => G_J = D. G_J = B, so G_J = D is false. For the implication to be true, G_L = C must be false. So G_L != C.
From (L1): G_Jean != A => G_J = C. G_J = B, so G_J = C is false. For the implication to be true, G_Jean != A must be false. So G_Jean = A.
We now know G_J = B and G_Jean = A.
The grades {G_J, G_Jean, G_L, G_P} must be {A, B, C, D}. So {B, A, G_L, G_P} = {A, B, C, D}.
This implies {G_L, G_P} = {C, D}.
We previously deduced G_L != C. So, G_L must be D.
If G_L = D, then G_P must be C (since {G_L, G_P} = {C, D}).
So, the proposed grades for this case are: G_J = B, G_Jean = A, G_L = D, G_P = C.
Let's verify these grades against all conditions:
- Grades {B, A, D, C} are distinct and match {A",True,1,0,0
236,"Question: Mad Ade has placed five Queens on a chessboard, such that every square including those occupied by the Queens are under attack.
Imagine the chessboard is set out with reference points 1 to 8 on the vertical and A to H across the horizontal.
At what positions would the five Queens need to be?
 Hint: A couple queens next to each other can cover a lot.",A couple queens next to each other can cover a lot.,"A5, D5, E5, F5, H1 (multiple correct arrangements, check to see that every single position on the board is attacked by at least one queen)",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step, following the logic and the hint provided.

1.  **Understand the Goal:** We need to place exactly five Queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that every single square on the board (64 in total, including the ones the Queens are on) is under attack by at least one of the Queens.

2.  **Recall Queen Attack:** A Queen attacks any square in the same row, column, or diagonal as itself.

3.  **Analyze the Hint:** ""A couple queens next to each other can cover a lot."" This suggests placing some Queens in close proximity, perhaps adjacent horizontally, vertically, or even in a small cluster. Placing Queens close together might limit their individual reach in some directions due to blocking, but the hint implies the combined coverage can be significant.

4.  **Initial Strategy based on the Hint:** The strongest form of ""a couple next to each other"" might be Queens in adjacent squares, forming a small block. Consider placing Queens in a 2x2 square, for instance, in the corner at A1, A2, B1, and B2. This uses four of our five Queens.

5.  **Evaluate Coverage of the 2x2 Block (A1, A2, B1, B2):**
    *   Queen at A1 covers row 1, column A, and its two diagonals (A1-H8 and A1-H1 if the board were infinite, but relevant diagonals on the 8x8 board).
    *   Queen at A2 covers row 2, column A, and its two diagonals.
    *   Queen at B1 covers row 1, column B, and its two diagonals.
    *   Queen at B2 covers row 2, column B, and its two diagonals.

    Let's combine this coverage:
    *   **Rows:** Row 1 is attacked by A1 and B1. Row 2 is attacked by A2 and B2. So, rows 1 and 2 are completely covered by these four Queens.
    *   **Columns:** Column A is attacked by A1 and A2. Column B is attacked by B1 and B2. So, columns A and B are completely covered.
    *   **Area Covered So Far:** Rows 1 and 2 (16 squares) and Columns A and B (ignoring the overlap, another 12 squares: A3-A8, B3-B8). This 2x2 block thus directly covers a significant portion of the board's edges: the first two rows and the first two columns.

6.  **Identify Remaining Uncovered Area:** The area *not* covered by the first two rows (1-2) or the first two columns (A-B) is the 6x6 grid starting at C3 and ending at H8.

7.  **Place the Fifth Queen:** We have one Queen left to cover the remaining C3-H8 area and ensure no square within the 6x6 area or on its boundaries (rows 3-8, columns C-H) is left unattacked. Where is the best place to put the 5th Queen (Q5) to effectively attack this remaining large block?
    *   Placing it in the very corner (H8) might cover that corner well but not reach into the necessary areas effectively.
    *   Placing it centrally might not cover the edges/corners of the remaining area.
    *   Placing it along one of the ""inner"" edges of the remaining area seems promising, for example, somewhere in row 3 or column C. Let's try placing it on column C. Which row? C3? C4? C5?
    *   Let's consider placing Q5 at C4. This square is within the region we need to help cover (rows 3-8, columns C-H).

8.  **Evaluate Coverage with Q1(A1), Q2(A2), Q3(B1), Q4(B2), Q5(C4):**
    *   We already know rows 1, 2 and columns A, B are fully covered by Q1-Q4.
    *   Q5 at C4 covers row 4 and column C entirely.
    *   Now, rows 1, 2, 4 and columns A, B, C are covered.

9.  **Systematically Check Remaining Rows and Columns:** We need to ensure rows 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and columns D, E, F, G, H are fully covered by the five Queens (Q1-Q5), considering all their attacks (row, column, diagonal).

    *   **Row 3:**
        *   A3 is attacked by B2 (diagonal).
        *   B3 is attacked by A1 (diagonal) and B2 (diagonal).
        *   C3 is attacked by A2 (diagonal) and B2 (diagonal).
        *   D3 is attacked by A1 (diagonal) and B1 (diagonal).
        *   E3 is attacked by A1 (diagonal) and B2 (diagonal).
        *   F3 is attacked by A1 (diagonal) and B1 (diagonal).
        *   G3 is attacked by A1 (diagonal) and B1 (diagonal).
        *   H3 is attacked by A1 (diagonal) and B1 (diagonal).
        *   Row 3 is fully covered.

    *   **Row 5:**
        *   A5 is attacked by A2 (diagonal).
        *   B5 is attacked by A1 (diagonal) and A2 (diagonal).
        *   C5 is attacked by A2 (diagonal).
        *   D5 is attacked by A2 (diagonal).
        *   E5 is attacked by A1 (diagonal) and B2 (diagonal).

        *   G5 is attacked by B2 (diagonal).
        *   H5 is attacked by A1 (diagonal).
        *   Row 5 is fully covered. (Also, C4 attacks D5, E6, F7, G8 on a diagonal, and B5, A6 on another). Let's recheck E5 coverage: E5 is on the A1-H8",True,0,0,1

239,"Question: You are in a game show with four other contestants.  The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues, and the first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no leading zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. The third set of two numbers is the same as the first set reversed.
2. There are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the combination.
3. If you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers, you will get the fourth set of numbers.
4. If you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.
5. The second set of numbers is not greater than 20.
6. The second number in the second set multiplied by the second number in the fourth set equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.
And get moving, I think another contestant has almost figured it out!
 Hint: Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.","Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.","The combination is 71-19-17-68.
From the second clue, we know that there are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the sets.  Therefore, only 1's, 6's, 7's, 8's and 9's could be in the remaining spots.
Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.
11 * 4 = 44
16 * 4 = 64
17 * 4 = 68
18 * 4 = 72
19 * 4 = 76
Of these, 17 * 4 and 19 * 4 are the only ones that are possible; as the answer of the other numbers contains a number which we know is not in the combination.
Now we skip all the way to clue 5, which tells us the second set of numbers is not greater than 20.  This means that the first digit of that set is also a 1.
So far, we know this much:
??-1?-1?-??
Now, we can come to clue 4, which tells us if you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.  The first number in the second set is 1, so the first number in the first set must be 7.  Since the first clue tells us the first set is the third set reversed, and we know that a 1 is the first number in the third set, a 1 must be the second number in the first set and a 7 must be the second number in the third set.
So far, we know this much:
71-1?-17-??
Now, the third set (17) multiplied by 4 will get us 68.  Now we know the fourth set is 68.
71-1?-17-68
Now we come to the final clue.  This tells us the second number in the second set (unknown) multiplied by the second number in the fourth set (8) equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.  We know that the first set is 71, so adding one to that (72) and then dividing it by 8 will get us 9.  So, the finished combination is:
71-19-17-68",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step using the clues and the hint.

The combination is `AB-CD-EF-GH`, where A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H are single digits.
Constraints:
*   Digits allowed: From Clue 2, no 2s, 3s, 4s, or 5s. So the allowed digits are {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
*   No leading zeros: A, C, E, G cannot be 0.
*   Since digits can be used more than once, repetition is allowed.

Let's analyze each clue and build possibilities:

1.  **Clue 1: The third set of two numbers is the same as the first set reversed.**
    *   `EF` = `BA` (as a two-digit number).
    *   This means E = B and F = A.
    *   Since E cannot be 0 (no leading zeros), B cannot be 0.
    *   A, B, C, E, G must be from {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
    *   D, F, H can be from {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

2.  **Clue 3: If you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers, you will get the fourth set of numbers.**
    *   4 * `EF` = `GH` (where `EF` and `GH` are the numeric values 10E + F and 10G + H).
    *   G cannot be 0.
    *   `EF` and `GH` must consist only of allowed digits {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}, with E and G being non-zero.

    *   **Apply the Hint:** The hint says E must be 1. Let's prove this using the allowed digits.
        *   E must be a non-zero allowed digit: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
        *   F must be an allowed digit: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
        *   `EF` is 10E + F. The smallest possible `EF` value if E is from {1, 6, 7, 8, 9} is when E=1 and F=0, so `EF`=10.
        *   `GH` is 10G + H. G must be a non-zero allowed digit: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}. H must be an allowed digit: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}. The smallest possible `GH` value is when G=1 and H=0, so `GH`=10.
        *   4 * `EF` = `GH`.
        *   If E = 1, F can be {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
            *   If `EF` = 10, 4 * 10 = 40. G=4. 4 is not an allowed digit (Clue 2). Invalid.
            *   If `EF` = 11, 4 * 11 = 44. G=4, H=4. 4 is not an allowed digit. Invalid.
            *   If `EF` = 16, 4 * 16 = 64. G=6, H=4. 4 is not an allowed digit. Invalid.
            *   If `EF` = 17, 4 * 17 = 68. G=6, H=8. Both 6 and 8 are allowed digits {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}. G=6 is non-zero. This is a valid possibility: `EF` = 17, `GH` = 68.
            *   If `EF` = 18, 4 * 18 = 72. H=2. 2 is not an allowed digit. Invalid.
            *   If `EF` = 19, 4 * 19 = 76. G=7, H=6. Both 7 and 6 are allowed digits {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}. G=7 is non-zero. This is another valid possibility: `EF` = 19, `GH` = 76.
        *   Now, consider if E is any other value from {1, 6, 7, 8, 9} (other than 1). The smallest such value is 6.
        *   If E = 6, F can be {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
            *   If `EF` = 60 (E=6, F=0), 4 * 60 = 240. This is a three-digit number, but `GH` must be a two-digit number. Any `EF` starting with 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a three-digit `GH` because 4 * 60 = 240, and any larger `EF` will give a larger result.
        *   So, E *must* be 1.

    *   We have found two possibilities for `EF` and `GH`:
        *   Possibility A: `EF` = 17 (E=1, F=7), `GH` = 68 (G=6, H=8).
        *   Possibility B: `EF` = 19 (E=1, F=9), `GH` = 76 (G=7, H=6).

Let's test these possibilities using the remaining clues.

**Possibility A: E=1, F=7, G=6, H=8.**

*   From Clue 1 (E=B, F=A): B = 1, A = 7.
    *   Check constraints: A=7 is non-zero allowed {1,6,7,8,9} (ok). B=1 is non-zero allowed {1,6,7,8,9} (ok). `AB` = 71.
*   From Clue 4 (A + C = 8): 7 + C = 8, so C = 1.
    *   Check constraints: C=1 is non-zero allowed {1,6,7,8,9} (ok).
*   From Clue 5 (`CD` <= 20): Since C=1, 10 * 1 + D <= 20, which means 10 + D <= 20, so D <= 10.
    *   Check constraints: D must be an allowed digit {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}. All these values are <= 10, so this constraint doesn't narrow down D yet.
*   From Clue 6 (D * H = `AB` + 1):
    *   We know H=8, A=7, B=1 (`AB` = 71).
    *   D * 8 = 71 + 1
    *   D * 8 = 72
    *   D = 72 / 8
    *   D = 9.
    *   Check constraints for D=9: 9 is an allowed digit {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9} (ok). 9 is also <= 10 (from Clue 5 constraint) (ok).

Let's assemble the combination from Possibility A:
*   A=7, B=1 (`AB`=71)
*   C=1, D=9 (`CD`=19)
*   E=1, F=7 (`EF`=17)
*   G=6, H=8 (`GH`=68)
The combination is 71-19-17-68.

Let's verify this combination against *all* the clues:
*   Digits used: 7, 1, 9, 1, 7, 6, 8. All are in {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9} (Clue 2 - ok).
*   No leading zeros: 7, 1, 1, 6 are non-zero (ok).
*   Clue 1: `EF` (17) is `AB` (71) reversed? E=B, F=A? E=1, B=1 (ok). F=7, A=7 (ok). `EF` (17) is `BA` (17). (Clue 1 - ok).
*   Clue 3: 4 * `EF` = `GH`? 4 * 17 = 68. Yes. (Clue 3 - ok).
*   Clue 4: A + C = 8? 7 + 1 = 8. Yes. (Clue 4 - ok).
*   Clue 5: `CD` <= 20? 19 <= 20. Yes. (Clue 5 - ok).
*   Clue 6: D * H = `AB` + 1? 9 * 8 = 71 + 1? 72 = 72. Yes. (Clue 6 - ok).

All clues are satisfied by the combination 71-19-17-68.

**Possibility B: E=1, F=9, G=7, H=6.**

*   From Clue 1 (E=B, F=A): B = 1, A = 9.
    *   Check constraints: A=9 is non-zero allowed {1,6,7,8,9} (ok). B=1 is non-zero allowed {1,6,7,8,9} (ok). `AB` = 91.
*   From Clue 4 (A + C = 8): 9 + C = 8, so C = 8 - 9 = -1.
    *   A digit cannot be negative. This possibility is immediately invalid.

Since Possibility A satisfied all clues and Possibility B is invalid, 71-19-17-68 must be the correct combination.

The final answer is $\boxed{71-19-17-68}$.",True,1,0,0

241,"Question: In Major League Baseball, the World Series is a best of seven series.  The first team to win four games is the champion.  The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.
In this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Los Angeles hosted the first two games.  The final scores of the games were:
Game 1:  4 to 3
Game 2:  6 to 5 (11 innings)
Game 3:  11 to 7
Game 4:  16 to 9
Game 5:  9 to 6 (10 innings)
Game 6:  2 to 1
Game 7:  13 to 8 (13 innings)
Which team won the World Series?
 Hint: In baseball, the home team bats last.  ","In baseball, the home team bats last.  ","Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.  It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.
The team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.  New York scored five runs in the top of the 13th inning.
Therefore, the New York Yankees won the World Series, four games to three.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's solve this step-by-step using the provided information and the hint.

242,"Question: A tourist group of 86 people broke up into two groups. The smaller group went to the beach, and the bigger group went to see a water mill. The following statements are all true. How many people were in each group?
a) A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.
b) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.
c) One of the groups contains only married couples.
d) The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.
e) One of the groups contains 8 times as many people who are younger than 50 as those who are at least 50 years old.
 Hint: Set up an equation.",Set up an equation.,"The first thing is to make this question an equation. The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then ¼(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then ¼(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation ¼(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.
If c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since ""couples"" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.
o+8o=9o.
So 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even. So, group x consists of 72 people and y consists of 14 people.
So, the answer is that there are 72 people that went to see the water mill and 14 people went to the beach.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $n_1$ be the number of people in the smaller group and $n_2$ be the number of people in the bigger group.
The total number of people is 86. So, we have the equation:
$n_1 + n_2 = 86$

Since $n_1$ is the number of people in the smaller group and $n_2$ is the number of people in the bigger group, we must have $n_1 < n_2$.
Also, $n_1$ and $n_2$ must be positive integers. $n_1 \ge 1, n_2 \ge 1$.
From $n_1 + n_2 = 86$ and $n_1 < n_2$, we can deduce $n_1 < 86/2 = 43$. So $1 \le n_1 \le 42$.

Now let's use the given statements:

a) A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.
This means either $\frac{1}{4} n_1 > n_2$ or $\frac{1}{4} n_2 > n_1$.
Since $n_1 < n_2$, $\frac{1}{4} n_1 < \frac{1}{4} n_2$.
If $\frac{1}{4} n_1 > n_2$, then $n_1 > 4n_2$. But we know $n_1 < n_2$. This would imply $4n_2 < n_1 < n_2$, which is impossible for positive $n_2$.
So, the statement must mean $\frac{1}{4} n_2 > n_1$. This inequality is $n_2 > 4n_1$.
Substitute $n_2 = 86 - n_1$ into the inequality:
$86 - n_1 > 4n_1$
$86 > 5n_1$
$n_1 < \frac{86}{5} = 17.2$
So, $n_1$ must be an integer between 1 and 17, inclusive. $1 \le n_1 \le 17$.

b) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.
Let the number of men be $m$ and the number of women be $w$. If $w = 6m$, the total number of people in that group is $n = m + w = m + 6m = 7m$.
This means the number of people in that group must be a multiple of 7.
So, either $n_1$ is a multiple of 7, or $n_2$ is a multiple of 7.
If $7 | n_1$, since $1 \le n_1 \le 17$, possible values for $n_1$ are 7 or 14.
If $7 | n_2$, then $n_2 = 86 - n_1$ is a multiple of 7. Since $1 \le n_1 \le 17$, $86-17 \le n_2 \le 86-1$, so $69 \le n_2 \le 85$.
Multiples of 7 in this range are 70, 77, 84.
If $n_2 = 70$, $n_1 = 86 - 70 = 16$.
If $n_2 = 77$, $n_1 = 86 - 77 = 9$.
If $n_2 = 84$, $n_1 = 86 - 84 = 2$.
Possible values for $n_1$ satisfying a) and b) are $\{2, 7, 9, 14, 16\}$.

c) One of the groups contains only married couples.
If a group contains only married couples, the number of people in that group must be an even number.
So, either $n_1$ is even or $n_2$ is even.
Since $n_1 + n_2 = 86$ (an even number), if one number is even, the other must also be even. If one number is odd, the other must also be odd.
So, statement c) implies that both $n_1$ and $n_2$ must be even.
From the possible values for $n_1$: $\{2, 7, 9, 14, 16\}$, we select the even numbers: $\{2, 14, 16\}$.
Let's check the corresponding $n_2 = 86 - n_1$ values for these $n_1$:
If $n_1 = 2$, $n_2 = 86 - 2 = 84$. (2 is even, 84 is even. Satisfies c). Also $2 < 84$ and $84 > 4 \times 2=8$. $84 = 12 \times 7$, so b) is satisfied).
If $n_1 = 14$, $n_2 = 86 - 14 = 72$. (14 is even, 72 is even. Satisfies c). Also $14 < 72$ and $72 > 4 \times 14=56$. $14 = 2 \times 7$, so b) is satisfied).
If $n_1 = 16$, $n_2 = 86 - 16 = 70$. (16 is even, 70 is even. Satisfies c). Also $16 < 70$ and $70 > 4 \times ",True,0,0,0

245,"Question: The answer I give is yes, but what I mean is no.
What was the question?
 Hint: nan",,Do you mind?,GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

The statement given is: ""The answer I give is yes, but what I mean is no.""
We need to find the question that was asked.

Let's analyze the statement:
1.  **""The answer I give is yes""**: This means the spoken or written response to the question is the word ""yes"".
2.  **""what I mean is no""**: This means the person's true intention or the state of affairs they are describing is ""no"".

So, we are looking for a question where saying the word ""yes"" is the correct *spoken* answer to that specific question, *when the underlying reality or intent the person wishes to convey is ""no""*.

This sounds like a classic riddle involving the structure of the question, specifically how ""yes"" and ""no"" relate to the question's phrasing. This often involves a negative or a double negative.

Let's consider questions involving negation. Suppose the question asks about something *not* happening.
For example, if the question was ""Are you *not* going?"".
*   If the person *is* going (meaning ""yes""), they would likely say ""No, I *am* going."" (Spoken answer is ""No""). This doesn't fit.
*   If the person is *not* going (meaning ""no""), they would likely say ""Yes, I am not going."" (Spoken answer is ""Yes"", meaning is ""no""). This fits the condition!

So, a question of the form ""Are you [negative statement]?"" can work. The negative statement must be equivalent to what the person *means*. The person means ""no"". So, the negative statement needs to be something like ""not X"" where saying ""Yes, I am not X"" is equivalent to saying ""No"" in the context of the question's intent.

Let's rephrase ""what I mean is no"" in a way that fits the structure ""I am not X"".
""I am not saying yes."" or ""I am not agreeing.""

Let's try the question: ""Are you not saying yes?""
*   Assume the person's true intention is ""no"".
*   If someone intends to say ""no"", then it is true that they ""are not saying yes"".
*   The question asks: ""Is it true that you are not saying yes?""
*   Since they intend to say ""no"", it *is* true that they are not saying yes.
*   Therefore, the correct spoken answer to the question ""Are you not saying yes?"" is ""Yes"".
*   So, ""The answer I give is yes"" is satisfied.
*   And the underlying intention that makes them ""not saying yes"" is ""no"".
*   So, ""what I mean is no"" is satisfied.

This fits perfectly. The question ""Are you not saying yes?"" elicits a ""Yes"" response from someone whose true intention is ""no"".

Let's consider another variation: ""Are you saying no?""
*   If the person's true intention is ""no"", they would say ""Yes, I am saying no"".
*   Spoken answer is ""Yes"".
*   Meaning is ""no"".
*   This also works!

However, the phrasing ""The answer I give is yes, but what I mean is no"" often implies a slight disconnect or a non-direct way of conveying the meaning. ""Are you not saying yes?"" feels slightly more like the kind of riddle structure intended, as it uses a negation within the question itself to flip the typical yes/no mapping. It's also a classic phrasing for this type of puzzle. ""Are you saying no?"" is a bit too direct. The phrasing ""what I mean is no"" suggests the ""yes"" is the *literal* answer to the *literal* question, but the *implication* or *underlying intent* is ""no"".

Let's stick with the most common form of this riddle, which uses the double negative implicitly or explicitly. ""Are you not saying yes?"" is the most direct fit for ""The answer I give is yes (meaning, yes, I am in the state of not saying yes), but what I mean is no (my underlying position is no)"".

Therefore, the question was asking if the person was in the state of ""not saying yes"". Since their intent was ""no"", they were indeed in the state of ""not saying yes"", leading them to answer ""Yes"" to that specific question, while still meaning ""no"" in the context of the original topic.

The question is ""Are you not saying yes?"".

Final check:
Question: Are you not saying yes?
Person's intended meaning: No.
If the intended meaning is ""no"", then the person is indeed *not* saying yes.
So, is it true that you are not saying yes? Yes.
Spoken answer: Yes.
Meaning: No.
This matches the conditions.

Final answer is likely ""Are you not saying yes?"".

Let's consider the hint ""nan"". This hint is often used as an abbreviation for ""not a number"" in programming contexts, or it could be meaningless noise. If it's meaningless, it doesn't help. If it's ""not a number"", it seems irrelevant to a yes/no logic puzzle. It's most likely a placeholder or an error in the prompt. It doesn't seem useful for solving the puzzle itself, which relies on logical deduction about language.

The solution hinges purely on the structure of the sentence ""The answer I give is yes, but what I mean is no."" and how ""yes"" and ""no"" can be used truthfully in response to specific question phrasings.

The most fitting and common answer to this classic riddle is a question structured to elicit a ""yes"" response when the underlying stance is ""no"", typically involving a negation. ""Are you not saying yes?"" is the prime example.

The reasoning steps:
1. Identify the core contradiction: spoken ""yes"", intended ""no"".
2. Understand that this requires a question where the literal truth of the answer ""yes"" corresponds to a state which is equivalent to ""no"" in a broader sense.
3. Consider questions involving negation. A question asking if the person is *not* doing something is a strong candidate.
4. The state the person is in, corresponding to their intended ""no"", is ""not agreeing"" or ""not saying yes"".
5. Formulate the question based on this state: ""Are you not saying yes?"".
6. Verify that this question fulfills the conditions:
    * If the person means ""no"", they *are* in the state of ""not saying yes"".
    * The truthful answer to ""Are you in the state of not saying yes?"" is ""Yes"". (This is the spoken answer).
    * The underlying meaning behind being in the state of ""not saying yes"" is ""no"". (This is the intended meaning).
7. Confirm this matches the prompt: ""The answer I give is yes, but what I mean is no.""

The hint ""nan"" is ignored as it provides no clear path to the solution based on standard puzzle hints or mathematical concepts relevant here.

The question is: ""Are you not saying yes?"" or possibly ""Are you saying no?"". Both fit the literal conditions, but ""Are you not saying yes?"" is the more conventional phrasing for this specific riddle structure. I will use the more conventional one as it better captures the subtle difference between the literal answer and the intended meaning often implied by the riddle's wording.

Final answer should be ""Are you not saying yes?"".

Double-check the ""Are you saying no?"" possibility:
Question: Are you saying no?
Person's intended meaning: No.
If the intended meaning is ""no"", the person *is* saying no.
So, is it true that you are saying no? Yes.
Spoken answer: Yes.
Meaning: No.

Yes, ""Are you saying no?"" also fits perfectly. The phrasing ""but what I mean is no"" could slightly favor ""Are you not saying yes?"", as the 'yes' response to that question refers to the *state* of ""not saying yes"", whereas in ""Are you saying no?"", the 'yes' response directly affirms ""saying no"". The riddle often implies a more indirect connection between the spoken word and the intended meaning. ""Are you not saying yes?"" creates this indirectness better.

Let's choose ""Are you not saying yes?"" as the primary answer due to its common usage in this riddle type, which highlights the contrast between the literal ""yes"" (to the negative question) and the intended ""no"".

Final verification of ""Are you not saying yes?"":
User's inner state/intention: ""No""
Question asked: ""Are you not saying yes?""
To answer this question truthfully, the user evaluates if their current state or intention aligns with ""not saying yes"".
Since their intention is ""no"", it is indeed true that they ""are not saying yes"".
So, the truthful answer to the question ""Are you not saying yes?"" is ""Yes"".
This is the answer given. (""The answer I give is yes"").
The underlying meaning/intention is ""no"". (""what I mean is no"").
This confirms the question.

Final decision: ""Are you not saying yes?"" is the most fitting answer.

One last thought: Could it be ""Are you going to say yes?"" If the person *means* no, they are *not* going to say yes. So the truthful answer is ""No, I am not going to say yes"". Spoken answer is ""No"", meaning is ""No"". Doesn't fit.

Could it be a question about whether they *can* say no? ""Can you say no?"" If they mean ""no"", they certainly can say no. Answer ""Yes, I can say no"". Spoken ""Yes"", meaning ""No"". This also works!

Let's compare ""Are you not saying yes?"" and ""Can you say no?"".
*   ""Are you not saying yes?"" - Yes (I am in the state of not saying yes) -> meaning No.
*   ""Can you say no?"" - Yes (I have the ability to say no) -> meaning No.

Both technically work based *only* on the provided text. However, the context of this type of riddle strongly favors questions that play on the *direct response* to a question about agreement or disagreement, rather than ability. ""Are you not saying yes?"" is a standard form of this riddle. ""Can you say no?"" feels like a variation, but less direct in linking the ""yes"" response to the immediate act of stating a position.

I will provide the standard answer to this riddle.

The standard riddle is ""Is the answer no?"". If the answer they give is Yes, but they mean no, this question doesn't fit.
""Is the answer yes?"". If they mean no, they would say No.

The phrasing must be such that a truthful ""yes"" response *to the question* reflects a situation where the underlying intent is ""no"".

Consider ""Are you *not* going to say no?""
*   Meaning is ""no"".
*   If meaning is ""no"", they *are* going to say no.
*   So, they are *not* not going to say no.
*   Answer to ""Are you not going to say no?"" is ""No"". Does not fit.

Consider ""Are you *not* going to say yes?""
*   Meaning is ""no"".
*   If meaning is ""no"", they are *not* going to say yes.
*   So, they *are* not going to say yes.
*   Answer to ""Are you not going to say yes?"" is ""Yes"". Fits.

This confirms ""Are you not saying yes?"" or ""Are you not going to say yes?"". The simpler ""Are you not saying yes?"" is sufficient and standard.

Okay, the reasoning is sound. The question ""Are you not saying yes?"" is the one that fits the conditions of the riddle.

Steps summarized:
1. Identify the contradiction: spoken ""yes"", intended ""no"".
2. Seek a question structure where this contradiction is resolved by literal truthfulness.
3. Focus on questions using negation or phrasing that allows ""yes"" to confirm a negative state.
4. Test candidate questions based on the structure ""Are you [negative state]?"" where the negative state is equivalent to the intended ""no"".
5. ""Are you not saying yes?"" fits: saying ""Yes"" to this confirms the state of ""not saying yes"", which is equivalent to intending ""no"".

No other simple yes/no question structure seems to fit as cleanly and commonly as this negative phrasing.

The hint ""nan"" remains uninterpreted but does not hinder the logical deduction based on the verbal puzzle itself.

The problem is a classic word puzzle, not a mathematical one, despite the introduction mentioning math logic. The logic applied is deductive reasoning based on interpreting the relationship between stated response and intended meaning.

Final decision: ""Are you not saying yes?"" is the answer.Here's my reasoning process to determine the question:

1.  **Analyze the user's statement:** The user says, ""The answer I give is yes, but what I mean is no.""
    *   This means the *actual spoken or written word* given as a response to the question is ""yes"".
    *   This also means the *true state, intention, or underlying meaning* the person wants to convey is ""no"".

2.  **Identify the core problem:** We need a question to which the truthful *literal* answer is ""yes"", but where the *implication* or *underlying intent* behind that ""yes"" response corresponds to ""no"".

3.  **Consider how ""yes"" can mean ""no"":** This typically occurs when the question is phrased in a way that flips the usual yes/no mapping. The most common way to achieve this is through a negative or a double negative in the question itself.

4.  **Explore questions involving negation:**
    *   Suppose the question is about something *not* being true. If the person intends ""no"", then the negative of that intention (""not no"") is ""yes"".
    *   Alternatively, if the question asks if the person is in a state of ""not X"", and their intention *is* ""not X"", then the truthful answer is ""Yes"".

5.  **Apply this to the intended meaning ""no"":** The person intends to convey ""no"". How can a question ask about this state (""intending no"") such that the answer ""yes"" is appropriate?
    *   Consider the state equivalent to intending ""no"". This state could be described as ""not agreeing"" or ""not saying yes"".

6.  **Formulate candidate questions:** Let's try phrasing a question based on the state ""not saying yes"":
    *   Question candidate: ""Are you not saying yes?""

7.  **Test the candidate question against the user's statement:**
    *   Assume the person is asked ""Are you not saying yes?""
    *   Assume the person's true intention is ""no"".
    *   If the person's intention is ""no"", then it is *true* that they are *not* in the state of ""saying yes"".
    *   So, the question ""Is it true that you are not saying yes?"" is asking if their state is ""not saying yes"".
    *   Since their intention is ""no"", their state *is* ""not saying yes"".
    *   Therefore, the truthful, literal answer to ""Are you not saying yes?"" is ""Yes"". This matches ""The answer I give is yes"".
    *   The reason they are in the state of ""not saying yes"" is because their underlying position or meaning is ""no"". This matches ""what I mean is no"".

8.  **Confirm the fit:** The question ""Are you not saying yes?"" perfectly matches the condition: giving a ""yes"" answer is literally true based on the phrasing of the question, while simultaneously conveying the intended meaning of ""no"".

9.  **Consider other possibilities briefly:**
    *   ""Are you saying no?"" If the meaning is ""no"", the answer is ""Yes, I am saying no"". Spoken ""Yes"", meaning ""No"". This also fits literally, but ""Are you not saying yes?"" is a more classic phrasing for this type of riddle that emphasizes the negative phrasing of the question.
    *   Other structures often fail. For example, ""Is the answer no?"" - if they mean no, the answer is ""Yes, the answer is no"". This fits.
    *   ""Is the answer yes?"" - if they mean no, the answer is ""No, the answer is not yes"". Does not fit.

10. **Refine the answer:** While ""Are you saying no?"" and ""Is the answer no?"" also technically fit the strict requirements, ""Are you not saying yes?"" is a very common and widely accepted answer to this classic riddle structure, as it creates the desired tension between the literal positive answer and the underlying negative meaning through the question's negative construction. I will provide the most common and characteristic answer.

11. **Address the hint:** The hint ""nan"" is likely irrelevant to this type of logical word puzzle. It may be an error or a placeholder. I have solved the problem based solely on the verbal logic presented in the question itself.

The question is designed to play on the relationship between the literal truth value of a statement and the intention behind it, specifically using negation to reverse the expected ""yes"" means yes, ""no"" means no mapping.

The final answer is the question that, when answered truthfully with ""yes"", signifies that the person holds the position ""no"". This is achieved by asking if they hold the position *opposite* of ""yes"", i.e., ""not yes"".

Question: Are you not saying yes?
If I mean ""no"", then it is true that I am ""not saying yes"". So I would answer ""Yes"".
Answer given: Yes.
Meaning: No.
This works.

Final Answer: The question was ""Are you not saying yes?"".

**Final verification:**
If the question is ""Are you not saying yes?"", and the speaker's true intent is to convey ""no"".
To answer truthfully, the speaker considers their state: ""Am I in the state of *not* saying yes?""
Since their intention is ""no"", they are indeed *not* in the state of saying ""yes"".
So, the truthful answer to the question is ""Yes"".
This is ""The answer I give is yes"".
The underlying intention that makes them ""not say yes"" is ""no"".
This is ""what I mean is no"".
The conditions are met.

We will represent ""A was in front of B"" as A > B, which also means ""B was behind A"".

Here are the clues translated into relationships:
1.  Grumpy was in front of Dopey. -> `Grumpy > Dopey`
2.  Stumpy was behind Sneezy and Doc. -> `Sneezy > Stumpy`, `Doc > Stumpy`
3.  Doc was in front of Droopy and Happy. -> `Doc > Droopy`, `Doc > Happy`

12. Stumpy was in front of Dopey. -> `Stumpy > Dopey`
13. Smelly was behind Doc. -> `Doc > Smelly`

Let's consolidate the unique direct relationships:
*   `Grumpy > Dopey`
*   `Sneezy > Stumpy`
*   `Doc > Stumpy`
*   `Doc > Droopy`
*   `Doc > Happy`

*   `Sleepy > Grumpy`
*   `Sleepy > Dopey`
*   `Doc > Dopey`
*   `Doc > Smelly`

Now, let's apply the hint: ""Lots of people must be behind Doc..."". Let's see exactly who is behind Doc based on the clues:
*   Directly behind Doc: Stumpy, Droopy, Happy, Dopey, Smelly (from clues 2, 3, 11, 13).
*   Indirectly behind Doc:
    *   Since `Doc > Smelly` and `Smelly > Grumpy`, `Smelly > Stumpy`, `Smelly > Sneezy`, `Smelly > Sleepy`, Doc is also in front of Grumpy, Sneezy, Sleepy (Stumpy is already listed).
    *   Since `Doc > Happy` and `Happy > Sleepy`, `Happy > Smelly`, `Happy > Bashful`, Doc is also in front of Bashful (Smelly and Sleepy are already covered by the Smelly chain or listed).
    *   Since `Doc > Dopey` and `Dopey > Droopy`, Droopy is also behind Doc (already listed).
    *   Since `Doc > Sneezy` (via `Doc > Smelly > Sneezy`), and `Sneezy > Stumpy`, `Sneezy > Dopey`, Doc is also in front of Stumpy and Dopey (already listed).
    *   Since `Doc > Stumpy` and `Stumpy > Sleepy`, `Stumpy > Dopey`, Doc is also in front of Sleepy and Dopey (already covered).
    *   Since `Doc > Sleepy` (via `Doc > Smelly > Sleepy` or `Doc > Happy > Sleepy`), and `Sleepy > Grumpy`, `Sleepy > Bashful`, `Sleepy > Dopey`, Doc is also in front of Grumpy, Bashful, Dopey (already covered).
    *   Since `Doc > Grumpy` (via `Doc > Smelly > Grumpy`), and `Grumpy > Dopey`, Doc is also in front of Dopey (already covered).
    *   Since `Doc > Droopy` and `Droopy > Bashful`, Doc is also in front of Bashful (already covered).

Let's list everyone Doc is in front of: Stumpy, Droopy, Happy, Dopey, Smelly, Grumpy, Sneezy, Sleepy, Bashful. That's 9 other people. Since there are only 10 people in total, Doc must be in front of everyone else.
Therefore, Doc is the first person in the queue.

The queue starts with: `Doc, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?`

Now let's figure out who is second. This person must be behind Doc, but not behind anyone else who is also behind Doc.
Let's look at the direct relationships with Doc: `Doc > Stumpy`, `Doc > Droopy`, `Doc > Happy`, `Doc > Dopey`, `Doc > Smelly`.
Are any of these people also behind another person on this list?
*   `Smelly` is behind Happy (`Happy > Smelly`). So Smelly is not second.
*   `Happy` is not explicitly stated as being behind Smelly, Stumpy, Droopy, or Dopey. Happy is in front of Smelly (`Happy > Smelly`), Sleepy (`Happy > Sleepy`), and Bashful (`Happy > Bashful`). This suggests Happy is likely second. Let's assume Happy is second and check if it fits.

Queue so far: `Doc, Happy, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?`

Now let's find the person behind Happy, who is not behind anyone else already placed (Doc, Happy). The clues involving Happy are: `Happy > Sleepy`, `Happy > Smelly`, `Happy > Bashful`.
*   `Smelly` is behind Happy (`Happy > Smelly`). Is Smelly behind Sleepy or Bashful? No, Smelly is in front of Sleepy (`Smelly > Sleepy`) and in front of Bashful (via `Smelly > Sleepy > Bashful` or `Smelly > Grumpy > Dopey > Droopy > Bashful` or `Smelly > Sneezy > Stumpy > Dopey > Droopy > Bashful`).

From clue 3, 7 must be the 1st or 3rd digit pressed since it can not be pressed before or after the 6 or 8. From clue 4, this means 5 must be pressed 1st or 3rd. But, from clue 2, it can not be the 3rd digit, so it must be the first, meaning 7 is the 3rd digit pressed.
That leaves 3, 6, 8, and 9 as the last 4 digits to be pressed. If 8 were pressed 8th, then the 9 must be pressed 6th, a contradiction with clue 4. So 8 must be pressed 6th meaning 9 is to be pressed last. This leaves 6 to be entered 8th and 3 to be entered 7th.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let the sequence of digits be $d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6, d_7, d_8, d_9$.
The digits are a permutation of $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.

Clue 1: Each digit is pressed once and only once. This means the sequence is a permutation of $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.

Clue 2: No two consecutive digits are pressed consecutively. This means $|d_i - d_{i+1}| \neq 1$ for $i = 1, ..., 8$.

Clue 3: $\{d_2, d_4\} = \{2, 4\}$ and $\{d_6, d_8\} = \{6, 8\}$.

Clue 4:
$d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5 = 19$
$d_5 + d_6 + d_7 + d_8 + d_9 = 27$

Step 1: Determine $d_5$ using clue 4 and the sum of all digits.
The sum of all digits from 1 to 9 is $S_{all} = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = \frac{9 \times 10}{2} = 45$.
The sum of the first 5 digits is $S_1 = 19$.
The sum of the last 5 digits is $S_2 = 27$.
Notice that the sum $S_1 + S_2$ includes $d_5$ twice, while covering all other digits once:
$S_1 + S_2 = (d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5) + (d_5 + d_6 + d_7 + d_8 + d_9)$
$S_1 + S_2 = (d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5 + d_6 + d_7 + d_8 + d_9) + d_5$
$S_1 + S_2 = S_{all} + d_5$.
Substituting the known values:
$19 + 27 = 45 + d_5$
$46 = 45 + d_5$
$d_5 = 1$.

The 5th digit is 1. The sequence is $d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, 1, d_6, d_7, d_8, d_9$.

Step 2: Use clue 3 and the non-consecutive rule with $d_5=1$ to determine $d_2$ and $d_4$.
From clue 3, $\{d_2, d_4\} = \{2, 4\}$.
From clue 2, $|d_4 - d_5| \neq 1$. Since $d_5 = 1$, $|d_4 - 1| \neq 1$. This means $d_4 \neq 0$ and $d_4 \neq 2$.
Since $d_4$ must be either 2 or 4, and $d_4 \neq 2$, it must be that $d_4 = 4$.
Given $\{d_2, d_4\} = \{2, 4\}$ and $d_4=4$, we must have $d_2=2$.

The sequence is now $d_1, 2, d_3, 4, 1, d_6, d_7, d_8, d_9$.

Step 3: Use the sum of the first 5 digits to find $d_1$ and $d_3$.
$d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5 = 19$
$d_1 + 2 + d_3 + 4 + 1 = 19$
$d_1 + d_3 + 7 = 19$
$d_1 + d_3 = 12$.

The digits used so far are $d_2=2, d_4=4, d_5=1$. So $\{1, 2, 4\}$ are used.
The remaining digits available for $d_1, d_3, d_6, d_7, d_8, d_9$ are $\{3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
$d_1$ and $d_3$ must be two distinct digits from this set that sum to 12.
Possible pairs for $(d_1, d_3)$ from $\{3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$:
- (3, 9)
- (5, 7)
- (7, 5)
- (9, 3)
Other pairs like (6,6) are not possible as digits must be distinct.

Step 4: Apply non-consecutive rules to the first part of the sequence ($d_1, 2, d_3, 4, 1$).
$|d_1 - d_2| \neq 1 \implies |d_1 - 2| \neq 1 \implies d_1 \neq 1, 3$. Since $d_5=1$, $d_1 \neq 1$ is already known. So $d_1 \neq 3$.
$|d_2 - d_3| \neq 1 \implies |2 - d_3| \neq 1 \implies d_3 \neq 1, 3$. Since $d_5=1$, $d_3 \neq 1$ is already known. So $d_3 \neq 3$.
$|d_3 - d_4| \neq 1 \implies |d_3 - 4| \neq 1 \implies d_3 \neq 3, 5$.
$|d_4 - d_5| \neq 1 \implies |4 - 1| = 3 \neq 1$. This is already satisfied.

Since A and H agree with each other while E and F are against them, exactly two of these four must be true.
Therefore, neither C nor G guessed correctly. Since G guessed that C is not first, C must be first.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $P_X$ denote the proposition that person X got first place. Since only one person can get first place, exactly one of $P_A, P_B, \ldots, P_H$ is true.
Let $S_X$ be the statement made by person X.
$S_A$: $P_F \lor P_H$
$S_B$: $P_B$
$S_C$: $P_G$
$S_D$: $\neg P_B$
$S_E$: $\neg S_A$, which is $\neg (P_F \lor P_H)$, equivalent to $\neg P_F \land \neg P_H$.
$S_F$: $\neg P_F \land \neg P_H$. This is the same statement as $S_E$.
$S_G$: $\neg P_C$
$S_H$: $S_A$, which is $P_F \lor P_H$. This is the same statement as $S_A$.

Let $T_X$ be the truth value of statement $S_X$.
$T_A \iff P_F \lor P_H$

$T_F \iff \neg P_F \land \neg P_H$
$T_G \iff \neg P_C$
$T_H \iff P_F \lor P_H$

We are given that exactly three of these statements are true.
From the statements, we observe some relationships:
$S_A$ and $S_H$ are the same statement ($S_A \equiv S_H$), so $T_A = T_H$.
$S_E$ and $S_F$ are the same statement ($S_E \equiv S_F$), so $T_E = T_F$.
$S_E$ is the negation of $S_A$ ($S_E \equiv \neg S_A$), so $T_E = \neg T_A$.
Similarly, $T_F = \neg T_A$, $T_E = \neg T_H$, $T_F = \neg T_H$.

These relationships imply that $T_A, T_H$ have the same truth value, and $T_E, T_F$ have the same truth value, and these two pairs have opposite truth values.
So, either ($T_A=T_H$=True and $T_E=T_F$=False) or ($T_A=T_H$=False and $T_E=T_F$=True).

Let's analyze these two cases for the truth values of $S_A, S_E, S_F, S_H$.

Case 1: $S_A, S_H$ are true, and $S_E, S_F$ are false.
This means $P_F \lor P_H$ is true (winner is F or H), and $\neg P_F \land \neg P_H$ is false (consistent).
In this case, we have two true statements accounted for ($S_A$ and $S_H$). Since exactly three statements must be true, exactly one more statement from the remaining ones ($S_B, S_C, S_D, S_G$) must be true.

Let's assume the winner is F ($P_F$ is true).
$T_A \iff P_F \lor P_H \iff \text{true} \lor \text{false} \iff \text{true}$. ($T_A$ is true)
$T_B \iff P_B \iff \text{false}$. ($T_B$ is false)
$T_C \iff P_G \iff \text{false}$. ($T_C$ is false)
$T_D \iff \neg P_B \iff \neg \text{false} \iff \text{true}$. ($T_D$ is true)
$T_E \iff \neg P_F \land \neg P_H \iff \neg \text{true} \land \neg \text{false} \iff \text{false} \land \text{true} \iff \text{false}$. ($T_E$ is false)
$T_F \iff \neg P_F \land \neg P_H \iff \text{false}$. ($T_F$ is false)
$T_G \iff \neg P_C \iff \neg \text{false} \iff \text{true}$. ($T_G$ is true)
$T_H \iff P_F \lor P_H \iff \text{true}$. ($T_H$ is true)
If F is first, the true statements are $S_A, S_D, S_G, S_H$. There are 4 true statements. This contradicts the condition that exactly three are true. So F is not first.

Let's assume the winner is H ($P_H$ is true).
$T_A \iff P_F \lor P_H \iff \text{false} \lor \text{true} \iff \text{true}$. ($T_A$ is true)
$T_B \iff P_B \iff \text{false}$. ($T_B$ is false)
$T_C \iff P_G \iff \text{false}$. ($T_C$ is false)
$T_D \iff \neg P_B \iff \neg \text{false} \iff \text{true}$. ($T_D$ is true)
$T_E \iff \neg P_F \land \neg P_H \iff \neg \text{false} \land \neg \text{true} \iff \text{true} \land \text{false} \iff \text{false}$. ($T_E$ is false)
$T_F \iff \neg P_F \land \neg P_H \iff \text{false}$. ($T_F$ is false)
$T_G \iff \neg P_C \iff \neg \text{false} \iff \text{true}$. ($T_G$ is true)
$T_H \iff P_F \lor P_H \iff \text{true}$. ($T_H$ is true)
If H is first, the true statements are $S_A, S_D, S_G, S_H$. There are 4 true statements. This contradicts the condition. So H is not first.

249,"Question: Serena has received a box of chocolates as a birthday present. The box contains 12 chocolates of different shapes (one is hemispherical) and flavours (four of which are: dark chocolate, white chocolate-hazelnut, tiramisu and milk chocolate-cherry). The 12 chocolates are divided into three rows of 4 chocolate per line. With the help of the clues and the drawing, can you figure out the shape, the flavour and the position in the box of each chocolate?
1. The following four chocolates are in the same row (but not necessarily in this
order): the flower-shaped chocolate (which isn't gianduia flavour), the dark
chocolate-orange chocolate (which isn't pentagonal-shaped), the chocolate just below the white chocolate and the heart-shaped milk chocolate-cognac flavoured chocolate.
2. Every row contains only one chocolate made from dark chocolate and only one
from milk chocolate and they aren't next to each other.
3. The cremino flavoured chocolate is just to the left of the heart-shaped chocolate and just above the trapezoid-shaped one.
4. The hexagonal-shaped chocolate is just below the dark chocolate-orange one and is in the same row as the dark chocolate-hazelnut one but further to the right.
5. Both the caramel chocolate and the square-shaped chocolate (which isn't made from dark chocolate) are in the central part of the box but neither in the same row nor one below the other.
6. The round chocolate (which isn't dark chocolate-orange flavour) is further to the left than the pentagonal-shaped chocolate (which isn't #4) but further to the right than the gianduia flavoured one. These three chocolates are in different rows.
7. Chocolate #5 isn't the cremino flavoured chocolate. The two white-chocolate chocolates are in the first two rows. The rectangular-shaped chocolate is next to the oval-shaped milk chocolate. Chocolate #9 isn't rhombus-shaped. The triangularshaped
