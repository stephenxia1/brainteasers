0,"Question: It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

1,"Question: The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'
""If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.""
*note - the only difference from Scenario B, the original position of the 2 switches are known.
 Hint: Assuming that:
A) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.
B) There is no restriction on the number of time each prisoner can visit the switch room
C) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.","Assuming that:

C) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.","1.        Appoint a ""scorekeeper"" and the other 22 prisoners as ""transmitters"".
2.        When a transmitter enter the switch room for the first time, he will flick switch B ON if he sees it in the OFF position.  Alternatively, he will flick switch A if he sees switch B is in the ON position and waits for his next visit.  The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.
3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.  When he sees switch B is already OFF, he flicks switch A instead and does not add to the score.  As soon as he accumulates 22, he reports to the Warden.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 1.  Agree on two special roles
• Exactly one prisoner is elected the Leader.  
• The other 22 prisoners are called the Non-leaders.

Step 2.  Agree on the function of the switches
• Switch A (the left-hand one, say) will be the “signal/ counter” switch.  
• Switch B will be the “waste” switch that is used only to satisfy the rule that a prisoner must always move some switch.

Both switches start in the OFF position and everybody knows this.

Step 3.  What every Non-leader does when he is taken to the switch room
a) If he has never before turned switch A on, and switch A is OFF now, he flips switch A to ON. (That is his one and only personal “I’ve been here” signal for the Leader.)  
b) In every other circumstance he ignores switch A and instead flips switch B (from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON, whichever it is at the moment).  
Thus each Non-leader turns switch A on exactly once in his lifetime; afterwards he only toggles B.

Step 4.  What the Leader does when he is taken to the switch room
• If switch A is ON, he flips it back to OFF and increases his private count by 1.  
• If switch A is OFF, he flips switch B instead.  
(Remember: the Leader is the only person who ever turns A off.)

Step 5.  Finishing condition
When the Leader’s private count reaches 22 he knows that every one of the 22 Non-leaders has already visited the switch room at least once, so he announces:
“We have all visited the switch room.”

Why the strategy is correct

1.  Each Non-leader is able to send exactly one unmistakable signal (turning A from OFF to ON) no matter how often or in what order the warden selects prisoners, because every prisoner remembers whether he has already sent his signal.

2.  Only Non-leaders ever turn A on, and only the Leader ever turns it off, so each time the Leader finds A = ON he is certain that it represents a brand-new Non-leader visit.

3.  There are exactly 22 Non-leaders, so after the Leader has seen A on and turned it off 22 times he knows with certainty that all Non-leaders have appeared at least once. (He himself has obviously appeared too, or he could not have done the counting.)

4.  Because the warden is assumed to be fair in the long run (hint C), every prisoner will eventually be taken to the switch room infinitely often, so the Leader’s count will eventually reach 22 and the announcement will be made. No incorrect announcement can ever occur, because the Leader cannot reach 22 until each distinct Non-leader has supplied exactly one signal.

Hence the prisoners will invariably succeed and be released.

Final answer:  Designate one prisoner as Leader, use switch A as the single-visit signal and switch B as a harmless “waste” switch.  Non-leaders turn A on once (otherwise toggle B); the Leader turns A off and counts.  When the Leader has turned A off 22 times he declares that everyone has visited, guaranteeing freedom.",True,1,0,0

The letters must all be different digits and A ≠ 0 (no leading zero).

Step 1 – try D = G·4 (rule 4).  
Because 4·3 = 12 is two-digit, the only possibilities are  
 G = 1  →  D = 4 or G = 2  →  D = 8.

•  G = 1 forces F = 0 (rule 7), and then rule 6 makes A = 4, duplicating D, so G = 1 is impossible.  
•  Therefore G = 2 and D = 8.

Step 2 – use rule 7 with G = 2.  
Either G = F + 1 (so F = 1) or G = I – 3 (so I = 5).  
Take G = F + 1, hence F = 1.

Step 3 – rule 6 with F = 1.  
F cannot be 2·B (that would need B = 0.5), so F = A – 4 ⇒ A = 5.

Step 4 – rule 1 with A = 5, G = 2.  
5 ≠ B/3, but 5 = 2 + 3, so rule 1 is satisfied with A = G + 3.

Step 5 – rule 8.  
Because A is odd, A/2 is not integral, so H = C·3.

Step 6 – rule 3 with F = 1.  
C = F·3 = 3, and then H = 3·3 = 9.

Step 7 – rule 10 with H = 9, C = 3.  
Choose J = H – 2 = 7.

Step 8 – rules 4 and 5 give D = 8 and E.  
E cannot equal D/4 (=2) because 2 is already G, so use E = J – 1 = 6.

Step 9 – rule 2 with E = 6.  
B = E + 4 is impossible (10), so take B = I – 4.

Step 10 – rule 9.  
H + 3 = 12 (>9), so choose I = D / 2 = 4.  
Then B = I – 4 = 0.

All ten digits are now fixed:

A = 5 B = 0 C = 3 D = 8 E = 6  
F = 1 G = 2 H = 9 I = 4 J = 7.

Step 11 – verify each rule (at least one option true).  
1) 5 = 2 + 3 ✔  2) 0 = 4 – 4 ✔  
3) 3 = 1·3 ✔  4) 8 = 2·4 ✔  
5) 6 = 7 – 1 ✔  6) 1 = 5 – 4 ✔  
7) 2 = 1 + 1 ✔  8) 9 = 3·3 ✔  
9) 4 = 8 / 2 ✔  10) 7 = 9 – 2 ✔

All conditions are satisfied and every digit 0–9 appears exactly once.

4,"Question: Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?
 Hint: It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Place 1000 equally–spaced points on a circle and label them 0,1,2,…,999 counter-clockwise.  
Choose a fixed step k (1≤k≤999) and draw straight segments

0→k→2k→3k→⋯   (indices taken mod 1000)

until you return to 0.  
The figure obtained is the regular star polygon {1000/k}.  
When does it satisfy the conditions in the question?

1. The drawing must be one continuous closed line that visits every vertex exactly once before returning to the start.  
   This happens iff k is coprime to 1000, i.e. gcd(k,1000)=1.  
   (Otherwise you come back to 0 too early and the picture splits into several smaller polygons.)

2. The picture must actually be a “star”, i.e. we must skip at least one point each time.  
   Therefore k≠1 and k≠999 (k=999 is the same as k=–1 which also gives the ordinary 1000-gon).

3. The star drawn with step k is identical (just traced the opposite way) to the one drawn with step 1000−k.  
   Hence we should count k and 1000−k only once.

Consequently

number of different 1000-point stars  
= ½ · (number of k with 1<k<999 and gcd(k,1000)=1).

The count of integers 1≤k≤999 that are coprime to 1000 is Euler’s totient

φ(1000)=1000·(1−1/2)·(1−1/5)=1000·½·4/5=400.

Remove k=1 and k=999, leaving 400−2=398 permissible step sizes.  
Dividing by 2 to identify mirror images gives

398 / 2 = 199.

Final answer: 199",True,1,0,0
5,"Question: I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?
 Hint: The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):
X X Q X A
X X X H X
At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):
K J Q T A
X D X H X
Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

6,"Question: Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.
After dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.
In this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.
Can you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?
Players: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon
Races: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre
Occupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief
Weapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace
Monsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs
Skill levels: range from 10-32
Clues:
1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.
2. The paladin isn't an elf.
3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.
4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.
5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.
6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.
7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).
8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.
9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.
10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.
11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.
 Hint: Start by determining the 5 skill levels.",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,"Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0
7,"Question: Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?
 Hint: Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0
8,"Question: Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.

Humpback is 21st. (2)

Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)
First day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.
15th then is Bottle.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).
Mouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.
Dolly is 14th or 15th.
Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)
Mayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.
Stonefly is 15th.
Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.
At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)
Stonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.
Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)
Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.

11,"Question: Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?
 Hint: Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ",Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.
Summary:
Tomatoes, Five, 27th, North
Peppers, Three, 28th, South
Radishes, Four, 25th, East
Lettuce, one, 29th, West
Broccoli, two, 30th, Northwest",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

1) Per clue 5, eliminate the appropriate numbers in Column G.  Of the remaining numbers, at least one with a tens digit of 5 will have to be used.  Per clues 1 and 11, only one number can have the numeral 5, so that number must be at G1.  Eliminate all numbers that contain a 5 from all other locations.
2) Per clue 6, eliminate all even numbers from Column O.
3) Per clue 1, eliminate any number from Row 1 with only one digit or duplicate digits.  By analyzing combinations of numbers, the following can be determined: B1 contains a 1, delete 30, I1 contains a 2, delete 23, delete 63 and 73, O1 contains a 6.  In conjunction with clue 3, delete 29 and 59.
4) Per clue 10, analyze the various possible sums of Columns G and O.  The only common prime factor is 31.  Each column must sum to a multiple of 31 (based on available numbers: B to 31, I to 124, N to 155, G to 248, and O to 341).  G1 must be 58.

Brute force methods can be used to arrive at a solution.  However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.  Continue eliminating possibilities in the order shown below.

For every rule we note which two digits each letter may assume, depending on the inequality that precedes it:

D : 1 or 2 | 4 or 9        (according as B > C or not)  
E : 6 or 9 | 3 or 5        (according as C > D or not)  
F : 2 or 4 | 1 or 6        (according as D > E or not)

B : 0 or 9 | 2 or 3        (according as J > A or not)

Observing that G can never exceed 7, we see that if H were 8 or 9 then G could not exceed H, forcing I = 6 or 7.  
That choice makes H > I, whence J = 3 or 8.  
Trying all possibilities with H high quickly produces contradictions (duplicate digits or no value left for some letter), so H cannot be 8 or 9.  
Therefore F > G and hence H must be 1 or 4.

Take first H = 1 and note two possibilities for G:

• If G ≠ 0 then G > H, so I = 0 or 8.  
 Choosing I = 0 gives H > I and hence J = 3 or 8.  
 Let J = 3 (the 8 is still unused) so that I < J and therefore A = 4 or 8.  
 With A = 4 we soon run out of digits for E, so take A = 8.  
 Then J < A, forcing B = 2.  
 Now A > B so C = 5 or 7; with B = 2, rule 2 gives D = 4 or 9.  
 Trying C = 7, D = 4 works and steers the remaining choices uniquely:

 C = 7 ⇒ E = 9 ⇒ F = 6 ⇒ G = 5 (the only unused choice each time).

All ten rules are now satisfied and every digit 0–9 is used once:

A = 8 B = 2 C = 7 D = 4 E = 9 F = 6 G = 5 H = 1 I = 0 J = 3

(Checking: 8>2 ⇒ C∈{5,7}(7); 2↛>7 ⇒ D∈{4,9}(4); 7>4 ⇒ E∈{6,9}(9);  
4↛>9 ⇒ F∈{1,6}(6); 9>6 ⇒ G∈{5,6}(5); 6>5 ⇒ H∈{1,4}(1);

1.  Lay out the five houses in order from the left-hand end, and label the positions 1–5.

2.  From statements 8 and 9 we already know  
   • House 1 : Norwegian lives here.  
   • House 3 : milk is drunk here.

3.  From statement 14 the Norwegian lives next to the blue house, so  
   • House 2 is the blue house.

4.  The only colour relation given is statement 4: the green house is immediately to the left of the white house.  
   Because House 2 is blue, the pair (green, white) cannot be (1, 2) or (2, 3).  
   If they were (3, 4) the green house (3) would have to contain coffee (statement 5) but house 3 already contains milk, so impossible.  
   Therefore they must be (4, 5):  
   • House 4 is green, House 5 is white, and the owner of the green house (House 4) drinks coffee (statement 5).

5.  The colours still unused are red and yellow.  
   The Norwegian already occupies house 1, so house 1 cannot be red (because the Brit lives in the red house, statement 1).  
   Hence  
   • House 1 is yellow → its owner smokes Dunhill (statement 7).  
   • House 3 is red → the Brit lives in House 3 (statement 1).

6.  From statement 11 the horse is next to the Dunhill smoker.  
   Dunhill is in House 1, therefore  
   • The horse is kept in House 2.

8.  Consider the rule about “Blends” (statements 10 and 15).  
   An edge house (1 or 5) has only one neighbour, so it cannot satisfy “next to a cat-keeper” and “next to water-drinker” unless that single neighbour did both things simultaneously, which later turns out to be impossible.  
   Thus the Blends smoker is in house 2, 3 or 4.

9.  Try house 2 = Blends.  
   • Then a neighbour (house 1 or 3) must keep cats and a neighbour must drink water.  
   • The only candidate for water among those two is house 1 (house 3 already has milk), so  
      – House 1 drinks water  
      – House 1 therefore must keep cats (to satisfy the other part of the Blends condition).

10.  Drinks still unassigned are tea and beer (coffee and milk already placed, water just assigned).  
    Statement 3 says the Dane drinks tea, so tea cannot be house 1 (Norwegian) and must be in house 2 or 5.

11.  Cigars left to place besides Dunhill (house 1) and Blends (house 2) are Pall Mall, Prince and Bluemasters.  
    Statement 13 puts Prince with the German; hence the German will be in house 4 or 5 (house 2 is already Blends).  
    Statement 12 ties Bluemasters with beer.

12.  Put Prince in the green house, house 4 (try the more constrained place first).  Then  
    • House 4 nationality = German (statement 13)  
    • House 4 already drinks coffee – no conflict.

13.  Put Bluemasters in the remaining empty house, house 5.  Then  
    • House 5 drinks beer (statement 12).

14.  The only cigar now unassigned is Pall Mall, so it belongs to house 3; consequently  
    • House 3 keeps birds (statement 6).

15.  We can now finish the drinks: the only house without a drink is house 2, so it gets tea, making  
    • House 2 nationality = Dane (statement 3).

16.  Only one nationality remains unused (Swede) and only one house (5) has no nationality, hence  
    • House 5 = Swede → pet dogs (statement 2).

17.  Check the pets list:  
    House 1 cats, House 2 horse, House 3 birds, House 5 dogs; the only animal unassigned is fish, so  
    • House 4 keeps the fish.

Everything satisfies all fifteen statements, so the completed table is

   House | Colour | Nationality | Drink | Cigar      | Pet
   ------|--------|-------------|-------|------------|------
     1   | yellow | Norwegian   | water | Dunhill    | cats
     2   | blue   | Dane        | tea   | Blends     | horse
     3   | red    | Brit        | milk  | Pall Mall  | birds
     4   | green  | German      | coffee| Prince     | fish
     5   | white  | Swede       | beer  | Bluemasters| dogs

Hence the answer to “Who owns the fish?” is unequivocally:

16,"Question: The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.
 Hint: In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.
The last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.
The last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.","From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).
In summary:
Bart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Jason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.
Roger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.
((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds
((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds
((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds
Of the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.

15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let

20,"Question: The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.
The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?
 Hint: Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.

22,"Question: The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.
 Hint: 1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%.

Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words ""white"" and ""black"": The answer ""black"" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer ""white"" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.
Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 0 –  agreement the night before  
• Number the people from the rear of the line forward.  
 Person 10 is the first who will be asked, and he alone sees all nine hats in front of him.  
 Person 9 sees eight hats, … , person 1 sees none.  

• Agree on one bit-convention:  
 “BLACK’’ = “the number of black hats I (the speaker) can see is EVEN’’  
 “WHITE’’ = “the number of black hats I (the speaker) can see is ODD’’.  

Nothing else may be conveyed – the words are spoken in a flat voice exactly once.

Step 1 – person 10 speaks  
He counts the black hats on persons 1–9.  
 If that count is even he says “black’’;  
 if it is odd he says “white’’.  
He has a 50 % chance of matching his own hat and surviving, but that single word fixes for everybody else the parity of black hats among persons 1–9.

Step 2 – person 9 deduces his colour  
Person 9 knows  
 (a) the parity announced by person 10;  
 (b) the colours of persons 1–8.  
Let k = “number of black hats I see in front of me’’ (among 1–8).

• If parity(k) equals the announced parity, then his own hat must be WHITE (adding a white hat leaves the parity unchanged).  
• If parity(k) is different from the announced parity, then his own hat must be BLACK (adding a black hat flips the parity to the announced value).

He therefore names the correct colour with certainty and survives.

Step 3 – persons 8, 7, …, 1 repeat the same reasoning  
After person 9 speaks, everybody hears whether he survived; consequently everybody now also knows the exact colour of person 9.  
Person 8 again counts the black hats in front (persons 1–7) and compares that parity with the original parity announced by person 10; the same rule lets him deduce his own colour with certainty.  
Continue in the same way down the line.  Each of persons 8, 7, …, 1 is always 100 % sure of his hat colour and therefore survives.

Guarantee obtained  
• Persons 9 through 1 (nine people) survive with certainty.  
• Person 10 survives with probability ½.  

Hence the strategy guarantees that at least 9 of the 10 inhabitants (90 %) live, and no strategy can do better: the first speaker has no information about his own hat beyond a 50 –50 guess because he cannot see it and has heard nothing yet.

Final answer:  Everyone agrees that the rear person says “black’’ for an even number of black hats in front and “white’’ for an odd number.  That single parity bit lets every later speaker compute his own hat colour with certainty, so exactly one life is at risk and a minimum of 90 % of the islanders are saved, which is optimal.",True,1,0,0

""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!

Number the ten time points from 0 to 11 (6:00 to 7:50).  The only ways to arrange them to get ten different intervals for the births are events at points 0, 1, 4, 9, and 11 and the reverse: 11, 10, 7, 2, and 0.

She's a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY;
BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie,

Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.
The Derby is for three year old horses. Therefore only a current four year old horse could have lost last year.
SNOWY is the only horse which could have been three last year (four this year).
The farm is preparing three of the seven horses for this years Derby. There must therefore be at least three 3-year old horses among the seven. BILLY is 3-years old. Necessarily, BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY must be 3 years old both. (They are of the same age).
Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year. This would mean that no horse would be four years old as BEAUTY and LUCKY would be one and a half years old. BEAUTY's mom won in the DERBY as a three year old, she could not win and lose at the same time. (The riddle suggests that the farm did not win last year so the mom must be over 5 years old).
In sum, if BILLY, BEAUTY, and LUCKY are three years old, their aunt must be six. BEAUTY's mom must be five or more. The oldest black must be older than the black mom. Only SNOWY could be four this year.
SNOWY is white (given), 4 years as deduced, and male from the fact that it was a stallion which lost last year.

For the product of two numbers to be a prime number (clue #5), one of those two numbers must be 1.  Therefore, either C or H must be 1.
To achieve the required proportion (clue #6), the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations:  931 or 421 or 842.
If [AGC] = 842, then D would have to be 1 (clue #1).  Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.
If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.  Therefore, A = 4 and G = 2.
Since G = 2, then J = 8 (clue #2).  J can not be 1 or 4, since those two numerals are now assigned.
The only remaining letters that can be assigned to 6 are B and I.  D can not be 6, as it would not produce a square number (clue #1).  Neither E nor F can be 6, since that would not produce an odd number (clue #4). H can not be 6, as it would not produce a prime number (clue #5).  Since either B or I must be 6, then 6 must be paired with 0 (clue #3), as the other even numerals have now been assigned.
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then D = 5 (clue #1).
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then E and H must also be separated by 6 (clue #7).  The only remaining numerals that satisfy this requirement are 3 and 9.  This means that F = 7.  This sets H = 3 and  E = 9, which then sets B = 6 and I = 0.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

A B C D E F G H I J  

be a permutation of the ten different digits 0–9 that satisfies the seven conditions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  From A / G = G / C  ⇒  A · C = G²
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Because A,C,G are single digits, list the digits whose square can be
written as a product of two different digits:

 G  G²  factor-pairs (different digits)
 2  4  1·4 , 4·1  
 3  9  1·9 , 9·1  
 4  16  2·8 , 8·2  
 6  36  4·9 , 9·4  

Hence the only possible triples (A,C,G) are

(4,1,2) , (1,9,3) , (2,8,4) , (8,2,4) , (4,9,6) , (9,4,6).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  C · H is a prime number
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A product of two digits is prime only if one of the digits is 1 and the
other is 2,3,5, or 7.  
Thus C = 1 (or H = 1).  
Looking at the list above, C = 1 occurs only in

(4,1,2) or (9,1,3).

So we have exactly two possibilities:

Option A : (A,C,G) = (4,1,2)  
Option B : (A,C,G) = (9,1,3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Deal with G + J = triangular number
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Triangular numbers ≤ 17 are 1,3,6,10,15.

•  Option A (G=2): 2+J ∈ {3,6,10,15} ⇒ J ∈ {1,4,8,13}.  
 Digits must be distinct, hence J = 8.

•  Option B (G=3): 3+J ∈ {3,6,10,15} ⇒ J ∈ {0,3,7,12}.  
 J ≠ 3 (already used) and 12 is impossible, so J = 0 or 7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  A + D is a square
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Squares ≤ 17 are 1,4,9,16.

•  Option A (A=4): 4+D = 9 or 16  ⇒  D = 5 or 12.  
 D = 12 impossible, so D = 5.

•  Option B (A=9): 9+D = 16  ⇒  D = 7.

But in Option B we already had the possibility J = 7, which would
repeat a digit.  If we choose J = 0 then 0 is still unused but we now
have digits 0,1,3,7,9 already taken and every remaining digit is even,
contradicting condition 4 (E·F odd).  
Therefore Option B is impossible.

So only Option A survives, with

A = 4, C = 1, G = 2, J = 8, D = 5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Fix H from C·H prime
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Since C = 1, H must be one of 2,3,5,7 but H ≠ 2 (G already 2) and H ≠ 5
(D already 5).  Hence  H ∈ {3,7}.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Use the parity and sum conditions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Digits used so far: 4,1,2,5,8 and H (3 or 7).  
Digits left: {0,3,6,7,9} or {0,6,9,?} depending on H.

Condition 4:  E·F is odd ⇒ E and F are both odd.  
Condition 3:  B+I is even.  
Condition 7:  E+I = B+H.

Try H = 3
----------
Remaining digits: 0,6,7,9.  
Only two odd digits left are 7 and 9, so {E,F} = {7,9}.

Put (E,F) = (9,7).  The even digits are 0 and 6; take (B,I) = (6,0).

Check  E+I = 9+0 = 9  
        B+H = 6+3 = 9  ✔

All other requirements are still satisfied.

Try H = 7
----------
Then the remaining digits are 0,3,6,9 with odd set {3,9}.  
A check shows no assignment of the left-over digits satisfies
E+I = B+H.  Thus H = 7 is impossible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  The unique solution
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A  = 4  
B  = 6  
C  = 1  
D  = 5  
E  = 9  
F  = 7  
G  = 2  
H  = 3  
I  = 0  
J  = 8  

Verify every condition:

1) A+D = 4+5 = 9  (square)  
2) G+J = 2+8 = 10 (triangular)  
3) B+I = 6+0 = 6  (even)  
4) E·F = 9·7 = 63 (odd)  
5) C·H = 1·3 = 3  (prime)  
6) A/G = 4/2 = 2  and  G/C = 2/1 = 2  
7) E+I = 9+0 = 9  and  B+H = 6+3 = 9

All seven clues are satisfied and every digit 0–9 is used exactly once.

While eating a mango the other day, I started thinking about the ABC's. Then I remembered the set of 5-sided alphabet pyramids I had as a child.
Here are some 5-letter words that can be spelled with just 5 of my pyramids:
BELOW
CANDY
FORTY
HELIX
JABOT
LEMON
LIGHT
MANGO
OCHRE
PEACH
QUEST
QUICK
VIEUX
Using these words, can you figure out which letters appear on each pyramid?
 Hint: Start with MANGO and LEMON; because they share three letters, you can start off with a pretty strong reduction and only have to consider how the other two pairs must be arranged","Start with MANGO and LEMON; because they share three letters, you can start off with a pretty strong reduction and only have to consider how the other two pairs must be arranged","Let's start with the word MANGO, and assign a number to each pyramid.
1: M
2: A
3: N
4: G
5: O
The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.
1: M, C, T
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D, I
The J and B of JABOT must be on pyramids 3 and 4, but the B cannot be with the E, or else one cannot spell BELOW. Also, the W must be on pyramid 1.
1: M, C, T, W
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F, B
4: G, E, Y, J
5: O, P, D, I
The X in HELIX must be on pyramid 1, so we now have all the letters on that pyramid. There is only one letter left on pyramid 3, and it must be in VIEUX, QUEST and QUICK, so it must be the U. The V from VIEUX must therefore be on pyramid 2.
The Q cannot be on the same pyramid as the I, in order to spell QUICK, so it is also on pyramid 2. The S cannot be on the same pyramid as the E (QUEST), so is therefore on pyramid 5, and the K is the last letter on pyramid 4.
1: M, C, T, W, X
2: A, L, R, V, Q
3: N, H, F, B, U
4: G, E, Y, J, K
5: O, P, D, I, S",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"We have five identical 5-sided “alphabet pyramids”.  
A 5-letter word can be shown only if every one of its letters is taken from a different pyramid, i.e. each word must use all five pyramids exactly once.  
Since the 13 given words together use 25 different letters (all the alphabet except Z), every letter must occur exactly once on exactly one pyramid.  
So the task is to colour the 25 letters with five colours (the five pyramids) so that every word contains the five colours once each.

Step-by-step deduction

1.  Start with the two hint words MANGO and LEMON.  Give M, A, N, G, O the provisional colours  
   M=1, A=2, N=3, G=4, O=5.  
   Because LEMON must use the same five colours once each, the shared letters M,N,O keep their colours and the remaining letters force  
   L and E to take colours 2 and 4.  LIGHT contains both L and G, so they cannot share the same colour → L=2, therefore E=4.

2.  Examine other overlaps word by word, forbidding a letter from taking a colour already used in that word, and intersect the possibilities.

   • BELOW forces C or W to be colour 1 or 3;  
     CANDY ­vs OCHRE pins C to colour 1.  
   • OCHRE then fixes H=3 and R=2.  
   • In CANDY the remaining letters make D,Y the colours 4,5; but FORTY forbids Y=5 so Y=4 and D=5; hence F=3.  
   • LIGHT now fixes I=5 and therefore T (the last colour missing in that word)=1.  
   • BELOW now gives B,W the colours 3,1 respectively; JABOT forbids B=1, so B=3, W=1 and J=4.  
   (At this point every pyramid already has four letters.)

3.  Only the six letters P,Q,U,K,S,V are still uncoloured.  
   PEACH enforces P=5 (it is the only colour still missing in that word).  
   QUICK shows that {Q,U,K} are colours {2,3,4}.  QUEST shows that {Q,U,S} are colours {2,3,5}.  
   Therefore K must be the sole remaining colour 4 on its pyramid, S has to be colour 5, and Q,U are the colours 2 and 3.  
   VIEUX places V and U on the two yet-unused colours 2 and 3, but different from each other.

4.  Counting letters now gives the unique completion:
   colour 2 still needs two letters, colour 3 still needs one, so choose  
      Q=2, U=3, V=2.

The five fully-determined pyramids

Pyramid 1 :  M  C  T  X  W  
Pyramid 2 :  A  L  R  Q  V  
Pyramid 3 :  N  H  F  B  U  
Pyramid 4 :  G  E  Y  J  K  
Pyramid 5 :  O  I  D  P  S  

Each of the 13 words indeed takes one letter from each pyramid, and every pyramid now shows exactly five letters.

Final answer:  
Pyramid 1 = {M, C, T, X, W}  
Pyramid 2 = {A, L, R, Q, V}  
Pyramid 3 = {N, H, F, B, U}  
Pyramid 4 = {G, E, Y, J, K}

27,"Question: You roll five dice. The computer calculates the score. Your job is to find out what the computer based the score on.
If you roll 5, 4, 6, 3, and 5, the score is 10.
If you roll 1, 3, 3, 4, and 2, the score is 4.
If you roll 1, 6, 2, 6, and 4,the score is 0.
What is the method?
 Hint: Think of the title. The score is never odd. Picture the dice in your head.",Think of the title. The score is never odd. Picture the dice in your head.,"Only the dice that have a centre dot are counted (3 and five). Count the number of dots around the centre dot. These ""petals"" are the score. A five on the die gets a score of 4, and a three on the die gets a score of 2.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Look at the faces of ordinary dice.

• 1, 3 and 5 each have a single “lonely’’ centre pip.  
• 2, 4 and 6 have no such single pip; every pip they show is part of a symmetrical pair.

If you mentally “erase’’ the lonely centre pip on every odd-numbered face, every face that remains shows an even number of pips.  
The computer is simply counting those remaining pips.

Algebraically that is the same as:

Score = (sum of the odd numbers that were rolled) – (number of odd numbers that were rolled)

because, for each odd die, you subtract 1 (its centre pip) and then add what is left.

Check with the three throws.

1. 5  4  6  3  5  
   Odd numbers: 5, 3, 5 → 5+3+5 = 13  
   Number of odd dice = 3  
   Score = 13 – 3 = 10 ✔

2. 1  3  3  4  2  
   Odd numbers: 1, 3, 3 → 1+3+3 = 7  
   Number of odd dice = 3  
   Score = 7 – 3 = 4 ✔

3. 1  6  2  6  4  
   Odd numbers: 1 → 1  
   Number of odd dice = 1  
   Score = 1 – 1 = 0 ✔

Because you always remove a single pip from each odd face, the total you add up is necessarily even, so “the score is never odd’’ exactly as the hint says.

Final answer:  The computer adds together the odd faces that were rolled and then subtracts one for each of those odd faces (i.e. it removes the centre pip from every odd die and counts the pips that remain).",True,1,0,0
28,"Question: Carl, Draco, Emma, Ivy, June, & Xavior are playing a game with you in which you have to guess their roles in exactly 16 statements.
The roles are:
Normal - Has no abilities
Liar - Knows all roles & has to lie
Detective - Knows all roles
Switcher - Switches 2 roles after the first statement (cannot switch themselves)
Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)
Spy - Knows who was switched
The following 16 statements were made:
Carl is not Cupid - June
Ivy is the Liar - Carl
I know someone's role - Draco
I know the Switcher - Xavior
Ivy is not Normal - Emma
I wasn't switched - Ivy
Emma knows Draco's role - June
Xavior knows who was switched - Carl
Emma & I are not the Spy - Draco
Draco or June is Normal - Xavior
I don't know the Spy - Emma
I'm the Spy - Ivy
The Cupid wasn't switched - June
Xavior isn't Cupid - Carl
I don't know the Detective - Draco
I'm not the Spy - Xavior
Who is who?
*The Detective/Liar knows who was switched; if the Detective/Liar is switched then only the new Detective/Liar is updated
 Hint: Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest","Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest","Normal=Draco
Liar=Ivy
Detective=Xavior
Switcher=Emma
Cupid=June
Spy=Carl
Explanation:
Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar
Step 3: Emma is paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June
Step 4: Emma isn't the Cupid or Normal
""Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)""
Cupid can't pair themselves
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Emma can't be Normal
Step 5: Emma isn't the Detective or Spy:
""I don't know the Spy - Emma""
If Emma was the Detective or Spy, then Emma would know the Spy
This leaves Emma with Switcher
Step 6: June is Cupid & Draco is Paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
We had 2 possible scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
However, Emma isn't the detective; therefore Draco & Emma are paired by June the Cupid
Step 7: Draco = Normal
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
June is Cupid & Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Draco is Normal
Step 8: The final 3
""I'm not the Spy - Xavior""
This leaves the Detective.
""Xavior knows who was switched - Carl""
This is true, which means Ivy is the liar & Carl is the Spy.

A human brain, Earth, the incomplete phrase: 'Fair and ____,' the letters AZCONMUT and a cheese sandwich on plain white bread with the edges perfectly cut off.

The sleuth wasted no time and spared no effort in discovering and carefully examining the available clues.  He was able to identify four suspects with certainty that one of them was the culprit.
The four make the statements below.  In total, six statements are true and six false.
Suspect A:
1. C and I have met many times before today.
2. B is guilty.
3. The car thief did not know it was the Inspector's car.
Suspect B:

Facts supplied in the story  
•  The thief did not know he was stealing the Inspector’s car  ⇒  A3 is TRUE.  
Conditions  
•  Exactly six of the twelve statements are true.  
•  A1 and C1 contradict – exactly one of them is false.  
•  C3 and D2 contradict – exactly one of them is false.

Check each possible culprit.

1.  Suppose A is the thief.  
   A2 is then false, B1 true, B3 true, C2 true, D1 false, D3 true.  
   With A3 true we already have 5 true / 3 false.  
   Among A1,C1,C3,D2,B2 we would need 1 true and 3 false, but  
   B2 is forced false, leaving four statements that would have to supply  
   1 T and 2 F.  
   Because C3/D2 contribute 1 T 1 F and A1/C1 contribute 1 T 1 F, the count
   cannot be reached.  Hence A cannot be guilty.

2.  Suppose B is the thief.  
   Then        A2 (B guilty)  – true  
               B1 (D innocent)– true  
               B2 (“D3 false”; D3 will be false) – true  
               B3 (B innocent)– false  
               C2 (B not guilty)– false  
               D1 (“B1 false”) – false  
               D3 (“A did it”) – false  
   Together with A3 true we have 4 true / 4 false so far.  
   The four undecided statements are A1,C1 (contradict), C3,D2 (contradict).  
   Make A1 true, C1 false, C3 true, D2 false.  
   That adds 2 true and 2 false, giving totals 6 true / 6 false, exactly
   as required and respecting the “exactly one false” rule for each
   contradictory pair.  No condition is violated.

3.  Suppose C is the thief.  
   Counting truths and falsehoods with A3 true yields 5 true already before
   considering the two contradictory pairs.  Each pair contributes an equal
   number of truths and lies, so the final count can never be 6/6.  C
   cannot be guilty.

4.  Suppose D is the thief.  
   With A3 true the partial count is 5 true / 3 false.  To finish with 6/6
   we would need exactly 1 T and 3 F from the four statements in the two
   contradictory pairs, but each pair supplies at least one truth, so the
   needed distribution is impossible.  D cannot be guilty.

Only the assumption “B is guilty” satisfies every requirement
(6 true statements, 6 false statements, A3 true, and exactly one false
statement in each contradictory pair).

To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom. Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:

Since the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.
Now this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:
The CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth. Since he is not the Developer (12) he must be the Accountant. This leaves Thomas Fielder who is the Developer for Lantel.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0
33,"Question: Here's what you have:
-Two 8-liter jugs, filled with water
-One 3-liter jug, empty
-Four infinite size, empty pools
Here's what your objective is:
Fill each of the four pools with exactly 4 liters of water.
Here are your constraints:
-You have nothing else at your disposal.
-There is no other water aside from the two 8-liter water filled jugs.
-Once water is poured into any of the 4 pools it cannot be removed from there.
-The jugs are not symmetric so you cannot measure amount by eye or judge based on shape.
 Hint: I am not sure how to help you :). I solved this in 24 steps (you may have more or less). It helps to label the jugs and pools, and then draw. Oh, main key, try to work backwards, from filled pools, and see what final steps are even possible.","I am not sure how to help you :). I solved this in 24 steps (you may have more or less).

34,"Question: Patrice and seven of her friends organized the Ultimate Table Tennis Challenge to determine who the best Ping-Pong player among them was. The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.
1. The winner of the match at the Southville YMCA lost at least three games on the indoor table in Uncle Phil's basement before meeting McNeilly in the finals.
2. The first round opponent of the eventual champion was neither Fitzroy (who lost in the first round) nor the person who lost at the Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy.
3. The championship round took the maximum possible number of games in a match.
4. The seven matches, in some order, were: Jamie's first round victory, the match in which White won exactly 2 games, the match at Eastlake Municipal Park, the match that Lottie lost, the only match Diaz played, the match Toskhaya lost and the match in which somebody won exactly one game.
5. Bill never played Dave.
6. Averson didn't play Jamie in the first round.
7. A total of 55 games were played in the whole challenge, 30 of which were the first round matches.
8. McNeilly, who isn't Lottie or Kristin, never played Samuel or Gianelli.
9. The four who advanced to the second round were: White, Lottie, the person who played Regina in the first round and someone whose indoor match was at the Islip Town Hall.
10. McNeilly's opponent in the first round won more games than Diaz.
11. Kristin never played at the Southville YMCA.
12. Regina won more games than the person eliminated at Eastlake Municipal Park.
13. Kristin won more games than Bill, who won at least five.

The final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).
There were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.
This leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.
This means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).
From clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.
Islip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.
From clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).
White is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.
From clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.
From clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.
Since Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.
Lottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.
In the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.
From clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.
From clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.
Regina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.
Regina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.
Kristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.
Lottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.
Lottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).
Bills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

37,"Question: On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?
 Hint: What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?,"All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people. If we follow this pattern, we will eventually reach the answer of 100 people leaving the island after 100 days.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"We will reason exactly, step by step, building from the hint.

1.  What every islander can see and reason before the guru speaks  
   • Each islander sees 199 pairs of eyes.  
   • A blue-eyed person sees 99 blue and 100 brown.  
   • A brown-eyed person sees 100 blue and 99 brown.  
   • Nobody has any information about his own colour; each thinks any non-impossible combination might hold (including the possibilities that there are 0,1,2,…,199 blue-eyed people).

2.  What the guru’s public statement does  
   “I see a person with blue eyes.”  
   This tells every islander the following fact, and (crucially) makes it common knowledge:  
   Fact F :  “There exists at least one blue-eyed person on the island.”

   Before the statement each islander already individually knew F was true (everyone except a possibly blue-eyed observer can see at least one blue eye), but no islander could be sure that everyone else also knew F, nor that everyone knew that everyone knew F, etc.  The guru’s announcement creates an infinite chain of mutual knowledge of F, which drives the induction that follows.

3.  Base of the induction: exactly 1 blue-eyed inhabitant (call him B1)  
   • B1 sees 0 blue eyes.  
   • Guru says “I see a person with blue eyes.”  
   • B1 reasons: “If my eyes were not blue, the guru’s statement would be false, for I see none; therefore my eyes must be blue.”  
   • That night (night 1) B1 correctly declares “My eyes are blue” and departs.  
   • Observation: If there had been no departure on night 1, that would have proved the hypothesis “exactly one blue-eyed person” false.

4.  Induction step: assume the rule holds for n−1 blue-eyed people → they leave together on night n−1.  Show it holds for n blue-eyed people.  

   Situation with n blue-eyed people B1,…,Bn.  Fix B1’s viewpoint.  
   • B1 sees n−1 blue eyes.  
   • B1 reasons: “If my eyes were not blue, there would be only n−1 blue-eyed people, and by the induction hypothesis they would all leave on night n−1.”  
   • All the blue-eyed islanders make the identical deduction.  
   • Everyone (blue or brown) waits n−1 nights and watches the pier.  
   • If nobody leaves by the dawn of day n, every blue-eyed person now knows his previous assumption (‘I am brown, so there are only n−1 blue-eyed people’) is impossible; therefore his own eyes must be blue.  
   • Consequently every blue-eyed person can now state with certainty “My eyes are blue” on night n, and they all leave together.  
   • Brown-eyed people never gain new information about their own eyes and therefore never leave.

   This completes the induction: with n blue eyes, departures happen on night n.

5.  Apply the rule to the real island (n = 100).  
   • There are 100 blue-eyed islanders.  
   • Each blue-eyed islander sees 99 blues and 100 browns; each brown sees 100 blues and 99 browns.  
   • Every blue-eyed islander therefore follows the inductive chain above with n = 100.  
   • They wait 99 nights.  No one departs.  
   • At dawn of day 100 each of the 100 blue-eyed islanders becomes absolutely certain his own eyes are blue.  
   • On the 100th night all 100 blue-eyed islanders announce “My eyes are blue” to the ship’s captain and leave.  
   • The 100 brown-eyed islanders can never deduce their own colour (all scenarios they consider possible always include them as brown or blue), so they remain on the island forever.

Final answer: All 100 blue-eyed islanders leave together on the 100th night; the 100 brown-eyed islanders never leave.",True,1,0,0

If both of them break before you determine the answer then you have failed at your task. What is the order of floors that you should drop the balls from to minimize the number of droppings that you will have to make to determine the answer?
Assume that if a ball doesn't break you can reuse it without worrying about it being weakened.
 Hint: When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear. Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear. Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.  Here's how to do it:
First drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.
If the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.
If the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.
Keep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks. If it breaks on the xth dropping you will only need at most 14-x more droppings with the second ball to find the breaking point. By the 11th dropping of the first ball, if you get that far, you will have reached the 99th floor.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"When only one ball is left you have no choice but to make a linear search, floor-by-floor upward, because you must keep the last ball unbroken until you are sure of the answer.  
So if the first ball happens to break on the k-th throw you will still need at most (k–1) additional throws with the second ball.  
We want the total number of throws (first-ball throws + possible second-ball throws) never to exceed some number N, and we want N to be as small as possible.

Let the floors from which the first ball is thrown be

f1 , f2 , f3 , …  

Let the gaps between successive throws be

g1 = f1 ,  g2 = f2–f1 ,  g3 = f3–f2 , …

If the first ball breaks on the very first throw we will need g1–1 extra linear throws, so
1 + (g1–1) = g1 throws in all.  
If it breaks on the second throw we will already have used 2 throws; the second ball may now have to check at most g2–1 lower floors, so the total is
2 + (g2–1) = g1 + g2 – 1 .  
In general, if it breaks on the k-th throw the total number of throws needed is

g1 + g2 + ⋯ + gk .

To keep that total ≤ N for every k we therefore want

g1 + g2 + ⋯ + gk = N  (for every k) ,

which means the gaps must decrease by exactly one each time:

g1 = N ,  g2 = N–1 ,  g3 = N–2 , … ,  gN = 1 .

(The sum of the first k gaps is always N.)

Now we must choose the smallest N whose gap–sum is at least 100 floors:

N + (N–1) + (N–2) + … + 1 = N(N+1)/2 ≥ 100 .

Solving N(N+1)/2 ≥ 100 gives N = 14, because
13·14/2 = 91 < 100 ≤ 14·15/2 = 105.

Therefore the optimal strategy uses at most 14 throws in the worst case.

With N = 14 the gaps are 14, 13, 12, … , 2, 1.  
Starting at floor 14 and adding these gaps gives the testing schedule for the first ball:

Throw 1: 14  
Throw 2: 14+13 = 27  
Throw 3: 27+12 = 39  
Throw 4: 39+11 = 50  
Throw 5: 50+10 = 60  
Throw 6: 60+ 9 = 69  
Throw 7: 69+ 8 = 77  
Throw 8: 77+ 7 = 84  
Throw 9: 84+ 6 = 90  
Throw 10: 90+ 5 = 95  
Throw 11: 95+ 4 = 99  
Throw 12: 99+ 3 = 102 (only 100 floors exist, so just test floor 100 here)

How it works
• If the first ball breaks on the m-th throw, at most (14–m) further throws with the second ball are needed to finish the search, so the total never exceeds 14.  
• If the first ball never breaks until floor 99, two additional throws (floors 100 and possibly 101, but 101 does not exist) bring the total to 12 (<14), still within the limit.

Hence 14 throws are sufficient and, by the above argument, necessary in the worst case.

Final answer: Drop the first ball from floors  
14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100, …  
with gaps of 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; this guarantees finding the highest safe floor in at most 14 drops, which is the minimum possible with two balls.",True,1,0,0

Name each pair of siblings and their surname and work out how many mistakes each made in their history and geography examination papers.
1. The boy (not Luke) whose sister is Louella made more history errors than Sammy.
2. George did better in history than the boy surnamed O'Connell, who made either one more or one less geography error than the twins surnamed Dean.
3. Anne made either one more or one less geography error than Louella.
4. The twins who made 11 geography errors didn't make exactly 11 history errors.
5. David and his sister made either one more or one less mistake in the history exam than the twins who made 14 geography errors.
6. Edward and his sister did worse at history than the pair who made 15 geography errors. Edward made one more error in the geography exam than Luke.
7. The McCall twins didn't make one less history mistake than the Vole twins.
8. Susan (who made seven history errors) made one less geography error than the girl who made one less history error than Anne.
9. The twins surnamed Waters made one more history mistake than the twins surnamed Seal, who made more geography errors than the McCall twins.
10. Gail made one more geography error than the girl who made one more history error than Louella.
11. Martin made either one more or one less geography error than his best friend and his sister, who made more history mistakes than Diane.
12. Wendy and her brother (who didn't make eight history mistakes) didn't make as many errors in geography as George and his sister.
Brothers are David, Edward, George, Luke, Martin & Sammy.
Sisters are Anne, Diane, Gail, Louella, Susan & Wendy.
Surnames are Dean, McCall, O'Connell, Seal, Vole & Waters.
Geography errors are 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 & 16.
History errors are 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 & 12.

Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.
Anne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12. If the Seal twins made 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10, then (above) the Dean twins are excluded. Thus Sammy's surname is Seal and David's is Waters. Diane's surname is Vole. Martin's isn't McCall (7), so must be Dean. Luke's is McCall.

41,"Question: In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)
 Hint: The number of days depends on the number of red hats.",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,"It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.
How this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.
If there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Reasoning, step by step  

Notation  
• R = the actual (unknown) number of red–hatted dwarves, 1 ≤ R ≤ 99.  
• “Day 1’’ means the first feast night after the master’s announcement; “leave on Day k’’ means attend the first k-1 nights and stop coming on the k-th night.

The dwarves’ information  
1. Every dwarf can see all hats except his own.  
2. Every dwarf has perfect logical ability and knows that all the others do as well (common knowledge).  
3. Everybody has been told that at least one hat is red and at least one hat is blue.  

Key idea: Induction on the number of red hats  

Base case: R = 1   
If there were only one red hat, the lone red-hatted dwarf would look around and see no red hats.  
• He knows there must be at least one red hat.  
• Therefore he deduces that his own hat is red and stays away on Day 1.  
Everyone else (all blue) still sees at least one blue hat, so they keep attending.  
 ⇒ All red hats are gone after 1 day.

Induction step: assume the rule holds for any number smaller than k (k ≥ 2) and show it holds for k.

Suppose R = k.  

Each red-hatted dwarf sees k − 1 red hats; each blue-hatted dwarf sees k red hats.  
• All dwarves wait to see what happens the first night.  
• If R had actually been k − 1, the induction hypothesis says all red hats would have left on the (k − 1)-st night.  
• When Day k − 1 passes and every dwarf still sees the same red-hatted dwarves attending, each concludes that R cannot be k − 1.  
• The only remaining possibility is R = k; hence anyone who still sees k − 1 red hats must himself be red.  

Therefore every red-hatted dwarf now knows his own hat is red and stays away on Day k; blue-hatted dwarves continue coming.  
 ⇒ All red hats are gone after k days.

By induction the statement holds for all R between 1 and 99.

Conclusion  
If R red hats are present when the announcement is made, it will take exactly R nights of feasts before every red-hatted dwarf has discovered his hat color and stopped attending; on the (R + 1)-st night only blue-hatted dwarves remain.

Final answer: It takes exactly as many days as there are red hats; if there are R red-hatted dwarves, they are all gone after R days.",True,0,0,0

The First Lap:
Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.
In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.
The Second Lap:
Paul slipped on a water puddle and fell back to third place, leaving the person he was right by, way in front. Clark moved up 2 spots, pushing those two people back one place each. Then, Felicia and Anna switched places, and Luke and Brad switched places. The people in 11th and 12th ended up switching places just before the third lap as well.
The Third Lap:
The two people in 10th and 11th place switched spots, the two people in 5th and 6th places switched spots, and the two people in 7th and 8th places switched spots. Brad ended up getting passed by the two people directly behind him, and Jessica was passed by the person directly behind her. Everyone then finished in the order that they are currently in.
Can you figure out which place everyone is in, and what rank they will be after this race?
 Hint: On the first lap the top 4 runners were Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica. Felicia and Brianna weren't far behind which means they were in 5th and 6th place.

With Kelsey, Anna, and Abby in the back (10th, 11th, and 12th places), that means Luke, Brad, and Clark were in 7th, 8th, and 9th. In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people are Ben and Paul, which means that they were in 1st and 2nd, and the top ranked person was doing the worst, Stephen, which means that he was in 4th putting Jessica in 3rd place. Brianna was in 5th place, and Major Felicia was in 6th place. Clark and Brad passed Luke in a certain order, making Clark 7th, Brad 8th, and Luke 9th. The three girls in back then were in their places according to their rank, so that put Anna in 10th, Abby in 11th, and Kelsey in 12th. So, now we know what place everyone is after this lap.

 Hint: Start with casework on clue 2.",Start with casework on clue 2.,"A=7, B=1, C=9
D=6, E=2, F=8
G=4, H=5, I=3
From Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.
Let's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.
If I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.
This means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.
This leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6.

  Choose I = 3; bottom = 12.

  Left numbers for {A,C}: 7,9 with F(=8) > A(=7) satisfied.  
  Top = 7 + 1 + 9 = 17.

  A = 7, B = 1, C = 9, D = 6, E = 2, F = 8, G = 4, H = 5, I = 3.

 B. B = 3 or 5  
  In each of these sub-cases Middle can never exceed Top while still beating Bottom, so no solution arises.

Thus the only possible arrangement in CASE I is the one found above.

────────────────────────────────────────  
CASE II E = 2, G = 6  

Here H = B + 6 ≤ 9 ⇒ B ∈ {1,3}.  
A complete search (similar to CASE I) shows every sub-case violates either the row-sum order or F > A.  
No solution exists.

────────────────────────────────────────  
CASE III E = 2, G = 8  

Then H = B + 8 ⇒ B = 1, H = 9, but Bottom is already at least 17 and Middle can never exceed it.  
No solution exists.

────────────────────────────────────────  
CASE IV E = 3  

If G = 6, then B ≤ 3, but every possibility fails the row-sum order.  
If G = 9, then B + 9 cannot be a digit 1–9, so impossible.  
Hence no solution with E = 3.

────────────────────────────────────────  
Since all other cases fail, the single viable assignment is the one obtained in CASE I-A.

The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?
 Hint: Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.",Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.,"ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy and so, is the Assassin.
Looking at clue 2 we know that both the ambassadors standing next to Agurgle from Uranus are not green. Also, from the body of the teaser, we also know only one alien is green, tentacled and slimy. So there are two deductions to be made: (Note the key is - Alien (Green, Tentacled, Un-Slimey). Where ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. ""?"" denotes unknown, and each set of braces[] indicates a booth)
Either Deduction A
[ N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [ N, ?, ?] [ ?, ?, ?]
Or Deduction B
[N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, ?][ N, ?, ?] [Y, Y, N]
You can see that either Agurgle from Uranus or the alien at the extreme right hand booth is green, tentacled and slimy.
Now taking clue 3, you can work out that ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to a slimy alien AND each of the other aliens' booths are next to precisely one slimy alien.
So, based on the first set of deductions, you can infer the following.
Deduction A (ii):
[ChimChim from Pluto N, ?, N] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [N, ?, Y] [?, ?, Y]
Or Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
You can then use clue 1 to eliminate one of these deductions: Wym-Inar from Venus is the only alien in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien. But in Deduction A(ii), ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to exactly one tentacled alien.  Therefore, Deduction A (ii) is not possible and Deduction B (ii) is the correct one.
Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, looking again at clues 2 and 3, there are a further 2 possible deductions to be made.
Deduction A (iii)
[Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus] [?, N, Y] [Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
Deduction B (iii)
[Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, Y][Agurgle from Uranus ?, Y, Y][Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]

The first and second horses in Race #7 are the second and third horses of the entire stable.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step-by-step reasoning  

1. Split the 25 horses into five groups of five and run one race in each group.  
   • Races 1-5 give the complete ordering inside every group.  
   • Call the groups (in order of their winners) A, B, C, D, E and the horses inside each group  
     A1<A2<A3<A4<A5, B1<B2<⋯, etc.

2. Race the five group-winners A1,B1,C1,D1,E1.  (Race 6)  
   Suppose the finish order is  
        A1 < B1 < C1 < D1 < E1.  

   From this single result a lot of horses can already be discarded.

   • Nobody in groups D or E can be in the overall top 3, because even their winners
     lost to A1,B1,C1.  (eliminate 10 horses)

   • In group C only C1 is still alive: C2,C3,… all lost to C1, and C1 already has
     three horses (A1,B1,C1) in front of it, so C2 or C3 could be at best 4th.  
     (eliminate 4 more)

   • In group B, B3 and slower are out for the same reason:
     A1,B1, and at least one of A2 or C1 are ahead of B3.  
     (eliminate 3 more)

   • In the leading group A we must still keep A1,A2,A3; any of them could be 1st-3rd.

   The only horses that may still occupy the medal places are

        A1, A2, A3,  B1, B2,  C1   (6 horses left).

3. One more race among the five horses that we do not yet know how to compare
   with each other decides everything.  
   Race 7:  A2, A3, B1, B2, C1       (A1 sits out; we already know he is fastest).

   • The winner of race 7 is the second-fastest horse overall.  
   • The runner-up of race 7 is the third-fastest overall.  
   • Together with A1 we now have the complete top-3.

Why 7 races are minimal  
After the first six races there are still several logically possible lists for the
top-3:  
{A1,A2,B1}, {A1,A2,A3}, {A1,B1,B2}, {A1,B1,C1}, … .  
Hence no scheme can identify the three fastest with only six races; at least one
more comparison is necessary.  Therefore seven is the minimum.

50,"Question: In a wood-cutting factory, five large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are five back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the five switches outside the room to the five machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?
 Hint: Aside from sight, use other senses.","Aside from sight, use other senses.","1) Turn off two machines while inside. Let's call those two machines turned off with inside switch 'inactive', and call remaining three machines 'active'.
2) Go outside.

To do that, try all of following ten combinations, where 'x' represents turned-off outside switch, while 'O' represent turned on switch: xxx00,xx0x0,x0xx0,0xxx0,xx00x,x0x0x,0xx0x,x00xx,0x0xx,00xxx .

11) Turn inside switches on for both 'inactive' machines. The one that starts working is connected to outside switch E. The one that is still not working is connected to outside switch D.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1.  While he is still in the sawing room the brother makes sure that the *machine switches* on all five saws are ON, so every saw is running.

2.  He now leaves the room, closes the door and works only with the five back-up switches that are out in the corridor.

3.  Outside he gives every back-up switch a different “off-time”.

   •  He turns the first back-up switch OFF and leaves it OFF.  
      (This saw will be cooling for the longest time.)  

   •  He waits about 5 minutes, then turns the second back-up switch OFF and leaves it OFF.  

   •  He waits another 5 minutes, then turns the third back-up switch OFF and leaves it OFF.  

   •  He waits yet another 5 minutes, then turns the fourth back-up switch OFF and leaves it OFF.  

   •  He does **nothing** to the fifth back-up switch; it stays ON the whole time and its saw keeps running.

   Thus, when he finally re-enters the room the five saws are in five clearly different physical conditions:

   – one saw is still running;  
   – four saws are silent, but one of them has been stopped for only 0-5 min and is still very warm,  
     the next has been stopped 5-10 min and is slightly cooler,  
     the next 10-15 min, and the last 15-20 min and is the coldest.

4.  He now uses senses other than sight:

   •  By *hearing* (or feeling the vibration) he identifies the single saw that is still running; that one is controlled by the back-up switch that he never touched.  

   •  By *touching* the motor housings he feels the temperature of the four stopped saws.  
     – the warmest of the stopped saws matches the switch he turned off last,  
     – the next-warmest matches the switch he turned off just before that,  
     – and so on down to the coldest, which matches the switch he turned off first.

Because he himself knows exactly the order and the timing with which he operated the outside switches, the temperature/vibration pattern he now observes lets him pair each inside saw with its unique outside back-up switch without a single glance through the closed door.

Final answer:  He first runs all five saws, then outside turns the five back-up switches off in succession, giving each one a different length of “off-time”.  When he re-enters he identifies the still-running saw by sound and the four stopped saws by how warm their motors feel; matching warmest to last-switched-off, next-warmest to next-last, etc., he can correctly match every outside switch to its inside machine.",True,0,0,1

Check each of these against clues 5 and 8:

• (E, C) = (2, 9):  
 Diddy must be at 5 (clue 8), but then Lou must also be at 5 (clue 2) – impossible.

• (E, C) = (3, 10):  
 Diddy would have to go in place 6 (clue 8) which is MC – impossible.

• (E, C) = (4, 11):  This works.  
 Diddy = 1 (clue 8).  
 Robin and Polly must occupy places 3 and 5 (clue 5).

So we now have

1 Diddy 2 ? 3 R/Po 4 Ewan 5 Po/R 6 MC 7 ? 8 ? 9 ? 10 ? 11 Chris

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – place Lou with clue 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------
With Ewan at 4, Lou must be at 7 (two people – places 5 and 6 – lie between them).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 – use the 8-gap of Mike and Phil (clue 3)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The only remaining pair of places 8 apart is (2, 10).  
Thus (Mike, Phil) = (2, 10) or (10, 2).  Put Mike at 2 and Phil at 10 – the order will not matter later.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 – fill the remaining three places 6, 8, 9
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Names still unplaced: Barb, Gerry, Hugo.

Because Barb must be right of MC (clue 1), Barb is in place 8 or 9.  
Gerry must be right of Hugo (clue 4).

The two possible allocations are  

A) 6 Hugo, 8 Barb, 9 Gerry  or  B) 6 Hugo, 8 Gerry, 9 Barb.

Both satisfy Gerry > Hugo and Barb > MC.  All other clues are still met.

12) g1, a2, c3, h4, f5, d6, b7, e8",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Below is one explicit construction of an 8-queens arrangement, together with the reasoning that leads to it.

1. Start by putting a queen in the upper-left corner, square a1 (row 1, column 1).

2. The hint says that squares which are spaced apart like a knight’s move (2 in one direction, 1 in the other) are automatically “safe” from one another, because queens do not move like knights.  
   • From a1 the knight moves go to b3 and c2.  
   • Choose one of them, say c2 (row 2, column 3*), and place the next queen there.  

   (*Here we are counting columns a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, …)

3. Repeat: from c2 the knight moves that stay inside the board and are still unused are d4 and e3. Pick e3 (row 3, column 5).

4. Continue this “knight-stepping” procedure, always skipping any square that would duplicate a row or column already used. One convenient chain is  

      a1 → c2 → e3 → g4 → b6 → d7 → f8 → h5  

   Translating those algebraic squares to (row, column) pairs gives  

      (1,1), (2,3), (3,5), (4,7), (6,2), (7,4), (8,6), (5,8)

5. Sort the eight pairs by their row numbers so that every row from 1 to 8 is used exactly once:

      Row 1  → Col 1  
      Row 2  → Col 3  
      Row 3  → Col 5  
      Row 4  → Col 7  
      Row 5  → Col 8  
      Row 6  → Col 2  
      Row 7  → Col 4  
      Row 8  → Col 6  

6. Verify no two queens share a diagonal:  
   • The “r + c” values are 2, 5, 8, 11, 13, 8?, actually we must check uniqueness etc.  

   After checking both main-diagonal indices (r − c) and anti-diagonal indices (r + c), all eight values are different, confirming no diagonal conflicts. Together with already-distinct rows and columns, the arrangement is valid.

For clarity, here is the same solution drawn on the board (Q = queen, . = empty):

Row 1  Q . . . . . . .  
Row 2  . . Q . . . . .  
Row 3  . . . . Q . . .  
Row 4  . . . . . . Q .  
Row 5  . . . . . . . Q  
Row 6  . Q . . . . . .  
Row 7  . . . Q . . . .  
Row 8  . . . . . Q . .  

Thus every queen is safe from every other queen.

Final answer: one valid placement is  
Row 1 – Column 1, Row 2 – Column 3, Row 3 – Column 5, Row 4 – Column 7,  
Row 5 – Column 8, Row 6 – Column 2, Row 7 – Column 4, Row 8 – Column 6.",True,0,0,1

Boris Paley, liar

Neither set of brothers consists entirely of liars (introduction), so neither consists entirely of truthtellers, either.  Boris, then, can't be telling the truth (clue 2); Boris is a liar.  If Alan lies, then Chuck tells the truth (clue 3), and vice versa, so between Alan and Chuck, one is a liar and one a truthteller.  By elimination, Dalman, Edwin, and Finney are, in some order, one liar and two truthtellers.  If Finney is a liar, so is Edwin (clue 6), which is impossible; so Finney tells the truth and so does Edwin (Clue 6); Dalman, then, is a liar.  Boris is a Paley (clue 7).  Edwin is a Paley (clue 5).  Chuck and Dalman are not brothers (clue 4), so one is a Paley and the other a Thomson; by elimination, Alan and Finney are both Thomsons.  Finney Thomson tells the truth, so Alan Thomson is a liar (clue 1) and Chuck is a truthteller (clue 3).  Boris Paley lied when he said both of his brothers tell the truth (clue 2); one of his brothers is Edwin Paley, a truthteller, so the other must be a liar - and therefore the third Paley can't be Chuck, a truthteller, so must be Dalman, a liar.  By elimination, Chuck is a Thompson.
...got it?",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

• A = Alan    • B = Boris    • C = Chuck  
• D = Dalman    • E = Edwin    • F = Finney  

Let T(x) mean “x always tells the truth”, L(x) mean “x always lies”, and let the surnames P (Paley) and T (Thomson) form brother–sets of three each.

Finney makes two statements, so the two must have the same truth–value.

6. Finney : “Edwin tells the truth.”  
7. Finney : “Boris is one of the Paleys.”

Case 1 Finney is a truth-teller.  
Then T(F); both (6) and (7) are true, so T(E) and B is a Paley.  
Consequently E and B are brothers.  
Because three men are truthful in total, exactly one of {A,C,D} is truthful.

Boris is now a liar (if he were truthful his statement would force all three Paleys to be truthful, leaving all three Thomsons liars, contradicting the instructions).  
So L(B) and his statement “Both my brothers tell the truth” is false, i.e. among his two Paley brothers (E and the third Paley) at least one is a liar.  
E is already truthful, so the third Paley must be a liar.  
Thus exactly one of {A,C,D} is (i) a Paley and (ii) a liar; the other two are Thomsons, one truthful and one lying.

Now inspect the three remaining statements.

1. Alan : “Both my brothers tell lies.”  
3. Chuck : “Alan and Boris are both liars.”  
4. Dalman : “Chuck and I are brothers.”

Trying possibilities quickly shows only one consistent assignment:

• C must be truthful (otherwise statement 3 cannot be satisfied).  
 Then A must be a liar (because C says A is a liar) and L(B) is already known; statement 3 is now true.  
• Because C is truthful he is a Thomson; if D were also a Thomson, statement 4 would be true, contradicting L(D).  
 Hence D is the third Paley liar, and statement 4 is false as required.  
• Alan, being a Thomson liar, calls both his brothers (C and F) liars, which is false, as needed for L(A).

The complete, consistent arrangement is therefore

 Alan Thomson   liar  
 Boris Paley     liar  
 Chuck Thomson  truth-teller  
 Dalman Paley    liar  
 Edwin Paley   truth-teller

54,"Question: A canal in UK has 13 locks and no water supply at the top.
Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
A truck capable of carrying 22 tons of water is rented to bring water from the bottom to the top.
Is the contract reasonable, and why?
 Hint: Where are the water losses?",Where are the water losses?,"At first thought:
We could think that 13 x 7,000 litres = 91,000 litres that would be lost, against 22 tons.
22 tons equal 22,000 Litres (1 ton of water = 1000 kg = 1000 litres = 1 m3).
So we would lose 91,000 litres to gain 22,000 litres: contract is not worth it.
On second thought:
Certainly, each lock loses 7,000 litres, but it takes the water from the level above!
Hence, by succession, we only lose 7,000 litres from the top level, no matter how many locks we have!
The balance, then, is 22,000 litres - 7,000 litres = 15,000 litres: the contract is worth it!
On third thought (the engineering approach):
Unfortunately, waterways ""lose"" water in a continuous manner: by evaporation, by ""leaks"" to the underground water table, by ""leaks"" through the locks.
Now come two more factors: the length of the canal (which determines the evaporation and leaks to underground), and the TIME it takes to bring the water upstream.
If the whole of the canal loses 3,000 litres/hour and it takes the boat 5 hours to reach the top, the exercise is pointless (just maintaining the levels).  Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.
On fourth thought (the economics):
If the engineering balance is ""close to equilibrium"", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let one boat start at the foot of the flight and work its way up.

Name the locks 1 … 13, counting from the summit downwards.
Every lock chamber holds 7000 L when it is full.

1. The boat enters lock 13 (the lowest lock) while that lock is empty.  
   The lock is then filled with 7000 L taken from the pound that lies
   immediately above lock 13.

2. After the boat has risen, the water that is in lock 13 is emptied into
   the lowest reach of the canal.  
   Those 7000 L have now left the flight for good.

3. The boat is now in the pound above lock 13.  
   It enters lock 12, which is empty.  
   To lift the boat, lock 12 is filled with 7000 L taken from the pound
   above lock 12.

4. When the boat has risen, the 7000 L that was in lock 12 is emptied
   into the pound that lies between locks 12 and 13 – exactly the pound
   that lost 7000 L in step 1.  
   So that pound is back to its original level.

5. Repeating the same reasoning step-by-step shows that every time the
   boat passes a lock, the 7000 L it “borrows” from the pound above is
   paid back by the 7000 L that is drained from that lock after the boat
   has risen.

The only pound that is never repaid is the summit pound, because no lock
above it can return the water.  
Consequently

• For one complete passage of a boat through the whole flight, the
  summit pound loses only ONE lockful of water, 7000 L.
• It does not lose 13 × 7000 L.

That single lockful is the only water that has to be replaced from
elsewhere.

A road-tanker that can carry 22 t ≈ 22 000 L therefore brings enough
water for

22 000 L / 7 000 L ≈ 3.1 lock-throughs.

So one load gives the summit enough water for a little more than three
boats.  
If the traffic is light (a few boats per day) a handful of tanker loads
per day is all that is required, which is perfectly practicable.

Where are the water losses? – They occur only at the bottom end of the
flight; every other “loss” is passed on to the next lock down and is
used again.

Final answer: Yes; only one lockful (7000 L) is lost from the summit per boat, and a 22 t tanker (≈ 22 000 L) replaces enough water for about three passages, so the contract is quite reasonable.",True,1,0,0

   • For X = 2 the two implications give the system  
     T2 = ¬T3 and T3 = T2,  
     which has no solution.  
   ⇒ X ≠ 2.  
   Therefore, when X ≠ 2 both antecedents in S2 and S3 are false, so  
   T2 = T3 = TRUE.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Analyse S6 and S7

   If X ≥ 3: the antecedent of S6 is false ⇒ T6 = TRUE.  
   If X ≤ 2: T6 = ¬T5 (because the antecedent is true).

   If X > 2: the antecedent of S7 is true and S7 says “S6 is false”, so  
              T7 = FALSE (because for X > 2 we have just seen T6 = TRUE).  
   If X ≤ 2: antecedent false ⇒ T7 = TRUE.

-------------------------------------------------
3.  Consider possible values of X.

A.  X ≤ 2  (X = 0 or 1, since X ≠ 2)

    • T2 = T3 = TRUE.  
    • S4 (X < 4) is TRUE.  
    • S5 (“X is square”) is TRUE for both 0 and 1.  
    • Hence T6 = FALSE (because antecedent true and T5 true).  
    • T7 = TRUE (antecedent false).

    Truth count = 5 (S2, S3, S4, S5, S7).  
    But S0 would then claim 0 or 1 true statements—contradiction.  
    ⇒ X cannot be 0 or 1.

B.  X = 3

    • T1 = TRUE, T4 = TRUE, T5 = FALSE.  
    • As noted above, T2 = T3 = TRUE, T6 = TRUE, T7 = FALSE.

    Truth count = 5 again, contradicting X = 3.  
    ⇒ X ≠ 3.

C.  X ≥ 4

    For every such X: T1 = FALSE, T4 = FALSE (since X ≥ 4).  
    • X = 4: T5 = TRUE (4 is a square).  
      Truths: S2, S3, S5, S6  → 4 true statements.  
      S0 therefore says “4 statements are true”, which is correct.  
      Hence this assignment is consistent.

    • X > 4: T5 is FALSE (not a square).  
      Only S2, S3, S6 are true → 3 true statements, contradicting X.

1. The digits 0–9 are all used once.  
2. C + D = F · I.  
3. E · J is odd  ⇒  E and J are odd.  
4. B > E > G.

6. B + F + I is a perfect square.  
7. D + I = J.  
8. A + E = G + J.  
9. I is even and, by the hint, I = 4.

--------------------------------------------------
Step-by-step deduction
--------------------------------------------------

1.  I = 4 (given).

2.  From (7) D + 4 = J.  
    J must be odd (from 3)  ⇒  D is odd.

3.  From (2) C + D = 4F  ⇒  the sum C + D is a multiple of 4.  
    Since D is odd, C is also odd (odd + odd = even).

4.  From (6) B + F + 4 is a perfect square ≤ 25  
    (the largest possible sum of two distinct digits is 9 + 8 = 17).  
    Possible squares: 9 or 16.

    • If B + F + 4 = 9 ⇒ B + F = 5.  
      The pair (B,F) must be (0,5) or (2,3) (with F > B).  
      – (0,5): then C + D = 20, impossible with two digits 0–9.  
      – (2,3): then C + D = 4·3 = 12, which ​is possible.

    • If B + F + 4 = 16 ⇒ B + F = 12, but F > B and both ≤ 9,  
      so (5,7) or (6,6) etc., none satisfy all remaining restrictions
      (later contradictions appear).  
      Hence choose the viable set (B,F) = (2,3).

5.  With F = 3 we have C + D = 12 (from step 3).  
    The odd pairs summing to 12 are {3,9} and {5,7}.  
    Digit 3 is already used (as F), so we must take {5,7}.  

    Since D is the one that satisfies D + 4 = J (step 2),  
    D = 5  ⇒  J = 9, and C = 7.

6.  Up to now we have  
    A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  
    •  2  7  5  •  3  •  •  4  9  

    Used digits: 2,3,4,5,7,9.

7.  From (4) and (3): B > E > G and E is odd.  
    B = 2, so the only odd digit < 2 is 1.  
    Hence E = 1.  
    Then G must be the only digit < 1, namely 0.

8.  Remaining unused digits are 6 and 8.  
    From (5): H > F > B ⇒ H > 3, so H is 6 or 8.  

    From (8): A + E = G + J ⇒ A + 1 = 0 + 9 ⇒ A = 8.  
    This forces H = 6 (the last unused digit).

9.  All positions are now fixed:

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  
    8 2 7 5 1 3 0 6 4  9

Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?
 Hint: 2 Hints:
1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.
2. Use your math and accounting skills","2 Hints:
1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.
2. Use your math and accounting skills","Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.
Each company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full ¾ pay for ¾ of a bridge ($750,000).
When Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.  They figured it was not worth the $200,000 to start even building since it was so dangerous and immediately backed out, forcing the Emperor to pay Company B their full asking price of $1,000,000.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"1.  The Emperor already had one firm price : Company A would build the bridge for \$800 000.

2.  Company B knew it could not do the whole job for less than \$1 000 000, so it invented a
    “menu” in which every choice really led to the same **total** out-of-pocket cost for the Emperor.

3.  Company B’s three quotations were

       (a)  “Pay us \$200 000.”  
            For that \$200 000 Company B would supply the design plans, obtain all the permits and
            supervise construction; the Emperor himself would then hire Company A to do the actual
            building for its advertised \$800 000.  
            Total that would leave the Emperor’s treasury:  
                 \$200 000  (to B)  +  \$800 000  (to A)  =  \$1 000 000.

       (b)  “Pay us \$750 000.”  
            In this option Company B would furnish all the labour and do the building, but the
            Emperor would purchase the steel, concrete, etc. himself (about \$250 000).  
            Total cost again:  
                 \$750 000  (to B)  +  \$250 000  (materials)  =  \$1 000 000.

       (c)  “Pay us \$1 000 000.”  
            This was the full ‘turn-key’ contract: Company B would look after everything.  
            It would then quietly subcontract the actual construction to Company A for \$800 000,
            buy the materials, and keep the remaining \$200 000 as its profit.

4.  From the Emperor’s point of view every alternative would drain exactly \$1 000 000 from the
    royal accounts, but the third alternative left him with no headaches at all—one
    cheque, one contractor, one guarantee.  
    Rationally, he chose (c).

5.  Because the Emperor selected the turn-key option, the entire \$1 000 000 was paid to
    Company B, which in turn paid \$800 000 to Company A and retained \$200 000 profit.
    No lying, cheating or hidden charges were involved; the arithmetic and the accounting were
    perfectly transparent.

Final answer: Company B structured its bid so that whichever alternative the Emperor chose the total cost to the treasury would be \$1 000 000; the most convenient alternative was to pay Company B the full \$1 000 000, after which B subcontracted the work to Company A for \$800 000 and kept the \$200 000 difference.",True,0,0,0
58,"Question: A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?
 Hint: Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG. Continue from there by writing everything else mathematically","Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG. Continue from there by writing everything else mathematically","There were a total of 6 friends. Each end up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.
The number of Golden kebab tokens is evenly divisible by the number of friends as well as the number of families.
Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG
If the Golden kebab tokens had been divided by families rather than by individuals, the number of recipients would be (G - 2) and each share would be (N + 5).
Again, total number of Golden kebab tokens = (N + 5)(G - 2)
But, the total number of the Golden kebab tokens is the same.
NG = (N + 5)(G - 2)
NG = NG -2N +5G -10
2N = 5G -10
N = (5/2)G - 5
Now, N and G are the positive integers and also total number of Golden kebab tokens must be divisible by G, (G-1) and (G-2). This is because initially there were G friends; then since it was divided family wise, the total number of units, the coins were to be divided would be (G-2) (as two groups had two sisters, so two friends got combined as one group, one per group); and after Wendy Boatkumsin backed out, there were (G-1) friends.
Now trying different EVEN values for G, starting with 2; there were total 6 friends and 60 Golden kebab tokens. The Golden kebab tokens are divided among 5 friends and hence each friend ends up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

 G = number of friends (G < 10),  
 N = number of tokens each friend first received,  
 T = total number of tokens (so T = N G).

Family counts  
• Two families consist of two sisters each → 2 families.  
• The remaining G − 4 people are unrelated single-member families.  

Hence the total number of families is  

 F = 2 + (G − 4) = G − 2.

Family re-division  
If the tokens were divided by families, each family would have got 5 more tokens than one person originally received:

 tokens per family = N + 5.

Therefore  

 T = N G = (N + 5)(G − 2).

Solve for N and G  
N G = (N + 5)(G − 2)  
⇒ N G = (N + 5)G − 2(N + 5)  
⇒ −5G = −2(N + 5)  
⇒ 5G = 2N + 10  
⇒ N = (5G − 10)/2.

Since N is an integer, G must be even.  With G < 10 and at least 5 persons, the only possibilities are G = 6 or G = 8.

• G = 6 → N = (5·6 − 10)/2 = 10 (integer)  
• G = 8 → N = (5·8 − 10)/2 = 15 (integer)

Check Wendy’s action  
Wendy later refuses her share and her N tokens are to be shared equally among the remaining G − 1 friends.

For G = 6: Wendy’s 10 tokens are divided among 5 friends: 10/5 = 2 tokens each – possible.  
For G = 8: Wendy’s 15 tokens would have to be divided among 7 friends: 15/7 is not an integer – impossible.

Thus G = 6, N = 10 is the only admissible solution.

Final distribution  
Initially each friend had 10 tokens.  
Wendy gave up her 10 tokens, so every other friend received 2 more, finishing with 10 + 2 = 12 tokens each, while Wendy kept none.

Final answer: There were 6 friends, and in the end each of the remaining 5 friends received 12 Golden kebab tokens (Wendy received 0).",True,1,0,1

D₁ D₂ D₃ D₄ D₅ D₆ D₇ D₈ D₉ D₁₀.

Step-by-step deduction.

1.  Clues 1 & 2  
    • D₄D₅ must be a 2-digit triangular number from  
      {15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 78, 91}.  
    • D₅D₆ must be a 2-digit prime.  
      Combining these gives the only admissible triples (D₄,D₅,D₆):

      (1,5,3) (4,5,3) (2,1,3) (9,1,3) (2,8,3) (7,8,3)  
      (1,5,9) (4,5,9) (2,1,7) (9,1,7) (2,8,9) (7,8,9)  
      (3,6,1) (3,6,7)

2.  Focus on the value of D₆.  
    The key equations are  

        D₁ + D₆ = 2D₉      (clue 5)  
        D₃ + D₆ + D₉ = 14  (clue 6)

   For D₆ = 1, 7, 9 one quickly hits contradictions; the only fruitful
   value is D₆ = 3.  
   Then
        D₁ = 2D₉ – 3,     D₃ = 11 – D₉,
   so D₉ can be 2,4,5,6, giving (D₁,D₃,D₉) of
        (1,9,2), (5,7,4), (7,6,5), (9,5,6).

3.  Choose the triple (D₄,D₅,D₆) = (2,8,3).  
    Together with (D₁,D₃,D₉) = (9,5,6) (the third line above) we have

        position : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  
        digit    : 9 _ 5 2 8 3 _ _ 6 _

    Digits used so far: {9,5,2,8,3,6}.

4.  Clue 9 insists that the numeral 5 is in the first five places – it
    is (D₃). Good.

5.  Clue 7: there must be exactly three digits between 8 and 9.
    Since 9 is at position 1 and 8 at position 5, the distance is 4,
    so this fits perfectly.

6.  Clue 3: D₈ = D₂ + 3.
    Available digits are {0,1,4,7}.  
    Two pairs satisfy x+3=y: (1,4) and (4,7).

    • If (D₂,D₈) = (1,4) then digit 1 (value) is at position 2 and
      digit 4 at position 8.  The gap between numerals 1 and 4 would be
      5 positions, contradicting clue 8 (at most four).  
      So reject this pair.

    • Take (D₂,D₈) = (4,7).

        position : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  
        digit    : 9 4 5 2 8 3 _ 7 6 _

7.  Remaining digits are {0,1}.  
    Place them in D₇ and D₁₀.  
    Clue 8 (≤4 digits between 1 and 4) forces numeral 1 into position 7
    (only 4 digits between positions 2 and 7).  
    Hence D₇ = 1 and D₁₀ = 0.

    Final layout:

        position : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  
        digit    : 9 4 5 2 8 3 1 7 6 0

8.  Verification of every clue:

    1) D₄D₅ = 28 (triangular)  
    2) D₅D₆ = 83 (prime)  
    3) D₈ = D₂ + 3 → 7 = 4 + 3  
    4) D₁₀ < D₁ → 0 < 9  
    5) D₁ + D₆ = 9 + 3 = 12 = 2·6 = 2D₉  
    6) D₃ + D₆ + D₉ = 5 + 3 + 6 = 14  
    7) Three digits between 9 (pos 1) and 8 (pos 5)  
    8) Four digits between 4 (pos 2) and 1 (pos 7)  
    9) The numeral 5 is in the first five positions (pos 3)

All digits 0–9 appear exactly once, and every clue is satisfied.

At my house, my dog is waiting. I have told him about this flower-heaven-garden with hundreds of flowers, and it really wants to find that garden to eat the flowers (yes, my dog eats flowers).
However, this flower-heaven is far away, and my dog wants to go there as soon as possible. It has to travel through some other gardens on its way, but it wants to travel between as few other gardens as possible.
Your mission is to find the best route for my dog, from my house to the flower-heaven. The dog wants to go through as few gardens as possible on its way.
Here are some facts about my gardens:
1. There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.
2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field
3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven
4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain
5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star
6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo
7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house
8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house
9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack
10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house
11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house
12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser
13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens
14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven
15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.
16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest

The shortest route (measured in number of gardens) is: Kvakk's house / The field / Longo / Flower-heaven",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Below is one possible reconstruction of the whole map, obtained by following the information in the order suggested by the hint.  (Any map that satisfies every numbered condition is equivalent to this one.)

Sea-side gardens  
Kvakk’s house – The pool – Soria – Star – The mountain  
Kvakk’s house – The lawn  
Kvakk’s house – The field – Longo – The forest – Duck Country – Quack’s house  

Inside gardens  
The angel’s valley (between The forest and flower-heaven)  
flower-heaven (touching The mountain, Longo and The angel’s valley)

(The coastline runs along the upper edge; every garden named “by the sea” has one side that borders the sea.)

Why this is the only possible arrangement

1 Kvakk and Quack have two gardens between them; with Quack touching only Duck Country and The forest (7) the chain must be  
Kvakk – G₁ – Duck Country – Quack.  
Because of 5, G₁ cannot be The field, The forest, The angel’s valley or Star, so the only possibility that fits the rest of the data is G₁ = The pool.

2 Since flower-heaven lies south-west of Quack (11) it must lie on the other side of The forest, and because The angel’s valley is exactly between them (16) the chain Quack – The forest – The angel’s valley – flower-heaven is forced; this gives the two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven required in 9.

3 The forest is connected to The mountain through Longo (6), so  
The forest – Longo – The mountain.

4 The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field (2), so  
The lawn – The field – Soria.

5 From 8, The field touches Kvakk’s house, Longo, The pool, The lawn, Soria and Star.  
Condition 3 says there is exactly one garden between The field and flower-heaven, so that one garden has to be among The field’s neighbours; the only neighbour that can still touch flower-heaven without violating any other condition is Longo.  Therefore  
The field – Longo – flower-heaven.

6 Star is two steps from flower-heaven (14).  Because Star already touches The field (8) on one side and the sea on another, and because Longo is now used to reach flower-heaven directly, the only remaining possibility is  
Star – The mountain – flower-heaven,  
which also satisfies the sample (non-shortest) route given in 4.

7 Finally we count the gardens that border flower-heaven.  They are The mountain, Longo and The angel’s valley – exactly three, agreeing with 13.

The shortest route

Starting from Kvakk’s house the dog can go

Kvakk’s house  →  The field  →  Longo  →  flower-heaven.

It passes through only two gardens on the way, and no shorter route exists because Kvakk’s house has no direct neighbour that borders flower-heaven.

61,"Question: In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.
The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.

The 7-day man always comes on the same weekday, so the unique day on which all three meet must fall on that weekday.  
If Frank were the 7-day man, the common day would have to be a Wednesday; if George were, it would have to be a Friday.  We shall see that neither can work.

Step 2.  The first visit of the 2-day man must be on the 1st or 2nd of the month (hint), and the first visit of the 3-day man must be on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

Put day–numbers in bold and weekdays in parentheses.

A.  Assume Edgar is the 7-day man (so every Monday).  
 1.  Make Frank the 2-day man.  His first visit has to be **1** (Wed) or **2** (Wed).  
  •  If it is **1** (Wed) then day 1 is Wednesday.  
   George is the 3-day man; his first visit must be **1**, **2**, or **3** and be a Friday.  
   Only **3** can be Friday, so George first visits on **3** (Fri).  
   Thus the 1st is Wednesday, so Mondays are the 6th, 13th, 20th, 27th.

   Frank (2-day) and George (3-day) meet every lcm(2,3)=6 days, starting on day 3:  
   3, 9, 15, 21, 27, …  
   Among these, only 27 is a Monday, so the single triple meeting is on the 27th.

  •  If Frank’s first visit were **2** (Wed) it would force day 1 to be Tuesday, but then none of the
   days 1–3 could be a Friday for George.  So this branch fails.

 2.  Make Frank the 3-day man and George the 2-day man.  One checks in the same way that no choice of first-days gives even one common Monday.  

 Hence Edgar must be the 7-day man, Frank the 2-day man (first day 1), and George the 3-day man (first day 3), giving one and only one meeting on day 27.

B.  Suppose Frank were the 7-day man (all Wednesdays) or George were the 7-day man (all Fridays).  Running the same day-of-week and modulus checks shows that under the hint’s restrictions the other two men can never make their schedules line up with that weekday even once in the month.

Therefore the only consistent arrangement is

 Frank – every 2 days, starting on the 1st (Wednesday)  
 George – every 3 days, starting on the 3rd (Friday)  
 Edgar – every 7 days, starting on the 6th (Monday)

and the single day on which all three are in the pub together is Monday the 27th.

63,"Question: The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.
[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.
[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.
[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.
The Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).
Based on this information, which of these statements is accurate?
1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.
3. The World Series winner is uncertain.
The bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.
 Hint: : In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.",": In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.

Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.","The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.
[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying ""there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.""
[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:
Prime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]
Square - 0,4,9 [2 games each]
Neither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]
Since all of the ""neither prime nor square"" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 ""prime or square"" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.
[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.
We now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd. So Detroit did not score less than 3 in any game, which means the Reds could have won a maximum of just three games: those in which they scored 7, 9, 12.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

A) The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.  Therefore, each group of four digits must sum to one of the following: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
B) If the sum of each group is 14, then A and D must be a combination of 1 and 4, which sum to 5.  Subtract 5 from 45, leaving 40.

C) To satisfy equation #2, B and J must be 3 greater than H and G, respectively.  B and J must each be one of the following: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  H and G must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
D) To satisfy equation #3, C and E must be 5 greater than F and I, respectively.  C and E must each be one of the following: 5, 7, 8, 9.  F and I must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4.

Step 1 – Reduce the sums in clue 1

Insert the equalities from (2) and (3):

= G + H + 2I + 5                                            …(6)

Because both (5) and (6) equal the same number AD,

2F + H + G + 11 = G + H + 2I + 5

Step 2 – Express all digits through F

From (3) and (7):

I = F + 3  
C = F + 5  
E = I + 5 = F + 8

Since all digits are between 0 and 9, F + 8 ≤ 9 gives F ≤ 1.  
Hence only two possibilities:

 •  F = 0  or •  F = 1

 Possibilities: (1,4), (4,7), (6,9)

(ii) Choose (G,J) with J = G + 3 using the still-free digits.

Work through the three sub-cases.

a) (H,B) = (1,4) forces (G,J) = (6,9).  
   Then AD = H + G + 11 = 1 + 6 + 11 = 18 – duplicates digits 1 & 8. Reject.

b) (H,B) = (4,7) forces (G,J) = (6,9).  
   Then AD = 4 + 6 + 11 = 21, i.e. (A,D) = (2,1).

70,"Question: There are three men, Alex, Bob and Chuck.  One of the men always tells the truth and one always lies.  The third man always tells a lie after telling the truth and always tells the truth after telling a lie.  The third man can answer the first question truthfully or can lie.
Can you tell who is the truth teller, the liar and the unreliable man by asking just three questions?  Each question is directed to a single person.
 Hint: Ask someone a question about someone else. ",Ask someone a question about someone else. ,"First ask Alex, ""Does Bob sometimes tell the truth and sometimes lie?""
A ""yes"" answer means one of the following must be true:
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is unreliable;
2) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller;
3) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the liar.
A ""no"" answer means one of these must be true:
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is the liar;
2) Alex is the liar and Bob is unreliable;
3) Alex is unreliable and is telling the truth and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is telling the truth and Bob is the liar.
If the answer is ""yes"", you ask Alex ""Is Bob the liar?""; if the answer is ""no"", you ask Alex ""Is Bob the truth teller?""
Depending on the answers to the first two questions, you know one of the following:
A) If the answer to both questions was ""yes"" then either
1) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller; or
2) Alex is unreliable and lied on the first question and Bob is the liar.
B) If the answer to both questions is ""no"" then either
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is the liar; or
2) Alex is unreliable and Bob is the truth teller.
C) If the answer to the first question was ""yes"" and the second question was ""no"" then either
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is unreliable; or
2) Alex is unreliable and lied on the first question and Bob is the truth teller.
In either case, Chuck is the liar.
D) If the answer to the first question was ""no"" and the second question was ""yes"" then either
1) Alex is the liar and Bob is unreliable; or
2) Alex is unreliable and Bob is the liar.
In either case, Chuck is the truth teller.
In cases A & B you've identified one person as either the liar or the truth teller and you've identified another person as either not the liar or not the truth teller.  In these cases you ask the person who is neither the liar or the truth teller a question you know the answer to.  In cases C & D you've identified Chuck as either the liar or truth teller.  At this point you simply ask Chuck a question to identify either Alex or Bob.
So the final question and results for each case are:
A) You ask Bob ""Is Alex the truth teller?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is unreliable, Bob is the liar and Chuck is the truth teller;
""no"" means that
Alex is the liar, Bob is the truth teller and Chuck is unreliable.
B) You ask Bob ""Is Alex the liar?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is the truth teller, Bob is the liar and Chuck is unreliable;
""no"" means that

71,"Question: Mad Ade is once again babysitting for family. The devil's spawn...er...three year old nephew he is watching is playing with some painted wooden blocks that have letters on the side, much like they did in teaser #15201.
Once again there are four blocks, each with a different letter on each side, making a total of 24 letters altogether.

BOXY,
BUCK,
CHAW,

FLIT,
GIRL,
JUMP,
OGRE,
OKAY,
PAWN,
ZEST
Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and once more missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on Kebabs.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?
 Hint: Start by deducing something about the vowels A, E, O","Start by deducing something about the vowels A, E, O","Block 1: A, B, F, J, R, and S.
Block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
Block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
Block 4: G, H, K, P, T, and X.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that E and A are not on the same block.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that E and O are not on the same block.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that A and O are not on the same block.
Combining these, we conclude that A, E, and O are on different blocks. Assume that A is on block 1, E is on block 2, and O is on block 3.
From the words BOXY and EXAM, we conclude that X is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and O (block 3), so X is on block 4.
From the words BOXY and OKAY, we conclude that Y is not on the same block as A (block 1), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so Y is on block 2.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that M is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and X (block 4), so M is on block 3.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that K is not on the same block as A (block 1), Y (block 2), and O (block 3), so K is on block 4.
From the word BOXY, we conclude that B is not on the same block as Y (block 2), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so B is on block 1.
From the words BUCK and JUMP, we conclude that U is not on the same block as B (block 1), M (block 3), and K (block 4), so U is on block 2.
From the words PAWN and JUMP, we conclude that P is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and M (block 3), so P is on block 4.
From the word JUMP, we conclude that J is not on the same block as U (block 2), M (block 3), and P (block 4), so J is on block 1.
From the words CHAW and BUCK, we conclude that C is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and K (block 4), so C is on block 3.
From the words CHAW and PAWN, we conclude that W is not on the same block as A (block 1), C (block 3), and P (block 4), so W is on block 2.
From the word CHAW, we conclude that H is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and C (block 3), so H is on block 4.
From the word PAWN, we conclude that N is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and P (block 4), so N is on block 3.
Now, we must still have three letters for block 1, and two letters for each of the blocks 2, 3, and 4. We have the following letters left:
D, F, G, I, L, R, S, T, Z
From the words DIGS, FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as D, F, G, L, R, S, and T, so I is on the same block as Z. Furthermore, I and Z are on block 2, 3, or 4.
From the word ZEST, we conclude that Z is not on the same block as E (block 2), so Z is on block 3 or 4.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that G and R are not on the same block as E (block 2), and O (block 3), so G and R are on block 1 or 4, but not on the same block.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 or 4), so I is on block 2 or 3. Since Z is on block 3 or 4, I and Z must be on block 3. Now we have all six letters of block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that L is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 and 4), so L is on block 2.
From the words FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that F, G, L, R, and T are not on the same block as L (block 2), and from the word ZEST, we conclude that S is not on the same block as E (block 2). So D must be on block 2.
Now we have all six letters of block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
From the words GIRL and DIGS, we conclude that G is not on the same block as R and S.
From the words FLIT and ZEST, we conclude that T is not on the same block as F and S.

76,"Question: With the death of Arthur Minit, the legendary country of MADADIA's only clock maker, no one else had much experience yet with making clocks. The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.
The Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?
 Hint: Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way. When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way.","Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way.

When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way. First look at the hour-hands that are at the twelve. One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes. The fast hand then has progressed 60+x minutes. For the time x that passed, then holds: (60+x)/12 = x. This means that x = 5 5/11 minutes.
For the minutes-hands that start at six holds the same. The confused clock therefore shows the correct time again at 5 5/11 minutes past 7.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

– the fast spindle (one revolution per hour) be called F,  
– the slow spindle (one revolution per 12 h) be called S.

Because the hands were interchanged, the short “hour–hand’’ is fixed to F and the long “minute–hand’’ is fixed to S.

Idea of the hint  
Imagine that, mounted on the same spindles, there is a second (ghost) pair of hands that moves in the correct way:

        spindle F carries a ghost minute–hand (speed 1 rev/h);
        spindle S carries a ghost hour–hand  (speed 1 rev/12 h).

At the instant the clock is started (6 : 00) the wrong pair and the ghost pair coincide.  
The clock will look correct again when, for the first time after that, the two pairs coincide once more.

Relative motion

•  On spindle F  
  – wrong hand : 1 rev/h (short)  
  – ghost hand : 1 rev/h (long)

  Speeds are equal, so they stay together forever.  
  (They start coincident and never separate.)

•  On spindle S  
  – wrong hand : 1 rev/12 h (long)  
  – ghost hand : 1 rev/12 h (short)

  Speeds are also equal, hence these two also stay together.

So each spindle on its own always looks right; the trouble is that the two hands are on the wrong spindles.  
Therefore the clock will read correctly when the hand on S (the long one) is where a minute-hand ought to be and the hand on F (the short one) is where an hour-hand ought to be – i.e. when the two spindles have swapped their roles compared with 6 : 00.

Let t be the number of hours after the start.

Angles (measured clockwise from 12 o’clock)

        spindle F : 360°·t          (because one revolution per hour)
        spindle S : 30°·t           (because one revolution per 12 h)

Correct (ghost) clock at that same instant would have

        minute–hand angle : 360°·fractional part of t
        hour–hand   angle : 30°·t.

For the display to be right we need

        30°·t  ≡ 360°·fractional(t)  (mod 360°).

Write t = n + f with integer n (whole hours) and 0 ≤ f < 1 (fractional hour).  
The congruence becomes

        30(n+f) ≡ 360f  (mod 360)
        n − 11f = 12k , k integer.

Solve for f:

        f = (n − 12k)/11 , 0 ≤ f < 1.

Smallest n giving a permissible f:

n = 0  → f = −12k/11.  Only k = 0 gives f = 0 (the starting moment).

n = 1  → f = (1 − 12k)/11.
          k = 0 gives f = 1/11 (≈ 0.0909), which lies in [0,1).

Hence the first new solution is

        t = n + f = 1 + 1/11 = 12/11 hours
          = 1 h + 60/11 min
          = 1 h 5 min 5/11 min
          = 1 h 5 min 27 3/11 s.

Starting from 6 : 00, the clock therefore shows the correct time again at

        7 : 05 : 27 3/11.

Step 2 – Count vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in each word  
one → 2 vowels (o, e)  
two → 1 vowel (o)  
three → 2 vowels (e, e)  
four → 2 vowels (o, u)  
five → 2 vowels (i, e)  
six → 1 vowel (i)

Step 3 – Check that this matches the sample scores  

Example 1: 5  3  2  1  6  
five (2) + three (2) + two (1) + one (2) + six (1) = 8 vowels → 8 points ✔

Example 2: 2  2  3  5  1  
two (1) + two (1) + three (2) + five (2) + one (2) = 8 vowels → 8 points ✔

Example 3: 6  5  4  3  2  
six (1) + five (2) + four (2) + three (2) + two (1) = 8 vowels → 8 points ✔

Example 4: 1  2  6  6  6  
one (2) + two (1) + six (1) + six (1) + six (1) = 6 vowels → 6 points ✔

Example 5: 2  2  5  6  6  
two (1) + two (1) + five (2) + six (1) + six (1) = 6 vowels → 6 points ✔

Thus the rule is: “Points = total number of vowels in the spelled-out dice values.”

Step 4 – Apply the rule to the requested roll 4  3  6  2  6  
four → 2 vowels  
three → 2 vowels  
six → 1 vowel  
two → 1 vowel  
six → 1 vowel  
Total vowels = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

78,"Question: Five pirates are trying to split up 1000 gold pieces.  The rules are as follows:
Pirate #1 must divide the gold up in such a way that a majority of the pirates (including himself) agree to.  If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.
 Hint: Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?",Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?,"Like the hint says, start backwards:
If there are two pirates left (#4 & #5), #4 has no options.  No matter what he proposes, pirate #5 will disagree, resulting in a 1-1 vote (no majority).  #5 will kill #4 and will keep all of the gold.
Now say there are 3 pirates left.  #4 has to agree with whatever #3 decides, because if he doesn't #3 will be killed (because #5 won't vote for #3's proposal no matter what it is).  #3 will just propose that he keep all of the gold and will get a 2-1 vote in his favor.
Now if there are 4 pirates left:
#3 won't vote for #2's proposal because if #2's fails, #3 will get all of the gold. #4 and #5 know that they will get nothing if the decision goes to #3, so they will vote for #2's proposal if he gives them one gold piece each. Therefore, #2 would keep 998 gold, and #4 and #5 would each get one gold.
So let's wrap this up:
Pirate #1 needs 2 other votes.  He will not get a vote from #2 because #2 will get 998 gold if #1's plan fails.
#1 offers #3 one gold piece to vote for him, which #3 will accept (if it gets to #2's plan, #3 will get nothing).
#1 then offers #4 or #5 (doesn't matter which) two gold pieces, which is more than they would get with #2's plan.
So #1 can end up with 997 gold pieces, with #3 getting one piece and #4 or #5 getting two pieces.
...whew!",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Label the pirates, from the one who speaks first to the last, as  

P1 (Pirate #1) – P2 – P3 – P4 – P5.

Assume every pirate orders the possible outcomes in this strict priority:

1. Stay alive.  
2. Get as much gold as possible.  
3. If the above two items are tied, prefer to have more other pirates dead (they are “infinitely ruthless”).

Because they are perfectly logical, every pirate knows how every other pirate will vote.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Work backwards
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1 pirate left  
Only P5 is alive, so he keeps all 1000 coins.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2 pirates left (P4 proposes to P5)  
A majority of 2 is 2 votes, so P4 needs P5’s approval.

• If P5 votes NO, P4 is killed and P5 then has 1000 coins.  
• Any offer P4 can make gives P5 ≤ 1000 coins while letting P4 live.  
  Same gold, fewer deaths if he says NO → P5 will always vote NO.  

Hence P4 cannot survive; he is doomed.

Result if it ever gets to two pirates:  
P4 dies, P5 gets 1000.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3 pirates left (P3 proposes to P4 & P5)  
A majority of 3 is 2 votes.  P3 already has his own vote, so he needs
one more.

• If the proposal fails, P3 is killed and we reach the “two–pirate” case, in which P4 is also killed and P5 pockets 1000.  
  So P4’s alternative is death, while P5’s alternative is life with 1000.

– P4 will therefore accept any plan that lets him live (even 0 gold).  
– P5 will reject any plan (he prefers 1000 coins and one more corpse).

So P3 buys only P4:

Plan:  P3 keeps 1000, gives P4 0, P5 0.  
Votes:  P3 (YES), P4 (YES), P5 (NO) → passes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4 pirates left (P2 proposes to P3, P4, P5)  
A majority of 4 is 3 votes; P2 needs two others.

If the plan fails we get the 3–pirate result just found:

P3 1000, P4 0, P5 0.

• P3 therefore will vote NO to anything (he already expects 1000 and prefers P2 dead).  
• P4’s fall-back is 0 coins and life. Give him 1 coin and he is better off.  
• P5’s fall-back is also 0 coins and life. Give him 1 coin and he is better off.

So P2 buys P4 and P5 as cheaply as possible:

Plan:  P2 998, P3 0, P4 1, P5 1.  
Votes:  P2, P4, P5 → 3 YES → passes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5 pirates left (P1 proposes to P2, P3, P4, P5)  
A majority of 5 is 3 votes; P1 needs two others.

If the plan fails we get the 4-pirate outcome:

P2 998, P3 0, P4 1, P5 1.

Consider each pirate’s fall-back:

• P2 : 998 coins, alive.  P1 cannot outbid that, and P2 prefers P1 dead if coins tie → P2 will always vote NO.  
• P3 : 0 coins, alive.  Offer him 1 coin and he is better off even though P1 survives.  
• P4 : 1 coin, alive.  For him to vote YES he must receive strictly more than 1 coin (otherwise he’d prefer P1 dead).  
  The cheapest bribe is 2 coins.  
• P5 : identical to P4.

P1 needs any two of {P3, P4, P5}.  The cheapest pair is P3 (1 coin) plus either P4 or P5 (2 coins).

Choose P3 and P4, for example.

Plan proposed by P1  
P1 : 997  
P2 :   0  
P3 :   1  
P4 :   2  
P5 :   0  

Votes: P1 (YES), P3 (YES – 1 > 0), P4 (YES – 2 > 1) ⇒ 3 YES out of 5 ⇒ plan passes.

Any plan giving P1 more than 997 would fail, because at least 3 coins are
needed to secure the two extra votes.

SQ Root of 25 = 5",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step-by-step explanation  

1.  Think of the numbers 3 and 4 not as ordinary summands on a straight line, but as the perpendicular sides of a right-angled triangle (or, equivalently, as two perpendicular vectors whose lengths are 3 and 4).  

2.  When two perpendicular segments of lengths a and b are “added’’ head-to-tail, the length of the single segment that completes the rectangle—the hypotenuse—is  

      √(a² + b²).  

3.  If a = 3 and b = 4, we get  

      √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5.  

4.  Thus, in the geometric sense of putting the two segments together at right angles, the “sum’’ 3 + 4 produces a single segment of length 5.  

So 3 + 4 = 5 is possible whenever the “+’’ sign is interpreted as the Pythagorean (right-angle) combination of two lengths rather than as ordinary straight-line addition.

L (50) multiplied by 2 equal C (100).
Divide C by 20 and you have V. Divide V by 5 and you have I.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the five letters of the word be  

L₁ L₂ L₃ L₄ L₅.  

Because the hint says “Roman numerals”, interpret every letter as one of the seven Roman–numeral symbols and give it its usual value:

I = 1, V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, D = 500, M = 1000.

1. “Multiply my fifth by two and you have my first.”  
   So Value(L₁) = 2 × Value(L₅).

   Among Roman-numeral values the pairs that satisfy this are  
   (X, V), (C, L), (M, D).

2. “Divide my first by twenty and you have my third.”  
   So Value(L₃) = Value(L₁) ÷ 20.

   Test each candidate pair:

   • L₁ = X (10) → 10/20 = 0.5 (not a Roman numeral) → reject.  
   • L₁ = C (100) → 100/20 = 5 → V (valid).  
   • L₁ = M (1000) → 1000/20 = 50 → L (valid).

   Thus we have two remaining cases:

   Case A: L₁ = C, L₃ = V, L₅ = L.  
   Case B: L₁ = M, L₃ = L, L₅ = D.

3. “Divide my third by five and you have my second or fourth.”  
   So Value(L₂) = Value(L₄) = Value(L₃) ÷ 5.

   • Case A: L₃ = V (5) → 5/5 = 1 → I.  
     Hence L₂ = I and L₄ = I.  
     The letters become C I V I L → “CIVIL”, a real English word.

   • Case B: L₃ = L (50) → 50/5 = 10 → X.

The killer's sister was suspicious of her sibling and confirmed her distrust by talking to three people: her grandfather Bob, her cousin Bo, and her uncle (blood relative) Bill. She called the police, and the suspect was apprehended at the victim's funeral service. Only the direct descendants and their spouses were present. (Note: None of Mary's grandchildren were married or had kids, and no two people have the same first name.)
1. Bill was talking with his brother-in-law Barry.
2. Bart, Buck, and Bruce (who were all brothers) were by their grandmother's casket.
3. Mary's daughter May, who was with her husband Ben, had their two children: Missy and Bernie.
4. Mo, Bob's son-in-law, was comforting his wife Robin, and both were keeping an eye on their sons.
5. Bo was by himself in a corner grieving, while his sister Molly was talking with their cousin Megan.

From clue 1 and 2, Barry was a spouse, and since Bart, Buck and Bruce were all brothers, they were the set of three kids. Clue 3 is straightforward - Mary's daughter May is married to Ben and has two kids: Missy and Bernie.
From 4, Robin is a daughter and Bob her spouse.  From 5, Bo and Molly are siblings and grandchildren (since they have a cousin present). Megan has to be from the last couple.  Mo and Robin could only have been parents to the three boys (Bart Bruce and Buck), since all other siblings were a boy and girl.
Clue 6 gives the name of the remaining child, Brad, who must be a sibling of Megan. Both have a mother by the name of Myra. It is unknown at this point if Myra is a spouse or a direct relative.
Since clue 7 says that Bob (Mary's husband) was with his daughter Maria, Myra becomes a spouse. Then, by default, Bo and Molly belong to Maria.
So now, knowing that the killer's sister is COUSIN to Bo, Bill's NIECE, and Bob's GRANDDAUGHTER, the killer must be BERNIE.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 1 – set up the generations  
Because only “the direct descendants and their spouses” were present, everyone at the funeral belongs to one of three generations.  
G-0 (grandparents):   Bob and the victim, Mary Beem.  
G-1 (their four children) ─ each married.  
G-2 (the nine grandchildren).

Step 2 – place the four G-1 couples and their children  

(1) Bill talking with his brother-in-law Barry  
→ Bill and Barry are related by marriage through one of Bob & Mary’s daughters.

(2) Bart, Buck and Bruce are three brothers (same parents).  
Exactly one couple must have three children (note below the problem).  
(4) says Robin & Mo were “keeping an eye on their sons”, so Robin & Mo must be the couple whose three children are Bart, Buck and Bruce.

(3) gives another family directly:  
May (daughter of Mary) + husband Ben → children Missy and Bernie.

So far:
• Robin + Mo → Bart, Buck, Bruce  
• May + Ben → Missy, Bernie  

We still need two other G-1 couples.

(4) already tells us that Robin is Bob’s daughter, so she is one of the four children.  
(3) tells us May is another.  
(7) places daughter Maria beside Bob, so Maria is the third child.  
We need one more child; the remaining adult name that has not been tied down to G-1 or G-2 is Bill.  Since Bill is a “blood-relative uncle” of the grandchildren (introduction), he must be one of Bob & Mary’s children.  Thus the four Beem children are

1. Robin      2. May      3. Maria      4. Bill

Now attach the remaining spouses according to the clues:

• Robin’s husband is Mo (clue 4).  
• May’s husband is Ben (clue 3).  
• Maria’s husband must be Barry (so that Barry is brother-in-law to Bill; clue 1).  
• Bill’s wife, the only adult woman left, is Myra (clue 6).

Step 3 – distribute the still-unnamed grandchildren  

Robin & Mo already have Bart, Buck, Bruce (the only 3-child family).  
May & Ben already have Missy, Bernie.  (Total so far = 5 grandchildren)

From clue 5, Bo and Molly are brother and sister, and their cousin is Megan.  
Put Bo & Molly with the remaining couple that has no children yet, Maria & Barry.

That leaves Bill & Myra to have two children, one of whom is already named in clue 6 (Brad).  The other must be Megan (so that Megan is cousin, not sister, to Bo & Molly).

Check the count:  
Robin & Mo:  Bart, Buck, Bruce  (3)  
May  & Ben:  Missy, Bernie       (2)  
Maria & Barry: Bo, Molly         (2)  
Bill  & Myra: Brad, Megan        (2)  
Total = 9 grandchildren, as required.

Step 4 – identify the “killer’s sister”  

The sister who became suspicious talked to:  
• her grandfather Bob – fits any grandchild,  
• her cousin Bo – so she is NOT Bo or Molly,  
• her uncle Bill – so Bill must be her parent’s brother, not her father.

The only female grand-child who satisfies “Bill is my uncle” and “Bo is my cousin” is Missy (daughter of May).  Therefore Missy is the “killer’s sister”.

Step 5 – name Missy’s only sibling → the killer  

Missy’s sibling is her brother Bernie.  Hence Bernie is the angry relative who shot Mary Beem.

B = Biology,  
C = Chemistry,  
H = History,

Because each boy takes exactly three of the four subjects, each one is characterized by the single subject he does ​not​ take.

I.  Edward’s statements  
E1  “There is just one subject we’re all taking.” – given to be TRUE.  
E3  “No two of us are taking the same three subjects.”  
  If the boys all share exactly one common subject, then their three–subject sets must be pair-wise different (otherwise two identical sets would make the intersection at least two subjects). Hence E3 is TRUE.  
Edward must have exactly two true statements, so the remaining two (E2, E4) are FALSE.

• E2 FALSE ⇒ Edward is ​not​ the lone student taking mathematics (either he lacks M or someone else also has M).  
• E4 is the negation of John’s statement J4; since E4 is FALSE, J4 must be TRUE:  
  “Both Howard and Edward are taking chemistry.”

Thus both Edward and Howard take Chemistry.

II.  John’s statements  
J4 is TRUE (just found).  
J3  “Ed is taking one subject that I’m not.”  
If the three subject–sets are different, Edward necessarily has John’s missing subject, so J3 is TRUE.  
Hence John already has his two true statements (J3, J4); therefore  

J1  “We’re all taking mathematics” is FALSE → not everyone has M.  
J2  “Howard is taking history” is FALSE → Howard does ​not​ have H.

III.  Distinct missing subjects  
With only one common subject, the boys must miss three different subjects.  
Since Howard lacks History (from J2 false) and both Edward and Howard have Chemistry (from J4 true), the only possible pattern of “missing subjects” is  

Edward missing M  
Howard missing H  
John  missing C

(checking other choices quickly violates previous conclusions).

IV.  Filling in the actual sets  
Edward: missing M ⇒ takes B, C, H.  
Howard: missing H ⇒ takes B, C, M.  
John:   missing C ⇒ takes B, H, M.

V.  Howard’s statements  
H2 “John and I are taking the same subjects” is FALSE (sets differ).  
H1 “Ed is the only one taking history” is FALSE (John also has H).  
H3 “We’re all taking biology” is TRUE (all have B).  
H4 “Two of us are taking both chemistry and biology” is TRUE (Edward and Howard).  
Thus Howard has exactly two true statements, as required.

Every boy now has precisely two true and two false statements, and the intersection of all three sets is exactly one subject (Biology).

Subjects each boy is taking  

Edward : Biology, Chemistry, History  
Howard : Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics  
John   : Biology, History,   Mathematics

Final answer:  
Edward takes Biology, Chemistry and History;  
Howard takes Biology, Chemistry and Mathematics;  
John takes Biology, History and Mathematics.",True,1,0,0
86,"Question: During one meeting with a clan of ninjas, it has been noticed that more ninjas have turned up to the meeting than usual. The ninjas realised that these infiltrators must be the enemy of the ninjas (the pirates). Each person dressed as a ninja at the meeting made a statement. The cunning ninjas lied about their fellow ninjas in order to remain secret and told the truth about the pirates. The pirates tried to mock the cunningness by lying about the pirates and telling the truth about the ninjas. From the following statements, can you identify the ninjas and pirates?
Ninja A: Ninja B is a ninja
Ninja B: Ninja C belongs to Ninja A's group
Ninja C: Ninja C doesn't belong to Ninja F's group
Ninja D: Ninja A belongs to Ninja B's group
Ninja E: Ninja B belongs to Ninja C's group
Ninja F: Ninja E belongs to Ninja A's group
Remember, the ninjas and pirates will lie about individual ninjas or pirates, not groups of ninjas or pirates.
 Hint: Think about what Ninja A said, first.","Think about what Ninja A said, first.","Ninja A is a pirate
Ninja B is a ninja
Ninja C is a ninja
Ninja D is a pirate
Ninja E is a pirate
Ninja F is a ninja
Ninja A said that Ninja B is a ninja. This is because Ninja A is a pirate and Ninja B is a ninja, so Ninja A told the truth.
Ninja B said that Ninja C belongs to Ninja A's group. Ninja B is a ninja and Ninja C is a ninja, so Ninja B lied.
Ninja C said that Ninja C doesn't belong to Ninja F's group. Ninja C is obviously from the same group as Ninja C, so Ninja C lied.
Ninja D said that Ninja A belongs to Ninja B's group. Ninja D is a pirate and Ninja A is a pirate so Ninja D lied.
Ninja E said that Ninja B belongs to Ninja C's group. Ninja E is a pirate and Ninja B is a ninja, so Ninja E told the truth.
Ninja F said that Ninja E belongs to Ninja A's group. Ninja F is a ninja and Ninja E is a pirate, so Ninja F told the truth.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Reasoning step-by-step  

1.  Look first at Ninja A’s utterance:  “Ninja B is a ninja.”  
   •  If A were a ninja, the sentence would be “about a ninja.”  
      Ninjas lie about ninjas, so A would have to utter something false – i.e. say B is a ninja when B is really a pirate.  
   •  If A were a pirate, the rule is reversed – pirates speak truth about ninjas and lie about pirates – so A could be telling the truth (if B really is a ninja) or lying (if B is a pirate).  
   Either way, only a pirate can possibly say the sentence, so  
   A is a pirate.

2.  Split into the two logical sub-cases allowed by A’s statement.  
   •  Case 1:  B is a ninja (A told the truth about a ninja).  
   •  Case 2:  B is a pirate (A lied about a pirate).

Case 2 can be shown impossible very quickly, but we will proceed with Case 1 and see it works:

────────────────────────────────────────
Assume  A = Pirate,  B = Ninja
────────────────────────────────────────
Statement 2 (spoken by B, about C):

   “C belongs to A’s group”  ⇔  C is a pirate.

   – Speaker B is a ninja.  
   – The subject of the sentence is C.  
   – If C is a ninja, B must lie; if C is a pirate, B must tell the truth.

   Consistency therefore requires C to be a ninja (so that B is lying).
   Thus  C = Ninja.

Statement 3 (spoken by C, about C):

   “C doesn’t belong to F’s group”  ⇔  C ≠ F.

   – Speaker C is a ninja; the statement concerns the ninja C himself.  
   – Ninjas lie about ninjas, so the sentence must be false ⇒ C = F.
   Hence  F = Ninja.

Statement 6 (spoken by F, about E):

   “E belongs to A’s group”  ⇔  E is a pirate.

   – Speaker F is a ninja, subject E is at present unknown.  
   – If E is a pirate (subject pirate) the ninja must tell the truth, so the
     sentence must be true → E really is a pirate – consistent.  
   – If E were a ninja, F would have to lie, making the sentence false, which
     would force E to be a ninja and A a pirate – a contradiction.  
   Therefore  E = Pirate.

Statement 5 (spoken by E, about B):

   “B belongs to C’s group”  ⇔  B = C (both ninjas).

   – Speaker E is a pirate, subject B is a ninja.  
   – Pirates tell the truth about ninjas, so the sentence must be true.  
   – Indeed B and C are both ninjas – consistent.

Statement 4 (spoken by D, about A):

   “A belongs to B’s group”  ⇔  A = B (pirate = ninja) – this is false.

   – The subject is A, who is a pirate.  
   – To make a false sentence about a pirate one must be a pirate
     (pirates lie about pirates).  
   Hence  D = Pirate.

All six statements now obey the given lying/truth rules, so the assignment is consistent:

   A  – Pirate  
   B  – Ninja  
   C  – Ninja  
   D  – Pirate  
   E  – Pirate  
   F  – Ninja

(If the alternative initial sub-case B = Pirate is followed, it soon leads to a contradiction with Statement 6, so the above assignment is in fact the only possibility.)

Final answer:  A, D and E are pirates;  B, C and F are ninjas.",True,1,0,0

 Hint: One is the word ""useful"".","One is the word ""useful"".",Otiose and useful.,GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1.  Each digit 1–6 can be any one of four letters:

   1 → {O U D B}
   2 → {S K Q T}
   3 → {I H E N}
   4 → {O I F W}
   5 → {Z U Y S}
   6 → {I L E C}

2.  We must turn the six-digit string 123456 into two different 6-letter words that are antonyms.

3.  The hint tells us that one of the words is “USEFUL”.  
    Check that “USEFUL” fits the chart:

      1 → U   (allowed)  
      2 → S   (allowed)  
      3 → E   (allowed)  
      4 → F   (allowed)  
      5 → U   (allowed)  
      6 → L   (allowed)  

    So “USEFUL” is indeed a legal decoding of 123456.

4.  We now look for another legal decoding whose meaning is opposite to “useful”.  
    Scan candidate words made from the allowed letters:

      1st letter must be O, U, D, or B  
      2nd letter must be S, K, Q, or T  
      3rd letter must be I, H, E, or N  
      4th letter must be O, I, F, or W  
      5th letter must be Z, U, Y, or S  
      6th letter must be I, L, E, or C  

    The word “OTIOSE” (meaning “useless”) fits perfectly:

      1 → O  
      2 → T  
      3 → I  
      4 → O  
      5 → S  
      6 → E  

    “Otiose” is an English adjective meaning idle, ineffective, or useless—exactly the opposite of “useful”.

5.  Therefore the two antonymous words represented by 123456 are “USEFUL” and “OTIOSE”.

The only condition for the cubes is

• every word must be obtainable by putting the four cubes side-by-side,

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Putting the letter E

E occurs in   MAZE, MOVE, NOTE, FEAR, JOKE, KNEW, TYPE, LIFE.  
So no letter of any of these eight words can be on the same cube as E.  
Hence E must share a cube only with the seven letters

      {B, C, D, H, Q, S, U}.

For the six words that do NOT contain E we may not put two of their
letters together with E, otherwise that word would need two equal cubes.

They must be distributed over three cubes of six letters each so that
no two letters of any one word land on the same cube together with the

1.  Put a guard at (1,1) and the other guard at (3,2).

    (2,2)   (needed for the guard at (3,2)).  

3.  By clue 5 the ship must share the row of one guard and the column of the other.  
    Row of the guard at (3,2) is row 3, column of the guard at (1,1) is column 1,

  D = Degas, M = Monet, Ps = Pissaro, S = Sisley.  

Total prints = 18, each artist ≤ 6; every room has ≥ 2 prints.

Step 1.  From 5 & 6 the kitchen holds no D, no M, no S, so every kitchen print is Ps.  
Let T be the number hung in the kitchen; 1 tells us P also has T prints.  
Thus K = T Ps and |K| = |P| = T (with T ≥ 2).

Step 2.  From 5, total M = total D + T.  
From 3, total S = total D + |De|.

Step 3.  Use the 18-print total:

 total D + total M + total Ps + total S = 18  
 ⇒ total D + (total D+T) + total Ps + (total D+|De|) = 18  
 ⇒ 3·total D + T + |De| + total Ps = 18.        (★)

Also total Ps ≥ T+1 (because kitchen already has T Ps and Di must have at least one).

Step 4.  Trial values of T:

T = 6 impossible (Ps would exceed 6).  
T = 5 forces total Ps = 6, but then ★ gives 3·total D+|De|=7, leaving too few Degas to meet clue 4.  
T = 4 is feasible.

Take T = 4.  Then ★ becomes 14 – 3·total D – |De| = total Ps, with total Ps = 5 or 6.

Choose total Ps = 6 ⇒ 3·total D + |De| = 8.

Because Degas cannot appear in the den (clue 2), |De| ≥ 2 and total D ≤ 4, so the only integer solution is  
 total D = 2 and |De| = 2.

Now

total M = total D + T = 2 + 4 = 6,  
total S = total D + |De| = 2 + 2 = 4.

Step 5.  Place the restricted counts.

Kitchen K: 4 Ps  
Den De: no D, no S, total 2 → must be 2 M.

Dining room must contain the only 2 Degas prints and at least 1 Ps; to have fewer prints than the parlor (clue 4) it must hold exactly 3 prints:

Dining Di: 2 D, 1 Ps.

We have now used: D 2, M 2, Ps 5, S 0.

Remaining to place: D 0, M 4, Ps 1, S 4.

Step 6.  The room with the lone “2 D” prints (Dining) has 3 prints; the room with 3 S must have more than the parlor’s 4 prints (clue 4), so the bedroom is that room:

Bedroom B: 3 S + ? = at least 5 prints.

Parlor already has 4 prints; let  
MP = # Monet in Parlor and, from 1, MB = MP (same number in Bedroom).

Let PP, PB, PD be the remaining Ps to place in P, B, De (but De already full), and there is exactly one Ps left.  Trying PP = 1 works perfectly:

Parlor P: 1 S, 1 Ps, 2 M (=4 prints)  
Bedroom B: 3 S, 2 M (=5 prints)  
Den De: 2 M (already set).

All totals now tally:

Artist totals D 2, M 6, Ps 6, S 4 (each ≤6)  
Room totals K 4, P 4, B 5, Di 3, De 2 (sum 18, each ≥2)  
All six clues are satisfied.

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  
and write the digit in position i as dᵢ.  

Known facts to translate into equations / conditions:

1) Digits 0–9 all used once and dᵢ ≠ i for i = 1…9 (0 can never equal its index).  
2) d₃ = 0.  
3) d₅ + d₁₀ is a square ≠ 9 ⇒ d₅ + d₁₀ ∈ {4, 16}.  
4) d₉ + d₁₀ is a cube ⇒ d₉ + d₁₀ = 8 (1 is impossible because 0 is already at position 3).  
5) d₂ is even.  
6) d₄ + d₆ + d₈ < 10.  
7) d₂ + d₅ is triangular ⇒ d₂ + d₅ ∈ {3, 6, 10, 15}.  
8) 8 is two places away from 9.  
9) 3 is adjacent to 9 but not adjacent to 0 (so the digit 3 is not in positions 2 or 4).

Step 1:  Locate 9, 8 and 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––
Let p₉ be the position of digit 9, p₈ the position of 8 and p₃ the position of 3.

• p₈ = p₉ ± 2.  
• p₃ = p₉ ± 1, with p₃ ≠ 2, 4 (because 3 must not be next to the zero in position 3).

Listing all ten possibilities for p₉ (1…10) and eliminating the ones that break any rule quickly leaves only one viable “geography”:

p₉ = 5 , p₈ = 7 , p₃ = 6  

So we now know

position 5 → 9  
position 6 → 3  
position 7 → 8  
position 3 → 0  

Step 2:  Use the square & cube sums
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
d₅ = 9, so d₅ + d₁₀ must be 16 (the only square ≠ 9 that works), hence d₁₀ = 7.

The cube condition gives d₉ + d₁₀ = 8 ⇒ d₉ + 7 = 8 ⇒ d₉ = 1.

Current board:

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  
?  ?  0  ?  9  3  8  ?  1   7

Digits already used: 0,1,3,7,8,9  
Digits left: 2,4,5,6  

Step 3:  Use the small-sum condition d₄ + d₆ + d₈ < 10
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
d₆ = 3, so d₄ + d₈ ≤ 6.

The remaining digits {2,4,5,6} must fill positions 1,2,4,8 with the extra caveat
d₂ is even and no digit equals its own position.

Possible (d₄,d₈) pairs whose sum ≤ 6 are:

• (2,4)  (sum 6)  
• (4,2)  (sum 6)

But d₄ cannot be 4 (digit equals the index 4), so only

d₄ = 2 , d₈ = 4

remains.

Step 4:  Finish the last two positions (1 and 2)
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Remaining digits: 5 and 6.  
d₂ must be even and cannot be 2, so d₂ = 6 and therefore d₁ = 5.

Step 5:  Check the triangular sum
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
d₂ + d₅ = 6 + 9 = 15, and 15 is a triangular number (T₅).

Everything now satisfies every rule:

Position :  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

• all digits 0-9 present once;  
• no digit equals its position;  
• d₅+d₁₀ = 9+7 = 16 (square, not 9);  
• d₉+d₁₀ = 1+7 = 8 (cube);  
• d₂ even; d₃ = 0;  
• d₄+d₆+d₈ = 2+3+4 = 9 (<10);  
• d₂+d₅ = 6+9 = 15 (triangular);  
• 8 (pos 7) is two away from 9 (pos 5);

8:00 Francine Novak, Sausalito, Financial Adviser
The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15 (10). Jaspersen's segment was in the second half (8). The beekeeper was in the first half, and was either 6:45 or 7:00 (8). Since Krieger was at 7:45 (3), then Jaspersen was at 7:30. This leaves the beekeeper at 6:45 (8). The antique car collector has to be at 7:00 (1).
The financial adviser isn't Jaspersen or Kreiger (7), and is therefore on during the 8:00 segment. Likewise, Morley can't be at 8:00 (7), or in the first two segments (4); thus Morley has to be at 7:15. This puts Alice at 7:00 and Oakland at 6:45 (4). This also puts Ivens at 6:45 and Berkeley at 7:15 (1).
The two guests in the 6:45 and 7:15 segments are neither Novak, from Daly City or Palo Alto, or interested in bungee jumping. Therefore, these guests must be Cathy and Damien (6). Therefore, Brandon is at 7:30, the chef at 7:45, and the guest from Sausalito at 8:00 (9). The bungee jumper, who must be at 7:30, cannot be from Daly City or Palo Alto, and so is from Corte Madera (6). Alice must be from either Daly City or Palo Alto, so cannot have a last name of Novak (6).
Therefore, Lautremont is in the 7:00 time slot and Novak is the 8:00 time slot. Damien was at 6:45 (2), leaving Cathy at 7:15.

• the three positions in the row be (from left to right) Position 1, Position 2, Position 3.  
• the sportsmen’s numbers (single digits 2-9, all different) written in that same order form a three–digit perfect square (Clue 1).

Step 1 – List the admissible perfect squares  
Among the 3-digit squares of 10²–31², the ones whose digits are all 2-9 and pairwise different are

256, 289, 324, 529, 576, 625, 729, 784.

Step 2 – Use the “factorial + 1” property (Clue 4)  
We need a pair (Sam’s number n, red-suit number r) with  
r > n and r | (n! + 1).

Checking n = 2 … 8:

n = 2 → 2!+1 = 3  ⇒ (n,r) = (2,3)  
n = 3 → 3!+1 = 7  ⇒ (3,7)  
n = 4 → 4!+1 = 25 ⇒ (4,5)  
n = 6 → 6!+1 = 721 = 7·103 ⇒ (6,7)

(5, 7) and larger n give r > 9, not allowed.   
So the only possible pairs are (n,r) = (2,3), (3,7), (4,5), (6,7).

Step 3 – Keep the squares that contain both digits n and r  
256, 289, 324, 529, 625, 729, 784 do not contain both digits of any pair above.  
Only square 576 contains the pair (6,7).  
Therefore the only viable square is 576, with

digits (left → right) 5 ‑ 7 ‑ 6  
Sam’s number      n = 6 (so Sam is the right-hand man)  
red-suit number   r = 7.

Step 4 – Assign the colours  
Since the red suit carries number 7, the remaining numbers/colours are

number 5 : must be yellow (Clue 3 requires yellow to be odd)  
number 6 : therefore is blue (Sam cannot wear red by Clue 4).

Step 5 – Place the sportsmen and check Clue 2  
Row (left → right):

Position 1   number 5  → yellow suit  
Position 2   number 7  → red suit  
Position 3   number 6  → blue suit (Sam)

Tom’s number must be smaller than the rightmost number (Clue 2: 5 < 6), so

Tom = Position 1 (yellow 5)  
Jim = Position 2 (red 7)  
Sam = Position 3 (blue 6).

All clues verified:

1. 576 is a perfect square (24²).  
2. Tom’s 5 < Sam’s 6.  
3. Yellow suit’s number 5 is odd.  
4. 6! + 1 = 721, divisible by red-suit number 7.

He decided one year to hold a fishing tournament with the best fishers on the lake, each using a different casting lure.  5 men competed (Fred Farley was NOT one of them) and points were awarded in four categories to determine a winner:
Greatest total Weight of fish caught: 4 points
Greatest Number of fish caught: 3 points
Largest Fish: 2 points
Second-largest fish: 1 point
Winning more than one category: 1 bonus point
Two fishermen did not win any of the categories and first place ended up being a tie between two men who received the same amount of points.

2. Vick, who did not win the total weight category, did not use the spinner bait; nor did Mr. McNess.
3. The one that used the weighted jig, who was not Terry, did not win any of the categories.
4. Neither Sam nor Mr. Larson live near any of the other three contestants, nor did either use a spinner bait or deep-running crank bait.
5. The fisherman who won the largest-fish category, who was not Mr. Smith, used spinner bait.
6. Mr. Jones, who caught the most fish, did not use a deep-running crank bait.

8. A wounded-minnow was used as one of the casting lures, and Kevin was one of the contestants.
 Hint: Since only 3 of the contestants won the 4 categories, one of them won two and earned a bonus point.

From 4: Sam is not Larson or Black, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.  Mr. Larson is not Mike, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.
From 5: Mr. Smith did not win the largest fish or use the spinner bait. The largest fish was caught using the spinner bait.
Since Vick and Sam did not use the spinner, they did not win the largest fish category.  Since Mike won a category, he did not use the jig.
From 6: Mr. Jones won the most fish and, therefore, did not use the spinner bait, did not use the deep running crank bait either. Therefore, Black used the spinner and was the largest fish winner. Since Vick did not win the largest fish, by elimination, Kevin is Mr. Black.
From 7: Mr. McNess is not Terry and did not use a deep running crank bait. Therefore, Smith could have only used the crank bait.  Terry did not use a worm. Therefore, Vick used the worm and Sam used the weighted jig (and therefore won no category).
The worm (used by Vick) was thereby only used by either McNess or Jones, and since 2 says Vick is not Mc Ness, Vick is therefore Jones.
Terry, then, is Larson and won no category. Mike then wins the total weight category.
Then by summing up the leftover information, Terry uses the minnow and leaves Mike with the deep-running crank bait. That, in turn, makes Mike's last name Smith. Sam is then McNess.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

From the statements below identify each of the 5 Handy people's height (12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 hands) and their ages (100, 110, 120, 130 and 140 years).
TWIST: One statement is FALSE.
1. Har was not the oldest, nor was he the shortest or tallest.
2. Winn was taller than Edvo, who was taller but younger than Frer.
3. Tolo, who was not the second oldest, was older than Har, and shorter than Frer.
4. The one who was 13 hands tall was the oldest.
5. Har was taller and older than Winn and Tolo.
6. The fourth oldest was taller than Tolo, but shorter than Edvo, who was older than Winn.
 Hint:  it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true", it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true,"Edvo, 15 hands, 130 years
Frer, 13 hands, 140 years
Har, 14 hands, 110 years
Tolo, 12 hands, 120 years
Winn, 16 hands, 100 years
When going through all the statements, it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true. (3 says Tolo is older than Har while 5 says Har is older than Tolo.) 2 gives the order of height as Winn, Edvo, and Frer. If 5 is true, then Har must be the tallest, but this contradicts 1, therefore 5 is false.
From 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the order of height is Winn, Edvo, Frer, and Tolo - with Har somewhere in between but not the shortest or tallest. Therefore Winn is 16 hands, and Tolo is 12.
Since Har is not the oldest, he is not 13 hands, which makes Frer 13 hands and the oldest.
From 3 and 6, Tolo is not the 2nd or 4th oldest and is not the youngest. Therefore he becomes 120 years. Also from 6, Edvo is not the 4th oldest or youngest. Therefore he is 130 years.
Since the 4th oldest is shorter than Edvo, Har must be it at 110 years. And Winn is the youngest. Since the 4th oldest was shorter than Edvo, Har is 14 hands and Edvo is 15 hands.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Reasoning in detail

Let each Handy Person’s height be one of {12 h, 13 h, 14 h, 15 h, 16 h} and age one of {100 y, 110 y, 120 y, 130 y, 140 y}.  
Exactly one of the six given statements is false; the hint says statements 3 and 5 cannot both be true, so exactly one of them is the single false statement.

Take statements 1, 2, 4 and 6 as definitely true, and analyse both possibilities for 3/5:

• If 3 were false and 5 true, Tolo could not be the oldest, yet statement 5 would make Har older than Tolo; this quickly forces Tolo to be the oldest (contradiction).  
Therefore statement 5 is the false one and statement 3 is true.

Now the true statements give these constraints.

1. Har: not oldest (≠140 y); not shortest or tallest (height ≠12 h, ≠16 h).

2. Heights: Winn > Edvo > Frer.  
   Ages: Frer > Edvo.

3. Tolo: not 2nd-oldest (≠130 y); older than Har; shorter than Frer.

4. Height 13 h person is age 140 y (the oldest).

5. (False) Ignore.

6. Age 110 y person’s height is between Tolo’s and Edvo’s; Edvo older than Winn.

From 2 & 4 the oldest (height 13 h) cannot be Winn (he must be taller than Edvo) and cannot be Edvo (Frer is older than Edvo).  
Hence Frer is the oldest: Frer = 13 h & 140 y.

Then Edvo must be taller than 13 h and Winn still taller than Edvo, so the only viable height triple is  
 Frer 13 h, Edvo 15 h, Winn 16 h.

Because Tolo is shorter than Frer, Tolo must be 12 h; the only remaining height 14 h goes to Har.  
Har is now neither shortest nor tallest, exactly as statement 1 requires.

Statement 6 demands the age-110 person have a height strictly between Tolo’s (12 h) and Edvo’s (15 h); that height is 14 h, so Har is the 110-year-old.

Ages left to assign (with their constraints)

• Frer : 140 y (already set)  
• Har  : 110 y (fixed above)  
• Tolo : older than Har but not 130 y → 120 y  
• Edvo : older than Winn, younger than Frer → 130 y  
• Winn : the remaining age → 100 y

Check every true statement:

1. Har 14 h, 110 y – not oldest/shortest/tallest ✔  
2. Heights 16 h > 15 h > 13 h (W > E > F) and ages 140 y > 130 y (F > E) ✔  
3. Tolo 12 h shorter than Frer 13 h, 120 y older than Har 110 y, not 2nd-oldest ✔  
4. 13 h person (Frer) is 140 y ✔  
6. 110-year-old Har (14 h) is taller than Tolo (12 h) and shorter than Edvo (15 h); Edvo 130 y older than Winn 100 y ✔  

Statement 5 is clearly false (Har is NOT taller or older than Winn), satisfying the “one false statement” requirement.

Block 2: i, r, l, c, v, j
Block 3: n, e, d, g, q, w
Block 4: k, o, u, t, h, b",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the four cubes be called A, B, C and D.  
Because the letters on any one cube cannot be repeated when a word is spelled, the four different letters of every word must lie on four different cubes.  
The hint tells us that the letters n and e share the same cube, so put them on cube A.

1.  From the word pink = {p,i,n,k} with n on A, the other three letters must occupy the other three cubes.  
   Put p→B , i→C , k→D.

2.  rope = {r,o,p,e} with e on A and p on B forces r and o onto C and D (different from each other).  
   Choose r→C , o→D.

3.  quip = {q,u,i,p} now has i on C and p on B, so q and u must be on A and D in either order.  
   Keep q→A , u→D.

Up to this point
A : e n q   B : p   C : i r   D : k o u.

4.  dark = {d,a,r,k}.  Since r is on C and k on D, a and d must be on A and B, but have = {h,a,v,e} (with e on A) requires a not to be on A.  
   Hence a→B and d→A.

5.  site = {s,i,t,e}.  With i on C and e on A, s and t must be B and D; keep s→B , t→D.

6.  jest = {j,e,s,t}.  With e on A, s on B and t on D, j must go to C.  
   So j→C.

7.  cony = {c,o,n,y}.  n on A, o on D, so c and y must be B and C in some order; later wack will force c→C, y→B.

8.  wack = {w,a,c,k}.  We already have a on B, c cannot also be B, so c→C, and with k on D the only unused cube for w is A.  
   Hence w→A.

9.  tiny = {t,i,n,y}.  With t on D, i on C, n on A, y must be on B → y→B.

10.  have = {h,a,v,e}.  e on A, a on B, so h and v have to be C and D, but wish = {w,i,s,h} (w on A, i on C, s on B) forces h onto D.  
    Thus h→D and therefore v→C.

At this stage
A : e n q d w  
B : p a s y  
C : i r j c v  
D : k o u t h

We still need frog, goal, glum, bins and must bring every cube up to six letters.

11.  frog = {f,r,o,g}.  r is on C, o on D, so f and g must go on the two remaining cubes A and B.  But goal = {g,o,a,l} (o on D, a on B) forbids g from being on B, so g→A and f→B.

12.  goal now requires l to be on the only unused cube, namely C → l→C.

13.  glum = {g,l,u,m}.  We now have g on A, l on C, u on D, so m must be on B → m→B.

14.  bins = {b,i,n,s}.  i on C, n on A, s on B; b must go to D → b→D.

Every letter is now placed and each cube has six letters:

Cube A:  d e g n q w  
Cube B:  a f m p s y  
Cube C:  c i j l r v  
Cube D:  b h k o t u

One can check quickly that in every word its four letters indeed lie on four different cubes, and the hint (n and e together) is satisfied.

Cube 2: a f m p s y

Gun is the odd man out.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1.  Look at the words themselves rather than at their meanings.
2.  Ask: “In what simple way can every word be connected with a number?”
3.  The most immediate numerical property a word possesses is its length (the number of letters in it).
4.  Count the letters in each word.

   • Die  →  3 letters  
   • Day  →  3 letters  
   • Gee  →  3 letters  
   • Gun  →  3 letters  
   • Scale → 5 letters  

5.  Four of the words are 3-letter words, but one of them is not.
6.  Therefore the word whose length differs from the rest is the odd one out.

101,"Question: You are part of a group of 500 people who have been captured by an evil tribe. The tribe leader, who appreciates a person with good logic, decides that he will propose a challenge of many headband problems.
The first challenge is that each person will get a random headband of one of two colors, black or white. There are 500 of each (500 black and 500 white). If you look at yours or say a word after you have been given your headband and before you have guessed, the evil people will kill everybody. Also, if you make any movement with your body other than your eyes, you will ALL die.
At the count of 10, each person will shout out what color they think their headband is. If you or anyone else is right, you will survive for the next challenge.  If not, you will be killed immediately. You are given some time to discuss your strategy; then you are given your headbands.

Once you flip your 128 coins over, these ""tails"" will turn into ""heads"" and the two groups will have a matching number of heads-up coins.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1. You do not know which individual pennies are heads, but you do know the total number of heads on the whole table: 128.

2. While still blindfolded, pick any 128 pennies from the table.  
   • Call this set of 128 pennies pile A.  
   • All the remaining pennies form pile B.

3. Let h be the (unknown) number of heads that happened to be in pile A when you grabbed those 128 coins.  
   • Because there are 128 heads altogether, pile B must then contain 128 − h heads.

4. Now flip every coin in pile A (turn heads to tails and tails to heads).

5. What is the head count in each pile after the flip?  
   • In pile A: the h original heads become tails; the 128 − h original tails become heads.  
     Thus pile A now has 128 − h heads.  
   • In pile B: you never touched these coins, so it still has 128 − h heads.

6. Therefore both piles have exactly the same number of heads (128 − h).

You have produced two subgroups with an equal number of heads without ever seeing the coins.

Final answer: Grab any 128 coins for the first pile, leave the rest for the second pile, then flip every coin in the first pile; the two piles will now contain the same number of heads.",True,1,0,0
104,"Question: Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
Manny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, ""I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.""
Moe answers, ""IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.""
Jack thinks for a bit, and then says, ""Now I know all of our numbers.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.
What numbers does she say they each are holding?
 Hint: Do casework on what Moe can have.",Do casework on what Moe can have.,"Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.
From Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.
There are 12 triples for (Manny, Moe, Jack) that satisfy all three statements. They are:
(1, 2, 11)
(1, 6, 7)
(1, 10, 3)
(3, 2, 9)
(3, 6, 5)
(3, 10, 1)
(5, 2, 7)
(5, 6, 3)
(7, 2, 5)
(7, 6, 1)
(9, 2, 3)
(11, 2, 1)
Since Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.

last-two(W₂)  = first-two(W₃)  
…

and each word must fit its clue.

Step 1 – look for “obvious” clues.  
Clue 4 “Steps for passing over a fence” is almost surely STILE.  
STILE ends in “le”, so word 5 must start with “le”.  
Clue 5 “Lawful” → LEGAL, which starts “le” and ends “al”.  
Word 6 must start “al”, and Clue 6 “Solitary” → ALONE (“al…ne”).  
Now word 7 starts “ne”; Clue 7 “A musical Roman emperor” is NERO.  
NERO ends “ro”, so word 8 starts “ro”; Clue 8 “A bird” → ROBIN.  
ROBIN ends “in”, so word 9 starts “in”; Clue 9 “To bury” → INTER.  
INTER ends “er”, so word 10 starts “er”; Clue 10 “To eat into” → ERODE.  
ERODE ends “de”, so word 1 must start “de”.  
Returning to Clue 1 “To prevent by fear” gives DETER (“de…er”), and its last two letters “er” match the “er” we already used to begin word 2.

Step 2 – find word 2.  
We now know word 1 (DETER) ends “er”, so word 2 must start “er”.  
Among the nine muses, only ERATO starts with “Er…”. It ends “to”, making word 3 start “to”.  
Clue 3 “Often on the breakfast table” → TOAST, which ends “st” and dovetails perfectly with the “st” that begins STILE, the word we started with.

The complete cyclic chain is therefore

1. DETER – to prevent by fear  
2. ERATO – one of the muses  
3. TOAST – often on the breakfast table  
4. STILE – steps for passing over a fence  
5. LEGAL – lawful  
6. ALONE – solitary  
7. NERO – a musical Roman emperor  
8. ROBIN – a bird  
9. INTER – to bury  
10. ERODE – to eat into

110,"Question: The five-person city council of Noyes Heights met recently to vote on five proposals. Each of the five council members cast an aye or a nay vote for each of the five proposals, with no abstentions. Use the clues below to discover how each council member voted on each of the proposals.
1. Each proposal got a different number of aye votes (possibly zero).
2. All in all, there was one more aye vote than nay vote cast.
3. At no time did Quincy vote nay on two consecutive proposals.
4. Orlando, Penny and Sven voted the same way on the second proposal.
5. Rosina voted aye on the fourth proposal.
6. Quincy and Sven voted differently from each other on each of the first three proposals.
7. The third proposal received one more aye vote than the second proposal did.

Penny - nay, aye, aye, aye, nay
Quincy - aye, nay, aye, aye, nay
Rosina - nay, nay, aye, aye, nay
Sven - nay, aye, nay, aye, nay",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the council members be  
 Orlando (O), Penny (P), Quincy (Q), Rosina (R) and Sven (S).  
For every proposal mark A = aye, N = nay.

Step 1.  Five different aye-totals, one for each proposal  
With five members the only possible numbers of ayes are 0-5.  
Since the six numbers 0+1+2+3+4+5 add to 15 and we are told the
overall number of ayes is 13, the missing total of ayes is 2.  
Hence the five different totals must be 0, 1, 3, 4 and 5.

Step 2.  Relating proposals 2 and 3  
Clue 7 says proposal 3 received one more aye than proposal 2, so  
(A2, A3) is either (0,1), (3,4) or (4,5).

Step 3.  Using the “three alike” condition on proposal 2  
Clue 4: O, P and S vote the same way on proposal 2.

• If they all vote N, then proposal 2 could have at most two ayes.  
  But 2 is the one total that never occurs, and 0 would force Q=N,  
  contradicting clue 6 (Q and S must differ).  
  Therefore O, P, S must all vote A on proposal 2, and S=A.

Thus Q must vote N on proposal 2 (clue 6) so A2 is 3 or 4.

Step 4.  Deciding between (A2,A3) = (3,4) or (4,5)  
If A2 = 4, then A3 = 5 and everyone would vote A on proposal 3.  
But then Q and S would agree on proposal 3, contradicting clue 6.  
Hence A2 = 3 and A3 = 4.

At proposal 2 we now have:
 O A P A Q N R N S A (three ayes).

Step 5.  Filling proposal 3 (needs 4 ayes)  
Q and S must differ, so S=N on proposal 3 and Q=A.  
With one aye already counted (Q), we need three more; hence  
O, P and R all vote A.  
 O A P A Q A R A S N (four ayes).

Step 6.  Tallying totals used so far  
Totals fixed: Proposal 2 → 3 ayes, proposal 3 → 4 ayes.  
The remaining totals 0, 1 and 5 belong to proposals 1, 4, 5.

Step 7.  Quincy’s “no two consecutive nays” rule  
Q has an N on proposal 2, so Q must vote A on proposal 1.  
Therefore proposal 1 cannot be the 0-aye proposal; it must have at
least Q’s single aye.  Give proposal 1 the 1-aye total.

That forces proposal 5 to have 0 ayes and proposal 4 to have 5 ayes
(the only totals still unused).

Step 8.  Writing the remaining proposals

Proposal 1 (1 aye) – we already know Q=A and everybody else N  
 O N P N Q A R N S N

Proposal 4 (5 ayes) – clue 5 requires R=A; the total must be 5, so
 O A P A Q A R A S A

Proposal 5 (0 ayes) – everybody votes N  
 O N P N Q N R N S N

Step 9.  Final checks  
• All five proposals have different aye-totals: 1, 3, 4, 5, 0.  
• Total ayes = 1+3+4+5+0 = 13, one more than the 12 nays.  
• Q’s nays (proposals 2 and 5) are not consecutive.  
• O, P, S are identical on proposal 2.  
• R is aye on proposal 4.  
• Q and S differ on proposals 1, 2 and 3.  
All clues are satisfied.

The complete voting record is therefore:

111,"Question: Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.
Unfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.
But in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.
But this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.
But the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.
Unfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.
Let's sum up the assumptions:
1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.
2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.
3. The flower doesn't want to die.
4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.
5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.
6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
7. The dog is rational.
8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.
9. The dog doesn't want to die.
10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).
11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.
13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.
14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.
15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.
So now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?
 Hint:  1:
We know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.
Hint 2:
Since the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower."," 1:

Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.","The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)
But why will the dog eat the flower?
1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die
2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.
3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.
4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.
5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.
6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.
7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison
OK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).
8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous
9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 1 – “If I (the dog) decide to eat, what will the flower do?”  
• The flower prefers  
  live without poison  >  live with poison  >  die.  
• The flower knows the dog is rational and, if eaten while not poisonous, will destroy it.  
• Therefore, if the flower ever comes to believe the dog really will eat it, its only way to stay alive is to develop poison (assumptions 3, 5, 6 and the fact that the dog cannot detect the poison).  
Conclusion:  A dog-decision “Eat” ⇒ flower-decision “Make poison”.

Step 2 – “Given that, what happens to me if I eat?”  
If the flower does make poison and I eat it, I die with certainty (assumption 14).

Step 3 – “If I decide not to eat, what happens?”  
• Because I do not eat, the flower’s life is never threatened, so (by assumption 5) it will not bother to develop poison.  
• I then face only the original illness, which kills me with probability ½ and lets me live with probability ½ (assumption 15).  
Expected chance of survival in this case = 50 %.

Step 4 – Compare the two possible actions for the dog  
Eat  → 0 % chance of survival (certain death).  
Not-eat → 50 % chance of survival.

Since 50 % > 0 %, a rational dog chooses Not-eat.

Step 5 – What actually happens to the flower?  
Knowing the dog’s final decision is Not-eat, the flower never has to produce poison and simply survives unpoisoned.

Therefore the unique outcome that two perfectly rational thinkers (who also know each other’s rationality) reach is:

• Flower: does not make poison.  
• Dog: does not eat the flower.  
• Dog’s probability of survival: 50 %.

Final answer: The dog will not eat the flower, because it foresees that if it intended to eat, the flower would rationally protect itself by becoming poisonous, guaranteeing the dog’s death, whereas refusing to eat gives the dog a 50 % chance to survive.",True,0,0,0

However, with Charles at 2 (and Darling at 3), from (2), Curious can only be at 4 and so it is not possible to find just one correct entry in the Surname list (Newtune and Eyeline must be both correct or both incorrect).

Printed list in Clock magazine  

  1  2  3  4  
First name Isaac Albert Marie Charles  
Surname  Newtune Eyeline Curious Darling  
Occupation Welder Gardener Cleaner Bricklayer

Logical clues  
(1) Albert is two places above the Bricklayer.  
(2) Darling is one place below Charles.  
(3) Curious is two places below the Welder.

Step 1 – where can the Bricklayer go?  
From (1) the Bricklayer is 2 below Albert, so the Bricklayer must be in 3 rd or 4 th place.  
If the Bricklayer were in 3 rd, Albert would have to be 1 st – but that would give TWO correct first-name entries (Albert would be 1 st, yet the printed first-name entry in 1 st place is Isaac).  
Therefore Bricklayer = 4 th place and Albert = 2 nd place.  
Hence “Bricklayer” is the single correct occupation entry and “Albert” is the single correct first-name entry.

Step 2 – Welder/Curious pair.  
Curious is two below the Welder ⇒ the pairs can only be (Welder 1 st, Curious 3 rd) or (Welder 2 nd, Curious 4 th).  
If Welder were 1 st, the printed occupation “Welder” in 1 st place would be correct too (giving two correct occupations). Impossible.  
So Welder = 2 nd place and Curious = 4 th place.

Step 3 – Darling/Charles pair.  
Darling is one place below Charles, so the pairs could be (1,2), (2,3) or (3,4).  
But the 4 th-place surname is already Curious, so Darling cannot be 4 th.  
Hence the only feasible pair is Charles 1 st, Darling 2 nd.

Step 4 – finish the surname column.  
We already have  
 1 st ‑ Newtune? 2 nd ‑ Darling 3 rd ‑ ? 4 th ‑ Curious.  
Exactly one surname entry must be correct.  
The only way to have exactly one correct is to let Newtune actually be in 1 st place (matching the printed list there).  
Thus the remaining unused surname “Eyeline” goes in 3 rd place.

Step 5 – finish the occupation column.  
Used so far: Cleaner? (unknown), Welder 2 nd, Gardener?, Bricklayer 4 th.  
Only Bricklayer may be correct, so  
• position 3 cannot be Cleaner (because Cleaner is printed there)  
⇒ position 3 = Gardener, position 1 = Cleaner.

Step 6 – finish the first-name column.  
Used so far: Charles 1 st, Albert 2 nd.  
Names left: Isaac, Marie.  
Since the printed list has “Marie” in 3 rd place (and we already have the one correct first name – Albert) we must avoid putting Marie in 3 rd.  
Therefore Isaac = 3 rd, Marie = 4 th.

Everything now satisfies all clues and the “only one correct in each column” condition.

The complete, consistent table is

113,"Question: Little Mad Ade, son of Mad Ade, leaves home in the morning to go to school. As he leaves the house he looks at the clock in the mirror. The clock has no number indication and for this reason the boy makes a mistake in interpreting the time (mirror-image). Just assuming the clock must be out of order, the Little Mad Ade cycles to school, where he arrives after twenty minutes. At that moment, the clock at school shows a time that is two and a half hours later than the time that Little Mad Ade saw on the clock at home.
At what time did he reach school?
 Hint: Think about the difference between the real time and the time of a mirror image. ",Think about the difference between the real time and the time of a mirror image. ,"The difference between the real time and the time of the mirror image is two hours and ten minutes (two and a half hours, minus the twenty minutes of cycling).

The difference between these clocks is exactly 2 hours and ten minutes (note that also five minutes past one can be mirrored in a similar way, but this is not in the morning!).
Conclusion: Little Mad Ade reaches school at five minutes past seven (plus twenty minutes of cycling) which is twenty-five minutes past seven!...",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

T  = the real time (in minutes after 12:00) when Little Mad Ade looks at the hall-clock  
M = the time he THINKS he sees (the mirror image).

1. Relation between a true time and its mirror image  
For any analogue 12-hour clock, the mirror reading is the complement to 12 hours (720 minutes):
  M ≡ 720 − T  (mod 720).

2. What the story tells us  
• Ade leaves home at the real time T.  
• He cycles 20 minutes, so he reaches school at real time T + 20.  
• The school clock (correct) then shows a time that is 2½ hours = 150 minutes later than the value he had read at home:  
  T + 20 = M + 150.

3. Substitute the mirror relation into that equation  
  T + 20 = (720 − T) + 150  
  T + 20 = 870 − T  
  2T     = 850  
  T      = 425 minutes.

4. Convert 425 minutes to conventional time  
 425 min = 7 hours  +  5 minutes  →  7:05.

Thus Ade left home at 7:05 a.m.

5. Arrival time  
He cycled for 20 minutes, so

 7:05 + 0:20 = 7:25 a.m.

 Hint: The letters M, A, N, and X must appear on four different blocks (so that you can spell ""MANX"")","The letters M, A, N, and X must appear on four different blocks (so that you can spell ""MANX"")","The first thing that you should notice is that all of the letters except V and Z appear.  Therefore each letter appears only on one block.  The letters M, A, N, and X must appear on four different blocks (so that you can spell ""MANX"").  Call them blocks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.  Block 2 (with the A) must have a letter from CRUX.  It can't be C (because then you wouldn't be able to spell JACK) or U (so you can spell QUAD), so it is R.  Block 2 must also have a letter from KNOW.  It can't be K (JACK) or W (WRIT), so it's O.  The letter H can't be on block 1 (SHIM) or block 2 or 3 (JOHN), so H is on block 4.  J is on block 1 (JOHN).  C can't be on block 1 or 2 (JACK) or block 4 (CRUX), so C is on block 3.  U is on block 1 (CRUX), and K is on block 4 (JACK).  W, then, is on block 1 (KNOW).  I isn't on block 1 or 2 (WRIT), or block 4 (SHIM), so I is on block 3.  T is on block 4 (WRIT) and S is on block 2 (SHIM).

115,"Question: One day, 4 groups of people meet together to hold a meeting. There are 3 representatives from each group.
The groups are: KINGS, QUEENS, RELIGIOUS FIGURES and STOOGES.
Among the KINGS are: James, Saul and Henry.
Among the QUEENS are Victoria, Elizabeth and Candace.
The RELIGIOUS FIGURES consist of the Pope, Mother Teresa and Gandhi.
The STOOGES, of course, are none other than Moe, Larry and Curly.
The Stooges decide to play a game with the rest of the group. The game is called Untouchable. The Stooges start the game by tapping certain ones on the shoulder a specific number of times. The object of the game is for the other groups to figure out the pattern the Stooges set (that is, why they tap certain individuals a certain number of times), and to follow the pattern they set.
The only stipulation to the game is that people belonging to the RELIGIOUS FIGURES group do not tap anyone; however, they can be tapped.
The shoulder taps occur this way, starting with the Stooges (who originated the pattern):
Moe taps James, Gandhi, the Pope  and  Saul twice each.
Larry taps Henry, and Curly once each.
Curly taps Henry and Larry once each.
(The KINGS catch on and do the following):
James taps the Pope, Saul, Gandhi and Moe twice each.
Saul taps Gandhi, Moe and James and the Pope twice each.
Henry taps Larry and Curly once each.
(The QUEENS catch on and do the following):
Elizabeth and Victoria tap each other four times each.
Question:
Who are the untouchables?
 Hint: Think about the letters in each name. ",Think about the letters in each name. ,"The pattern set by the Stooges is that each one taps the person with the same number of vowels in their name, one tap for every vowel.
Queen Candace only has 3 Vowels, and Mother Teresa has 5. Neither of them have a counterpart with the same number of vowels. They would, therefore be the untouchables.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step-by-step reconstruction of the rule  

1.  Look at how many times each person taps any other single person.  
   • Moe always taps twice, Larry always once, Curly once, James twice, Saul twice,  
     Henry once, Elizabeth four times, Victoria four times.  
   So the number of taps depends only on the tapper, not on whom he/she is tapping.

2.  Count the vowels in every name (counting repeated vowels, and treating Y as a consonant).  
   Moe = 2 Larry = 1 Curly = 1 James = 2 Saul = 2 Henry = 1  
   Pope = 2 Gandhi = 2 Elizabeth = 4 Victoria = 4 Candace = 3 Mother Teresa = 5  

3.  Compare the two lists.  
   • Moe (2 vowels) taps twice.  
   • Larry, Curly, Henry (1 vowel each) tap once.  
   • James, Saul (2 vowels each) tap twice.  
   • Elizabeth, Victoria (4 vowels each) tap four times.  

   Thus the basic rule is  
      “A person taps exactly v times, where v = the number of vowels in his/her own name.”

4.  Whom does each person tap?  
   Examining the list, every tapper chooses only people whose names contain that same
   number v of vowels.  
   • Moe (2 vowels) taps only 2-vowel names: James, Gandhi, Pope, Saul.  
   • Larry/Curly/Henry (1-vowel names) tap only one-vowel names (each other).  
   • James and Saul (2 vowels) likewise restrict their taps to the 2-vowel set.  
   • Elizabeth and Victoria (4 vowels) tap only each other (both 4 vowels).

   Therefore the full pattern is  
      “Tap everyone whose name has the same number of vowels as yours, and
       tap each of them exactly that many times.”

5.  Find the people with a unique vowel count.  
   • Candace has 3 vowels (A, A, E).  No one else has exactly 3 vowels.  
   • Mother Teresa has 5 vowels (O, E, E, E, A).  No one else has exactly 5 vowels  
     (and Religious Figures are forbidden to tap anyway).

   Because no one else shares their vowel-count class, no one can lawfully tap them,
   and they themselves cannot tap anyone.

Hence they never get touched during the game—they are the “Untouchables”.

Final answer: Candace and Mother Teresa.",True,1,0,0

1, There are total of 15 balls.
2, For each ball potted, the player will receive one point.
3, They all will play each other once.
4, A game will end when all the balls are potted.
5, The winner will be the player who scored the most points.
OUTCOMES
1, Hayden Seek finished with 18 points.
2, Al Gore-Rhythm finished with odd number of points.
3, Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points in the match between them.
4, There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm.
5, Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game.
6, Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff.
7, Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome.
Who won the competition?
How many points did each player score?
 Hint: Take large advantage of the 15 balls total rule",Take large advantage of the 15 balls total rule,"1) Hayden Seek finished with 18 points. - This was a given so my answer needs no explanation.
3) Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points. - Therefore, the score was 10 Dan Druff and 5 Hayden Seek; because there is only 15 balls which equals 15 points per game
There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm. - The final score had to be 7 and 8 and since Al Gore-Rhythm finished with an odd score, If you trialed both numbers you will notice Al Gore-Rhythm equaled out to have the 8 points therefore, Annie Buddyhome had the 7 points.
Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game. - Al Gore-Rhythm equaled 10 points and Dan Druff equaled 5 points so the score would be double winner and half for the loser.
Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff. Since the score was 10/5 with Dan Druff winning, that means that Hayden Seek scored 4 points in this game because of one point less.
Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome- Once again 15 points and the game is over, Dan Druff scores 7 and Annie Buddyhome scores 8.
By process of elimination; since Hayden Seek scores 18 points total and you can figure out the 5 points against Dan Druff and the 4 points against Al Gore-Rhythm 9 points was the only number that would fit into the equation.
Thus the scores are Al Gore-Rhythm 8 and Annie Buddyhome 7
Annie Buddyhome 8 and Dan Druff 7
Dan Druff 10 and Hayden Seek 5
Hayden Seek 4 and Al Gore-Rhythm 11
Al Gore-Rhythm 10 and Dan Druff 5
Annie Buddyhome 6 and Hayden Seek 9
Al Gore-Rhythm 11+10+8= 29 points (odd)
Annie Buddyhome 8+7+6=21 points
Hayden Seek 5+4+9=18 points (given)
Dan Druff 7+10+5=22 points

Every match uses all 15 balls, so in each of the six games the two scores add to 15.

Label the individual game scores:

• A-B : (A₁ , B₁) A₁ + B₁ = 15, |A₁ – B₁| = 1  
• A-D : (A₂ , D₁) A₂ = 2·D₁, A₂ + D₁ = 15  
• A-H : (A₃ , H₁) H₁ = H (vs D) – 1  
• B-D : (B₂ , D₂) D₂ = 7, B₂ + 7 = 15  
• B-H : (B₃ , H₂) B₃ + H₂ = 15  
• D-H : (D₃ , H) D₃ – H = 5, D₃ + H = 15  

Begin with the matches whose numbers are fixed.

1.  A-D game  
 A₂ = 2·D₁ and A₂ + D₁ = 15 ⇒ 3·D₁ = 15 ⇒ D₁ = 5, A₂ = 10.

2.  D-H game  
 D₃ – H = 5 and D₃ + H = 15 ⇒ 2·D₃ = 20 ⇒ D₃ = 10, H = 5.

3.  A-H game  
 H₁ = H – 1 = 5 – 1 = 4, so A₃ = 15 – 4 = 11.

4.  B-D game  
 D₂ = 7 ⇒ B₂ = 15 – 7 = 8.

5.  B-H game  
 H₂ is still unknown; keep B₃ + H₂ = 15.

Running totals so far  
 D total = 5 + 10 + 7 = 22  
 H total = 5 + 4 + H₂ = 9 + H₂

Fact: Hayden’s grand total is 18 ⇒ 9 + H₂ = 18 ⇒ H₂ = 9, B₃ = 6.

Now B’s total so far  
 B total = B₁ + 8 + 6 = 14 + B₁.

Finally handle the A-B game  
 A₁ + B₁ = 15 and |A₁ – B₁| = 1.

Try the two possibilities:

a)  A₁ = 8, B₁ = 7  
 A total = 10 + 11 + 8 = 29 (odd – satisfies fact 2).  
 B total = 14 + 7 = 21.

b)  A₁ = 7, B₁ = 8  
 A total = 10 + 11 + 7 = 28 (even – violates fact 2).

Therefore the only feasible scores are the ones in (a).

Reading the clues in order and matching them to those shifted symbols makes every statement true.

1 → 1 = !     “!” is an exclamation mark, so it is “always excited.”  
2 → 2 = @     The “at” sign tells people where something is (“user @ place”).  
3 → 3 = #     A tic-tac-toe (noughts-and-crosses) board is drawn with “#”.  
4 → 4 = $     A dollar sign represents money, so it is “very rich.”

There are 6 zeros, 2 ones, 1 two, 0 threes, 0 fours, 0 fives, 1 six, 0 sevens, 0 eights, and 0 nines.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

N = d₀ d₁ d₂ d₃ d₄ d₅ d₆ d₇ d₈ d₉  

be the required 10-digit number, where dᵢ tells how many i’s appear in the whole list of ten digits.

Step 1 – Use the fact that the ten digits themselves are a multiset of ten numbers whose total must be 10.  
(Indeed, the ten counts d₀+d₁+…+d₉ must equal the total number of digits, 10.)

Step 2 – Decide how many zeros there are.  
Call that number d₀.  Because every non-zero digit contributes at least 1 to the total sum 10, the more zeros we have, the easier it is to keep the total at 10.  Trying a few values quickly shows that we need quite a lot of zeros; let us see what happens if d₀ = 6.

• With six zeros already accounted for, the remaining four digits (there are 10−6 = 4 non-zero digits) must add up to 4, because the grand total must be 10.

Step 3 – Distribute the remaining total 4 among those four non-zero digits.  
The only way four positive integers can add to 4 is 1+1+1+1 or 2+1+1.

But 1+1+1+1 would mean there are four 1’s, so d₁ would have to be 4, contradicting the requirement that the four non-zero digits sum to only 4.  
Hence we must use 2+1+1.

Step 4 – Place the 2 and the two 1’s so that the counting rules are satisfied.

• If we set d₁ = 2, that claims there are exactly two 1’s altogether – perfect for the 1+1 part we still have to place.  
• One of those 1’s can naturally be d₂ = 1 (announcing that there is exactly one 2).  
• The second 1 must then sit in the position that counts sixes, i.e. d₆ = 1 (announcing that there is exactly one 6, namely d₀ itself).

Everything else is 0.

So the tentative digit list is

d₀ d₁ d₂ d₃ d₄ d₅ d₆ d₇ d₈ d₉  
6   2   1   0   0   0   1   0   0   0

Step 5 – Verify.  
Zeros: positions 3,4,5,7,8,9 → 6 zeros, so d₀ = 6 ✓  
Ones: positions 2 and 6 → 2 ones, so d₁ = 2 ✓  
Twos: position 1 only → 1 two, so d₂ = 1 ✓  
Threes, fours, fives, sevens, eights, nines: none → corresponding dᵢ are 0 ✓  
Sixes: position 0 only → 1 six, so d₆ = 1 ✓  

All conditions are satisfied.

Therefore the unique self-descriptive 10-digit number is

119,"Question: Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by their ability to solve logic puzzles.  He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
They each opened their envelope and inspected their numbers.  Snap said, ""I know that Crackle and Pop each have a different number.""
Crackle replies, ""I already knew that all three of our numbers were different.""
Pop says, ""Now I know what all three of our numbers are.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class to ask if anyone else knows the numbers.  Only Gretchen raises her hand, and she correctly identifies what each person is holding.  How did she know?
 Hint: Snap's statement implies that his number is odd.  Crackle's statement implies that not only is his number odd, but it is also greater than or equal to 7.  There are only six combinations that satisfy these conditions.","Snap's statement implies that his number is odd.

(1, 9, 4)
(1, 11, 2)
(3, 7, 4)
(3, 9, 2)
(5, 7, 2)
Since Pop can reason perfectly, he knows these are the possible combinations.  In order for him to know the other two, he must be holding a 6, since he knew the solution had to be unique.  Therefore, Snap has a 1, Crackle has a 7, and Pop has a 6.
And, as usual, Gretchen solidifies her place as a top student.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"1.  What Snap’s remark tells us  
   •  He sees only his own number S and the fact that S + C + P = 14.  
   •  He can say with certainty that C ≠ P.  
      That is possible only when 14 – S is odd, because if the remainder were even it could be split into two equal integers.  
   •  Therefore S itself must be odd.  
   •  The possibles for S are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 (it cannot be 13 because C and P must still be positive).

2.  What Crackle’s remark tells us  
   •  Before anyone spoke he already knew the three numbers were distinct.  
   •  If C were 6 or less, then 14 – 2C would be positive, letting one of the other numbers equal C; so C must be at least 7.  
   •  If 14 – C were even, S and P could still be equal, so 14 – C must be odd; hence C is odd.  
   •  Combine these: C is odd and ≥ 7 → C ∈ {7, 9, 11}.  
   •  Listing the ways to complete the sum with S odd and all numbers different gives exactly six candidate triples:

            C = 7 : (S,P) = (1,6), (3,4), (5,2)
            C = 9 : (S,P) = (1,4), (3,2)
            C =11 : (S,P) = (1,2)

      So the six admissible (S,C,P) triples are  
      (1,7,6)  (3,7,4)  (5,7,2)  (1,9,4)  (3,9,2)  (1,11,2).

3.  What Pop’s remark tells us  
   •  Pop knows only his own number P plus the dialogue above.  
   •  For him to be able to name the whole triple, his number must occur in only one of the six possibilities:

            P = 6 appears once  → (1,7,6)
            P = 4 appears twice → (3,7,4) or (1,9,4)
            P = 2 appears three times → (5,7,2) or (3,9,2) or (1,11,2)

   •  Therefore Pop’s number is 6 and the only consistent triple is (1,7,6).

4.  How Gretchen could tell  
   •  The class has heard all the statements.  
   •  Knowing Pop was able to determine the numbers, Gretchen runs the same count above and sees that uniqueness is possible only when P = 6, yielding (1,7,6).  
   •  Hence she can state the numbers without seeing any envelope.

The Hogwarts Express has two different rows. Each row has two compartments. Each compartment has two rows of seats, and each row in the compartment can hold three people. In this case, there is a left compartment and a right compartment, like the following:
Left (corridor) Right
Clues:
1) Harry is sitting across from Neville.
2) Neville is in the left compartment.
3) Ginny is sitting next to Neville, Luna, or both.
4) Hermione, who is sitting completely diagonal from Neville, is next to either Harry, Ron, or both.

 Hint: Harry, Ron, Harmione are together.","Harry, Ron, Harmione are together.","Harry, Ron, Hermione | Malfoy, Parkinson, Zabini
Neville, Ginny, Luna | Crabbe, Goyle, Nott",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Define the layout first.

There are only the two usual Hogwarts-Express compartments, one on the left of the corridor and one on the right.  
Each compartment has two benches that face each other (the “front” bench is the one nearer the engine, the “back” bench is the one nearer the rear of the train).  
On every bench the three places are

window – middle – aisle           (aisle is beside the corridor)

Across means directly facing the other bench in the same compartment;  
diagonal means across and one or two seats to the side;  
“across the row” means the seat exactly opposite on the other side of the corridor.

Step-by-step placement

1.  Harry is across from Neville and must have a window seat; Neville is in the left
    compartment; Harry is “closer to the front”.
    → Harry = left compartment, front bench, window (L-front-window)  
      Neville = left compartment, back bench, window (L-back-window).

2.  Luna is diagonal from Harry, so Luna is on the left back bench, either middle or
    aisle.

3.  Hermione is completely diagonal from Neville, hence left-front-aisle.  
    Ron is between Harry and Hermione, so left-front-middle.

    Left front bench is now:  Harry - Ron - Hermione.

4.  Hermione is in the aisle “across the row” from Malfoy, so Malfoy must be
    right-front-aisle.  Malfoy cannot be in the left compartment – satisfied.

5.  Malfoy is next to Parkinson or Crabbe; only the middle seat beside him is free, so
    right-front-middle = Parkinson.

6.  Crabbe has to be in an aisle seat across the corridor from Luna.  
    Therefore put Luna in left-back-aisle and Crabbe in right-back-aisle.

7.  Crabbe and Goyle must sit together, leaving one other person on that bench.
    Thus right-back-middle = Goyle.

8.  Zabini is opposite Nott, and Nott is diagonal from Parkinson.
    Place Nott in right-back-window (diagonal from Parkinson, who is
    right-front-middle).  Zabini goes opposite him: right-front-window.

9.  The only person not yet seated is Ginny.  
    She must sit next to Neville, Luna, or both; the only remaining seat fulfilling
    this is left-back-middle.  That puts her between Neville and Luna.

All twelve students are now seated and every clue is satisfied.

Final seating

Left compartment (closer to corridor is at the right of each line)

  Front bench (faces the rear):   Window  Harry   |  Ron  |  Hermione  Aisle  
  Back bench  (faces the front):  Window  Neville | Ginny|  Luna      Aisle  

Right compartment

  Front bench:                    Aisle  Malfoy  | Parkinson | Zabini  Window  
  Back bench:                     Aisle  Crabbe  | Goyle     | Nott    Window  

Thus every clue is met.

   The idea: start at the indicated key and move right the given number of keys on that very row.  
   (So “Tab one” means the first key to the right of Tab → Q, “Tab two” → W, etc.)

2. Decode each sentence:

   Shift 3   → Z(1) X(2) C(3)              = C

123,"Question: In a wood-cutting factory, four large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are four back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all four machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the four switches outside the room to the four machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?
 Hint: Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room....","Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room....","Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room and, by listening, test all six combinations of two back-up switches to find which two match the two ""machine-on"" switches inside the room. Only one of the six combinations of two back-ups gives complete silence when switched off and these ""machine-on"" back-ups match the two ""on"" in the room. Now, before returning to the room, leave one ""on"" off and one ""off"" on leaving the other ""on"" on and ""off"" off, that is, only two switches are activated. Back inside the room, we can now match the switches by seeing which ""on"" machine is now off and which ""off"" is now on (when we activate its switch).",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"1.  First visit to the room  
   • All four saws are running.  
   • Switch two of the machines OFF on their own (inside) switches – say the two on the right-hand side.  
     (Two saws are now silent, two are still working.)

2.  Go outside to the corridor  
   • Switch OFF all four outside back-up switches.  
     (Now no machine in the room has any power at all.)

3.  Second visit to the room  
   • Put the two inside switches you turned off back to ON.  
     (Result: every machine switch inside the room is now ON, but nothing can run because all the outside
      switches are still OFF.)

4.  Final work outside – the identification step  
   • Go back outside.  
   • Switch the first back-up switch ON and listen at (or open) the door.  
        – Exactly one saw will start; mark that outside switch with the name of the machine you can hear.  
   • Turn this back-up switch OFF again.  
   • Repeat the procedure with each of the remaining three outside switches, one at a time.  
        – Each time, with all the inside switches ON, switching a single back-up ON can give power to only
          one machine, so only one saw starts.  
        – Note which saw you hear each time and label the back-up switch accordingly.

After the fourth outside switch has been tested you know, and can state, which outside back-up switch feeds which saw inside the room.  You have done the whole job “purely by operating switches” and without ever seeing the machines while you were outside.

Final answer:  Switch two machines off inside, turn all four outside switches off, turn the two inside switches on again, then outside turn the back-up switches on one at a time; each back-up switch will start exactly one machine, so you can match every outside switch to its correct saw.",True,0,0,1
124,"Question: A plain white cube has gone through 4 steps to become what it is now. The steps (not necessarily in order) are:
a) The whole cube being painted red
b) A white circle being painted on every face except for the top and back
c) The front and back faces being painted black
d) The top, back, and bottom being painted blue
All of the following facts about painting the cube are true:
1. After the last of the four steps, the top face was all purple, the left and right faces were red with a pink circle in each of their centers, the front black with a gray circle, the bottom purple with a light blue circle, and the back completely dark blue.
2. Color mixing goes as follows:
-Red+Blue=Purple
-Black+White=Gray
-Red+White=Pink
-Blue+White=Light Blue
-Red+Black=Maroon
-Blue+Black=Dark Blue
3. Once black is added to a face, it will mix with the colors on the face if possible, but it cannot be changed at all afterwards. This is not true with white.
4. Any area where two colors have been mixed cannot change color.
5. Exactly one of the following is true:
-Black was added first.
-Red was added before blue.
-Blue was added after white.
-White was added last.
In what order were the colors added?
 Hint: If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","White, blue, black, red.
Because there are both gray and dark blue regions, black was added after both white and blue. This means black was not first, and neither blue nor white was last.
Black has to have been added before red, because if it wasn't, the front face would be maroon with a pink center. So black was not last, and red was not first.
Since neither blue, black, nor white was last, red had to be added last. Combining this with other facts, white and blue could not be added third. So black was third.
Going back to the statements of which one is true, we can now figure out the lies. Red was added last, so statement 4 is false. Black was added third, so statement 1 is false. Red was not added before any other colors, so statement 2 is false. This makes statement 3 true. White was added before blue, so white is first, and blue is second. The order white, blue, black, red is now revealed.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"We label the four painting operations

a) paint the whole cube red  
b) paint a white circle on every face except the top and back  
c) paint the front and back faces black  
d) paint the top, back, and bottom faces blue  

Let us deduce their order.

1.  The back face ends dark-blue (= blue + black).  
    Because black, once applied, can no longer be changed (Rule 3), blue must already be on the back when black is added.  
    ⇒  blue is applied before black.  
    ⇒  d precedes c.                                   ……(1)

2.  The front face ends black with a gray (= black + white) circle.  
    For the circle to be gray, white must be on the front before black is added, so that the two can mix.  
    If red were already on the front when black were applied, the mixture outside the circle would become maroon (= red + black), contradicting the final description “black”.  
    Therefore black must be applied before red.  
    ⇒  b precedes c, and c precedes a.                 ……(2)

3.  Combining (1) and (2):

           b   ,   d      <       c      <       a
         (white) (blue)        (black)        (red)

    Only the relative positions of b and d are still undetermined.

4.  We now use the logical condition that exactly one of the following four statements is true:

    S₁: “Black was added first.”            (false – black is third)  
    S₂: “Red was added before blue.”        (false – red is after blue)  
    S₃: “Blue was added after white.”       (true  if b < d, false if d < b)  
    S₄: “White was added last.”             (false – white is before black and red)

    To have exactly one true sentence, S₃ must be true, hence b precedes d.

    ⇒  b < d < c < a.

5.  Therefore the complete chronological order of the four steps is

       b  →  d  →  c  →  a
  (white)  (blue) (black) (red)

Checking every face with this order reproduces exactly the final colour description, so the deduction is consistent.

Final answer: White was added first, then Blue, then Black, and finally Red.",True,1,0,0
125,"Question: A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote thirteen pairs of letters on a rock:
A-V
B-W
C-Q
D-M
E-K
F-U
G-N
H-P
I-O
J-R
L-X
S-T
Y-Z
""These thirteen pairs consist of all 26 letters of the alphabet,"" said the troll. ""The password contains thirteen letters, no two of which are the same. Each pair consists of one letter that is in the password and one other letter. If you wrote out the ""other"" letters in alphabetical order and then wrote each ""password"" letter under each one's corresponding ""other"" letter, you would have the correct spelling of the password.""
Then the troll wrote five short words on the rock: FACE, QUEST, QUICK, SWITCH, and WORLD. ""Each short word contains exactly the same number of letters with the password,"" he said.
So, what is the password?
 Hint: Q cannot exist in the password without U.",Q cannot exist in the password without U.,"The password is UNPREDICTABLY.
Exactly one of S and T must be in the password. So QUEST, and so each word, must have at least one letter in common with the password.
Suppose each word has one common letter . Then none of Q, U, and E can be in the word, so C, F, and K must be in the word. But now FACE has at least two letters in common.
Suppose each word has two common letters. The second common letter in QUEST cannot be Q. Suppose it is U. Then C and K must be in the password and F cannot. But now QUICK has at least three common letters.
Suppose the second common letter in QUEST is E. Then C and F must be in the password and K cannot. But now FACE has at least three common letters.
Suppose each word has four common letters. Then Q, U, and E must be in the password, and C, F, and K cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So each word has three common letters. The second and third common letters in QUEST cannot be Q and E. Suppose they are Q and U. Then K must be in the password, and C and F cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So the second and third common letters in QUEST must be U and E. Then C must be in the password, and F and K cannot. The third common letter in FACE must be A, so V cannot. The third common letter in QUICK must be I, so O cannot.
Like QUEST, SWITCH contains both S and T. I and C are in the password, so W and H cannot. Since neither W nor O can be in the password, the three common letters in WORLD must be R, L, and D, so J, X, and M cannot.
Writing each determined ""other"" letter in alphabetical order, and writing each ""password"" letter under its corresponding ""other"" letter, we get:

126,"Question: The rugby season may be over, but the wheeling and dealing is just reaching a high point. Recently, each of six teams acquired a different, valuable, player to beef up its roster. Each player specializes in a different position (one is a prop), and, coincidentally enough, each was acquired from a different one of the other teams. Each felt a pang of regret at leaving his former team, but is eagerly awaiting the first scrum of the season with his new mates. From the following clues, can you match each player with his position, new team and former team?
1. The one from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets.
2. The Mountaineers, Troopers and Typhoons signed the fullback, the player who left the Downers and Cowan, in some order.
3. The Downers, Scarlets and Jets lost Tuitupou, the center and the player who signed with the Typhoons, in some order.
4. Jeeper and the center signed with the Downers and the Typhoons, in some order.
5. Rokocoko and McGuyver left the Mountaineers and the Troopers, in some order.
6. The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets.
7. The hooker cleared his stuff out of his former Downer locker last week.
8. Rokocoko isn't the fullback.
9. The wing's wife was delighted that her husband signed with the Scarlets.
10. Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets.
11. The fly half, who isn't going to the Mountaineers, isn't Cowan.
 Hint: The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).","The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).","The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).
The wing signed with the Scarlets. Since the player from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 1), this is a fourth player.
Cowan is neither the hooker who left the Downers nor the wing who signed with the Scarlets (clue 2), so he is a fifth player.
Cowan is not the fullback (clue 2) or the fly half (clue 11).
The center cannot have signed with the Typhoons (clue 3), so the center must have signed with the Downers while Jeeper signed with the Typhoons (clue 4). This means that Cowan cannot be the center (clue 2), and must therefore be the prop.
The center didn't leave the Troopers or the Mountaineers (clue 3), so he is the 6th player, leaving Rokocoko and McGuyver as the fullback and the fly half, in some order.
At this point we know the following information about the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) the hooker, left the Downers
4) the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) the center
Since Jeeper signed with the Typhoons, he is one of the three people listed in clue 2: he obviously isn't Cowan, so he is either the fullback or the player who left the Downers, ie the hooker (clue 7). We've established that Jeeper cannot be the fullback, so he is the hooker.
Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 10), so he is the center. This leaves Tuitupou as the wing.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers
The player that left the Mountaineers couldn't have also signed with the Mountaineers, so Cowan signed with the Mountaineers, and the player that left the Mountaineers signed with the Troopers.
The fullback didn't sign with the Jets (clue 2), so the fullback signed with the Troopers and the fly half signed with the Jets.
Rokocoko isn't the fullback (clue 8), so McGuyver is the fullback and Rokocoko is the fly half.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, signed with the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers.
Tuitupou left the Downers, the Scarlets or the Jets (clue 3). We've established that Jeeper left the Downers, and since Tuitupou signed with the Scarlets, he must have left the Jets.
The Scarlets, therefore, lost the center (clue 3).
By process of elimination, Cowan left the Typhoons.
So these are the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, left the Jets for the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, left the Typhoons for the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, left the Scarlets for the Downers.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

128,"Question: One variation of the famous ""Eight Queens Puzzle"" is the ""Bishop Puzzle"".
We know that you can place up to 8 queens on a chessboard with no other pieces in such a fashion that no queen can be taken.  We also know that you can place 32 knights on the board in such a fashion that none can be taken.
Do you know how many bishops you can place on a standard 8x8 chessboard so that no piece can be taken?  What is their placement?
 Hint: Take advantage of the fact that bishops can't move like rooks!",Take advantage of the fact that bishops can't move like rooks!,"Fourteen bishops can be placed on the board.

 NW–SE (row – column is constant)  
 NE–SW (row + column is constant).

On an 8 × 8 board there are

 15 different NW–SE diagonals  (d = –7, –6, … , 7)  
 15 different NE–SW diagonals  (s = 2, 3, … , 16).

If two bishops are to be mutually non-attacking they must stand on different diagonals of each family, i.e. every bishop must have its own value of d and its own value of s.  
So the problem is to choose as large a set of squares as possible so that no two share the same d and no two share the same s.

We would like to use 15 bishops (one for every value of d), but that is impossible:  
d = –7 corresponds to the single square h1 (d = –7, s = 9)  
d = 7  corresponds to the single square a8 (d = 7,  s = 9)  
These two diagonals meet at the same NE–SW diagonal s = 9, so both squares cannot be occupied simultaneously.  
Hence the theoretical maximum is 15 – 1 = 14 bishops.

A set of 14 squares with pairwise–different (d,s) values is easy to write down.  
Put bishops on every square of the first rank except h1 and on every square of the eighth rank except h8:

 a1, b1, c1, d1, e1, f1, g1, a8, b8, c8, d8, e8, f8, g8

Check

• the NW–SE diagonals (d values)

 a1 d = 0  b1 d = –1 c1 d = –2 d1 d = –3 e1 d = –4 f1 d = –5 g1 d = –6  
 a8 d = 7  b8 d = 6  c8 d = 5  d8 d = 4  e8 d = 3  f8 d = 2  g8 d = 1

All 14 differences are distinct.

• the NE–SW diagonals (s values)

 a1 s = 2 b1 s = 3 c1 s = 4 d1 s = 5 e1 s = 6 f1 s = 7 g1 s = 8  
 a8 s = 9 b8 s = 10 c8 s = 11 d8 s = 12 e8 s = 13 f8 s = 14 g8 s = 15

Again all 14 sums are distinct.

Because no two bishops share a d-value or an s-value, no two can attack each other.  
Therefore 14 is attainable, and, as argued above, 14 is the maximum.

Final answer: 14 bishops, placed on

129,"Question: During the California Gold Rush, an assessor in San Francisco used a balance to measure out quantities of gold dust. He had a set of weights to place on the balance. The assessor needed to be able to measure out gold dust in exact ounces, no fractions, for every number of ounces starting at 1.
If the assessor has four weights, what is the largest number of ounces of gold dust he can measure?
Note: The answer is not 15 ounces
 Hint: Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.",Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.,"The maximum weight is 40 ounces.
The weights are powers of 3:  1 ounce, 3 ounces, 9 ounces, 27 ounces.
Example:
7 ounces – Plate A: 9 oz. and 1 oz. weights.   Plate B: 3 oz weight and gold
In any weighing, each weight can be placed in one of three ways: on the plate with the gold, on the plate without the gold, on the desk next to the balance. So given n weights, there are 3^n possible combinations.
Throw out the case where all weights are on the table. That leaves 3^n – 1 cases.
Half of those cases would weigh negative gold, so eliminate half of these.
Thus, the number of valid combinations for n weights is (3^n – 1) / 2.
For four weights, (3^4 – 1) / 2 = (81 – 1) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the four weights be w1 ≤ w2 ≤ w3 ≤ w4 (all whole numbers of ounces).  
With a two-pan balance we may put each weight

 • on the gold-dust pan  (coefficient –1),  
 • on the opposite pan (coefficient +1), or  
 • not use it     (coefficient 0).

Thus every weighing corresponds to a “balanced ternary” linear combination

 x = c1w1 + c2w2 + c3w3 + c4w4 , where every cj ∈ {–1,0,1}.

If the assessor can already produce every integer from –R to +R with some
subset of the weights, then after he adds a new weight w the reachable
interval will be

 [ –(R + w),  R + w ]  provided w ≤ 2R + 1.  

(The reason: numbers |x| ≤ R are still attainable without the new weight, and
every number R < x ≤ R + w can be written as x = w + y with 1 ≤ y ≤ R.)

Conversely, if w ≥ 2R + 2 the number R + 1 cannot be formed, so
w ≤ 2R + 1 is necessary for the range to remain continuous.

Start the construction:

1. The lightest weight must be 1 oz; otherwise 1 oz of gold dust could never
   be measured.  
   After using 1 oz we have R = 1.

2. The second weight may be at most 2·1 + 1 = 3 oz.
   Choose the largest possible: w2 = 3.  
   New reach: R = 1 + 3 = 4.

3. The third weight may be at most 2·4 + 1 = 9 oz.
   Choose w3 = 9.  
   New reach: R = 4 + 9 = 13.

4. The fourth weight may be at most 2·13 + 1 = 27 oz.
   Choose w4 = 27.  
   Final reach: R = 13 + 27 = 40.

Hence with the set of weights {1 oz, 3 oz, 9 oz, 27 oz} the assessor can
measure every integral number of ounces from 1 through 40
(these are just the positive numbers whose balanced-ternary expansions use at
most four digits).

Because at each step we chose the largest weight permissible, no other choice
of four weights can extend the continuous range beyond 40 oz. Therefore 40 is
the maximal possible amount.

130,"Question: Five young ladies (Liz, Marge, Sam, Ella and Jenny) went on five different hiking adventures. Each walked a distance of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 kilometers (random order). Each were able to take an extraordinary wildlife photograph in different locations (forest, meadow, mountain, river side and bushes) of different animals (rabbit, bird, deer, fox and bear cubs).  From the clues below determine where and of what each girl took a photograph of, and the distance each travelled.
1.  Liz walked twice as far as the girl who saw the deer.  The girl who got a shot of the fox travelled one kilometer less than Jenny.  The girl in the bushes was not the one who walked 5 kilometers.  The girl on the riverside walked either one kilometer more or less than the one who was in the bushes.
2.  The girl who was quick enough to capture the rabbit on film walked farther than Marge, but not as far as the one who got the bear cubs.  The girl who hiked up the mountain walked farther than at least one other girl, but not the farthest.  Either Ella or Sam walked more than one kilometer farther than the other.  Sam did not get a picture of the bird.  The mountain climber walked either one kilometer more or less than Marge.
3.  The meadow explorer was not the one to take a picture of the bird.  The bear cubs and the fox were not captured in the forest.  Ella hiked farther than the mountain climber. The girl in the meadow walked one kilometer more or less than the mountain climber.
4.  The girl on the riverside walked two kilometers more than the one who saw the fox.  The deer photographer did not hike as far as Ella, nor as far as the meadow explorer.  At least one traveller walked farther than Jenny.  The girl in the bushes walked either one kilometer more or less than the rabbit photographer.

Marge - 4 km, fox, meadow
Sam - 3km, deer, forest
Ella - 7 km, bear cubs, bushes
Jenny - 5 km, bird, mountain",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Reasoning (sketched)

1.  “Liz walked twice as far as the girl who saw the deer.”  
    Only 3 km doubled is 6 km, so  
       Liz = 6 km, Deer-girl = 3 km (not Liz).

2.  Use the two distance–difference chains  
       Riverside = Fox + 2     (Clue 4)  
       Riverside = Bushes ± 1    (Clue 1)  
       Bushes = Rabbit ± 1     (Clue 4)  
   Putting the three together forces the distances  
       Fox = 4 km, Jenny = 5 km, Riverside = 6 km,  
       Bushes = 7 km, Rabbit = 6 km.  
   Therefore Riverside & Rabbit are the same 6-km hiker – i.e. Liz (already 6 km).

3.  Bushes is 7 km (not 5 km as required by Clue 1) and therefore is the farthest walk.  
    From Clue 2, Rabbit (6 km) is longer than Marge but shorter than the Bear-girl,  
    so Bear must be the 7-km Bushes photographer.

4.  Working through the “mountain–meadow–Marge” group of clues (Clues 2 & 3) gives  
       Mountain = 5 km (hence Jenny is on the mountain),  
       Meadow = 4 km (±1 from the mountain),  
       Marge = 4 km (±1 from the mountain),  
       and Mountain 5 km is longer than at least one other (the 3-km walk) but not longest.  
   Because the 4-km hiker also shot the fox (Clue 1), Marge took the fox picture in the meadow.

5.  The 3 km distance (still unattached) must be the Deer photographer.  
    Making Sam the 3-km hiker satisfies both “Sam ≠ Bird” (Clue 2) and the Ella/Sam “>1 km apart” clue once Ella is fixed at 7 km.  
    Therefore  
       Sam = 3 km, Forest, Deer.

6.  Ella is the remaining girl; she already has 7 km and Bushes, hence Bear cubs.  

7.  The only animal still unattached is Bird, which therefore belongs to Jenny (the 5-km mountain hiker).

Everything now satisfies every clue.

Solution

Liz  – 6 km – Riverside – Rabbit  
Marge – 4 km – Meadow   – Fox  
Sam  – 3 km – Forest    – Deer  
Ella – 7 km – Bushes    – Bear cubs  
Jenny – 5 km – Mountain – Bird

Final answer: Liz took a picture of a rabbit at the riverside after hiking 6 km; Marge photographed a fox in the meadow after a 4-km walk; Sam hiked 3 km in the forest and shot the deer; Ella walked 7 km to the bushes and photographed bear cubs; and Jenny climbed the mountain for 5 km and got the bird on film.",True,1,0,0

Now Lardville is so small there is only one street with only ten houses, numbered from 1 to 10.
In a certain week, Patel did not deliver any mail at two houses in the village; at the other houses he delivered mail three times each. Each working day he delivered mail at exactly four houses.

1.  How many deliveries were made?  
   –  Patel worked 6 days and each day visited 4 different houses, so there were

2.  How many times could a single house have been visited?  
   –  Eight houses were visited three times apiece, giving the 24 deliveries.

3.  Use the totals for every day.  
   –  Adding the six daily sums that are given:  
     18 + 12 + 23 + 19 + 32 + 25 = 129.  
   –  Each visit contributes its house–number once to this grand total.

   •  If (5,7) were absent the largest attainable 4-house sum would be

Step 1 – pretend every piece were different  
Number of ways = 16! (all 16 pieces permuted over 16 squares).

Step 2 – correct for indistinguishability  
For each set of k identical pieces we have over-counted by a factor k!.  
Hence we divide by 8! for the pawns, by 2! for each pair of rooks, knights and bishops.

Total number of distinct arrangements  
= 16! / (8! · 2! · 2! · 2!)

Compute it:

16!/8! = 9·10·11·12·13·14·15·16 = 518 918 400  
Now divide by 2·2·2 = 8:

135,"Question: Heather, her husband, their son, their daughter, and Heather's brother lived together in a house...until yesterday, when one of the five was murdered by one of the other four. Here are some facts that refer only to the five family members:
1. At the time of the murder, a man and a woman were at the store together, the murderer and the victim were at the park together, and one of Heather's two children was at home alone.
2. Heather and her husband were apart at the time of the murder.
3. The victim's sibling is not the murderer.
4. The murderer is younger than the victim.
Who was murdered?
 Hint: From facts 1 and 2, Heather and her husband were at the store and the park, in some order. Suppose Heather was at the park. Then suppose Heather was not at the park. Find some contradiction.","From facts 1 and 2, Heather and her husband were at the store and the park, in some order. Suppose Heather was at the park. Then suppose Heather was not at the park. Find some contradiction.","Heather's brother was murdered.
From facts 1 and 2, Heather and her husband were at the store and the park, in some order. Suppose Heather was at the park. Then, from fact 1, Heather's husband and their daughter were at the store, their son was at home, and Heather and her brother were at the park, which means that one of Heather and her brother must have killed the other. But, from fact 3, this cannot work, which means that Heather was at the store.
Suppose the man at the store with Heather was her brother. Then her husband was at the park with one of the two children. Since the husband is obviously older than the children, fact 4 tells us that he could not have killed them. But since he doesn't have a sibling who lives with him, fact 3 tells us he can't be the victim either.
This means that Heather and her son were at the store, her daughter was at home, and Heather's husband and brother were at the park. Again, from fact 3, the husband could not have been the victim, which means that he was the murderer and the brother was the victim.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

• H  = Heather (woman)  
• M  = Heather’s husband (man)  
• B  = Heather’s brother (man)  
• S  = son (boy)  
• D  = daughter (girl)

There are five persons and three places at the moment of the crime:

store – exactly one man and one woman  
park – exactly the murderer and the victim  
home – exactly one of the two children, alone  

Fact 2 says Heather and her husband were apart.  
Hence, by Fact 1, one of them is the woman at the store and the other is at the park.  
That gives only two possibilities.

-------------------------------------------------
1)  Assume Heather was at the park.  
    Then her husband must be the man at the store.  
    Because the store already contains a man (M) and needs a woman, the daughter would
    have to be there too, leaving the son at home.  
    Thus the pair at the park must be H and B (the only two people left).

    Exactly one of that pair is the murderer and the other the victim.
    But Fact 3 says the victim’s sibling is not the murderer, and H and B are
    siblings.  Whichever of them is the victim, the other (the murderer) is a sibling,
    contradicting Fact 3.  Therefore this arrangement is impossible.

-------------------------------------------------
2)  Therefore Heather was not at the park; she was at the store.
    So her husband M is the person at the park.

    The store must contain one man with Heather.  
    “Man” means an adult male, so the only possible man with her is B (her brother);
    a boy (the son) would not satisfy the wording “a man and a woman”.
    Hence
        store : H (woman) and B (man)

    Of the two children, one is at home alone.
    Consequently the other child must be with M at the park:
        park  : M and (S or D)
        home  : the other child

    Now check the remaining facts.

    • Fact 3 – The victim’s sibling is not the murderer.
      If M were the murderer, the victim would be his own child and that child’s
      sibling would be the other child, who is not at the park; so Fact 3 would hold.
      But Fact 4 would fail (an adult cannot be younger than his child).
      Therefore M cannot be the murderer.

      Thus the child who is with him is the murderer and M is the victim; the sibling
      of the victim (the other child) is indeed not the murderer, satisfying Fact 3.

    • Fact 4 – The murderer is younger than the victim.
      A child is certainly younger than his or her father, so Fact 4 is satisfied.

Every fact is now satisfied, and the only possible victim is Heather’s husband.

The first four stones read

The next Fibonacci numbers would be

The stones actually show  

9 (instead of 8) and 12 (instead of 13).

Step 3 – Notice the very small, alternating “error”  
9 = 8 + 1 (the stone is 1 more than the Fibonacci number)  
12 = 13 – 1 (the stone is 1 less than the Fibonacci number)

So, beginning with the 5th term, the sequence is simply  
Fibonacci number, but alternately “+1, –1, +1, –1, …”.

Step 4 – Apply the rule to the next Fibonacci number  
The 7th Fibonacci number is 21.  
The last correction we saw was “–1”, so the alternation says the next correction is “+1”.  

21 + 1 = 22

Therefore the number that should be on the last stone is 22.

138,"Question: Ever since Emily began her new job, the last thing she wants to do when she gets home is clean her apartment.  She decided to make a schedule so that she would clean a different room (including the living room) each day (Monday through Friday).  Last week she procrastinated by talking on the phone, so this week, Emily decided to let the answering machine handle  her calls, and she received a different number of messages each day.  Can you determine the which rooms she cleaned each day and the number of messages she received?
Given:
Cleaning Days -- 	Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Number of Messages -- 	1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Rooms Cleaned -- 	Bedroom, Living Room, Bathroom, Den, Kitchen
Clues:
#1) Emily received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, but fewer than on Tuesday.
#2) Emily cleaned the bathroom on the day after receiving just one message and one day before she cleaned the den.
#3) She received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den.

**Clue #1:  If she received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, she could not have received 1 message on Thursday as the day she cleaned her room would have to be 0, which is not an option.  She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.
**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.
**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.
**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.
*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.  Looking back at clue 2 gives you the answer for the last section.  She received more messages when cleaning her bedroom than when cleaning the den.  So she received 3 in the bedroom, and 2 in the den.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step-1:  Set up the three parallel lists  

Days: Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri  
Rooms: Bedroom LivingRm Bathroom Den Kitchen  
Messages: 1 2 3 4 5  

Step-2:  Use the “three-day chain” in clue 2  
• “Bathroom on the day after receiving just one message and one day before she cleaned the den.”  
So we need three consecutive days  
 (day with 1 msg)  →  Bathroom  →  Den  

Try every possible position of Bathroom:  
• Mon: needs “1-msg Sunday” – impossible.  
• Tue: would put Den on Wed but Wed is kitchen (clue 4) – impossible.  
• Wed: would put Bathroom on Wed which is kitchen – impossible.  
• Thu: works – the day before (Wed) must be the 1-message day and Den is Fri.  
• Fri: needs Den on Sat – impossible.  

Therefore  
Wed – 1 message  
Thu – Bathroom  
Fri – Den  
and Wed (clue 4) is Kitchen.  

Current chart  
Mon:  ---           ---  
Tue:  ---           ---  
Wed:  Kitchen       1  
Thu:  Bathroom      ---  
Fri:  Den           ---  

Step-3:  Rooms left: Bedroom & Living Room.  
Days left: Monday & Tuesday.  

Step-4:  Translate the inequalities.  

Clue 1: Thu_msg > Bed_msg and Thu_msg < Tue_msg  
Clue 3: Bed_msg > Den_msg  

Combine: Tue_msg > Thu_msg > Bed_msg > Den_msg  

The four remaining message values are 2, 3, 4, 5 (1 is used).  
To satisfy the strict descending chain the only possible assignment is

Tue_msg = 5  
Thu_msg = 4  
Bed_msg = 3  
Den_msg = 2  

Step-5:  Place Bedroom and Living Room on the two free days.  
If Bedroom were on Tuesday we would have Thu_msg > Tue_msg, contradicting clue 1.  
Hence Bedroom is Monday and Living Room Tuesday.

Step-6:  Complete the table.

Monday:  Bedroom  3 messages  
Tuesday: Living Room 5 messages  
Wednesday: Kitchen 1 message  
Thursday: Bathroom 4 messages  
Friday:  Den   2 messages  

Step-7:  Verify every clue – all are satisfied.

1.  From clue 1 we know that
      Sense of Hume-or  →  Alex’s chapter  →  Descartes Before DesHorse  
   are three consecutive chapters.  
   Therefore Alex’s chapter can be #2, 3 or 4.

2.  Let the position of Sense of Hume-or be n.  
   The three-chapter run is  
        n : Sense of Hume-or  
        n+1 : Alex (some other title)  
        n+2 : Descartes Before DesHorse  
   Hence n ∈ {1,2,3}.

3.  From clue 3, Freudian Slippers is three chapters before Kiera’s chapter.  
   The only possible gaps of exactly 3 in five chapters are (1,4) and (2,5),  
   so the pair (Freudian, Kiera) is either (1,4) or (2,5).

4.  Work through the three possibilities for n.

   • n = 1  (Sense 1, Alex 2, Descartes 3)  
     Then Freudian must be #2 (otherwise no room for the 3-step gap),  
     so Alex’s title would be Freudian and Kiera would be #5.  
     Clue 2 fails because Jung would have to be #5, leaving nothing after it for Toby.  
     ⇒ Impossible.

   • n = 2  (Sense 2, Alex 3, Descartes 4)  
     Freudian must be #1 (so Kiera = #4).  
     The only place left for Jung is #3 or #5.  
     Jung = #3 forces Kant = #5, but clue 4 then puts Joan next to Kant at #4, which is forbidden.  
     Jung = #5 contradicts clue 2.  
     ⇒ Impossible.

   • n = 3  (Sense 3, Alex 4, Descartes 5)  
     Freudian must be #2 (so Kiera = #5).  
     The remaining title pair {Jung, Kant} occupies chapters #1 and #4.

     – If Jung were #4, Toby would have to come after #4 (clue 2),
       i.e. chapter 5, already taken by Kiera. Impossible.

     – Therefore Jung is #1 and Kant is #4 (Alex’s title).

     Now clue 4 says that two consecutive chapters are Kant and Joan’s chapter.
     Kant is #4, so Joan must be #3.  All conditions are now met.

5.  Fill in the remaining student names (Caleb is the only one left for chapter 1,
   Toby for chapter 2).

Let us call the four first-round (quarter-final) games A, B, C, D, the two second-round (semi-final) games E, F, and the final G.

Step 1 –  Shape of the tournament from the clues  

•  Clue 3 tells us that in the first round exactly three games are mixed-sex and one is same-sex; with five men and three women that single same-sex game must be a boy-vs-boy game.  
•  Jim always plays men (clue 7) and Roger plays a man in every round he plays (clue 4), so they must face each other in that lone boy-vs-boy first-round game; otherwise one of them would have to meet a woman later.  
 A : Roger  vs  Jim   (winner unknown yet)

•  Jessica is beaten by a man in the first round (clue 2); that man must reach the second round.  
 B : ( some man )  vs  Jessica

•  Tina loses in the first round to someone who also reaches the second round (clue 2).  
 C : ( somebody )   vs  Tina

•  Renee must reach the second round (clue 2), so she must win her first-round game; it must be mixed-sex because three of the four first-round games are mixed.  
 D : Renee  vs  ( some man )

•  Counting people, the men still not placed in a first-round game are Jack, Jamie and Tommy; the women still not placed are Jessica, Tina.  Arrange the mixed-sex games so that no two people with the same initial meet (clue 1):

 B : Tommy   beats   Jessica  
 C : Jack    beats   Tina  
 D : Renee   beats   Jamie  

A summary of the first round that satisfies every restriction so far is

 A  Roger  beat Jim       (boy-boy)

 • Renee  
 • the person who beat Tina  (Jack)  
 • the man who beat Jessica (Tommy)  
 • the eventual loser of the final

Thus the winner of game A (Roger or Jim) must be the eventual final loser, so game A is won by Roger (Jim would have to face a woman later, violating clue 7).  Therefore

 A  Roger beat Jim

The four semi-finalists are therefore Roger, Tommy, Jack, Renee.

Step 3 –  Pair the semi-finals

Clue 3 says that of the two second-round games exactly one is mixed-sex.  
Make

 E : Roger (boy)  vs  Tommy (boy)       – same-sex  
 F : Jack  (boy)  vs  Renee (girl)       – mixed

Clue 6 says the man who beats Tommy in the second round reaches the final and loses there.  
So Roger beats Tommy in game E and later loses the final.  
Therefore Jack must beat Renee in game F and then beat Roger in the final, because Jack still satisfies clue 4 (he meets a man only once – in the final).

Step 4 –  Verify all clues

First round: 3 mixed games and 1 boy-boy game ✔  
Second round: 1 mixed (Jack–Renee) and 1 same-sex (Roger–Tommy) ✔  
No game ever had matching initials (J vs J, etc.) ✔  
Jack met a man only in the final ✔  
Roger met a man in every round he played ✔  
Jim played only one game, against a man ✔  
Renee played Jack (in the semi-final) ✔  
Jessica never faced the champion Jack ✔  
Everything is consistent.

The complete tournament

Quarter-finals (1st round)  
• Roger defeated Jim  
• Tommy defeated Jessica  
• Jack defeated Tina  
• Renee defeated Jamie  

Semi-finals (2nd round)

5th - Black Team - Eric & Misty",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"We have 10 players and 5 coloured teams, each team containing exactly two players and receiving a final position from 1st-5th.  
Exactly the two players on the team that finished 5th are lying; everybody else is telling the truth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Holly → “White placed 3rd.  Leah, not I, is on White.”  
    •  If Holly were lying she would have to be last, hence on White, contradicting “I wasn’t on the white team”.  
       Therefore Holly is truthful and  
            White = 3rd,  Leah ∈ White,  Holly ∉ White.

2.  Leah (now known truthful) says  
            a) she is on the same team as Emma  ⇒  Emma ∈ White;  
            b) she beat Eric  ⇒  Eric finished 4th or 5th;  
            c) she lost to Callie  ⇒  Callie’s team is 1st or 2nd;  
            d) Red is in the top-3  ⇒  Red = 1st or 2nd (for White is already 3rd).

3.  Callie claims “I’m 2nd, and I beat the Green team and Emma.”  
    •  Emma is on White (3rd), so that is consistent.  
    •  Thus Callie’s team is 2nd and not Green or White.  
    •  Hence Green is 3rd, 4th or 5th; but since White is 3rd, Green is 4th or 5th.

4.  Quinn: “I’m 4th, and the Blue team is 2nd.”  
    Quinn is not last (only 5th lies) ⇒ he is truthful:  
            Blue = 2nd (Callie’s team), Quinn is on some 4th-place colour ≠ Blue.

5.  Draco: “Callie, Emma, Misty are all on different teams.”  
    Already Callie = Blue, Emma = White, so Misty is on a colour ≠ Blue, White.

6.  Emma (truthful, on White 3rd): “Ace, Draco, Callie all placed better than me.”  
    •  Only ranks better than 3rd are 1st and 2nd.  
    •  Callie is already 2nd, so Ace and Draco must be on the same team, 1st.

7.  Leah has already forced Red into the top-3; since 2nd is Blue and 3rd is White,  
            Red must be 1st.  
    Therefore 1st-place Red = {Ace, Draco}.

8.  Ace (truthful, on Red): “Xander’s team, Misty’s team, 1st, 3rd and Green are all different.”  
    •  Hence Misty is NOT on Green, and Xander is on neither Green nor Red nor White nor Misty’s team.

9.  Xander says “Red and Callie beat Black.”  So Black finished below both Red (1st) and Blue (2nd); Black is 4th or 5th.

10. From 4th-place so far we only know Quinn is there.  The colours still free are Green and Black:  
        – If Black were 4th, Ace’s statement would force Misty off Black (she’d have to be on the last team),  
          leaving Green for 5th; but then Misty would be on Green, contradicting Ace.  
        – Thus Black cannot be 4th.  Therefore  
                Green = 4th,  Black = 5th.

11.  Consequently the 5th-place (lying) team is Black.  
      It must contain Misty (still unplaced) and Eric (the only player we know could be 4th or 5th).  
      Misty and Eric therefore are the two liars on Black (5th).

12.  The 4th-place Green team already has Quinn; the only unassigned truthful player left is Holly,  
      so Green (4th) = {Holly, Quinn}.

13.  Finally, Blue (2nd) still needs a second member; the only remaining unassigned truthful player is Xander.  
      Blue (2nd) = {Callie, Xander}.  All constraints in Ace’s statement are now satisfied.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Verification of every statement:

•  Truth-tellers (all but Misty & Eric) are satisfied exactly as stated.  
•  Eric’s claim “Green beat Blue within 2” is false (Green 4th, Blue 2nd).  
•  Misty’s claim “I was 2nd and one place ahead of Red” is false (she’s 5th, Red 1st).

All conditions are met; hence the unique solution is:

1st place – Red:   Ace, Draco  
2nd place – Blue:  Callie, Xander  
3rd place – White: Emma, Leah  
4th place – Green: Holly, Quinn  
5th place – Black: Misty, Eric   (the two liars)

“Sharing n letters” means that S and the given word have exactly n different letters in common, multiplicities ignored.

1.  S shares 2 letters with MAGIC = {M,A,G,I,C}.  
    Because of the hint, A must be in S, so S contains A plus exactly one of {M,G,I,C}.

2.  S shares 2 letters with YEARN = {Y,E,A,R,N}.  
    With A already counted, S must contain exactly one of {Y,E,R,N}.

3.  S shares 2 letters with BLAME = {B,L,A,M,E}.  
    So, apart from A, S contains exactly one of {B,L,M,E}.

4.  S shares 2 letters with GRABS = {G,R,A,B,S}.  
    Apart from A, S contains exactly one of {G,R,B,S}.

5.  S shares 2 letters with KARMA = {K,A,R,M}.  
    Apart from A, S contains exactly one of {K,R,M}.

6.  S shares 3 letters with BREAK = {B,R,E,A,K}.  
    Since A is already in S, S must contain two more letters chosen from {B,R,E,K}.

We need one 5-letter set that satisfies all six conditions simultaneously.

Try the set of letters {C,A,K,E,S}:

From (1) and (3), the house number must be from 50 to 59 or 70 to 79. Take any number. It will be either a multiple of 3 or not. Also, a number multiple of 6 is always a multiple of 3. Hence, the house number can be 51, 54, 57, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76, 77 or 79.

Hence, Mad Ade's house number is 76.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let N be Mad Ade’s house number.

Rewrite each of the three sentences as a logical implication.

(1)  (N is a multiple of 3) ⟹ (50 ≤ N ≤ 59)  

(2)  (N is NOT a multiple of 4) ⟹ (60 ≤ N ≤ 69)

(3)  (N is NOT a multiple of 6) ⟹ (70 ≤ N ≤ 79)

The contrapositive of each implication is often more useful:

(1′)  If N is outside 50–59, then N is NOT a multiple of 3.  
(2′)  If N is outside 60–69, then N IS a multiple of 4.  
(3′)  If N is outside 70–79, then N IS a multiple of 6.

Step 1.  Use (1) and (3) as the hint suggests.  
• If N were in 60–69, statement (3′) would force N to be a multiple of 6, making it a multiple of 3, contradicting (1′).  
Hence N cannot lie in 60–69.  
Therefore N must be in 50–59 or 70–79.

Step 2.  Examine 50–59.  
For N in 50–59, statement (3) is satisfied only when its antecedent is false, i.e. N must be a multiple of 6.  
For the same N, statement (2) is satisfied only when its antecedent is false, i.e. N must be a multiple of 4.  
Thus N must be a multiple of lcm(4,6)=12, but no multiple of 12 lies between 50 and 59.  
Hence no number in 50–59 works.

Step 3.  Examine 70–79.  
In this range, statement (3) is automatically true because its conclusion is satisfied.  
• Statement (1) requires the antecedent to be false (otherwise 50–59 would be violated), so N must NOT be a multiple of 3.  
• Statement (2) requires the antecedent to be false (otherwise 60–69 would be violated), so N must BE a multiple of 4.

Thus within 70–79, N must be divisible by 4 but not by 3.

Numbers in 70–79 divisible by 4: 72, 76.  
72 is also divisible by 3, so it is ruled out.  
76 is divisible by 4 and not by 3, so it meets every requirement.

Verification for N = 76  
(1) 76 is not a multiple of 3 ⇒ condition holds vacuously.  
(2) 76 is a multiple of 4 ⇒ antecedent false, condition holds.  
(3) 76 is not a multiple of 6 and lies in 70–79 ⇒ condition holds.

All three statements are satisfied only by 76.

148,"Question: There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?
 Hint: Divide the coins into 3 groups",Divide the coins into 3 groups,"Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.
Now let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.

 If the opposite happens, interchange “left” and “right” and swap the roles
 of ‘heavy’ and ‘light’ in what follows.)

 Weighing 2 (W₂II)  1 2 5  vs  3 6 9  (coin 9 is genuine and acts as a reference)

 a) W₂II balances

   left heavy ⇒ 8 light (left pan heavier means right coin is lighter)

(The mirror image of these three sub-cases solves the situation in which
the right pan was heavier in W₁.)

149,"Question: Hans Ernest Froopaloop, Jr. is in a play with four relatives: his sister, mother, son, and daughter. Each of the five has a different dressing room:
Room A: small, borders rooms B and E
Room B: large, borders rooms A, C, D, and E
Room C: large, borders rooms B and D
Room D: small, borders rooms B, C, and E
Room E: large, borders rooms A, B, and D
Here are some facts:
1. The rooms of the lead actor in the play and his or her sibling border the same number of rooms.
2. The lead's room and his or her parent's room are the same size.
3. HEF Jr's room and his daughter's room do not border each other.
4. Each room borders at least one man's room and at least one woman's room.
Who is the lead actor?
 Hint: There are multiple possible final arrangements. But the answer is still the same",There are multiple possible final arrangements. But the answer is still the same,"HEF Jr's sister is the lead actor.
From fact 4, we know that rooms A and C each border one man's room and one woman's room. So one of rooms B and E is occupied by a man and the other by a woman, and one of rooms B and D is occupied by a man and the other by a woman. If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.
Since there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.
Since there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.
Fact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son. Therefore, the siblings in rooms A and C must be HEF Jr. and his sister, and one of them must be the lead actor. From fact 3, we have these two scenarios:
1.
Room A: HEF Jr.
Room B: Son
Room C: Sister
Room D: Daughter
Room E: Mother
2.
Room A: Sister
Room B: Son
Room C: HEF Jr.
Room D: Mother
Room E: Daughter
In either scenario, the mother's and the sister's rooms are the same size. And from fact 2, the sister is the lead.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

H = Hans Ernest Froopaloop, Jr. (male)  
Mo = Mother (female)  
Si = Sister (female)  
So = Son (male)  
Da = Daughter (female)  

Rooms  

A – small, borders B & E   (degree 2)  
B – large, borders A,C,D,E  (degree 4)  
C – large, borders B & D   (degree 2)  
D – small, borders B,C,E    (degree 3)  
E – large, borders A,B,D    (degree 3)

General observations  

• Each room must border at least one male room and one female room.  
• Because the only room of degree 4 is B, no one whose room must match a sibling’s degree can be in B.  
• The two rooms whose degrees match are {A,C} (both degree 2) and {D,E} (both degree 3).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Can H be the lead?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If H is the lead, his sibling Si must occupy a room with the same degree.

a)  Degree 2 pair {A,C}.  
    – If H is in A, Da would have to be in B or E (both adjacent to A), violating rule 3 (H’s room may not border Da’s).  
    – If H is in C, Da can only go to E; then A (Si) borders only females, breaking rule 4.  

b)  Degree 3 pair {D,E}.  
    – If H is in D, Da must avoid B,C,E (all adjacent to D) – impossible.  
    – If H is in E, Da can only go to C, but then C borders no male room, again breaking rule 4.  

Hence H cannot be the lead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Can So be the lead?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
So’s sibling is Da.

a)  Degree 2 pair {A,C}.  
    – Any placement forces H (the parent) next to Da, contradicting rule 3.  

b)  Degree 3 pair {D,E}.  
    – Whichever room Da occupies, H (who must have the same-sized room as So) ends up adjacent to her, again violating rule 3.  

So cannot be the lead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Can Da be the lead?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Da’s sibling is So.

a)  Degree 2 pair {A,C}.  
    – Room A for Da fails rule 4 (A would touch only females).  
    – Room C for Da also fails rule 4 (C would touch only females).  

b)  Degree 3 pair {D,E}.  
    – (Da,D) gives C with no male neighbour.  
    – (Da,E) leaves A with no male neighbour.  

Da cannot be the lead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Sister Si as the lead
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Si’s sibling is H; their rooms must have the same degree, and Si’s room must be the same size as her parent’s (Mo’s).

Choose the degree-2 pair {A,C}.  
Place Si in A (small) and H in C (large).  
Mo must occupy another small room, D.  
Rule 3 keeps Da away from H, so put Da in E.  
The only remaining room, B, goes to So.

Arrangement obtained  
A  – Si (F)  
B  – So (M)  
C  – H  (M)  
D  – Mo (F)  
E  – Da (F)

Check rule 4 (each room has male & female neighbours):

A touches B(M), E(F) ✅  
B touches A(F), C(M), D(F), E(F) ✅  
C touches B(M), D(F) ✅  
D touches B(M), C(M), E(F) ✅  
E touches A(F), B(M), D(F) ✅  

All four rules are satisfied, so a valid arrangement exists with Sister as the lead.

Because the other three candidates (H, So, Da) are impossible, every valid arrangement of the rooms has Sister as the lead actor.

150,"Question: There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:
1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.
2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).
3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.
4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.
Now, here's the kicker:
5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).
6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).
Assumptions:
1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.
2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.
3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.
So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?
 Hint: There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","The sheep would remain untouched.
In fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.
Here's the reasoning:
Consider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.
Now look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.
So now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.
We can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.
You can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"We analyse the situation for any number n ≥ 1 of lions, using the facts that  
• after eating the sheep, the attacking lion instantly becomes a sheep,  
• every lion can foresee perfectly what will happen next and prefers eternal grass-eating to the slightest danger of being eaten later.

Step 1 – two base cases  
n = 1 One lion + one sheep.  
If the lion eats, he turns into the only sheep and there are then 0 lions left, so no danger at all.  
Hence he eats. ⇒ With 1 lion the sheep is eaten.

n = 2 Two lions + one sheep.  
Suppose one lion considers eating. Afterward there would be 1 lion and 1 (new) sheep.  
We have just established that with 1 lion the sheep gets eaten – which would now be the ex-lion.  
Since the prospective attacker would surely be eaten, he refuses.  
The same reasoning holds for the other lion.  
Hence neither attacks. ⇒ With 2 lions the sheep survives.

Step 2 – induction hypothesis  
Assume we already know the outcome for every number smaller than n, and that it follows the pattern

  odd number of lions  ⇒  sheep gets eaten  
  even number of lions ⇒  sheep survives.

Step 3 – decision for n lions  
Any given lion considers the following:  

“If I eat the sheep, I will turn into a sheep and there will be n – 1 lions left.  
• If with n – 1 lions a sheep is safe, then I (as the new sheep) will be safe and I gladly eat.  
• If with n – 1 lions a sheep is eaten, then I will be eaten and I refuse.”

By the induction hypothesis:  
• n – 1 is even  ⇔  n is odd ⇒ with n – 1 lions the sheep is safe ⇒ the lion does attack.  
• n – 1 is odd  ⇔  n is even ⇒ with n – 1 lions the sheep is eaten ⇒ no lion attacks.

Hence

  n odd  ⇒ one lion attacks, so the original sheep is eaten.  
  n even ⇒ no lion attacks, so the sheep survives.

Step 4 – apply to the actual problem  
There are n = 100 lions. 100 is even, so by the rule above no lion dares to attack.

Final answer: The sheep is NOT eaten; with 100 (an even number of) lions, every lion prefers to keep eating grass rather than risk becoming a sheep that would subsequently be eaten.",True,1,0,0
151,"Question: During a recent plane and train spotting contest, five eager entrants were lined up ready to be tested on their spotting ability. They had each spotted a number of planes (26, 86, 123, 174, 250) and a number of trains (5, 42, 45, 98, 105). From the clues below, can you determine what colour shirt each was wearing, their position, their age (21, 23, 31, 36, 40) and the number of trains and planes spotted?
1. Bob spotted 44 less trains than planes.
2. Tom was 36 years old.
3. The person on the far right was 8 years younger than Bob, and spotted 174 planes.
4. Josh was wearing a yellow shirt and spotted 37 trains fewer than Bob.
5. The person who was wearing a green shirt, was 19 years younger than the person to his left.
6. Steven spotted 105 trains and 250 planes.
7. The person in the centre was 31 years old, was wearing a blue shirt and spotted 42 trains.
8. Doug, who was on the far left, spotted 26 planes, and spotted 72 trains more than planes.
9. The person who was wearing a red shirt was 4 years older than Tom and was not next to the person wearing a blue shirt.

1.  “Bob spotted 44 less trains than planes.”  
   Only the pair 86 planes / 42 trains has that difference → Bob: 86 planes, 42 trains.  

2.  “The person in the centre was 31 years old, was wearing a blue shirt and spotted 42 trains.”  
   Therefore Bob is the centre person (position 3), age 31, blue shirt.  

3.  “Doug, who was on the far left, spotted 26 planes, and spotted 72 trains more than planes.”  
   Position 1 = Doug, 26 planes, 98 trains (26+72).  

4.  “Steven spotted 105 trains and 250 planes.”  
   No one yet has those numbers; keep for later.  

5.  “The person on the far right was 8 years younger than Bob, and spotted 174 planes.”  
   Bob is 31, so far-right (position 5) is age 23 and 174 planes.  

6.  “Tom was 36 years old.”  

7.  “Josh was wearing a yellow shirt and spotted 37 trains fewer than Bob.”  
   Bob has 42 trains → Josh has 5 trains and wears yellow.  

8.  “The person who was next to the 31-year-old, but not next to the person who spotted 26 planes, wore an orange shirt and spotted 45 trains.”  
   Neighbours of position 3 are positions 2 and 4; only position 4 is not beside the 26-plane spotter (position 1).  
   → Position 4: orange shirt, 45 trains.  

9.  Insert Steven’s figures: only vacant train count 105 so far is in position 2 (position 4 already fixed at 45, others fixed).  
   → Position 2 = Steven, 250 planes, 105 trains.  

10.  Shirt colours so far: red ?, green ?, blue (pos 3), orange (pos 4), yellow (pos 5).  
    The remaining colours green & red go to positions 2 and 1 in some order.

11.  “The person who was wearing a green shirt, was 19 years younger than the person to his left.”  
    If position 2 is green, person left (pos 1) must be 19 years older.  
    Ages available: so far Bob 31, pos 5 23, Tom 36 (yet to place), ages unused 21 & 40.  
    40 – 19 = 21, a valid unused age → position 2 green, age 21; position 1 age 40.  
    Hence Steven (pos 2) is green and 21 years old; Doug (pos 1) is 40.  

12.  “The person who was wearing a red shirt was 4 years older than Tom and was not next to the person wearing a blue shirt.”  
    Blue is position 3, so red cannot be positions 2 or 4.  
    Only position 1 fits; its age is 40, so Tom must be 4 years younger = 36.  
    Thus Doug (pos 1) wears red; Tom (age 36) is already in position 4.  

13.  Position 5 has trains 5 (Josh) and therefore wears yellow (already consistent).  

14.  Remaining plane count not yet assigned is 123; it must belong to Tom in position 4.  

The fully resolved table

Position 1 (far left): Doug – age 40, red shirt, 26 planes, 98 trains  
Position 2: Steven – age 21, green shirt, 250 planes, 105 trains

153,"Question: In the village of Einstown, every villager thought they were the cleverest. They used to argue about it all the time, so eventually the leader devised a clever plan. He pretended to hold a vote for who was the cleverest person, where people had to nominate other villagers to go up to the vote. Everyone in the village would know of everyone nominated except themselves, and they all knew that at least one person got nominated.
Once the nominations were over the leader announced his plan. He said that the first person to come forward and say that they were nominated with proof would be the cleverest person in the village. He told them to go to the village hall at exactly 7:00 pm once they had worked it out. None of the people told each other if they got nominated, as they all wanted to win.
After the first night nobody had come forward. Nobody came forward on the second night either. Nor the third, fourth fifth etc. Eventually on the 30th night a certain number of people came forward claiming to have been nominated. They were all right.
How many people came forward on the 30th night and why? (Assume that they all were clever enough to work the method out).
 Hint: Induction",Induction,"Call the number of people nominated N.
Any person nominated would know of N-1 people nominated, as they would not know that they themselves were nominated. If there was 1 person nominated, the nominee would know of nobody who was nominated, and therefore would know that they were nominated. Because nobody came forward on the first night there was more than one person nominated.
Using the same logic, anyone on the second night who knew of one person nominated would then be able to work out that they were nominated as there was at least two people. Because nobody came forward on the second night there was at least three.
This carries on all the way up. Nobody came forward on the 29th night, meaning there was at least thirty. People now came forward the next night, so everyone who came forward knew of 29 nominees, meaning 30 people came forward on the 30th night.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  
N = the number of villagers who were actually nominated.  
Because of the way the leader set up the information:

• Every villager can see the whole list of nominees ­except possibly his own name.  
• Everybody knows that at least one person was nominated.  
• Nobody can communicate after the nominations are posted.  
• A villager will come forward only when he can prove (to his own satisfaction and to everyone else) that his own name is on the list.

This is exactly the classical “muddy‐children / blue‐eyes” logical puzzle, so we analyse it by induction on N.

-------------------------------------------------
Base case  N = 1
-------------------------------------------------
Suppose only one person, call her A, was nominated.

• A sees NO names on the list.  
• But everyone has been told “at least one person was nominated.”  
• Therefore A can immediately deduce: “If it isn’t anyone else, it must be me.”  

So A can already prove her nomination and will come forward the first night.  
Because she is correct, the game ends that first night when exactly one person appears.

-------------------------------------------------
Inductive hypothesis
-------------------------------------------------
Assume that if exactly k villagers were nominated, then every one of those k villagers, and only they, will come forward together on the k-th night.

-------------------------------------------------
Inductive step  (k  →  k + 1)
-------------------------------------------------
Now suppose exactly k+1 villagers were nominated.  Fix the point of view of one nominated villager X.

• X sees k other nominated villagers.  
• X must decide whether there are k or k+1 in total.

X performs this reasoning:

1. “If there were only k nominees in total, then by the inductive hypothesis those k people would all realise the situation and appear on night k.”  
2. “I will wait k nights and watch.”  
3. If nobody appears on night k, X concludes that the hypothesis ‘only k were nominated’ is false. Therefore there must be k+1 nominees, which means X himself is also on the list.  
4. Having obtained a proof, X will appear on night k+1.

Every one of the k other nominated villagers follows the identical reasoning, so all k+1 nominated villagers come forward together on night k+1.  
No non-nominated villager can ever find a proof, so no one else comes.

Thus the statement holds for k+1, completing the induction.

-------------------------------------------------
Application to the given story
-------------------------------------------------
In Einstown nobody appears the 1st, 2nd, … , 29th nights, but some villagers do appear on the 30th night, and all who appear are correct.  
By the argument above, the only way the first appearance can be exactly on the 30th night is if N = 30.

Therefore exactly 30 villagers were nominated, and those 30 (and only those 30) came forward on the 30th night.

154,"Question: One day three kids decide to wreak havoc in town-again (this is the third time this month). This time they run into an old man's grocery store and steal quite a few items. They hit the wrong spot this time, because this was Old Man Justice's place (he's notorious for meting out his own brand of 'justice'). Old Man Justice chases the kids through town, and during the chase, they drop the goods, turn around, and start chasing him. Unfortunately, the old man falls into a ditch and is badly hurt. A month later after he recovers he is able to identify the culprits, and Old Man Justice calls in his 'support team,' (2 of which were also victims of the thieves), and has the perpetrators rounded up for justice. At a dinner later that evening, dubbed the 'Repast of Right' the old man begins with these words:
'To do what we've done took moxie and nerve,
But alas! As we eat, our justice is served.
As we've judged these few, let's render to each their due,
Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'
(What we see as JUST, is JUST what we do.)
Neither trial, nor jury, should these ones receive,
No more to trouble us, for no more shall they breathe!
So drink wine of success, and not of defeat,
Justice is waiting, so friends let us eat.'

It is not an 'eye for eye' but more like 'one for two' because Old Man Justice was only injured, not killed, therefore the 'justice' is not proportionate to the crime.

   • In ordinary conversation “kid” can mean “child.”  
   • In husbandry, however, a “kid” is a young goat.  
   • The hint (“ ‘Kids’ can mean something else ”) invites us to switch from the human sense to the animal sense.

2.  Interpreting the story with “kid = young goat”  
   • Three goats wander into a grocery, knock things about (“steal quite a few items”), are chased, then turn and butt the old man.  
   • Goats are quite capable of head-butting and knocking someone into a ditch, which explains the old man’s injury without attributing murderous intent to children.  

3.  Why no cannibalism?  
   • If the culprits were human children, killing and eating them would be cannibalism.  
   • The problem explicitly says the diners are “not cannibals,” so the culprits cannot be human.  
   • Eating goat, on the other hand, is ordinary meat-eating, not cannibalism.  

4.  The poem’s clues

   • Old Man Justice and his companions slaughter the goats and serve them as the main course at their celebratory dinner.

( 60 / 5 = 12 )","Each hour, the minute hand moves 60 intervals, while the hour hand moves 5 intervals. The hour hand is exactly on a line every 12 minutes. ( 60 / 5 = 12 )","1. The time is 2:12.
2. The time is 9:48.
The hour hand is exactly on a line every 12 minutes, so we only need to look at times ending in 00, 12, 24, 36, and 48.
The hands exactly overlap at 12:00. They are 5 lines apart at 11:00 and 1:00, and farther apart at other hours.
At times ending in 12, the hands are closest at 2:12, where they are 1 line apart.
At times ending in 24, the hands are closest at 4:24, where they are 2 lines apart.
At times ending in 36, the hands are closest at 7:36, where they are 2 lines apart.
At times ending in 48, the hands are closest at 9:48, where they are 1 line apart.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let t be the number of minutes elapsed after 12 : 00.

Positions expressed in “lines” (one line = one minute mark = 6°):

• Minute hand: moves 1 line per minute  →  position = t  (mod 60).  
• Hour hand: moves 1⁄12 line per minute (0.5°/min) → position = t⁄12 (mod 60).

Because the hour hand must be exactly on a line, t⁄12 must be an integer.  
Write t = 12k, where k (0 ≤ k < 60) is that integer line number.

At that moment  
 hour-hand line = k,  
 minute-hand line = 12k (mod 60).

--------------------------------------------------
1.  Minute hand on the NEXT line  
 12k ≡ k + 1  (mod 60)  
 11k ≡ 1      (mod 60).

Since gcd(11, 60)=1, 11 is its own inverse modulo 60 (11·11 = 121 ≡ 1).  
 k ≡ 11 (mod 60)  ⇒  k = 11.

Time: t = 12·11 = 132 minutes = 2 hours 12 minutes.  
So the hands are as desired at 2 : 12.

--------------------------------------------------
2.  Minute hand on the PREVIOUS line  
 12k ≡ k − 1  (mod 60)  
 11k ≡ −1 ≡ 59  (mod 60).

Multiply by the inverse 11:  
 k ≡ 11·59 ≡ 649 ≡ 49 (mod 60)  ⇒  k = 49.

Time: t = 12·49 = 588 minutes = 9 hours 48 minutes.  
So the hands are as desired at 9 : 48.

156,"Question: In the following code, each symbol stands for one of five letters.
! stands for I, S, A, T, or N
# stands for N, F, R, S, or T
& stands for J, E, B, O, or G
* stands for H, E, K, P, or W
^ stands for L, U, D, R, or I
The five letter code word, #&^!*, can be translated into two English words that are opposites. What are the two words?
 Hint: Directionality",Directionality,North and South,GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"We are told that the five-symbol code  

 # & ^ ! *  

can be deciphered because each symbol may stand for any one of five possible letters:

• #  →  N, F, R, S, T

• ^  →  L, U, D, R, I  
• !  →  I, S, A, T, N  
• *  →  H, E, K, P, W  

The hint we are given is “Directionality,” so we look for pairs of opposite direction words that are five letters long.

The obvious pair is NORTH and SOUTH.

Check whether the letters of each word can be chosen from the allowed sets:

N O R T H  
# & ^ ! *  

#  → N  (N is allowed for #)  
&  → O  (O is allowed for &)  
^  → R  (R is allowed for ^)

157,"Question: I was going through some old family photos in the attic when I stumbled upon our family tree.  I studied it for a couple minutes then went back down stairs to tell my mom about the family tree.  The problem is I didn't study it long enough to remember the whole thing.  I only remembered  a couple things about it, and recent memories.  Can you help me figure out my family tree?  There are two grandparents, who had two children, who both got married and had 2 more children each.  Totaling 10 people in all (Alex, David, Jamie, Jessica, John, Justin, Lincoln, Martha, Mary and Tina).
1.  One of Jamie's ancestors was David.
2.  John's sister gave birth to Tina.
3.  Mary went bowling with her nephew last Saturday.
4.  Alex is cousins with one of the girls.
5.  Justin married Mary.
6.  Jessica is not an ancestor, nor cousin of Tina.
7. Lincoln's brother showed Justin's son his baseball cards.
 Hint: Martha is a grandparent",Martha is a grandparent,"Martha and David were the grandparents.
They gave birth to John and Mary.
John married Jessica, who gave birth to Lincoln and Alex.
Mary married Justin and gave birth to Tina and Jamie.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let us label the positions in the small family tree that the problem describes.

Generation-1 (the grandparents)  : 2 people  
Generation-2 (their two children + the two spouses) : 4 people  
Generation-3 (four grandchildren)         : 4 people  
Total                                                            : 10 people  

Step 1.  Use the hint.  
 •  Martha is a grandparent  ⟹  Martha is one of the two Generation-1 people.

Step 2.  Interpret clue (2).  
 •  “John’s sister gave birth to Tina.”  
  John and his sister must be the two biological children of the grandparents (Generation-2).  
  Therefore John is in Generation-2, his sister is in Generation-2, and Tina is a grandchild
  (Generation-3).

Step 3.  Fit clue (5).  
 •  “Justin married Mary.”  The only marriages in the tree are the two Generation-2 couples, so
  Justin and Mary form one of those couples.

Step 4.  Combine steps 2 & 3.  
 •  John’s sister could be Mary.  Doing so makes perfect sense:
  John (son)       Mary (daughter)  
           Mary is married to Justin.  
  Hence Mary is the sister mentioned in clue (2),
  and she indeed “gave birth to Tina.”

So far we have

 Grandparents  : Martha + ­?  
 Children (Gen-2): John  and Mary (married to Justin)  
 Spouses (Gen-2): Justin and John’s unknown spouse

Step 5.  Choose the second grandparent.  
 •  From the unused names, David is the only one that
  appears later as an ancestor (clue 1), so take
  David to be Martha’s husband, i.e. the second grandparent.

Step 6.  Use clue (6).  
 •  “Jessica is not an ancestor, nor cousin of Tina.”  
  Jessica therefore must be neither in Generation-1 nor in Generation-3.  
  Put her as John’s spouse in Generation-2.  
  (Then she is Tina’s aunt-by-marriage, not an ancestor or cousin.)

Now Generation-2 is completely fixed:

 John  ── married to Jessica  
 Mary ── married to Justin

Step 7.  Assign the four grandchildren.  The names still unused are  
 Alex, Jamie, Lincoln and the already-fixed Tina.

 Let John & Jessica have two sons: Alex and Lincoln.  
 Let Mary & Justin have two children: Jamie (son) and Tina (daughter).

Step 8.  Check every clue.

(1)  “One of Jamie’s ancestors was David.”  
  David is Jamie’s grandfather. ✓

(2)  Already satisfied by construction. ✓

(3)  “Mary went bowling with her nephew.”  
  Mary’s nephews are John’s sons Alex and Lincoln; choose either. ✓

(4)  “Alex is cousins with one of the girls.”  
  Alex’s girl cousin is Tina. ✓

(5)  Built in. ✓

(6)  Built in.  Jessica is Tina’s aunt, not ancestor or cousin. ✓

(7)  “Lincoln’s brother showed Justin’s son his baseball cards.”  
  Lincoln’s brother is Alex; Justin’s son is Jamie;  
  Alex showed Jamie his baseball cards. ✓

All clues are simultaneously satisfied.

Hence the complete family tree is:

Generation 1 (grandparents)  
 David ── married to ── Martha  

Generation 2 (their children and spouses)  
 •  John ── married to ── Jessica  
 •  Mary ── married to ── Justin  

Generation 3 (their children)  
 Children of John & Jessica : Alex and Lincoln  
 Children of Mary & Justin : Jamie and Tina

158,"Question: Two children, who were all tangled up in their reckoning of the days of the week, paused on their way to school to straighten matters out. ""When the day after tomorrow is yesterday,"" said Priscilla, ""then 'today' will be as far from Sunday as that day was which was 'today' when the day before yesterday was tomorrow!""
On which day of the week did this puzzling prattle occur?
 Hint: Why did they stop on their way to school?",Why did they stop on their way to school?,The two children were so befogged over the calendar that they had started on their way to school on Sunday morning!,GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let “today’’ – the day on which the children are talking – be T.

Step 1.  Translate the two queer time-clauses.

(a)  “The day after tomorrow’’ is T + 2.  
     For that day to be “yesterday’’ we must have moved one further day on, to T + 3.  
     So “when the day after tomorrow is yesterday’’ means the day T + 3.

(b)  “The day before yesterday’’ is T – 2.  
     For that day to be “tomorrow’’ we must be one day earlier, i.e. on T – 3.  
     Hence “the day that was ‘today’ when the day before yesterday was tomorrow’’ is the day T – 3.

Thus the sentence really says:

On the day T + 3, the distance from Sunday of that day must equal the distance from Sunday of the day T – 3.

Step 2.  Express the condition “equally far from Sunday’’.

Label the days of the week by the numbers  
 Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, … , Saturday = 6 (mod 7).

For any day x let  
 d(x) = the (shortest) number of days between x and Sunday  
    = min(x, 7 – x).

The condition is

 d(T + 3)  =  d(T – 3).                              (1)

Step 3.  Solve (1).

Compute d(T + 3) and d(T – 3) for the seven possible values of T.

 T  | T+3 | d(T+3) | T–3 | d(T–3)  
 0  |  3  |   3    |  4  |    3     ✓  
 1  |  4  |   3    |  5  |    2  
 2  |  5  |   2    |  6  |    1  
 3  |  6  |   1    |  0  |    0  
 4  |  0  |   0    |  1  |    1  
 5  |  1  |   1    |  2  |    2  
 6  |  2  |   2    |  3  |    3

The equality holds only for T = 0, i.e. Sunday.

Step 4.  Use the hint.

Because the children were “on their way to school’’ yet it turns out to be Sunday, we understand why they stopped—their reckoning was wrong and there is no school on Sunday.

160,"Question: Biggie Nuff, Baron of Grey Matter, now living in Shapeless, Mass., was dying from a newly developed allergy to water, and wanted his will to reflect the common inheritance law of his father's native country.  Biggie's wife, Faerie, was pregnant at the time with what would be the first child for either of them.  Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.
In due time, Biggie died, and the authorities read his will, holding dispensation of the estate until the child was born.  Five months after Biggie's death, Faerie delivered ... normal, healthy twins, a boy (whom she named Manny) and a girl (whom she named Goodie).
The estate's executor immediately appealed to the Shapeless magistrate to rule on the proper division for the estate.  After a great deal of arguing and deep thought, plus several failed attempts to raise Biggie's spirit with a seance, the judge rendered a fair decision.
How did they divide Biggie's estate?
 Hint: The fraction is in sevenths",The fraction is in sevenths,"The judge reasoned that Biggie intended to give his wife half as much as a son, or twice as much as a daughter.  Therefore, he ruled that Manny gets 4/7 of the estate, Faerie gets 2/7, and Goodie gets 1/7.

 B + G + W = 1.  (1)

What information does Biggie’s will give us?

• If the only child had been a girl, the ratio of the widow’s share to the girl’s share would have been  

 W : G = 2 / 3 : 1 / 3 = 2 : 1.  (3)

Both a boy and a girl were born, so both ratio conditions (2) and (3) must be respected simultaneously.

From (2): B = 2W.  
From (3): W = 2G.

Substitute W = 2G into B = 2W: B = 2(2G) = 4G.

Thus the three shares are in the ratio  

 B : W : G = 4G : 2G : G = 4 : 2 : 1.

That is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 equal parts, so

 B = 4/7, W = 2/7, G = 1/7.

Therefore the judge awarded

 • 4/7 of the estate to the son Manny,

Let B x and R x be the blue and red ribbons for rose x, and T x = B x + R x its total.  
Total ribbons = 28.

1.  Clue-5 (and hint): Yummy Yellow (YY) has no red ribbons and exactly one blue ribbon.  
   ⇒ B YY = 1, R YY = 0, T YY = 1.

2.  Clue-2: Pretty in Pink (PIP) won ¼ of all ribbons.  
   ⇒ T PIP = 28 / 4 = 7.

   The same clue says T PIP equals T Ravishing Red + T Yummy Yellow + T Simply Silver.  
   With T YY = 1 we get
        T RR + T SS = 7 − 1 = 6.

3.  Clue-4: ¾ of Ravishing Red’s ribbons are red, so T RR must be a multiple of 4.  
   The only multiple of 4 that fits T RR + T SS = 6 is T RR = 4 and T SS = 2.

   Therefore  
        R RR = ¾·4 = 3,  B RR = 1.  
   For Simply Silver, clue-6 says blue = red, so  
        B SS = R SS = 1.

4.  Totals so far: T PIP 7, T RR 4, T SS 2, T YY 1 (sum = 14).  
   The remaining two roses (Mrs. Thelma Thorne, Very Violet) together must have 28 − 14 = 14 ribbons.

5.  Clue-3: Very Violet’s total equals Mrs. Thelma Thorne’s total plus Simply Silver’s total.  
   ⇒ T VV = T MTT + 2.

   Together they sum to 14, so  
        T MTT + (T MTT + 2) = 14  ⇒  2 T MTT = 12 ⇒ T MTT = 6, T VV = 8.

6.  Clue-5: One-third of Mrs. Thelma Thorne’s ribbons are blue.  
   ⇒ B MTT = ⅓·6 = 2,  R MTT = 4.

7.  Clue-8: Very Violet’s red ribbons equal Mrs. Thelma Thorne’s red plus Ravishing Red’s red.  
   ⇒ R VV = 4 + 3 = 7.

   Since T VV = 8, we have B VV = 1.

8.  Clue-7: Very Violet’s blue ribbons equal Pretty in Pink’s blue ribbons.  
   ⇒ B PIP = B VV = 1, hence R PIP = 7 − 1 = 6.

9.  All totals are different (clue-1), and every clue is satisfied.

You spend lots of money on selfish things, and are finding yourself very short of money.  The show has refused to let you back on after you meanly insulted the host.
But you are sneakier than that.  Now, your son has applied to be a contestant and has successfully made it on.  He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.
He is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!
You grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.
The combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.  A 'set' refers to a set of two numbers.
""OK, Dad...
1. The sum of the digits in the third set is less than 14 but greater than 10.
2. The third set of numbers is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
3. If you multiply the second set of numbers by 2 and add 7, then you will get the first set of numbers.
4. The sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.
5. There are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination.  Every other number is in the combination.
6. The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).
Hurry, Dad, hurry!""
 Hint: The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.",The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.,"The solution is 49-21-75-88.
First of all, we know that there are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination and that every other digit appears at least once (clue 5).
OK, we'll start on the first set.
We know it's a square number (clue 6).
The only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:
25
49
81
Now, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.
So you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.
81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.
25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.
So that leaves with 49.
49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.
Now we know this much:
49-21-??-??
Now we must work on the last two sets.
Clue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
Here are the possible combinations:

78-91
79-92
81-94
82-95
84-97
85-98
Now, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.
Currently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.
So now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:
58-71
75-88
72-85
Now, we read clue 4.  This tells us the sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.  The sum of the digits in the first set is 13 (4 + 9), and so the only one greater than that is the 75-88 combination (8 + 8 = 16).
So there we have it.
49-21-75-88.
(P.S. Sorry if this offended anybody, not that I think it would, but in my other teaser people were complaining so I'm just putting this in here for warning).",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"We name the four two–digit sets  
A-B-C-D, so the combination is A-B-C-D.

1. A is a square number ≤ 60 and may not contain 0, 3, 6.  
   Possible squares: 16, 25, 36, 49 → after the digit ban only 25 or 49 remain.

2. From clue 3: B·2 + 7 = A.  
   • If A = 25 ⇒ B = 9 (not two-digit) → impossible.  
   • If A = 49 ⇒ B = 21 – acceptable (digits 2,1 both allowed).

   Hence A = 49 and B = 21.

3. Digits used so far: 4,9,2,1.  
   Still needed (clue 5): 5,7,8 (and one digit may be repeated).

4. Clues 1 & 2 about C and D:
   • Sum of digits of C is 11, 12, or 13.  
   • D = C + 13.  
   • Digits 0,3,6 are forbidden.  
   • Sum of digits of D > sum of digits of A (=13).

   Enumerating the allowed C’s and testing C + 13 gives only three viable pairs:
   C = 75 → D = 88  
   C = 84 → D = 97  
   C = 85 → D = 98  

5. Check the digit-set condition for each pair:

   • 49-21-75-88 uses digits {1,2,4,5,7,8,8,9}: every digit 1,2,4,5,7,8,9 appears at least once, and no 0,3,6 appear – valid.

   • 49-21-84-97 lacks the digit 5 – invalid.  
   • 49-21-85-98 lacks the digit 7 – invalid.

Therefore only the first pair satisfies every clue.

The winning combination is:

Each of these three books belongs to exactly one of the students. As I wanted to know the names of the respective owners of the books I asked them about the owners of the books. The following are the answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy.
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
I knew that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Which of the following statements can then be concluded?
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement can be concluded. One or more statements can be concluded.
 Hint: Start with casework on if Anu tells the truth",Start with casework on if Anu tells the truth,"All the three given statements can be concluded.
The given statements are
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
The answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy to my query about the owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books are as follows :-
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Case 1 : Let us assume that Anu always tells the truth.
Then according to Anu's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Maths book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Anu's reply with that of Bob's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy lies three times when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 1, Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie and Coy always lies. Also in this case the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Case 2 : Let us assume that Bob always tells the truth.
Then according to Bob's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Bob's reply with that of Anu's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Anu speaks the truth, lies and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Coy lies, speaks the truth and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 2, Bob always speaks the truth, Anu and Coy alternate between truth and lie and hence this case is not possible since it is given that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Case 3 : Let us assume that Coy always tells the truth. Here we can again make two sub cases.
a) According to Coy's answer,
Maths book belongs to Anu.
Physics book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
b) According to Coy's answer,
Chemistry book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Physics book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is also not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
Hence among the three cases, only Case 1 can be considered to be a valid case wherein Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie, Coy always lies and the Chemistry book belongs to Bob. Hence all the given statements 1, 2 and 3 can be concluded.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

P , C , M    denote respectively the owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books.  
A , B , C    denote the students Anu, Bob and Coy.

For every sentence we translate “belongs to / does not belong to” into an equality / inequality.

Anu  
A1 : P = A  
A2 : M ≠ B  
A3 : C ≠ C  

Bob  
B1 : P ≠ B  
B2 : C = C  
B3 : M ≠ A  

Coy  
C1 : P ≠ A  
C2 : M ≠ C  
C3 : C ≠ B  

The three students possess the three different books, so (P,C,M) is a permutation of (A,B,C).

Exactly one student is a truth-teller (all his statements are true), exactly one is a liar (all his statements are false) and the remaining one is an alternator (at least one true and one false).

Step 1 Assume Anu is the truth-teller (all A-statements true).
 A1 gives P = A.  
 A2 gives M ≠ B.  
 A3 gives C ≠ C   (Chemistry not Coy).  

With P already fixed as A, the only way to have all three books owned by different people is

 P = A , C = B , M = C .

Now evaluate Bob’s and Coy’s sentences for this assignment.

Bob: B1 T, B2 F, B3 T   → mixture → alternator.  
Coy: C1 F, C2 F, C3 F   → all false → liar.

So the requirements are satisfied: a consistent world exists in which  
P = A , C = B , M = C ; Anu is the truth-teller, Coy the liar, Bob the alternator.

Step 2 Show that no other arrangement works.

There are only 6 possible allocations of the three books; we have already examined one.  
Checking the remaining five permutations (either by a short table or direct testing) one sees that in each of them it is impossible to have exactly one student all-true, one all-false and one mixed. Therefore the solution found in Step 1 is the only possible one.

Consequences that hold in every admissible world
• Anu is the unique truth-teller → Anu always tells the truth.  
• Coy is the unique liar    → Coy always lies.  
• Chemistry is owned by Bob  → Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.

Thus every statement (1), (2) and (3) can be concluded.

166,"Question: Grobi is a very unique creature.
Grobi:
1...is round in shape.
2...is six inches in diameter.
3...lives on an acre-sized flat field.
4...moves only by jumping; cannot walk, crawl, fly, or move in any manner other than jumping.
5...can jump, in any one jump, a minimum of 6 inches or a maximum of 72 inches (6 feet) across the field (cannot jump straight up-down).  Grobi can therefore, in any one jump, jump any distance across the field at or between the 6-72 inch limits.
6...can jump directly north, south, east, or west only; cannot jump diagonally.
7...must jump four times in any one direction (N-S-E-W) before changing direction (N-S-E-W) or to continue in the same direction (N-S-E-W).
8...dines on mushrooms which grow in the field.  The mushrooms grow to a maximum of six inches in diameter and to a height of an inch.
9...can ingest a mushroom only by landing directly atop the mushroom.
10...is very adept at precisely determining distances.
One day Grobi - happily jumping around in the middle of the field - locates a six-inch diameter mushroom six inches away (center of Grobi to center of mushroom distance) directly west of Grobi.

From 6, Vincent must have been one of the two since the statement identifies three of the four knights not eliminated. From 2, Vincent was one of the two, and by elimination, the other is Charles.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  
W = “Sir William went”,  
A = “Sir Andrew went”,  
L = “Sir Luke went”,  
C = “Sir Calvin went”,  
Ch = “Sir Charles went”,  
V = “Sir Vincent went”.

Exactly two of these six statements are true.

The six given conditions are

1. (¬W ∧ ¬V) →  C  
2. (C ∨ V)   → ¬A  
3. (¬A ∧ ¬W) →  Ch  
4. (¬L ∧ ¬A) →  V  
5. W         → (C ∨ Ch)  
6. ¬V        → (¬A ∧ ¬Ch)

Step 1.  Show that Vincent must be one of the two.

Assume, for contradiction, ¬V.  
Then by (6) we have ¬A and ¬Ch.

With V out, the possible companions are W, L, C.

• If W is in, (5) says his partner must be C or Ch, but Ch is already out, so the pair must be {W,C}.  
  Now ¬L and ¬A are true, so the antecedent of (4) (¬L ∧ ¬A) is true, which forces V to be true – a contradiction.

• If W is not in, we only have L and C left, so the pair would be {L,C}.  
  Again ¬W and ¬A are true, so (3) forces Ch to be true – impossible because ¬Ch.

Hence ¬V leads to a contradiction; therefore V is in the pair.

Step 2.  Consequences of V being in.

With V true, (2) tells us A is false: ¬A.

Step 3.  Determine whether W is in.

Case 3a.  W is also in the pair.  
Then (5) demands C ∨ Ch.  
But the pair {V,W} contains neither C nor Ch, so this case is impossible.

Case 3b.  W is not in the pair.  
Since we already have ¬A, (3) now has true antecedent (¬A ∧ ¬W), so its consequent Ch must be true.  
Thus Ch is the second knight.

Step 4.  Verify that the pair {V, Ch} satisfies every statement.

1. ¬W ∧ ¬V is false (V is true), so (1) is satisfied vacuously.  
2. V is true, so antecedent true, and ¬A holds; (2) is satisfied.  
3. ¬A ∧ ¬W is true, so consequent Ch must hold; Ch is indeed in the pair.  
4. ¬L ∧ ¬A is true (neither L nor A went), so V must hold; V is in the pair.  
5. W is false; antecedent false, statement satisfied.  
6. ¬V is false; antecedent false, statement satisfied.

All six conditions are met.

Therefore the only possible pair is Sir Vincent and Sir Charles.

The first and third statements are incompatible; they cannot of course both be true, and they can only be lies if on one of the days mentioned Steve tells the truth. But, they have no such day in common. Therefore one of them must be true, and the other must refer to that day. Looking at the second statement (which must be a lie, as there can at most be one true statement and we have one), the first day cannot be Wednesday, Friday or Saturday. Therefore, the first statement cannot be true, since the third cannot refer to it by day. Therefore, the third statement is true, and must (from the first statement) be a Monday or Tuesday. Statement two, however, rules out Monday, leaving only Tuesday as the 'day of truth'. Thus: 'one day' is a Sunday; on the third day (Tuesday) Steve is truthful.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let us label the seven week-days

 L(X) is true  ⇔ X ≠ T.  

Three consecutive days are involved:

 Day 1 : statement S₁ “I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays.”  
 Day 2 : statement S₂ “Today is either Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday.”  
 Day 3 : statement S₃ “I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays.”

Because Steve tells the truth only on T, the statement made on a given day is

 • true if that day is T,  
 • false otherwise.

Step 1 – Work out when each statement would be true.

S₁ is the conjunction L(Monday) ∧ L(Tuesday).  
 S₁ is true  ⇔ T ≠ Monday and T ≠ Tuesday.

S₃ is the conjunction L(Friday) ∧ L(Wednesday).  
 S₃ is true  ⇔ T ≠ Friday and T ≠ Wednesday.

S₂ (made on Day 2) is simply  
 S₂ is true  ⇔ Day 2 ∈ {Thursday, Saturday, Sunday}.

Step 2 – Try the three possible positions of the truthful day among Day 1, Day 2, Day 3.

Case A T = Day 1 (so S₁ would be true, S₂ and S₃ false).
 • S₁ true ⇒ T is neither Monday nor Tuesday.  
 • S₂ false ⇒ Day 2 ∉ {Thu, Sat, Sun}.  
 • S₃ false ⇒ T ∈ {Wednesday, Friday}.  
 The only possibilities for T are Wednesday or Friday, giving the triples  
  (Wed, Thu, Fri) or (Fri, Sat, Sun).  
 In both triples Day 2 is in {Thu, Sat, Sun}, making S₂ true, contradiction.

Case B T = Day 2 (so S₂ would be true, S₁ and S₃ false).
 • S₂ true ⇒ Day 2 ∈ {Thu, Sat, Sun}.  
 • S₁ false ⇒ T ∈ {Monday, Tuesday}.  
 Impossible, because Day 2 cannot be both in {Thu, Sat, Sun} and {Mon, Tue}.

Case C T = Day 3 (so S₃ true, S₁ and S₂ false).
 • S₃ true ⇒ T is neither Wednesday nor Friday.  
 • S₁ false ⇒ T ∈ {Monday, Tuesday}.  
 Thus T is Monday or Tuesday.

 Sub-case C1 T = Monday  
  Then the three days are (Sat, Sun, Mon).  
  Day 2 = Sunday makes S₂ true, but it must be false. Reject.

 Sub-case C2 T = Tuesday  
  Then the three days are (Sun, Mon, Tue).  
  – Day 2 = Monday, which is not in {Thu, Sat, Sun}; hence S₂ is false ✔️  
  – With T = Tuesday, L(Mon) is true, L(Tue) is false, so S₁ = true ∧ false = false ✔️  
  – With T = Tuesday, L(Wed) and L(Fri) are both true, so S₃ = true ∧ true = true ✔️  

All conditions are satisfied only in sub-case C2.

Therefore T = Tuesday.

So Steve tells the truth on Tuesday.

From the clues you must determine:  the color of shorts each runner is wearing, the positions at the end of the cycling leg, and the final standings.
Contestants in the race:  Alvin, Brian, Chuck, David, Ethan, Frank
Colors of their shorts:  red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet
1) Brian moved up two places, now just behind the runner in the red shorts.
2) The runner in the yellow shorts fell down, lost an even number of positions, and was now in last place.
3) Frank moved ahead of the runner who wore the blue shorts.
4) The runner in the orange shorts took over the lead.
5) Ethan and the runner in the green shorts switched places.
6) David moved ahead of Brian, who was not wearing the blue shorts.
7) Chuck stubbed his toe, lost one position, and was now just ahead of Alvin.
8) Ethan and Brian, neither one who wore the violet shorts, switched places.
9) Alvin moved ahead of the runners who wore the green and orange shorts.
10) David dropped behind the runners who wore the blue and violet shorts.
11) The runner in the yellow shorts moved ahead of David.

171,"Question: Mad Ade's Great Uncle Gaseous O' Windpants owned the Madadian Grocery store ""The Beggars Can't Be Choosers"". Madadia was well renowned for its pungent cheeses, especially its ""Kebabrie"" and ""Chillirella"".
On display in the store were six cheese pieces weighing 15, 16, 18, 19 , 20 and 31 Pounds. Five out of the six pieces are ""Kebabrie"" and the remaining one is ""Chillirella"".
Norma Leigh-Sobar purchased two pieces of ""Kebabrie"" and Laura Anne-Hardy also purchased some ""Kebabrie"" , but she purchased twice as much in weight than Norma .
How much does the remaining ""Chillirella"" weigh?
 Hint: Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.",Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.,"Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.
Since Laura bought twice what Norma bought, the total amount of cheese bought by the two together equals 3 times that purchased by Norma alone. Now, the total weight of all the wedges at the grocery divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so the ""Chillirella"" wedge must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. But the only such wedge is the 20 pound wedge, thus the ""Chillirella"" wedge must have weighed 20 pounds.
Thus Norma purchased the 15 and 18 pound pieces which equals 33 pounds and Laura purchased the 16, 19 and 31 pound pieces which equals 66 pounds.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the six wedges have weights  

15 lb, 16 lb, 18 lb, 19 lb, 20 lb and 31 lb.

There are 5 wedges of Kebabrie and 1 wedge of Chillirella.

1.  Norma buys exactly two Kebabrie wedges.  
    Their total weight is X.

2.  Laura buys Kebabrie whose total weight is twice Norma’s, i.e. 2X.

3.  Hence the five Kebabrie wedges together weigh  
         X + 2X = 3X.

4.  The total weight of all six wedges is  
         15 + 16 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 31 = 119 lb.

    Therefore  
         3X = 119 − (weight of the Chillirella wedge).

5.  For X to be an integer, 119 minus the Chillirella weight must be divisible by 3.  
    119 ≡ 2 (mod 3), so the Chillirella wedge must also leave a remainder 2 when divided by 3.  
    Among the six weights only 20 lb satisfies this (20 ≡ 2 mod 3).

    ⇒ Chillirella weighs 20 lb, and the five remaining weights are the Kebabrie wedges.

6.  Now 3X = 119 − 20 = 99, so X = 33.

    Can two of the remaining five weights sum to 33?  
    The pair 15 lb + 18 lb = 33 lb fits perfectly, so Norma bought the 15-lb and 18-lb wedges.

7.  Laura must then take the remaining three Kebabrie wedges: 16 lb + 19 lb + 31 lb = 66 lb = 2X, as required.

All conditions are satisfied, and the only possible weight for the Chillirella wedge is therefore 20 lb.

Man i (i = 1,…,12) says: “At most i – 1 of us are truthtellers.”

1.  If man i is a truthteller, his statement is true, so  
    T ≤ i – 1  (1)

2.  If man i is a liar, his statement is false, so

Thus

• truthtellers are precisely those i with i – 1 ≥ T, i.e. i ≥ T+1;  
• liars are precisely those i with i ≤ T.

How many truthtellers does this classification give?  
Indices i satisfying i ≥ T+1 run from T+1 up to 12, so the count is

  12 – (T+1) + 1 = 12 – T.

But this number must equal T itself (because we assumed there are T truthtellers):

  T = 6.

Hence there are exactly 6 truthtellers, namely those with indices i ≥ 7:

Step 3 (action after the answer)  

• If he answers YES, turn over card 2.  
• If he answers NO, turn over card 3.

His answer is random, but whichever way you go (card 2 after “yes” or card 3 after “no”) you will certainly turn over an ace.

Case B – Card 1 is an ace  
Then exactly one of cards 2 or 3 is the jack.  
Because you are pointing to an ace, the man must tell the truth.  
• If he says “yes”, card 2 really is an ace, so you turn up an ace.  
• If he says “no”, card 2 is the jack, hence card 3 is the ace, and you turn up that ace.

 Hint: From statements 3, 5 and 6 the four couples consist of 3 generations since there is a set of sisters involved and there are grandparents present.","From statements 3, 5 and 6 the four couples consist of 3 generations since there is a set of sisters involved and there are grandparents present.","From statements 3, 5 and 6 the four couples consist of 3 generations since there is a set of sisters involved and there are grandparents present.
From 2 and 3, the Jones are definitely one of the sisters, and from 6, the Williams are definitely on the 3rd generation. Looking at 1 and 4, the Johnson's are on the 2nd generation and since the Smiths have a daughter, they are on the 1st or 2nd generation. But since the Jones must be one of the sisters, the Smiths cannot fall in the 2nd generation with the Johnson's. Therefore the Smiths are the grandparents.
From 6, Mrs. Williams' partner is Mr. Smith.  From 1 and 6, Mrs. Johnston and Mrs. Williams both have male partners, therefore from 5, Mrs. Smith's partner could have only been Mrs. Jones. Which also means that Jones and Johnson are the pair of sisters.
Thus from 2, Mr. Jones is then partnered with Mr. Johnson, and from 3, Mrs Jones (who is partnered with Mrs. Smith) is playing against Mrs. Johnson (whose partner is Mr. Williams from 1).
In summation, Mr. Jones and Mr. Johnson play against Mrs. Williams and Mr Smith, while Mrs Jones and Mrs. Smith play against Mrs. Johnson and Mr. Williams.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Reasoning step–by–step

1.  Let the four married couples be the Johnsons, Joneses, Smiths and Williamses  
    (Mr J and Mrs J etc.).

2.  From (5) Mrs Smith’s partner is her daughter → Mrs Smith must be partnered with
    one of the other three women.

3.  From (6) Mrs Williams’ partner is her grandfather → Mrs Williams must be
    partnered with one of the four men and that man is one generation older than
    Mrs Williams.

4.  From (3) Mrs Jones plays against her sister → one of the remaining women is
    Mrs Jones’s sister and they are at the same table on opposite partnerships.

5.  The only way to have sisters (3), a mother–daughter pair (5) and a
    granddaughter–grandfather pair (6) with only three generations is

            Grandparents :  Mr & Mrs Smith
            Their daughters (sisters) :  Mrs Johnson and Mrs Jones
            Grand-daughter :  Mrs Williams

6.  Therefore  
        • Mrs Smith’s daughter is Mrs Jones → Mrs Smith partners Mrs Jones.  
        • Mrs Williams’ grandfather is Mr Smith → Mrs Williams partners Mr Smith.

7.  From (1) Mrs Johnson’s partner is her son-in-law.  
    Her only married child is Mrs Williams, so the son-in-law is Mr Williams.
    ⇒ Mrs Johnson partners Mr Williams.

8.  From (2) Mr Jones’ partner is his wife’s brother-in-law.  
    Mrs Jones’s sister is Mrs Johnson; her brother-in-law is therefore
    Mr Johnson.  ⇒ Mr Jones partners Mr Johnson.  
    This also satisfies (7): “Mr Johnson’s partner was a man.”

9.  Check (4): Mr Johnson must play against his father-in-law.  
    Mr Johnson’s father-in-law is Mr Smith, and the partnerships found in 6–8
    put Mr Johnson and Mr Smith at opposite sides of the second table – satisfied.

10.  Place the partnerships at two tables:

    TABLE 1  
        • Partners:  Mrs Johnson  –  Mr Williams  
        • Partners:  Mrs Smith    –  Mrs Jones

The only thing we are actually given to look at is the shapes of the capital letters themselves.

182,"Question: You've been placed on a course of expensive medication in which you are to take one tablet of Sildenafil and one tablet of Citrate daily. You must be careful that you take just one of each because taking more of either can have serious side effects.
Taking Sildenafil without taking Citrate, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the Sildenafil pills and one of the Citrate pills at one time. Therefore, you open up the Sildenafil bottle, and you tap one Sildenafil pill into your hand. You put that bottle aside and you open the Citrate bottle. You do the same, but by mistake, two Citrates fall into your hand with the Sildenafil pill.
Now, here's the problem. You weren't watching your hand as the pills fell into it, so you can't tell the Sildenafil pill apart from the two Citrate pills. The pills look identical. They are both the same size, same weight (10 micrograms), same color (Blue), same shape (perfect square), same everything, and they are not marked differently in any way.
What are you going to do? You cannot tell which pill is which, and they cost $300 a piece, so you cannot afford to throw them away and start over again. How do you get your daily dose of exactly one Sildenafil and exactly one Citrate without wasting any of the pills?
 Hint: You can cut pills in half",You can cut pills in half,"Carefully cut each of the three pills in half, and carefully separate them into two piles, with half of each pill in each pile. You do not know which pill is which, but you are 100% sure that each of the two piles now contains two halves of Citrate and half of Sildenafil. Now go back into the Sildenafil bottle, take out a pill, cut it in half, and add one half to each stack. Now you have two stacks, each one containing two halves of Sildenafil and two halves of Citrate. Take one stack of pills today, and save the second stack for tomorrow.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1. You have three indistinguishable tablets in your hand:  
   • 1 Sildenafil  
   • 2 Citrates  

2. Cut every tablet exactly in half.  
   You now have six half-tablets.

3. Make two piles (or use two small cups).  
   • Put one half from each original tablet into Cup A.  
   • Put the other half from each original tablet into Cup B.  

   Composition of each cup so far:  
   – ½ Sildenafil  
   – ½ Citrate + ½ Citrate = 1 whole Citrate  
   So each cup now holds 1 Citrate but only ½ Sildenafil.

4. Take a fresh Sildenafil tablet from the bottle, cut it in half, and drop  
   • one half into Cup A,  
   • the other half into Cup B.

   Now each cup contains:  
   – (½ Sildenafil + ½ Sildenafil) = 1 whole Sildenafil  
   – 1 whole Citrate  

5. Swallow everything in Cup A today: that is exactly one Sildenafil and one Citrate.  

6. Seal Cup B and keep it for tomorrow; it already contains tomorrow’s exact dose (the other halves you just created).

Result  
You take the correct dose today, you waste nothing, and all four tablets (the three that fell plus the extra Sildenafil) are ultimately used.

Final answer: Cut all three mixed pills in half, split the halves into two equal piles, add half of a new Sildenafil tablet to each pile, take one pile today and save the other for tomorrow; each pile then contains exactly one full Sildenafil and one full Citrate, so no pill is wasted and the correct dose is taken.",True,1,0,0

184,"Question: Al, Ben, Carl, and Dan live in four adjacent apartments. The apartments are set up like this:
|1|2|3|4|
with apartment 1 being the westernmost apartment and apartment 4 being the easternmost. One of the four is the landlord. Here are some facts:
1. If Carl does not live next to Ben, then Al is the landlord and he lives in apartment 1.
2. If Al lives east of Carl, then Dan is the landlord and he lives in apartment 4.
3. If Ben does not live next to Dan, then Carl is the landlord and he lives in apartment 3.
4. If Dan lives east of Al, then Ben is the landlord and he lives in apartment 2.
Who is the landlord?
 Hint: All four facts are in the form of ""hypothesis and conclusion"" statements. If the hypothesis of such a statement is false, the whole statement is true. If the conclusion is true, the whole statement is true. However, if the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false, the statement is false.

Obviously only one conclusion is true at most. Let us suppose that all conclusions are false. This would mean that each hypothesis is also false. From facts 1 and 3, Ben lives next to both Carl and Dan, and therefore between Carl and Dan. Then either Al lives east of both Carl and Dan (contradicting fact 4) or Carl and Dan both live east of Al (contradicting fact 2.) So there must be exactly one true hypothesis, which will be paired with the one true conclusion. Obviously each of the three false conclusions is paired with a false hypothesis.
If conclusion 1 is true, then Al lives in apartment 1. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al has to live east of Dan. So this cannot be right.
If conclusion 2 is true, then Dan lives in apartment 4. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al must live east of Dan. So this cannot be right, either.
If conclusion 4 is true, Ben lives in apartment 2. Then, since hypotheses 1 and 3 are false, Ben lives between Carl and Dan, putting Al in apartment 4. But since hypothesis 2 is false, Carl must live east of Al. Therefore, conclusion 3 is true.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let

! stands for W, T, S, E, or I
# stands for F, O, A, T, or L
The five letter code word, %$#@!, can be translated into two English words that are opposites. What are the two words?
 Hint: Prepositions",Prepositions,Above and Below,GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 1.  Write down the five symbol–to–letter sets that the problem gives.  
(1) % → {T, F, B, L, A}  
(2) $ → {B, N, R, E, J}  
(3) # → {F, O, A, T, L}  
(4) @ → {M, O, F, L, V}  
(5) ! → {W, T, S, E, I}

The coded word % $ # @ ! therefore has the pattern

• first letter ∈ {T,F,B,L,A}  
• second letter ∈ {B,N,R,E,J}  
• third letter ∈ {F,O,A,T,L}  
• fourth letter ∈ {M,O,F,L,V}  
• fifth letter ∈ {W,T,S,E,I}

Step 2.  Use the hint “Prepositions” and look for pairs of five–letter prepositions that are antonyms (opposites).  The natural candidates are ABOVE and BELOW (e.g. “The picture is above the sofa / below the sofa”).

Step 3.  Check that ABOVE fits the symbol constraints.

A  (in {T,F,B,L,A}) ✔  
B  (in {B,N,R,E,J}) ✔  
O  (in {F,O,A,T,L}) ✔  
V  (in {M,O,F,L,V}) ✔  
E  (in {W,T,S,E,I}) ✔  

So ABOVE is valid.

L  (in {F,O,A,T,L}) ✔  
O  (in {M,O,F,L,V}) ✔  
W  (in {W,T,S,E,I}) ✔  

So BELOW is also valid.

186,"Question: Two friends, Joe and Smoe, were born in May, one in 1932, the other a year later. Each had an antique grandfather clock of which he was extremely proud. Both of the clocks worked fairly well considering their age, but one clock gained ten seconds per hour while the other one lost ten seconds per hour. On a day in January, the two friends set both clocks correctly at 12:00 noon. ""Do you realize,"" asked Joe, ""that the next time both of our clocks will show exactly the same time will be on your 47th birthday?"" Smoe agreed. Who is older, Joe or Smoe?
 Hint: To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again","To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again","To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again. This is when the slow clock loses six hours, and the fast one gains six hours. This will take 90 days. In 90 days they will come together at 6:00. On a calendar, there are 90 days between noon January 31, and noon May 1 in years with no leap year. If Smoe had been born in 1933, his 47th birthday would have been in 1980, a leap year. This means that Smoe must be older, born in 1932, and the time of this problem is 1979.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 1.  How fast do the two dials separate?  
• One clock gains 10 s every hour; the other loses 10 s every hour.  
• Therefore the reading of the fast clock pulls away from the slow one at the rate  
  10 s + 10 s = 20 seconds per hour.

Step 2.  How far apart do the dials have to get before they “look the same’’ again?  
On a 12-hour face two readings look identical whenever they differ by an integral number of
12 hours.  Starting together, the first time this happens is when they differ by exactly 12 h.

12 hours = 12 × 3600 s = 43 200 s.

Step 3.  How long (real time) does it take to build up a 43 200 s difference at 20 s / h?

time = 43 200 s ÷ 20 s h⁻¹ = 2160 h  
2160 h ÷ 24 h day⁻¹ = 90 days.

So the two dials will next coincide 90 days after they were set.

Step 4.  Fit those 90 days between “a day in January’’ and “your 47th birthday in May’’.

Let the day in January be J and the birthday be B.  We need B–J = 90 days.

The only way to get 90 days from January into May in an ordinary (non-leap) year is  
31 January → 1 May  (31 Jan → 28 Feb = 28 d, +31 Mar = 59 d, +30 Apr = 89 d, +1 May = 90 d).

If the year were a leap year (e.g. 1980) the extra 29th of February would make
31 Jan + 90 days land on 30 April, not in May, so the year cannot be a leap year.

Hence the clocks are set on 31 January of a non-leap year and the birthday in question
is 1 May of that same non-leap year.

Step 5.  Whose 47th birthday occurs on 1 May of a non-leap year?

• Someone born in May 1932 turns 47 on 1 May 1979 (1979 is not a leap year).  
• Someone born in May 1933 turns 47 on 1 May 1980 (1980 is a leap year—ruled out).

Therefore the person whose 47th birthday fits the 90-day interval is the one born in 1932.

Conclusion: Smoe is the one whose 47th birthday is being discussed; hence Smoe was born in May 1932 and is the elder.  Joe, born a year later in May 1933, is younger.

Final answer: Smoe is older than Joe.",True,1,0,0

Translate every clue into equations or exclusions and work step-by-step.

1. Let the five quantities be a, b, c, d, e (all >2, all different, total 30).  
   Jane made 5 toys, so one of the numbers is 5.

2. From
   • “Cher made one more than the elf in red.”  
   • “Cher made one less than the elf who made sleds,”  
   we get three consecutive numbers  
        red = n, Cher = n+1, sleds = n+2.  (1)

3. “The elf in green made one-third as many as Sue,” so  
        green = g, Sue = 3g.  (2)

4. Altogether the five different numbers must be  
        n, n+1, n+2, g, 3g                                 (3)  
   and they add to 30:
        n + (n+1) + (n+2) + g + 3g = 30
        3n + 4g = 27.                                       (4)

   Try n = 3,…,8 (because every number >2 and 3n<27).  
   Only n = 5 gives an integer g:
        3·5 + 4g = 27  ⇒  4g = 12  ⇒  g = 3.
   Hence the five quantities are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9.

   So
        red = 5, Cher = 6, sleds = 7, green = 3, Sue = 9. (5)

5. Jane made 5 toys, therefore Jane is the elf in red (5).  
   Johnny made racing cars; Johnny must be the one who made 3 toys (the only number left that is neither 5, 6, 7, nor 9).  
   Because 3 toys = green, Johnny wears green.

6. The highest number (9) belongs to Sue, and the clue says “The elf who made the spinning tops made the most toys,” so Sue made the spinning tops.

7. Balls are made by “another elf,” and trains are made by “the elf in yellow.”  
   So far we have used cars (Johnny), tops (Sue), sleds (number 7) and still need trains and balls.  
   Jane (red, 5) cannot make trains (trains need yellow), cannot make sleds (7) and already has a number, so Jane must make the balls.

8. The suit colors already fixed:  
        green – Johnny,  
        red – Jane,  
        orange – Marcia (given),  
   so the two remaining colors are yellow and blue.  
   The elf in yellow must build the trains; the only elf still without a toy is Cher.  
   Hence Cher wears yellow and makes trains.  
   The last unused color, blue, goes to Sue.

9. The only elf without a number yet is Marcia, and the only unused number is 7, so Marcia (orange) made 7 sleds.

Everything now fits every clue:

Johnny – green suit – 3 racing cars (one-third Sue)  
Jane   – red suit   – 5 balls  
Cher   – yellow suit– 6 trains (one more than red, one less than sleds)  
Marcia – orange suit– 7 sleds  
Sue    – blue suit  – 9 spinning tops (the most)

1. When adding the first number of the third set with the second number of the second set, you will get a number below 8.
2. The only digits not used in the code are 5 and 7.
3. When adding the two digits of the first set together, you will not get 10.
4. If you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed.
5. No set has a number above 90.
6. The product of both the digits in the first set is below 30 but above 20.
7. One of the number sets is 66.
8. There is only one 8 in the combination, and it is in the last set.
Now, get cracking!

 Hint: ??-??-66-??",??-??-66-??,"The set is 39-21-66-48.
First of all, the second clue tells you there are no 5's or 7's in the combination.
Now we go to the fourth clue. It tells you that if you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed. There are only a few numbers that will satisfy this:
11, 12, 16, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
Now we skip down to clue 8, which tells us there is one 8 only, and it is in the last set. It could either be the first digit or the second digit.
However, this eliminates these numbers from being in the second set: 11, 16, 23 and 24. Now, only 12, 21 and 22 are the possibilities for being in the second set.
Now, let's look at clue 7. This tells us that 66 is one of the four number sets. We know it can't be in the second, or fourth, and since clue six tells us the product of the two numbers in the first set ranges from 21-29, 66 must go in the third set.
??-??-66-??
Now we must look at the first clue. The first number of the third set (6) plus the second number of the second set will get a number below 8. This means it cannot be 12 or 22, because they would both total 8. This means that the second set of numbers is 21. Making good progress!
??-21-66-??
Now, we come back to clue 4 which tells us the second set multiplied by 4 equals the fourth set reversed. 21 multiplied by 4 is 84, which when reversed is 48!
??-21-66-48
Now, we come back to clue 6, which tells us the product of the digits in the first set is above 20 but below 30. These are the only numbers that satisfy that condition - and remember, no 5's, 7's or 8's are left in the combination:
39 (3 * 9 = 27)
46 (4 * 6 = 24)
64 (6 * 4 = 24)
93 (9 * 3 = 27)
Now, we look at clue 5. This eliminates 93. Now, come to clue 3. This tells us the sum of the two digits in the first set does not equal 10. This eliminates 46 and 64. The only number left is.... 39!
Now you have your answer;

Digits 0,5,7 are forbidden, and the single 8 must be in the last set.

Step-by-step

1. Fill in what is given  
   ?? - ?? - 66 - ??.

2. Use clue 1  
   First digit of 3rd set (6) + second digit of 2nd set < 8 → 6 + (second digit) < 8 → second digit = 1.  
   Second set = A1.

3. Use clue 4  
   4 × (second set) = (fourth set) reversed.  
   Try the possibilities for A (remember 0,5,7,8 not allowed and no number above 90):

      A1   4×(A1)     two–digit?   reverse gives 4th set
      11   44          yes          44  (contains no 8 → reject, only 8 must be in last set)
      21   84          yes          48  (contains the single 8 → keep)
      31   124         3-digit → reject
      41   164         reject
      61   244         reject
      91   364         reject

   Therefore second set = 21 and fourth set = 48.

4. Current layout  
   ?? - 21 - 66 - 48

5. Use clues 3 & 6 for the first set XY  
   • X+Y ≠ 10  
   • 20 < X·Y < 30  
   • digits cannot be 0,5,7,8  
   Possible ordered pairs:

        (3,9)  product 27, sum12  → OK, number 39 (≤90)  
        (9,3)  product 27, sum12  → 93 (>90) reject  
        (4,6)/(6,4) product 24, sum10 → sum forbidden

   Thus first set = 39.

6. Verify remaining clues  
   • Only digits not used are 5 and 7 – true (digits used: 1,2,3,4,6,8,9)  
   • One 8 and it is in last set – true (48)  
   • No set exceeds 90 – 39,21,66,48 all ≤90  
   • Given 66 is present – true (3rd set)

All clues are satisfied.

190,"Question: A warden at a prison decides to give some prisoners a chance to escape by working together to solve a puzzle. He prepares a colored hat for every one of them and tells them the rules. The hats can be either black or white and will be placed on everyone's head.  The prisoners will get a chance to discuss a strategy together, which they will all follow, then they will be marched out into a large room where they will see everybody else's hat color. Each prisoner will then simultaneously guess which of the two hat colors they have. If every one of them is right, or every one of them is wrong, they will all go free. However, the prisoners will not be allowed to communicate in any way during this process. Also, the warden will hear their strategy and place hats any way he can to prevent them from going free. What strategy do they use to escape?
 Hint: Think about it for two people and then three people. What will be the difference between what a white hatted person sees and a black hatted person sees?",Think about it for two people and then three people. What will be the difference between what a white hatted person sees and a black hatted person sees?,"Every prisoner should count up how many black hats they see. If they count an odd number of black hats, they say that they have a black hat. If they count an even number of black hats, then they say that they have a white hat.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let us call a white hat 1 and a black hat 0.  
Before they are taken into the room the prisoners agree on one very simple
rule:

Target-parity rule  
“We are going to make the total number of white hats in the room come out
EVEN.  
After you have looked at everybody else, say the colour that would make the
overall number of whites even.”

How each prisoner acts  
• Count the number of white hats you can see.  
• If that number is even, guess ‘black’.  
• If that number is odd, guess ‘white’.  
(Any fixed parity could be chosen; “even” is just convenient.)

Why it works

Take the real hat configuration H = (h₁,…,hₙ), hᵢ ∈ {0,1}.  
Let W be the actual total number of white hats, i.e. W = h₁+⋯+hₙ.

Case 1 : W is even.  
For a prisoner i whose own hat is white (hᵢ=1) the other hats contain
W−1 whites – an odd number – so he says “white”, i.e. hᵢ itself.  
For a prisoner whose hat is black (hᵢ=0) the others contain W whites – an
even number – so he says “black”, again his true colour.  
Thus every prisoner states his actual hat colour: all answers are correct.

Case 2 : W is odd.  
If hᵢ=1 the others show W−1 whites – even – so he says “black”, the
opposite of his real colour.  
If hᵢ=0 the others show W whites – odd – so he says “white”, also the
opposite of his real colour.  
Hence every prisoner gives the wrong colour: all answers are wrong.

Therefore, regardless of how the warden distributes the hats, the prisoners
always end up with either all correct or all wrong answers, and they are
released.

(With two prisoners the same rule already works: each sees 0 or 1 whites,
decides as above, and again they are both right or both wrong; with three
prisoners the reasoning is identical.)",True,1,0,0
191,"Question: Madadian Multi-Squillionaire Sheik Ratelunroll has bought four prestige cars from the Madadian Motor Company (MMC) - The Silver Dream, The Golden Pleasure, The Devine Lightning, and a The Rusting Bucket, - as presents for his sons' birthdays, all of which are next week (strange things like this happen in Madadia all the time). Given the following information, what will each son get?
1, Derek will not get The Golden Pleasure unless Berrick gets The Silver Dream and Eric gets The Rusting Bucket.
2, Berrick will not get The Rusting Bucket unless Merick gets The Devine Lightning and Derek gets The Silver Dream.
3, Eric will not get The Devine Lightning unless Derek gets The Golden Pleasure and Berrick gets The Silver Dream.

Eric = The Golden Pleasure
Merick = The Silver Dream

means

 If X gets Y, then the stated condition must also be true.

Rewrite the nine requirements:

1. Derek G  ⇒  (Berrick S & Eric R)  
2. Berrick R ⇒  (Merick D & Derek S)  
3. Eric D   ⇒  (Derek G & Berrick S)

9. Merick S ⇒  (Eric G)

Because every car goes to exactly one son, each car–son pairing is unique.

----------------------------------------------------
Step 1 (use the hint – rule 9)

Assume Eric gets the Golden Pleasure (Eric G).  
Then rule 9 forces Merick S (Merick gets the Silver Dream).

----------------------------------------------------
Step 2 (deduce Derek’s car)

Silver is already taken by Merick, Golden by Eric, so Derek can receive only D or R.

• Suppose Derek D.  
  Rule 6 would then require Berrick G, but Golden is already Eric’s.  
  Impossible.  So Derek cannot get D.

Therefore Derek must get the Rusting Bucket: Derek R.

----------------------------------------------------
Step 3 (deduce Berrick’s car)

The only unassigned car is the Devine Lightning, so Berrick D.

----------------------------------------------------
Step 4 (check every rule)

1. Derek G is false – no requirement.  
2. Berrick R is false – no requirement.  
3. Eric D is false – no requirement.  
4. Derek S is false – no requirement.  
5. Berrick S is false – no requirement.  
6. Derek D is false – no requirement.  
7. Merick D is false – no requirement.  
8. Derek R is true; it requires Berrick D and Eric G – both satisfied.  
9. Merick S is true; it requires Eric G – satisfied.

All nine conditions are met, so the assignment is consistent.

----------------------------------------------------
Step 5 (show it is unique)

Check the other three possibilities for who might get G:

(a) Derek G ⇒ Berrick S & Eric R (rule 1) ⇒ Merick D.  
    But Merick D ⇒ Berrick G (rule 7) – clashes with Derek G. Impossible.

(b) Berrick G.  
    Trying all ways to distribute S, D, R to the others always violates some rule  
    (details omitted here for brevity), so impossible.

(c) Merick G likewise leads quickly to contradictions.

Hence the solution found in Steps 1-4 is the only possible one.

192,"Question: Thirty fans hire a bus to attend a football game. On the way to the stadium, they realize that exactly half of them are fans of one team and the other half are fans of the other team. With still some way to go before reaching the stadium, the bus develops mechanical problems and the driver announces to his passengers that the only way to continue the journey is for half of them to get out and walk. There is a huge fight that doesn't stop until the driver speaks to them again and suggests a way of selecting the passengers who are to get off the bus.
""All of you,"" he said, ""get into a big circle. When you are ready, beginning at this spot, I'll count nine people clockwise. The ninth person leaves the circle and continues on foot. Then I'll count another nine starting from where I stopped, and the ninth person leaves the circle and continues on foot. And so on until fifteen people have left the circle.""
Suppose that you are one of the fans. How should you arrange all the other fans of your team so that none of them will have to leave?
 Hint: Just keep counting in circles and see where you each spot lands",Just keep counting in circles and see where you each spot lands,"If the two teams are A and B and you are a supporter of team A and don't want any of your fellow supporters to end up walking to the stadium, organize them in a circle starting at the point where the driver starts and reading clockwise as follows: A, A, A, A, B, B, B, B, B, A, A, B, A, A, A, B, A, B, B, A, A, B, B, B, A, B, B, A, A, B.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Number the places in the circle 1,2,3,…,30 clockwise, and let the driver begin his count with the person standing in place 1 (that place will be yours).

If we follow this rule and keep track of the places that are removed we get the ordinary Josephus-elimination with step 9 on 30 people.  
Carrying the count through until exactly fifteen people have been sent away gives the following list of places that leave:

 9, 18, 27, 6, 16, 26, 7, 19, 30, 12, 24, 8, 22, 5, 23.

 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 25, 28, 29.

Therefore you can guarantee that no supporter of your own team has to get off simply by putting every member of the other team in the fifteen “leaving’’ places and every member of your team (including yourself) in the fifteen “staying’’ places.

193,"Question: It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.
You quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...
 Hint: If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change. ","If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.

No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.
What else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!  So doing this, the Great Pumpkin has decided to give you a treat for figuring this out and you find all seven lanterns full of candy the next morning!  Congratulations!",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 1 – translate the puzzle into “mod-2 language”  
Write Lk = 0 if lantern k is out, Lk = 1 if it is lit (k = 1,…,7, subscripts taken mod 7 so that 0≡7 and 8≡1).  
Blowing on lantern k toggles Lk-1 , Lk , Lk+1 .  
“Toggle” = “add 1 (mod 2)”.  

Step 2 – introduce the unknowns  
Let xk ∈ {0,1} be the number of times (mod 2) we will blow on lantern k.  
Because order is irrelevant (the moves commute), only the parity of each xk matters.  

Step 3 – write the seven equations  
Initially every lantern is lit, i.e. every Lk starts as 1.  
We want every final Lk to be 0.  
Therefore for every k  

1 + xk-1 + xk + xk+1 = 0   (mod 2).                       (E k)

Re-write them

(E1)  x7 + x1 + x2 = 1  
(E2)  x1 + x2 + x3 = 1  
(E3)  x2 + x3 + x4 = 1  
(E4)  x3 + x4 + x5 = 1  
(E5)  x4 + x5 + x6 = 1  
(E6)  x5 + x6 + x7 = 1  
(E7)  x6 + x7 + x1 = 1  

Step 4 – solve the system

Subtract (E2) from (E1):        x7 + x3 = 0  →  x7 = x3.          (1)  
Subtract (E4) from (E3):        x2 + x5 = 0  →  x2 = x5.          (2)  
Subtract (E6) from (E5):        x4 + x7 = 0  →  x4 = x7 = x3.     (3)

Equation (E3) now becomes  
  x2 + x3 + x4 = 1 → x2 + x3 + x3 = 1 → x2 = 1.                 (4)

Hence, from (2)  x5 = 1.                                          (5)

Equation (E2):  x1 + x2 + x3 = 1 → x1 + 1 + x3 = 1 → x1 = x3.    (6)

Equation (E5):  x4 + x5 + x6 = 1 → x3 + 1 + x6 = 1 → x6 = x3.    (7)

Finally insert x1,x6,x7 all equal to x3 into (E7):  
  x6 + x7 + x1 = 1 → x3 + x3 + x3 = 1 → (3)x3 = x3 = 1.          (8)

Thus

x1 = x2 = x3 = x4 = x5 = x6 = x7 = 1.

Step 5 – interpret the solution  
“1” means “blow on that lantern an odd number of times”; since two blows cancel, blow each lantern exactly once.

Step 6 – conclusion  
Blow on every one of the seven jack-o’-lanterns (in any order―order does not matter).  
Each lantern will be toggled three times (by your own blow and by the blows on its two neighbours), i.e. an odd number of times, so every one of the seven ends up extinguished.

Final answer: Blow out every lantern exactly once (in any order); all seven will be left dark.",True,1,0,1

B = blue, K = black, G = green, R = red, Y = yellow.  
Represent each day by the unordered pair of colours Peter wears.

1.  Start with what is fixed.
   • Monday: {B,K} (rule 4)

2.  Rule 2 forbids using any colour again on the next day.

3.  Rule 3 says one colour is worn on 4 different days.
    • Black cannot be that colour, because rule 7 forbids the pair {R,K}.
      If K were used 4 times we would need 4 distinct pairs with K, but
      only 3 are allowed ({B,K},{Y,K},{G,K}).  
    • Green cannot be that colour, because G must be used on Thursday;
      the only non-consecutive days it could also appear are Tue, Sat,
      Sun, and Sat & Sun are consecutive – only 3 usable days.  
    • The same “at most 3 possible days” argument eliminates R and Y.  
    • Therefore blue is the colour used on 4 days.

   Since no colour may be used on consecutive days, the only pattern
   for B on 4 days is Mon–Wed–Fri–Sun.

4.  Build the week from Monday onward.

   Tuesday (cannot contain B or K): {R,G} or {Y,G}.  
   If Tuesday were {Y,G}, then Wednesday (which contains B) could not use Y,  
   so Wednesday would be {B,R}.  
   That forces Thursday to contain G, not B or R ⇒ {G,K} or {G,Y}.
   Friday must contain B but not Y (rule 6) and not G/K from Thursday.
   That is impossible.  
   Hence Tuesday = {R,G}.

   Wednesday: must contain B and not repeat Tuesday’s colours Y,G,
   so Wednesday = {B,Y}.

   Thursday: must contain G, and not B or Y ⇒ {G,K} or {G,R}.
   • {G,R} would make Friday’s only possible pair {B,K},
     but {B,K} is a repeat of Monday.  Impossible.
   • Therefore Thursday = {G,K}.

   Friday: must contain B, must not contain Y (rule 6), nor G or K

5.  Determine Saturday and Sunday.

   Friday used B and R, so Saturday cannot use B or R.  
   Blue must re-appear on Sunday (fourth day), so Saturday cannot use G
   either (it would clash with Sunday).  
   Only Y and K remain: Saturday = {Y,K}.

   Sunday must give the fourth distinct blue pair.  
   The pairs with B used so far are {B,K}, {B,Y}, {B,R};
   the remaining possible partner is G.  
   Also Sunday cannot repeat Saturday’s colours, so Sunday = {B,G}.

6.  Check all rules.
   Mon {B,K}, Tue {R,G}, Wed {B,Y}, Thu {G,K}, Fri {B,R},
   Sat {Y,K}, Sun {B,G}

   • all seven pairs are distinct (rule 1)  
   • no colour is used on consecutive days (rule 2)  
   • blue appears on four days (rule 3)  
   • given conditions 4–7 are satisfied.

Everything is consistent.

195,"Question: At the Christmas party of the ""Sweaty Chef"" kebab shop, the owner Mr Juan, took note of how many people were present. Although he was a bit tipsy when he made his note, and thus made a mistake.  His notes were as follows:-
1, There were 9 men and children.
2, There were 2 more women than children.
3, The number of different man-woman couples possible was 24. Note that if there were 7 men and 5 women, then there would have been 35 man-woman couples possible.
Also, of the three groups - men, women and children - at the party:
4, There were 4 of one group.
5, There were 6 of one group.
6, There were 8 of one group.
Exactly one of the above 6 statements is false.
Can you tell which one is false? Also, how many men, women and children are there at the party?
 Hint: Can 4,5,6 all be true at the same time?","Can 4,5,6 all be true at the same time?","Statement (4) is false. There are 3 men, 8 women and 6 children.
Assume that Statements (4), (5) and (6) are all true. Then, Statement (1) is false. But then Statement (2) and (3) both can not be true. Thus, contradictory to the fact that exactly one statement is false.
So Statement (4) or Statement (5) or Statement (6) is false. Also, Statements (1), (2) and (3) all are true.
From (1) and (2), there are 11 men and women. Then from (3), there are 2 possible cases - either there are 8 men and 3 women or there are 3 men and 8 women.
If there are 8 men and 3 women, then there is 1 child. Then Statements (4) and (5) both are false, which is not possible.
Hence, there are 3 men, 8 women and 6 children. Statement (4) is false.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

m = number of men  
w = number of women  
c = number of children  

Write the six statements as mathematical conditions:

1.  m + c = 9                                                  
2.  w = c + 2                                                  
3.  m × w = 24                                                
4.  at least one of m, w, c equals 4                          
5.  at least one of m, w, c equals 6                          
6.  at least one of m, w, c equals 8                          

Exactly one of the six statements is wrong.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 –  Assume the first three statements are true           
----------------------------------------------------------------
If 1, 2 and 3 are all true we can solve for the three numbers.

From (1) m = 9 – c  
From (2) w = c + 2  

Put these in (3):

(9 – c)(c + 2) = 24  
−c² + 7c + 18 = 24  
c² – 7c + 6 = 0  
(c – 6)(c – 1) = 0 ⇒ c = 6 or c = 1.

•  If c = 6  ⇒  w = 8,  m = 3.  
•  If c = 1  ⇒  w = 3,  m = 8.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 –  Check how many of 4, 5, 6 are satisfied              
----------------------------------------------------------------
Case (m,w,c) = (3,8,6):  
numbers present = {3, 6, 8}.  
– “4 of one group” is false,  
– “6 of one group” is true,  
– “8 of one group” is true.  
Exactly one statement (No. 4) is false.  This fits the “only one is false” condition.

Case (m,w,c) = (8,3,1):  
numbers present = {8, 3, 1}.  
Both statements 4 and 5 are false (there is no group of 4 or 6), giving two false statements, which is not allowed.

So the only viable counts are (m,w,c) = (3, 8, 6) and the only false statement among the six is No. 4.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 –  Verify that no other single–false possibility exists  
----------------------------------------------------------------
•  Suppose statement 1 were the single false one.  
   Then statements 4,5,6 would all have to be true, forcing the set {m,w,c} to be {4,6,8}.  
   No arrangement of 4,6,8 satisfies both m + c = 9 and m × w = 24 simultaneously, so this is impossible.

•  The same kind of check shows that taking statement 2 or statement 3 as the unique false statement also gives contradictions.

Therefore the only consistent scenario is the one already found.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion

196,"Question: Write on a piece of paper a 5x5 letter square using the alphabet, minus the letter Q, where A is in the upper left-hand corner and Z is in the lower right-hand corner.  After you have done this, can you tell me which letter comes just above the letter which comes between the letter just before the letter just below B and the letter just before the letter just above Y?
 Hint: One step at a time",One step at a time,"The letter is G.
The two letters to initially find are F & S. The letter above the one which is between them is G.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 1 – Build the 5 × 5 square (write the alphabet in order, omitting Q)  

Row 1 A  B  C  D  E

Row 3 K  L  M  N  O  
Row 4 P  R  S  T  U  
Row 5 V  W  X  Y  Z  

(The square begins with A at the upper-left corner and ends with Z at the lower-right corner.)

Step 2 – Decode the wording one clause at a time  

• “The letter just below B”  
  B is in row 1, column 2.  The letter directly beneath it (row 2, column 2) is G.  

• “The letter just before the letter just below B”  
  Alphabetically (with Q missing) the letter before G is F.  

So the first key letter is F.

• “The letter just above Y”  
  Y is in row 5, column 4.  The letter directly above it (row 4, column 4) is T.  

• “The letter just before the letter just above Y”  
  The letter before T is S.  

So the second key letter is S.

Step 3 – “The letter which comes between” F and S  

Whether you look alphabetically or geometrically in the square, the central letter between F (row 2, col 1) and S (row 4, col 3) is L, which sits at row 3, col 2.

Step 4 – “The letter that comes just above” that L  

L is at row 3, column 2; the letter directly above it (row 2, column 2) is G.

One possible arrangement:
W B G R

Y W B G",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"One convenient way to tackle the problem is to place the 4 blue squares first so that they never share a row, column, or (45°) diagonal – exactly the same requirement that four non-attacking queens must satisfy on a 4 × 4 chessboard.  
A standard 4-queens solution is  

 Row 1 Col 2, Row 2 Col 4, Row 3 Col 1, Row 4 Col 3.

Put a B in those four cells:

 Row 1:  _  B  _  _  
 Row 2:  _  _  _  B  
 Row 3:  B  _  _  _  
 Row 4:  _  _  B  _  

Now only the 12 blank cells remain, each to be filled with exactly three R’s, three W’s, three G’s and three Y’s, still observing the “no two alike in any row, column or diagonal” rule.

Work systematically (treating each colour as a “digit” in a Sudoku-like puzzle).  
One possible chain of deductions is:

• The main diagonal must contain four different colours, so set  
 Row 1 Col 1 = R, Row 2 Col 2 = W, Row 3 Col 3 = G, Row 4 Col 4 = Y.

• Column and diagonal restrictions then force  
 Row 1 Col 3 = Y, Row 1 Col 4 = G, Row 2 Col 3 = R, Row 3 Col 4 = W.

• Continuing in the same way gives  
 Row 3 Col 2 = Y, Row 4 Col 2 = R, Row 2 Col 1 = G, Row 4 Col 1 = W.

This fills every square and one quickly checks that every row, column, and every diagonal (of any length in either 45° direction) contains each colour at most once.

The completed 4 × 4 board is therefore

 Row 1 : R  B  Y  G  
 Row 2 : G  W  R  B  
 Row 3 : B  Y  G  W

1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
We started off with 5 cards each and I served in the first round.
At the end of three rounds if I had exactly 4 cards then which of the following statements must be true:-
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.

200,"Question: Phil Fegit was sitting in his bedroom watching the torrential rain pour down on his home town of MADADIA.  The water had caused floods throughout the town and water over six feet deep had forced people to abandon the downstairs of their homes and they had to retreat to the upstairs rooms. The yearly Kebab harvest had been washed away as the downpour had continued unabated for a full month.
Just at that moment Phil's wife, Norma, walked into the bedroom and he commented upon the rain. She replied that she could really care less. No matter how much Phil tried to stress the importance of the rain falling in Madadia, she refused to take it seriously.
How come?
 Hint: nan",,"Phil was watching a news report about his home town on TV, he had recently moved away from the area and it was sunny where he was.
His wife wasn't from Madadia, hence she didn't care what happened there.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1.  Read the story literally.  
    •  Phil is “watching” the rain pour down “on his home town of MADADIA.”  
    •  The flood is already six-feet deep; everybody downstairs has fled upstairs.  
    •  Yet Phil is perfectly dry, calmly sitting in a bedroom.  
    •  Norma walks in, hears the news and says she “could really care less.”

2.  Notice the absurd details.  
    •  An entire town is six-feet under water, but the only reaction we see is a casual conversation.  
    •  “The yearly Kebab harvest had been washed away.”  Kebabs are cooked meat, not something that grows in fields and is “harvested.”  
    •  The town name “MADADIA” is unknown and looks invented.  
    •  The hint is simply “nan” – a computer scientist’s symbol for “Not-a-Number” (i.e. something that is not a real value).

3.  Put the clues together.  
    •  Everything sounds like fiction or a simulation rather than real life.  
    •  “Watching” the rain suggests Phil is looking at a screen, not out of a window.  
    •  The bizarre “kebab harvest,” the made-up town name and the “nan” hint all point to a computer game / simulation where anything can be given any name.

4.  Draw the conclusion.  
    Phil is not experiencing an actual flood.  He is watching a computer simulation (think of SimCity or a similar world-building game) in which the city he created – “Madadia” – has just been hit by a month-long deluge.  Norma knows it is only a game, so she quite correctly “could really care less,” no matter how much Phil tries to make it sound important.

Final answer: The flood is only happening inside the computer game Phil is playing; it isn’t real, so Norma doesn’t have to take it seriously.",True,0,0,0

monkey l mouse  l horse",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Work the clues one by one.

1. Put the fixed portrait: 2A = Dog.  

2. Clue 6 says the Monkey is either above or below the Dog, so it must be in 1A or 3A.  
   If Monkey were in 1A, row 3 could not contain a matching-letter pair (clue 2).  
   Hence Monkey is in 3A.

3. Clue 3 puts the Horse in the same row as the Monkey ⇒ Horse is in row 3.

4. Row 3 must contain two portraits whose names start with the same letter (clue 2).  
   The only possible pairs are (Monkey, Mouse) or (Hamster, Horse).  
   Because Horse is already in row 3, the pair must be Monkey–Mouse.  
   Therefore row 3 contains Monkey, Mouse and Horse.  
   Let 3B = Mouse and 3C = Horse for the moment.

5. Column C must also contain two portraits whose names start with the same letter (clue 2).  
   With Horse already in 3C, the duplicate initial must be H, so Hamster must occupy 1C or 2C.  

6. Clue 1 requires Bear to be in the same row as Hamster.  
   Choose 1C = Hamster, which forces Bear into row 1.

7. Row 1 now has two open spots (1A, 1B) for Bear and the remaining animals.  
   Put 1A = Bear (satisfies clue 1).

8. We still have Cat, Lion, Tiger to place.  
   Put Cat in 1B for now.

9. Clue 5: either Lion or Tiger is below the Cat (i.e. in column B under Cat).  
   So 2B must be Lion or Tiger (3B is Mouse, already fixed).  

10. Clue 7: Dog (2A) is not next to Tiger, hence Tiger cannot be 2B.  
    Therefore 2B = Lion and 2C = Tiger.

202,"Question: In the purely fictitious land of Fiddledeboox, the Minister of Finance emerged from a top-level meeting.   Reporters had gathered to hear his announcement about either an increase or a decrease in either wages, subsidies or tax levels.
It was widely known that this Minister [M] told the truth to reporters [R] only once in every three statements.
M:  Well, I can tell you that it's about subsidies.
R:  Are they going down again?
M:  Nothing is going down.
R:  So it's good news for the people?
M:  Of course.  Either subsidies are going down or there will be a wage increase.
While others jostled to ask the next question, one logically minded newshound was already leaving with the hot headline news.
From the Minister's three statements above, can you also deduce the truth?
 Hint: Assume each statement, in turn, to be true.  Then examine the truth or otherwise of the others.
Or check the statements in the light of each of the six possibilities.","Assume each statement, in turn, to be true.  Then examine the truth or otherwise of the others.
Or check the statements in the light of each of the six possibilities.","It was a tax increase.
Solution:
Remember that only one statement can be true.
If (1) is true then either (2) or (3) will be true as well.  So (1) is a lie.
If (3) is true, either (1) or (2) would be also true.  So (3) is a lie.
If (2) is true, it must be either wages or taxes going up or (1) would be true.  It cannot be wages, making (3) true, so taxes are increasing.
There are other ways of deducing this gloomy news.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

W↑ : wages are to be increased  
W↓ : wages are to be decreased  
S↑ : subsidies are to be increased  
S↓ : subsidies are to be decreased  
T↑ : taxes  are to be increased  
T↓ : taxes  are to be decreased  

Exactly one of these six possibilities is the real decision.

The Minister’s three utterances are  

(1) “It’s about subsidies.”              (call this P₁)  
(2) “Nothing is going down.”             (call this P₂)  
(3) “Either subsidies are going down or there’ll be a wage increase.” (call this P₃)

By reputation the Minister tells the truth only once in every three statements, so among P₁ , P₂ , P₃ exactly one is true.

Truth–tables for the three sentences

• P₁ is true  ⇔  S↑ ∨ S↓ (the decision concerns subsidies).  
• P₂ is true  ⇔  W↑ ∨ S↑ ∨ T↑ (nothing is going down).  
• P₃ is true  ⇔  S↓ ∨ W↑ (subsidies down or wages up).

Now examine each of the six economic possibilities.

1. W↑ :  P₁ = F,  P₂ = T,  P₃ = T  (two truths → impossible)  
2. W↓ :  P₁ = F,  P₂ = F,  P₃ = F  (zero truths → impossible)  
3. S↑ :  P₁ = T,  P₂ = T,  P₃ = F  (two truths → impossible)  
4. S↓ :  P₁ = T,  P₂ = F,  P₃ = T  (two truths → impossible)  
5. T↑ :  P₁ = F,  P₂ = T,  P₃ = F  (one truth  → acceptable)  
6. T↓ :  P₁ = F,  P₂ = F,  P₃ = F  (zero truths → impossible)

The only case that yields exactly one true statement is case 5.

Therefore the real decision must be a tax increase; statement (2) (“Nothing is going down”) is the single truth, while statements (1) and (3) are lies.

Final answer: Taxes are going up, and the only truthful remark was “Nothing is going down.”",True,1,1,0
203,"Question: There are 2008 eggs lying in front of you. I am also with you waiting to start the game. The goal of the game is to be the person to take that very last egg (or eggs) to win. You and I can each only take between 1 and 100 eggs at a time. You go first. How many eggs must you take initially in order to always win (assuming we both play perfectly)?
 Hint: By a perfect game, that means over any two turns, the sum of the number of eggs  you and I take is the same (except of course, excluding the initial move you make).","By a perfect game, that means over any two turns, the sum of the number of eggs  you and I take is the same (except of course, excluding the initial move you make).","89 eggs.
In order to see this, look at the smallest way possible to guarantee a win; you leave me with 101 eggs. If I take 1 egg, you take all 100; if I take 100 eggs, you take the last one. Therefore you would always win.
If you try with 202, I can take from 1 to 100, so there is 201 to 102 left. Then you would take 100 or 1 egg(s) in order to leave me with 101 again. By simple analysis, you must take 101 eggs over two rounds in order to get down to 101.
19*101 = 1919, so we must take 2008-1919 = 89 eggs to start off with a multiple of 101.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 1 :  Translate the rules into a mathematical problem  
•  On every move a player may take 1, 2, … , 100 eggs.  
•  Whoever takes the very last egg(s) wins (normal play).  
•  With perfect play you want a method that works no matter what your opponent chooses on his turns.

Step 2 :  Look for an invariant you can control  
If on your turn you can always leave a number of eggs that is a multiple of (100 + 1) = 101, then after your opponent takes k eggs (1 ≤ k ≤ 100) you can immediately take (101 − k) eggs (also between 1 and 100).  
Thus the two consecutive moves always remove exactly 101 eggs, and the pile after your reply is again a multiple of 101.  
Keeping this “multiple–of–101” condition after every one of your turns guarantees that you will still be the player to make the very last move.

Step 3 :  Choose the first move so the invariant starts to hold  
Compute 2008 (the starting pile) modulo 101:  
101 × 19 = 1919  
2008 − 1919 = 89  
So 2008 ≡ 89 (mod 101).

Therefore, if on your very first turn you take 89 eggs, you leave 2008 − 89 = 1919 eggs, which is 101 × 19, a multiple of 101.

Step 4 :  Show the rest of the strategy works  
•  After your first move the pile size is a multiple of 101.  
•  Whatever number k (1–100) your opponent now removes, you respond with (101 − k).  
   Together both moves remove 101 eggs, so the pile is still a multiple of 101.  
•  There are 1919 / 101 = 19 such blocks of 101 eggs.  
   Because you start each block and 19 is odd, you will also start and finish the last block, taking the last egg(s) and winning.

Step 5 :  Verify legality  
The initial move 89 is within the allowed 1–100 range, and every response (101 − k) to an opponent’s move k is also within 1–100, so the strategy is legal.

1.  The Jewish (Hebrew) calendar counts years “Anno Mundi’’ – from the traditional date of Creation (-3761 in the Gregorian system).  
   Hebrew year 1310 ≈ 1310 – 3761 = –2451, i.e. about 2451 BCE.

2.  The Christian calendar counts years “Anno Domini’’ (AD).  
   Year 1310 AD is simply the mediaeval year 1310 CE.

3.  The Islamic calendar counts lunar years from the Hijra (622 CE).

The first trick obviously required two cards of the leading suit, and since everyone had to play the leading suit if possible, there had to be two people who had at least one card of the first leading suit. But since John, Paul, and George each had a club, the first leading suit could not have been a club.
If the first leading suit was a heart, then the high suit had to be a card of which only one of Paul and Ringo had. This means it could only have been a club or a diamond. Similarly, if the first leading suit was a spade, the high suit could only have been a diamond, and if the leading suit was a diamond, the high suit could only have been a heart or a spade.
If the first leading suit was a heart, the second trick was led by either Paul or Ringo, and the leading suit had to be a spade. If the first leading suit was a spade, the second trick was led by John, and the leading suit could have been a club or a heart. If the first leading suit was a diamond, the second trick was led by either Paul or George, and the leading suit was a club.

215,"Question: Mad Ade sat at home, waiting for his favourite TV program ""I'm a celebrity, Get me a Kebab"" to start. He glanced at his clock and began to wonder strange and wondrous things, but that is another story altogether.
He realised that he could leave 6 adjacent numbers of the face of a clock intact and rearrange the other 6 in such a way that the sum of every pair of adjacent numbers is prime.
Unfortunately the TV program started at that point so he never actually got around to doing it. Can you find the two possible solutions to Mad Ade's clock teaser?
 Hint: Part of it is making sure each number is odd...",Part of it is making sure each number is odd...,"Imagining the number on a clock face in a clockwise order they would be
1 2 3 4 7 10 9 8 5 6 11 12
Or
1 2 3 4 9 10 7 6 5 8 11 12",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 1 – What has to be true for two neighbouring numbers  
If two neighbouring numbers are to add to a prime then, apart from the single prime 2, their sum has to be odd.  
Hence every neighbouring pair must consist of one odd and one even number – the numbers round the clock have to alternate odd / even.

Step 2 – Which six consecutive numbers may be left untouched  
Because the six “fixed” numbers must keep their original order, every one of the five sums that occur inside that block has to be prime already.  
Going round the ordinary clock face the consecutive sums are

1+2 = 3 (P), 2+3 = 5 (P), 3+4 = 7 (P), 4+5 = 9,
5+6 = 11 (P), 6+7 = 13 (P), 7+8 = 15,
8+9 = 17 (P), 9+10 = 19 (P), 10+11 = 21,
11+12 = 23 (P), 12+1 = 13 (P).

The only run of five successive prime sums is

11-12-1-2-3-4

so these six numbers must stay where they are.  
Consequently the places of the other six numbers (5,6,7,8,9,10) – starting at the “5-o’clock” position – may be permuted, but odds have to stay on odd positions and evens on even positions.

Step 3 – Notation for the movable part  

              4  | o1 e1 o2 e2 o3 e3 | 11
              ↑              ↑
              first movable   last movable
              place (= o1)    place (= e3)

o1,o2,o3 are the three odd numbers {5,7,9},  
e1,e2,e3 are the three even numbers {6,8,10}.  
All twelve neighbouring sums have to be prime, in particular

4+o1 , o1+e1 , e1+o2 , o2+e2 , e2+o3 , o3+e3 , e3+11   must be prime.

Step 4 – The end conditions fix e3 and o3  
Because 11 pairs primely only with 2,6,8,12 and 2 and 12 are already fixed, e3 is 6 or 8.

• If e3 = 6, then o3 must be 5 or 7 (6 makes a prime with 5 or 7).  
• If e3 = 8, then o3 must be 5 or 9 (8 makes a prime with 5 or 9).

Step 5 – Case analysis  

Case A   e3 = 6, o3 = 5  
e2 must satisfy 5+e2 prime → e2 = 8.  
The remaining even is e1 = 10, the remaining odds are {7,9}.  
o2 must satisfy 10+o2 prime and 8+o2 prime → o2 = 9.  
Hence o1 = 7 and the whole movable part is  

7   10   9   8   5   6

Case B   e3 = 8, o3 = 5  
e2 must satisfy 5+e2 prime → e2 = 6.  
The remaining even is e1 = 10, the remaining odds are {7,9}.  
o2 must satisfy 10+o2 prime and 6+o2 prime → o2 = 7.  
Hence o1 = 9 and the movable part is  

9   10   7   6   5   8

All the other sub-cases break down at one of the prime conditions, so the two sequences obtained above are the only possibilities.

Step 6 – The two complete clock faces  

Writing the numbers clockwise starting with 12 o’clock:

Solution 1 :   12  1  2  3  4  7  10  9  8  5  6  11  
Neighbouring sums: 13,3,5,7,11,17,19,17,13,11,17,23  (all prime)

Solution 2 :   12  1  2  3  4  9  10  7  6  5  8  11  
Neighbouring sums: 13,3,5,7,13,19,17,13,11,13,19,23  (all prime)

Both solutions keep the six-number stretch 11-12-1-2-3-4 fixed and satisfy the prime-sum condition everywhere.

During the course of the conversation, it is discovered that, prior to the party, each person except you was acquainted with a different number of the people present. Assuming the acquaintance relationship is symmetric (i.e., if you are acquainted with someone, that person is also acquainted with you), then how many people did your spouse know prior to the party? How many people did you know?
 Hint: Start with the assumption that everybody knows their own spouses -- which means that everybody there knew at least one person.",Start with the assumption that everybody knows their own spouses -- which means that everybody there knew at least one person.,"Start with the assumption that everybody knows their own spouses -- which means that everybody there knew at least one person. Discounting yourself, everyone knows a different number of people, which means that (again, discounting yourself) one person knows one, one person knows two, one person knows three, etc., up to one person who knows nine people (everybody else). Number the people (besides yourself) according to how many people they know, so that person 1 is the one who knows one person, person 2 is the one who knows two people, etc.
Now pair up people with their spouses. If person 9 knows everybody else, s/he must be the only person who knows person 1, because person 1 only knows one person. So they must be married. Person 8 knows everybody except for person 1. Person 2 therefore knows person 8 and person 9. Person 9 is married to person 1, so person 2's spouse must be person 8. Person 7 knows everybody except for persons 1 and 2. Person 3 therefore knows persons 7, 8, and 9. Persons 8 and 9 are married to persons 2 and 1 respectively, so person 3's spouse must be person 7. Person 6 knows everybody except for persons 1, 2, and 3. Person 4 therefore knows persons 6, 7, 8, and 9. The only one of those not yet paired up is person 6, so person 4 and person 6 must be married.
This leaves person 5, who knows everyone except persons 1, 2, 3, and 4. These five people, therefore, must be persons 6, 7, 8, 9, and you. Since you are the only one of these five not yet paired up, person 5 must be your spouse. So your spouse knew five people prior to the party.
The above also determines that the people who know you are persons 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. So you knew five people prior to the party also.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the ten people at the party be numbered  

0 : you  
1 : your spouse  
2–9 : the other four couples, each husband–wife pair being (2,3), (4,5), (6,7) and (8,9).

Because everybody knows his or her own spouse, every degree (number of prior acquaintances) is at least 1.  
During the conversation it is discovered that the nine people different from you (1–9) all have different degrees, so these degrees must be

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9  (in some order).

Call the person whose degree is k, Pk.  
We have to find the degrees of P0 (you) and P1 (your spouse).

Step 1.  P1 and P9 are married  
P9 knows everybody (degree 9).  
Suppose P1’s only acquaintance (degree 1) were not P9 but, say, Pm.  
Because P9 knows everybody, P9 knows P1, hence P1 would also know P9, giving P1 two acquaintances – a contradiction.  
Therefore P1 and P9 are spouses.

Step 2.  P2 and P8 are married  
Remove the couple {P1,P9}.  
Every remaining person loses the acquaintanceship with P9, so each of the remaining eight degrees drops by 1.  
What is left is a new party of four couples in which the eight degrees are now the distinct numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.  
Applying the argument of Step 1 to this smaller party shows that the person who now has degree 0 (original degree 2) must be married to the one who now has degree 7 (original degree 8).  
Hence P2 and P8 are a couple.

Step 3.  P3 with P7 and P4 with P6  
Repeat the same elimination process twice more:

• Remove {P2,P8}; all remaining degrees drop by 1, leaving 0,1,2,3,4,5 for three couples.  
Again the 0-degree and 5-degree people must be married: P3 to P7.

• Remove {P3,P7}; degrees drop by 1, leaving 0,1,2,3 for two couples.  
The 0-degree and 3-degree people must be married: P4 to P6.

After these removals only one couple is left unpaired.

Step 4.  Your spouse must be the 5-degree person  
The only degree among 1–9 not yet assigned a spouse is 5, so P5 must be your spouse.  
Consequently, degree 5 occurs twice – once for P5 and once for P0 (you), for otherwise the nine different degrees 1–9 could not all appear among persons 1–9.

Step 5.  Consistency check  
The degree multiset  
9,8,7,6,5,5,4,3,2,1  
passes the Havel–Hakimi (or Erdős–Gallai) test, so a symmetric acquaintance graph with these degrees and with exactly the five spouse edges exists.  One explicit construction is shown below (edges are listed succinctly):  

• Couple edges: (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6), (5,0).  
• P9 joined to everyone else.  
• P8 joined to everyone except P1.  
• Additional edges among {P4,P5,P6,P7,P0}:  
 (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,0), (6,5), (6,0).

Every vertex then has its prescribed degree, so the solution is feasible and unique.

Conclusion  
Your spouse (person 1) knew 5 people before the party, and you (person 0) also knew 5 people.

What is it ?
 Hint: nan",,A personalised number plate.,GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Reasoning  
1. The only way the prices in the story make sense is if two different things are being paid for:  
   • the legal right to own/use something (very expensive) and  
   • the mere physical object that shows it (very cheap).  

2. In Britain a personalised vehicle registration (number-plate) works exactly like that.  
   • You pay the DVLA a large sum (here £5000) to buy the registration mark itself.  
   • If you physically break the plastic/metal plate you can have a brand-new one made at any motor-factors shop for only about £25, because you already own the rights to the mark.  

3. Owning the registration mark means you can later transfer it to someone else. A collector who likes the plate may well offer more than you originally paid (here £6000).  

Thus:  
• £5000 — price of purchasing the personalised registration from the DVLA.  
• £25 — price of replacing the smashed bit of plastic that shows the number.  
• £6000 — what another motorist is willing to pay for the right to that same registration.

The little clue 'June is in her prime' should have helped, as it suggests that all the numbers in her name are prime numbers.  As the total is 17 all the numbers must be less than 10, so:
J=2; U=7; N=5; E=3  (or J=3; U=7; N=5; E=2)
Setting these numbers in the word Jane or Jean we can conclude that
16=2+A+5+3, so A=6.
Putting these numbers in the word Jenny in the same way we find Y=4.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  
J, A, N, E, U, Y = the integers assigned to the six different letters that appear in the names.  
Each letter must receive a different, non-zero integer.

Translate the statement “if the letters are added together, the total is the girl’s age”:

Jane: J + A + N + E = 16  
Jean: J + E + A + N = 16      (same letters as Jane)  
June: J + U + N + E = 17  
Jenny: J + E + N + N + Y = 19

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Eliminate sums that repeat

Put S = J + N + E.  
Then

June: S + U = 17  …(1)  
Jane: S + A = 16  …(2)  
Jenny: S + N + Y = 19 …(3)

From (1) and (2): U – A = 1 ⇒ U = A + 1.  …(4)  
From (2) and (3): N + Y = 3 + A.       …(5)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Use the hint “June is in her prime”

Interpreting the hint in the natural way, assume each letter in JUNE is given a prime number.
Thus J, U, N, E are four different primes whose sum is 17 (June’s age).

The only way to write 17 as a sum of four distinct primes is  
17 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7.

Hence {J, U, N, E} = {2, 3, 5, 7}.  
Keep every assignment distinct and non-zero.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Try each choice for U

Because U = A + 1, A must be one less than whichever prime is chosen for U.
Check which primes allow A to be different from every other letter value.

a) U = 2 ⇒ A = 1  (duplicate or negative Y will appear – no good)  
b) U = 3 ⇒ A = 2  (2 already used – duplicate)  
c) U = 5 ⇒ A = 4  (leads to unavoidable duplicates)  
d) U = 7 ⇒ A = 6  (distinct and acceptable)

Therefore U = 7 and A = 6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Fix N and find Y

The remaining primes {2, 3, 5} must be J, N, E, and they must satisfy

J + N + E = 17 − U = 10.

That forces {J, N, E} = {2, 3, 5} (in some order).

Equation (5) gives Y = 3 + A − N = 9 − N.

Check the three possible values of N:

• N = 2 ⇒ Y = 7  (duplicate of U)  
• N = 3 ⇒ Y = 6  (duplicate of A)  
• N = 5 ⇒ Y = 4  (new, non-zero, distinct) ✔

So we must take N = 5 and Y = 4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Two ways to place the last two primes

With N fixed at 5, the remaining primes 2 and 3 can be assigned to J and E in either order:

Option 1: J = 2, E = 3  
Option 2: J = 3, E = 2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Verification

Option 1:  
Jane  2+6+5+3 = 16 Jean  2+3+6+5 = 16  
June  2+7+5+3 = 17 Jenny 2+3+5+5+4 = 19

Jane  3+6+5+2 = 16 Jean  3+2+6+5 = 16  
June  3+7+5+2 = 17 Jenny 3+2+5+5+4 = 19

All six letters have different, non-zero integers in both cases.

Balances at the start of March

Let the amounts in their desks on 3 March be SK, ST, SH.

 SK  + (1 – K)  = 20   ⇒ SK = 19 + K  
 ST  + (–K – 2) = 20   ⇒ ST = 22 + K  
 SH  + (2K + 1) = 20   ⇒ SH = 19 – 2K

For K = 1,2,3,4,5 we get

 K = 1 → SK = 20, ST = 23, SH = 17  
 K = 2 → SK = 21, ST = 24, SH = 15  
 K = 3 → SK = 22, ST = 25, SH = 13  
 K = 4 → SK = 23, ST = 26, SH = 11  
 K = 5 → SK = 24, ST = 27, SH =  9

So the largest possible initial amount is $27 (Kate’s amount when K = 5).

-----------------------------------------------------
Can the $27 situation really occur?

Take K = 5, so T = 4, H = 10, N = 2.  
Start with (24, 27, 9) dollars for (Kevin, Kate, Kathy).  
Run the 21 days in the order

 H H H H H K K K T N H H T N H K T H K T H

(K = Kevin wins, T = Kate wins, H = Kathy wins, N = no winner).

A day when you win adds $2; a day someone else wins subtracts $1; N changes nothing.  
Tracking the balances shows that no one ever drops below $9, and the final balances are (20, 20, 20) as required.

One evening, the guard who was on duty accidentally on purpose left the cell door open so that Torks G'Arbage could leave for distant parts.

• (D,E,F) are three consecutive even digits.  
• (G,H,I,J) are four consecutive odd digits.  
• A+B+C = 9.  
• Hint narrows the choices to

An adopted dad- my sisters' dad and a step dad- who lives with me. My two younger sisters never knew my biological dad. My oldest sister (19) lives by herself. Her son lives with me, my 3 other sisters, my mom, and step dad.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the people who actually live in the house be listed first, because the riddle says the “immediate family (living in my house) consists of 7”.

1. Mum  
2. Eldest sister A  
3. Second-eldest sister B  
4. “Me” – the narrator (the middle child)  
5. Younger sister C  
6. Youngest sister D  
7. A’s little son – my nephew  

That is exactly 7 people.

How do the three dads enter the story if none of them lives in the house?  
Mum has been married (or in a long-term relationship) three different times, in this order.

• Dad 1 – father of the two oldest girls A and B.  
• Dad 2 – father of “me”, the middle child.  
• Dad 3 – father of the two youngest girls C and D, and Mum’s present husband.

Because each man stayed in the children’s lives after the break-ups, every child counts as a “dad” any man who is either

 • her own biological father, or  
 • a man who has acted as her step-father.

Now check each child’s list of dads.

• Eldest sister A: Dad 1 (biological) and Dad 3 (step)  → 2 dads  
• Second sister B: Dad 1 (biological) and Dad 3 (step)  → 2 dads  
• I (the narrator): Dad 2 (biological), Dad 1 (former step-dad) and Dad 3 (present step-dad)  → 3 dads  
• Younger sister C: Dad 3 (biological) and Dad 2 (former step-dad)  → 2 dads  
• Youngest sister D: Dad 3 (biological) and Dad 2 (former step-dad)  → 2 dads  

So the narrator really does “have 3 dads”, while two of the sisters (A and B) each “only have 2 dads”.  
Everything else mentioned in the riddle is now accounted for:

• 4 sisters?  A, B, C, D  
• A nephew in the house?  A’s little boy  
• The narrator is the middle child?  Two older (A, B) and two younger (C, D) sisters make the narrator the third of five – exactly the middle.

Thus the riddle is resolved simply by successive marriages/divorces that gave the children different combinations of biological and step-fathers.

Final answer:  The mother has been with three different men.  Her five children (the narrator and four sisters) have different biological fathers, and every man who has ever been married to Mum is considered a “dad”.  That gives the narrator three dads, but two of the sisters, who each have only one biological father and one step-father, have just two dads.  The seven people actually living in the house are Mum, the narrator, the four sisters, and the eldest sister’s baby (the nephew).",True,0,0,0

2. Ben is the older, shorter boxer, and Carl is the younger, taller boxer.
3. Al is the older, shorter boxer, and Carl is the younger, taller boxer.
Scenario 2 cannot be possible because it contradicts fact 2 by making the younger of Ben and Carl the taller boxer.
Fact 2 also tells us that Al is not the shorter boxer, so scenario 3 cannot be possible, either.
Therefore, scenario 1 is true, which means that Carl is not a boxer.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

• O = the older of the two boxers  
• Y = the younger of the two boxers  
• S = the shorter of the two boxers  
• T = the taller of the two boxers

(3) “The taller of Al and Carl is the younger boxer.”  
  ⇒ Y = the taller of (A , C).               (§)

Since O and Y are different people, O ≠ Y.

--------------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Decide who can be O and Y.

From (†) O is either A or B (whichever is shorter).  
From (§) Y is either A or C (whichever is taller).

Hence the only possible ordered pairs (O , Y) are  
 (O , Y) = (A , C), (B , A), (B , C).

(O , Y) = (A , A) is impossible because O ≠ Y.

--------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Test each pair against (‡).

• Case 1:  (O , Y) = (A , C)  
 Conditions: A shorter than B, C taller than A.  
 Then S = the shorter boxer = A.  
 But (‡) says S = younger of (B , C), which must be B or C, not A.

• Case 2:  (O , Y) = (B , A)  
 Conditions: B shorter than A, A taller than C.  
 Heights can be B < C < A.  
 Then S = the shorter boxer = B.  
 (‡) demands the younger of (B , C) be B, so B younger than C.  
 That is consistent if the ages are C (oldest) > B > A (youngest).  
 All three original statements are now satisfied and the two boxers are A and B.  
 Therefore Carl is not a boxer.

• Case 3:  (O , Y) = (B , C)  
 Conditions: B shorter than A, C taller than A (so B < A < C).  
 Now S = B.  
 (‡) again requires B be younger than C, but here B is the older boxer, so B must be older than C.  
 Contradiction ⇒ impossible.

Only Case 2 works, and in that case Al and Ben are the two boxers while Carl is not.

228,"Question: Henry and Gretchen are going to play a game.  Henry explains, ""You and I will take turns saying numbers.  The first person will say a number between 1 and 10.  Then the other person will say a number that is at least 1 higher than that number, and at most 10 higher.  We will keep going back and forth in this way until one of us says the number 50.  That person wins.  I'll start.""
""Not so fast!"" says Gretchen.  ""I want to win, so I will start.""
What number should Gretchen say to start?
 Hint: By following this strategy, she is assured a victory.  Think of all of the numbers she will want to say.","By following this strategy, she is assured a victory.  Think of all of the numbers she will want to say.","She wants to say, ""6.""
The series of numbers she will say is 6, 17, 28, 39, 50.
Since she wants to say 50, she needs Henry to say a number between 40 and 49.  Therefore, she wants to say 39.
Knowing she wants to say 39, she needs Henry to say a number between 29 and 38.  So she wants to say 28.  Following this same logic recursively, she will want to say 17, and she will want to say 6 to start the game, and be assured victory.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 1 – Look at the last move  
If you ever get a turn when the last number spoken is 40-49 you can jump to 50 (add 1-10) and win.  
So Gretchen would like to reach 40-49 immediately after Henry finishes a turn.

Step 2 – Work backwards one block of 1-10  
What numbers guarantee that Henry’s reply will be in the 40-49 range?  
If Gretchen says 39, Henry’s next number must be 40-49 (he has to add 1-10).  
Whatever he chooses, Gretchen then replies with 50 and wins.  
Thus 39 is a “target” number for Gretchen.

Step 3 – Work backwards again  
To be certain she can say 39 on her following turn, she wants Henry to leave her 29-38.  
What number assures that?  
If she says 28, Henry can only add 1-10, so he must say 29-38.  
Then Gretchen jumps to 39.  
Hence 28 is another target number.

Step 4 – Continue the process  
Apply the same reasoning repeatedly:

• If Gretchen says 17, Henry is confined to 18-27, letting her answer 28.  
• If Gretchen says 6, Henry is confined to 7-16, letting her answer 17.

Therefore the chain of “safe” numbers for Gretchen is  
6 → 17 → 28 → 39 → 50.

Step 5 – The opening move  
Because Gretchen has the very first move and may choose any number from 1 to 10, she simply begins with the first number in that chain, 6.

No matter what Henry does afterward, Gretchen can always respond with the next number in the list, and the sequence inevitably ends with her saying 50.

229,"Question: One of four people - two men (Jack and Mike) and two women (Carol and Lily) - was murdered.
The following facts refer to the people mentioned:

(b) Mike's sister argued twice with the victim's legal spouse after the murder. Who was the victim?
 Hint: They may or may not share sisters?",They may or may not share sisters?,"Mike is the victim.
If Mike's sister and Jack's sister are the same person, then (a) reads ""Lily argued exactly once with (Mike or Jack)"" and (b) reads ""Lily argued twice with (the same Mike or Jack)"".  These two statements contradict each other.  Therefore Mike's sister must be different from Jack's sister.
If this is the case then there are two possibilities:
1)  Jack and Carol are brother and sister.  Mike and Lily are brother and sister.  Jack is married to Lily and Mike is married to Carol.  If this is the case, then (a) reads ""Carol argued once with Mike"" and (b) reads ""Lily argued twice with herself"", leaving Jack dead.

If this is the case, then (a) reads ""Lily argued once with Jack"" and (b) reads ""Carol argued twice with Lily"", leaving Mike dead.  Since there are no contradictions, this is the solution.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

• J = Jack (male)  
• M = Mike (male)  
• C = Carol (female)  
• L = Lily (female)

and accept the ordinary assumptions of the genre:

1.  Marriages are monogamous and heterosexual.  
2.  No one is both the legal spouse and the sibling of the same person (no incest).  
3.  The only relevant people are the four named ones; any “sister” that is spoken of must therefore be C or L (there are no unnamed outsiders).  

The two given facts are  

(a) Jack’s sister argued exactly once with Carol’s legal husband.  
(b) Mike’s sister argued exactly twice with the victim’s legal spouse.  

We test each of the four candidates for the victim.

────────────────────────────────────────
1.  Assume Jack is the victim.

Because the argument with Carol’s husband happens after the murder, Carol’s husband must still be alive, so he cannot be Jack.  
Hence Carol’s husband = Mike, and the only way Jack can be married (so that he has a “legal spouse”) is to be married to Lily.

JS (Jack’s sister) cannot be Lily (she is Jack’s wife), so JS must be Carol.  
But then Carol would simultaneously be

• Jack’s sister (JS) and  
• Mike’s wife (Carol’s husband is Mike).

Now look at fact (b): Mike’s sister must argue with Jack’s spouse (Lily).  
Mike’s sister cannot be Lily (would be arguing with herself).  
The only woman left is Carol, so Mike’s sister would also have to be Carol.

Therefore Carol would be both Jack’s sister and Mike’s sister while being married to Mike  
→ Mike would be married to his own sister, violating rule 2.  

Contradiction ⇒ Jack cannot be the victim.
────────────────────────────────────────
2.  Assume Mike is the victim.

Because the murder occurs before the arguments, Carol’s husband must be alive, so Carol’s husband ≠ Mike.  
Thus Carol’s husband = Jack.  
Since the victim (Mike) must be married, Mike’s spouse has to be Lily.

So we now have  

Carol’s husband (CH) = Jack,  Victim’s spouse (VS) = Lily.

Pick the sisters so that no one marries a sibling:

• Let Jack’s sister (JS) be Lily.  Jack is not married to Lily, so no incest.  
• Let Mike’s sister (MS) be Carol.  Mike is married to Lily, not to Carol, so no incest.

Check the two facts:

(a) JS (Lily) argued once with CH (Jack). ✔  
(b) MS (Carol) argued twice with VS (Lily). ✔

All conditions are satisfied and no rules are violated, so this assignment is consistent.

────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Assume Carol is the victim.

Then Carol’s husband is also the victim’s spouse.  
Facts (a) and (b) would require two different sisters (one of Jack, one of Mike) who both have to be alive to argue, but the only living woman left is Lily.  Impossible ⇒ Carol cannot be the victim.

4.  Assume Lily is the victim.

The only surviving woman would be Carol.  She would need to be simultaneously  
Jack’s sister (to satisfy fact (a)) and Mike’s sister (to satisfy fact (b)), which forces Mike to be married to his own sister in every possible marriage arrangement.  This violates rule 2 ⇒ Lily cannot be the victim.

230,"Question: Walter, Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke crossed a river in a tiny rowboat. They all started on the same side of the river. They made three trips from the starting side to the destination side, and two trips from the destination side to the starting side. Here are some facts:
1. On each trip from the starting side of the river to the destination side, two people were in the boat, but only one person rowed the boat, and that person rowed the boat for the entire trip.
2. On each return trip, only one person was in the boat.
3. Walter is the weakest of the group. He could only row the boat if no one else is in it.
4. Xavier is the second weakest of the group. He can only row the boat if he is by himself or if Yoshi, the lightest of the group, is a passenger.
5. Each man rowed the boat at least once.
Who rowed twice?
 Hint: Fact 5 tells us that Walter had to row the boat at least once, but fact 3 tells us that he had to go by himself. This means he could only row the boat on a return trip,.","Fact 5 tells us that Walter had to row the boat at least once, but fact 3 tells us that he had to go by himself. This means he could only row the boat on a return trip,.","Yoshi rowed twice.
Fact 5 tells us that Walter had to row the boat at least once, but fact 3 tells us that he had to go by himself. This means he could only row the boat on a return trip, which means he rowed on at least one return trip.
The man who rowed twice could not have rowed on two trips from the starting side to the destination side, because he would have had to make a third trip by himself back to the starting side. So the man who rowed twice must have made a return trip at least once.
Now we know that if Walter made two trips, they must both have been return trips, and Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke each rowed for one of the other three trips. If Walter made only one trip, the other person who made a return trip must have been the person who rowed twice (Xavier, Yoshi, or Zeke) and that person would also have made one of the other three trips. So the three trips from the starting side to the destination side must have been rowed by Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke.
Fact 1 tells us that Xavier's trip to the destination side must have had a passenger, and fact 4 tells us that that passenger must have been Yoshi. Yoshi would have had to row back to row his trip to the destination side, or else Yoshi rowed to the destination side, then back to the start, then got rowed across by Xavier.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

• L = the starting (left) bank,  
• R = the destination (right) bank,  
• the five trips be  

 T1  L → R (two men in the boat)  
 T2  R → L (one man returns)  
 T3  L → R (two men)  
 T4  R → L (one man returns)  
 T5  L → R (two men) .

Because the boat ends on R after T5, exactly three outward trips and two return trips are required.

Step 1.  Who rows the two return trips?  
‐ Fact 3 says Walter (W) can row only when he is alone, so he must row one of the return trips (T2 or T4).  
‐ Fact 4 says Xavier (X) can row alone or with passenger Yoshi (Y) only.  If X were the other return rower he would end up on L with W, but then no one who may start on L could legally row the last outward trip together with W (X cannot row with W, and W cannot row outward).  Therefore X cannot be the second return rower.  
‐ Thus the second return rower must be Y (Zeke (Z) could row back, but then X would never be able to row with an allowable passenger).  

Hence the two return trips are rowed by W and Y.

Step 2.  Counting the required rowers.  
There are five trips, so five rowers in all.  
We already have W and Y as rowers once each.  
To satisfy Fact 5 every man must row at least once, so X and Z must each row at least once on the three outward trips.  That already accounts for four distinct rowers (W, X, Y, Z).  There is only one trip left unaccounted for, so exactly one of the four men rows twice.

Step 3.  Why must that man be Y?  
W cannot row twice (he can row only alone, and there is only one unscheduled return).  
X cannot row twice because every outward trip he rows must have Y as passenger, yet Y is on R just before X would need him on L again (the boat is on L after W’s solo return); Y cannot be on both banks simultaneously.  
Z could not be the second return rower (see Step 1) and can row only in outward trips, so he can appear at most once.  

Therefore the only person who can possibly appear twice is Y.  Consequently Yoshi rows once on a return trip (alone) and once on an outward trip (with some passenger), while W, X, and Z each row exactly once.

A concrete schedule that satisfies every condition is

 T1 :  Z rows, W passenger (L → R)  
 T2 :  W rows alone (R → L)  
 T3 :  X rows, Y passenger (L → R)  
 T4 :  Y rows alone (R → L)  
 T5 :  Y rows, W passenger (L → R)

All five facts are met and Y rows twice, everyone else once.

231,"Question: There is a famous diamond displayed in a room that measures 15 meters by 15 meters by 15 meters. The room is made entirely of concrete blocks and the floor is covered with a thick carpet. The only thing in the room is the diamond that is housed under a glass cube. The glass cube stands on a one-meter pedestal in the centre of the room. Alarm wires spaced eight centimetres apart and running parallel to each other lie under the carpet. The alarm will trigger if more than four kilograms of pressure is applied to any individual wire. Will Carlo who weighs 74 kilograms was able to steal the famous diamond using the following equipment: a five meter 2 x 4 board, four leather straps (each two meters long and five cm wide), a hammer, and a saw. How could he do it without triggering the alarm?
 Hint: How can he spread out his weight?",How can he spread out his weight?,"Will Carlo stole the diamond in the following manner: First, he cut five meter 2 x 4 boards in half. Then using the available straps, he fastened the two boards to his feet like skies. With the boards strapped to his feet, his weight was displacing enough so that he did not exceed the wire's weight tolerance and triggers the alarm. Carlo then slowly and carefully walked to the centre of the room, smashed the glass cube with the hammer, took the diamond and returned the same way he came in.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 1 – What has to be avoided  
An individual alarm-wire may not be loaded with more than 4 kg.  
Carlo’s mass is 74 kg, so his whole weight must be spread at the same time over at least  
74 kg ÷ 4 kg ≈ 19 wires.

The wires lie 8 cm apart.  
19 wires therefore occupy 18·8 cm = 144 cm ≈ 1.5 m.  
If Carlo can make every step rest on a strip of floor 1.5 m wide (measured across the
direction of the wires) the load per wire will be under the 4 kg limit and the alarm stays
silent.

Step 2 – Turning one 2 × 4 into such a strip  
A 2 × 4 is 3.8 cm thick and about 8.9 cm (≈ 9 cm) wide, but it is 5 m long.  
Lay the board FLAT on the carpet so that its 5-metre length is perpendicular to
the wires.  
Because the board is 5 m long, it crosses

5 m ÷ 0.08 m = 62˝–63 wires,

far more than the 19 wires that are required.  
If Carlo stands on that board, his 74 kg is shared by about 63 wires, i.e.

74 kg ÷ 63 ≈ 1.2 kg per wire   (< 4 kg),

so no wire is over-loaded.

Step 3 – Reaching the middle of the room  
The centre of the room is 7.5 m from any wall, yet the board is only 5 m long.  
To get all the way in without ever stepping on the carpet Carlo “walks his plank”.

1. Stand just inside the doorway holding the board cross-wise.  
   Put it on the carpet perpendicular to the wires, push it forward as far as you can
   and step onto its inner end.

2. While standing on the forward 1 m of the board, pick up the rear 4 m and swing it
   round in front of you, again laying it flat and cross-wise.  
   (The leather straps are simply handy handles that let him drag and turn the board
   without losing balance.)

3. Move onto the new front end, pull the rear part forward again, and repeat.
   Two such “leap-frog” moves carry him well past the 7.5 m mark, right beside the
   pedestal.

Because at every moment his entire weight is borne by the board, and the board always
lies across more than sixty wires, the alarm never senses more than 4 kg on any one wire.

Step 4 – Taking the diamond and getting out  
From the board Carlo can step onto the 1-m pedestal (there are no alarm wires in the
pedestal itself), use the hammer to break the glass, pocket the diamond, climb back
onto the board and “walk” the board back to the door the same way he came in.

No wire ever carries more than about 1½ kg, so the alarm is never triggered and Carlo
leaves with the famous stone.

Final answer: Carlo lays the 5-metre 2 × 4 flat on the carpet perpendicular to the wires, so his weight is spread over about 63 wires (≈1 kg per wire). By repeatedly standing on the forward end of the board and swinging its rear end in front of him he “walks” the plank across the room, reaches the pedestal, steals the diamond, and returns the same way without any wire ever bearing more than 4 kg, so the alarm is not set off.",True,0,0,0

To start, it can't be Emma or Quinn or anyone who mixed/gave to them. This leaves Flare, Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Watt, Misty, and Ryan.
It can't be Flare because he exchanged with Alice before Alice exchanged with Emma. It can't be Watt because he mixed with Tina before Tina exchanged with Emma. This leaves Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Misty, and Ryan.
It can't be Gabbi because she mixed with Flare before Flare mixed with Tina who mixed with Emma later. This leaves Luke, Callie, Misty, and Ryan.
If only one of Luke & Callie started with sugar it wouldn't be solvable because no interactions happened before them and the outcome would be the same, therefore the solution is either Misty and Ryan or Luke and Callie.

• B = “has blue eyes”,  
• R = “has red hair”,  
• H = “is 5′ 11″ ”.  

For every woman a characteristic is either present (1) or absent (0).

Step 1 – translate the six pairwise facts.

1a   Blue(A) = Blue(B)  
3a   Blue(B) ≠ Blue(C)        ⇒ Blue(A) = Blue(B) ≠ Blue(C)

1b   Red(A)  ≠ Red(B)

2b   H(A)    ≠ H(C)  
3b   H(B)    ≠ H(C)            ⇒ H(A)  = H(B)  ≠ H(C)

Introduce the three attributes of Audrey:

 Blue(A)=b , Red(A)=r , H(A)=h  ( each of b,r,h is 0 or 1 )

Then, from the deductions above,

 Blue(B)=b  Blue(C)=1–b  
 Red (B)=1–r  Red (C)=r  
 H   (B)=h  H   (C)=1–h

Step 2 – count how many of the three characteristics each woman has.

 s(A)= b + r + h  
 s(B)= b + h + (1–r) = (b + h + 1) – r  
 s(C)= (1–b) + r + (1–h) = (r + 2) – (b + h)

Step 3 – list the eight possible triples (b,r,h) and the resulting counts.

          1 1 1          3      2      1

Step 4 – see which of the decision clauses can be applied.

Clause 4a: “If any woman has exactly two characteristics, Mr F marries the one with the least number of characteristics.”

Clause 4b: “If any woman has exactly one characteristic, Mr F marries the one with the greatest number of characteristics.”

• In six of the eight rows both a “1” and a “2” appear, so both clauses would demand
   mutually opposite actions – an impossible situation; those six rows are therefore
   impossible.

• Only two rows give a single applicable clause:

 (0,1,0) → counts 1-0-3.  Someone has “1” but nobody has “2”, so only clause 4b
  applies – Mr F marries the woman with the greatest count, namely Charlotte (3).

 (1,0,1) → counts 2-3-0.  Someone has “2” but nobody has “1”, so only clause 4a
  applies – Mr F marries the woman with the least count, again Charlotte (0).

Thus every consistent assignment of characteristics leads to the same conclusion:  
Charlotte is the bride‐to‐be.

234,"Question: Draw a diagram of the Fantasylands to help you with this teaser...
Beethoven's Wig has been stolen again!  Instead of hiding it in a box, the enemy, who remains anonymous, has hidden it inside one of four castles.  Each castle is located in a different fantasyland and has a creature guarding its gates.  Use the clues below to put the lands in order (1st,2nd,3rd, and 4th), figure out which castle belongs in which land, which creature belong to which castle, and help Beethoven reclaim his wig!
Object: Beethoven's Wig
Fantasylands: Lothlorien, Mordor, Narnia, and Malacandra.
Creatures: Dragon, Troll, Giant, and Balrog.
Castles: Stone, Gold, Glass, and Silver.
1.  Narnia is to the left of Lothlorien, which is to the right of the Balrog.
2.  The Stone Castle is to the right of the Wig, and is placed at either Malacandra or Lothlorien.
3.  The Giant is not at Lothlorien and is not in the same place as the wig.
4.  The Balrog is not in Lothlorien, but he stays at the Stone Castle.
5.  The Troll doesn't live at the Golden Castle, which is to the left of where the Balrog stays and to the right of the Silver Castle.
6.  Mordor is to the left of the Dragon, who stays at the second place.
7.  The Troll is not at the Silver Castle, which is 1 fantasyland to the left of the wig.

Narnia is the second land.  It has the Dragon, the Golden Castle, and the Wig.
Malacandra is the third land.  It has the Stone Castle and the Balrog.
Lothlorien is the fourth land.  It contains the Troll and the Glass Castle.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"We label the four places from left-to-right as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.

Step 1.  From clue 6 the Dragon is at the 2nd place; Mordor is to its left, so Mordor = 1st.

Step 2.  The hint says Mordor and Lothlorien are the two edge lands, hence Lothlorien = 4th.

Step 3.  
• Clue 4: Balrog lives in the Stone Castle and is not in Lothlorien.  
• Clue 2: the Stone Castle is either in Malacandra or Lothlorien → therefore the Stone Castle (with the Balrog) must be in Malacandra.  
So Malacandra, Stone Castle, Balrog occupy the only remaining non-edge place: the 3rd.

Step 4.  
Clue 5: Silver Castle < Golden Castle < Balrog(=3rd).  
The only way to fit before the 3rd place is  
Silver Castle = 1st, Golden Castle = 2nd.

Step 5.  
Clue 7: Silver Castle is exactly one land to the left of the Wig; hence Wig = 2nd (right after Silver at 1st).

Step 6.  
Clue 3: the Giant is not at Lothlorien and not with the Wig (2nd).  
The only free castle without the Wig is the 1st, so Giant = 1st.

Step 7.  
Clue 5 also says the Troll isn’t at the Golden Castle (2nd).  
Clue 7 says the Troll isn’t at the Silver Castle (1st).  
With Balrog fixed at the 3rd, the only place left is the 4th → Troll = 4th.

Step 8.  Lands still unassigned: Narnia.  
Clue 1: Narnia is left of Lothlorien (4th) → Narnia must be the only unfilled land, the 2nd.

Step 9.  The only unused castle is Glass, so Glass Castle = 4th.

1st place: Mordor – Silver Castle – Giant  
2nd place: Narnia – Golden Castle – Dragon – (Wig)  
3rd place: Malacandra – Stone Castle – Balrog

Jack  
 1. “All four of us will get different grades.”  ⇒ J, Je, L, P are all distinct.  
 2. “If I get an A then Lucy will get a D.”    ⇒ J = A  →  L = D.

Jean  
 3. “If Lucy gets a C then Jack will get a D.”  ⇒ L = C  →  J = D.

 8. “If Jean doesn’t get a B, I won’t either.”    ⇒ Je ≠ B  →  P ≠ B.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Jack cannot have an A.  
If J = A, rule 2 forces L = D.  
Rule 5 would then need Je = A (to keep its antecedent false), but distinctness forbids Jean from also having A.  
Contradiction ⇒ J ≠ A.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Use rule 5 (“Je ≠ A → J = C”).  

• If J = C, then P must be D (rule 4).  
  But rule 7 would then require P = B (because L would be A), impossible.  
  Hence J ≠ C.  

Contrapositive of rule 5 gives J ≠ C ⇒ Je = A.  
So Jean’s grade is fixed: Je = A.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Determine Jack’s grade.  
With Je = A, J can be B or D (A and C are excluded).

J = D is impossible, because rule 4 demands J > P and nothing is worse than D.  
Therefore J = B.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Assign Lucy and Paul the remaining two grades C and D (still distinct).  
We must satisfy every conditional:

Take L = C, P = D  
 • Rule 3: L = C makes antecedent true, but J must then be D (it is B).  
  Contradiction.  

Therefore the only possible way is L = D, P = C.

Check all statements:

1. Different grades? A, B, C, D all different – yes.  
2. J ≠ A, so rule 2 is automatically true.  
3. L ≠ C, so rule 3 is true.  
4. J = B better than P = C – yes.  
5. Je = A, so antecedent false – rule 5 true.  
6. L ≠ B, so rule 6 true.  
7. L ≠ A, so rule 7 true.  
8. Je ≠ B (true) and P ≠ B (true) – rule 8 holds.

All conditions are satisfied.

 Hint: A couple queens next to each other can cover a lot.",A couple queens next to each other can cover a lot.,"A5, D5, E5, F5, H1 (multiple correct arrangements, check to see that every single position on the board is attacked by at least one queen)",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"We want a set of five squares such that a queen put on each of them attacks (or occupies) every one of the 64 squares of the ordinary 8 × 8 chessboard.  
One convenient way to look for such a set is to try to make every rank, every file and every long diagonal contain at least one of the queens.

Step 1 – put a queen in the lower left corner  
Place Q₁ on A1.  
That single queen immediately covers  

• the whole first rank,  
• the whole A–file, and  
• the long north-east diagonal A1–H8.

Step 2 – cover the eighth rank and the C–file at the same time  
Put Q₂ on C8.  
Now the eighth rank and the C–file are taken care of; Q₂’s south-east diagonal C8–H3 will also be useful later.

Step 3 – cover the sixth rank and the D–file  
Put Q₃ on D6.  
The sixth rank and D–file are now covered, and the diagonal D6–A3 takes care of many squares in the centre.

Step 4 – cover the third rank and the F–file  
Put Q₄ on F3.  
Besides the whole 3rd rank and F–file we also get the diagonal F3–A8 and the short diagonal F3–H1.

Step 5 – cover the fifth rank and the H–file

• Ranks: 1 (Q₁), 2 (columns/diagonals), 3 (Q₄), 4 (columns/diagonals), 5 (Q₅), 6 (Q₃), 7 (diagonals/columns), 8 (Q₂) – all ranks are dominated.  
• Files: A (Q₁), B (diagonals/ranks), C (Q₂), D (Q₃), E (diagonals), F (Q₄), G (diagonals), H (Q₅) – every file is dominated.  
• A systematic square-by-square inspection shows that every single square lies either on the rank, file or diagonal of at least one of the five queens.

237,"Question: You are stuck in a room. All that is there is a slip of paper on a table, and many bottles. The only exit is guarded by a heat sensor that will not let you out. The only way out is to drink one of the bottles' contents, and the liquid will cool down your body heat (with no harm to yourself) enough so that the heat sensor doesn't detect you anymore. There are nine bottles on the ground beyond the table. The content of the slip of paper will tell you what each of the bottles are. Find out what all the bottles are, and then find out which one to drink to get out.
Three of me are poison, and will kill you if you drink.
Two of me are water, nothing bad will happen with these.
Two of me are wine, and it will only get you drunk.
One will heat you up forever, and this room will never let you out. (hinder)
Only one here will help you, it will cool down your body heat.
No medium bottles are poison.
Wine is bad in large doses, so none are large.
Each of the end bottles have the same contents.
No matter how help hides, it will be on poison's left side, but its left side is safe.
No two small bottles are the same.
The hinderer is harder, for it resides between wine and water.
The hinder bottle is large, so it works forever.
Neither big nor medium will save your life.
Poison is all you will get from the bottle on the far right.
Water is next to the helper.

 Hint: Use the fact that help must be small. ",Use the fact that help must be small. ,"Poison--wine--hinder--water--help--poison--wine--water--poison
Only the middle bottle will save your life.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Reasoning step-by-step

Let the nine bottles be numbered 1–9 from left to right.  
According to the statement their sizes are

1 L 2 S 3 L 4 M 5 S 6 L 7 M 8 L 9 S  (L = large, M = medium, S = small)

Symbols for contents  
P = poison W = water V = wine H = hinder (heats) C = help (cools)

Facts translated into constraints
1. 3 P, 2 W, 2 V, 1 H, 1 C altogether.
2. No medium bottle is poison → bottles 4, 7 ≠ P.
3. No large bottle is wine.
4. Bottles 1 and 9 are identical.
5. Help is immediately to the left of a poison bottle, and the bottle on help’s left is not poison (safe).
6. Help is small (hint) → help is bottle 2, 5 or 9.
7. The three small bottles must all be different.
8. The hinder bottle is large and stands between a wine and a water bottle.
9. Water is next to the help.
10. “Poison is all you will get from the bottle on the far right” → bottle 9 = P.

Step 1.  From (4) and (10): bottle 1 = bottle 9 = P.  
We already have two of the three required poisons.

Step 2.  Help cannot be bottle 2, because its left neighbour (1) would be poison, contradicting (5).  
Help cannot be bottle 9 (it is poison).  
Therefore help must be bottle 5 (C).  
Then by (5) bottle 6 = P (the third poison) and bottle 4 is “safe”, i.e. not poison.

Current state
1 P 2 ? 3 ? 4 ? 5 C 6 P 7 ? 8 ? 9 P

Step 3.  The hinder bottle is large and must stand between wine and water.  
Only the large bottles with two neighbours (3 or 8) can do that.  
Bottle 8 cannot be H, because its right neighbour (9) is P, not W or V.  
Therefore bottle 3 = H, with bottles 2 and 4 being (in some order) V and W.

Step 4.  Water must be next to the help (rule 9).  
The only neighbour of bottle 5 that is not poison is bottle 4, so bottle 4 = W.  
Consequently bottle 2 = V.

Step 5.  We still need one more water and one more wine.  
The remaining undecided positions are 7 (M) and 8 (L).  
Wine cannot be large, so bottle 7 = V and bottle 8 = W.

Step 6.  Check all conditions: they are satisfied.

Final list of bottles
1. Large – Poison  
2. Small – Wine  
3. Large – Hinder (heats)  
4. Medium – Water  
5. Small – Help (cools) ← drink this one  
6. Large – Poison  
7. Medium – Wine  
8. Large – Water  
9. Small – Poison

You also know that a, b, c have the values 0, 1 and 2, but not necessarily in that order.
But to make matters more complicated the symbols + - * / have been mixed up: all you know is that each represents a different arithmetical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division).
Can you work out the values of a, b and c, and what each of the symbols actually mean?
 Hint: The only thing you should assume about the arithmetical symbols is that no two represent the same operation.",The only thing you should assume about the arithmetical symbols is that no two represent the same operation.,"a = 1
b = 2
c = 0

- = *
* = +
/ = /
(Yes, the division symbol escaped the bedlam!)",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

a, b, c  be a rearrangement of 0, 1, 2 (all different), and  
“+ – * /” each stand for a different one of the four ordinary operations.

Write the ordinary operation represented by each symbol as  

+ → P  – → M  * → S  / → D

so that the four given relations become  

(1) a P c = a  
(2) b M c = c  
(3) c D b = c  
(4) a S a = b  

Step 1.  Analyse (4): a S a = b.  
Try each possible operation for S and see whether a and b can be distinct members of {0,1,2}.

• S = + : a+a = b.  
 a=1 gives b=2 (distinct and within {0,1,2}).  
 a=0 gives b=0 (duplicate) and a=2 gives b=4 (not allowed).  
 So the only viable case with S = + is a=1, b=2.

• S = −, ×, ÷ : a−a=0, a×a∈{0,1,4}, a÷a=1;  
 all of these force b to equal a or to be 4, so none work with distinct 0,1,2.

Therefore  
a = 1, b = 2, c = 0, and * (S) must be ordinary addition.

Step 2.  Use a=1, c=0 in (1): a P c = a ⇒ 1 P 0 = 1.  
The ordinary operations that satisfy x ∘ 0 = x are + and −.  
But + is already taken by “*”, so P must be ordinary subtraction.  
Thus “+” represents subtraction.

Step 3.  Use b=2, c=0 in (2): b M c = c ⇒ 2 M 0 = 0.  
The only remaining unused operations are × and ÷;  
2×0 = 0 works but 2÷0 is undefined.  
Hence M is ordinary multiplication, so “−” represents multiplication.

Step 4.  The only operation not yet assigned is division, so  
“/” must stand for ordinary division.  
Check (3): c D b = c ⇒ 0 ÷ 2 = 0 – true.

All four equations now hold:

a + c  (1−0)  = 1  
b − c  (2×0)  = 0  
c / b  (0÷2)  = 0  
a * a  (1+1)  = 2

Everything is consistent and each symbol denotes a different operation.

239,"Question: You are in a game show with four other contestants.  The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues, and the first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no leading zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. The third set of two numbers is the same as the first set reversed.
2. There are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the combination.
3. If you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers, you will get the fourth set of numbers.
4. If you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.
5. The second set of numbers is not greater than 20.
6. The second number in the second set multiplied by the second number in the fourth set equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.
And get moving, I think another contestant has almost figured it out!
 Hint: Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.","Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.","The combination is 71-19-17-68.
From the second clue, we know that there are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the sets.  Therefore, only 1's, 6's, 7's, 8's and 9's could be in the remaining spots.
Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.
11 * 4 = 44
16 * 4 = 64
17 * 4 = 68
18 * 4 = 72
19 * 4 = 76
Of these, 17 * 4 and 19 * 4 are the only ones that are possible; as the answer of the other numbers contains a number which we know is not in the combination.
Now we skip all the way to clue 5, which tells us the second set of numbers is not greater than 20.  This means that the first digit of that set is also a 1.
So far, we know this much:
??-1?-1?-??
Now, we can come to clue 4, which tells us if you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.  The first number in the second set is 1, so the first number in the first set must be 7.  Since the first clue tells us the first set is the third set reversed, and we know that a 1 is the first number in the third set, a 1 must be the second number in the first set and a 7 must be the second number in the third set.
So far, we know this much:
71-1?-17-??
Now, the third set (17) multiplied by 4 will get us 68.  Now we know the fourth set is 68.
71-1?-17-68
Now we come to the final clue.  This tells us the second number in the second set (unknown) multiplied by the second number in the fourth set (8) equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.  We know that the first set is 71, so adding one to that (72) and then dividing it by 8 will get us 9.  So, the finished combination is:
71-19-17-68",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the four two–digit parts of the combination be  

AB-CD-EF-GH  

where A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H are individual digits.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 Use clue 1  
“The third set is the first set reversed”  
⇒ EF = BA  (i.e. E = B, F = A)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 Use clue 3 together with the hint  
“4 × (third set) = fourth set” and “the first digit of the third set is 1”  
⇒ E = 1, so EF is one of 10, 11, 12, … 19.

Because no digits 2, 3, 4, 5 are allowed (clue 2), EF may only be  
10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Compute 4 × EF and discard any product that contains 2, 3, 4, 5 as a digit:

 EF = 10 → 40 (invalid, has 4)  
 EF = 11 → 44 (invalid, has 4)  
 EF = 16 → 64 (invalid, has 4)  
 EF = 17 → 68 (valid)  
 EF = 18 → 72 (invalid, has 2)  
 EF = 19 → 76 (valid)

So two possibilities remain:  

 EF = 17, GH = 68  
 EF = 19, GH = 76

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 Translate EF into the first set by clue 1  
EF = BA implies

 • If EF = 17  ⇒  AB = 71  
 • If EF = 19  ⇒  AB = 91

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 Use clue 6  
“The second number in the second set multiplied by the second number in the fourth set equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.”

That is, D × H = (two-digit number AB) + 1.

Case A AB = 71, GH = 68  → H = 8  
 Need D × 8 = 71 + 1 = 72 ⇒ D = 9  (allowed)

Case B AB = 91, GH = 76  → H = 6  
 Need D × 6 = 91 + 1 = 92 ⇒ D = 92/6 is not an integer ⇒ impossible.

Hence only Case A survives:

 AB = 71, EF = 17, GH = 68, D = 9.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5 Use clue 4  
“The first number in the first set plus the first number in the second set equals 8.”

A = 7, so C must satisfy 7 + C = 8 ⇒ C = 1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 6 Check clue 5  
“The second set is not greater than 20.”

Second set CD = 19, which is ≤ 20, so it fits.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 7 Verify all clues

• Combination so far: 71-19-17-68.  
• Digits present: 0? no, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9 only → satisfies clue 2.  
• 3rd set 17 is 1st set 71 reversed → clue 1 ok.  
• 4 × 17 = 68 → clue 3 ok.  
• 7 + 1 = 8 → clue 4 ok.  
• 19 ≤ 20 → clue 5 ok.  
• 9 × 8 = 72 = 71 + 1 → clue 6 ok.

The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.
In this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Los Angeles hosted the first two games.  The final scores of the games were:
Game 1:  4 to 3
Game 2:  6 to 5 (11 innings)

Game 4:  16 to 9
Game 5:  9 to 6 (10 innings)
Game 6:  2 to 1
Game 7:  13 to 8 (13 innings)
Which team won the World Series?
 Hint: In baseball, the home team bats last.  ","In baseball, the home team bats last.  ","Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.  It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.
The team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.  New York scored five runs in the top of the 13th inning.
Therefore, the New York Yankees won the World Series, four games to three.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let NY = New York Yankees and LA = Los Angeles Dodgers.

1. Home-field pattern  
   • Games 1, 2, 6, 7 were played in Los Angeles (LA is the home team).  
   • Games 3, 4, 5 were played in New York (NY is the home team).

2. What “home team bats last” means in extra-inning games  
   • If the HOME team wins in the bottom of an extra inning, the game stops the instant the winning run scores.  
     Therefore the winning margin can be 1, 2, 3 or 4 runs (a walk-off single, double, triple or grand slam).  
     It can never be 5 or more runs.  
   • If the VISITING team wins, it scores in the top half of the inning and the home team fails to tie or pass the visitor in the bottom half.  
     In that case the final margin can be any positive number (1, 2, …).

3. Look at the only game whose result forces the winner  
   Game 7 (played in Los Angeles) ended 13–8 in 13 innings – a 5-run difference.  
   A 5-run margin in an extra-inning game is impossible for the home team; it can happen only if the visiting team scores those runs in the top of the inning and the home team then fails to catch up.

   Therefore the VISITING team won Game 7.  
   The visiting team in Game 7 was New York.

4. Consequence for the Series

b) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.
c) One of the groups contains only married couples.
d) The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.
e) One of the groups contains 8 times as many people who are younger than 50 as those who are at least 50 years old.
 Hint: Set up an equation.",Set up an equation.,"The first thing is to make this question an equation. The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then ¼(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then ¼(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation ¼(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.
If c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since ""couples"" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.
o+8o=9o.
So 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even. So, group x consists of 72 people and y consists of 14 people.

2.  Statement (c):  “One of the groups contains only married couples.”

That group must have an even number of people, so at least one group is even.  
Because x + y = 86 is even, x and y have the same parity.  
Hence x must be even (otherwise both would be odd and no group would be even).

Row 1:    A  
Row 2:   B  C  
Row 3:  D  E  F

(All letters stand for different digits 0–9.)

The clues translate into these equations/conditions.

1.  A – G = 7.              (1)  
2.  E – F = 4.              (2)  
3.  G + H + I + J = 8.          (3)

5.  A + C + F + J = 25.         (5)  
6.  1 is not adjacent to 2.  

The hint gives A = 9.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Find G using (1).  
9 – G = 7 ⇒ G = 2.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Work on the bottom row with (3).  
We need three different digits whose sum with 2 is 8, i.e. H + I + J = 6.  
Among the digits {0,1,3,4,5,6,7,8} the only way to get 6 with three distinct
digits is {0,1,5}.  
So {H,I,J} = {0,1,5}.  
Because 1 must not be next to 2 and 2 sits at G,  
H cannot be 1 (H is adjacent to G).  
Thus the four possibilities reduce to

 (A) H = 0, I = 1, J = 5   (B) H = 0, I = 5, J = 1  
 (C) H = 5, I = 0, J = 1   (D) H = 5, I = 1, J = 0

-------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Use (5): C + F + J = 16.

Case (A) : J = 5 → C + F = 11  
Case (B) : J = 1 → C + F = 15  
Case (C) : J = 1 → C + F = 15  
Case (D) : J = 0 → C + F = 16  

-------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Bring in (4): C = B + 1, and (2): E = F + 4.  
All unused digits so far are {3,4,6,7,8}.  
Search each case:

• Case (A) C + F = 11 with digits {3,4,6,7,8}  
 Possible (C,F) pairs: (7,4) or (4,7).  
 Take (C,F) = (7,4): then B = 6 and E = 8.  
 The remaining unused digit is 3 → D = 3.  
 All digits 0–9 are now used once and every clue is satisfied.

 Take (C,F) = (4,7): then B = 3, E = 11 (impossible).  
 So only (C,F) = (7,4) works.

• Case (B) C + F = 15 → only {7,8}.  
 (C,F) could be (7,8) or (8,7); both fail because  
 E = F + 4 would be 12 or duplicates a digit.

• Case (C) identical to (B) — fails.

• Case (D) C + F = 16 has no solution with the available digits.

Therefore the unique viable assignment is the one found in case (A):

A = 9  
B = 6 C = 7  
D = 3 E = 8 F = 4  
G = 2 H = 0 I = 1 J = 5

-------------------------------------------------
Step 5.  Final checks  
• A – G = 9 – 2 = 7 ✔  
• E – F = 8 – 4 = 4 ✔  
• Bottom row 2+0+1+5 = 8 ✔  
• C – B = 7 – 6 = 1 ✔  
• Rightmost-column sum 9+7+4+5 = 25 ✔  
• 1 (at I) is not adjacent to 2 (at G) ✔  

All clues are satisfied and every digit 0-9 appears exactly once.

245,"Question: The answer I give is yes, but what I mean is no.
What was the question?
 Hint: nan",,Do you mind?,GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1.  We need a question for which an audible/explicit answer of “yes” must in fact convey the opposite, i.e. “no”.

2.  That can only happen if the act of answering “yes” itself proves that the factual situation described in the question is false.

3.  Consider the question “Are you asleep?”  
    •  If a person really were asleep, they could not speak.  
    •  Therefore any spoken reply means the speaker is not asleep.  
    •  If they answer “Yes,” the literal word is an affirmation, but its very utterance proves the correct factual answer is “No.”

4.  This exactly matches the riddle statement:  
       “The answer I give is yes, but what I mean is no.”

5.  The hint “nan” can be read as “nap” (sleep) with its middle letter changed, steering us toward the idea of sleeping.

247,"Question: You are a spy trying to gain access to a high profile building that contains very classified information. The only thing standing between you and those secrets is a keypunch security system containing the digits 1-9 that will open the door to the building. Your spy agency has provided you details about the order of the keys you need to enter:
1. Each digit is pressed once and only once.
2. No two consecutive digits are pressed consecutively.
3. The digits 2 and 4 are pressed 2nd and 4th in some order; the digits 6 and 8 are pressed 6th and 8th in some order.
4. The sum of the first 5 digits pressed is 19; the sum of the last 5 digits pressed is 27.
As you wonder why your agency couldn't just write down the sequence for you, you crack the code and enter the building.
What sequence of keys did you press on the security system to get into the building?
 Hint: You can figure out the 5th digit to enter from clue 4 and some algebra.",You can figure out the 5th digit to enter from clue 4 and some algebra.,"5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 3, 6, 9
From  clue 4, the sum of the first 4 digits to be pressed, the last 4 digits to be pressed, and two times the 5th digit to be pressed is 19 + 27 = 46. The sum of the first and last 4 digits to be pressed and the 5th digit must be the sum of the digits 1-9, from clue 1. This sum is 45, meaning the 5th digit is 46-45 = 1.
From clues 2 and 3, 2 must be the 2nd digit and 4 must be the 4th digit.
From clue 3, 7 must be the 1st or 3rd digit pressed since it can not be pressed before or after the 6 or 8. From clue 4, this means 5 must be pressed 1st or 3rd. But, from clue 2, it can not be the 3rd digit, so it must be the first, meaning 7 is the 3rd digit pressed.
That leaves 3, 6, 8, and 9 as the last 4 digits to be pressed. If 8 were pressed 8th, then the 9 must be pressed 6th, a contradiction with clue 4. So 8 must be pressed 6th meaning 9 is to be pressed last. This leaves 6 to be entered 8th and 3 to be entered 7th.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the nine pressed digits be  

p₁ p₂ p₃ p₄ p₅ p₆ p₇ p₈ p₉  (position 1 through 9).

1.  Algebra from the two sum conditions  
   • p₁+p₂+p₃+p₄+p₅ = 19  
   • p₅+p₆+p₇+p₈+p₉ = 27  
   Add them: (sum of all nine digits) + p₅ = 46.  
   But 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45, so p₅ = 1.  

2.  Fix the special positions  
   • {p₂ , p₄} = {2 , 4}  
   • {p₆ , p₈} = {6 , 8}

3.  Finish the first-five-digits sum  
   p₁ + p₂ + p₃ + p₄ = 18.  
   Because p₂+p₄ = 2+4 = 6, we need p₁+p₃ = 12.  
   Only two pairs of distinct available digits sum to 12: {3,9} and {5,7}.

   • The pair {3,9} is impossible: no matter how 3 and 9 are placed, either
     (3,2) or (3,4) or (2,3) or (4,3) becomes an adjacent consecutive pair,
     violating rule 2.

   • Therefore {p₁ , p₃} = {5 , 7}.

4.  Sum of the last four unknown positions  
   p₆+p₇+p₈+p₉ must be 26.  
   Since p₆ and p₈ are 6 and 8, their sum is 14, so p₇+p₉ = 12.  
   The remaining unused digits are {3,9}; conveniently, 3+9 = 12, so  
   {p₇ , p₉} = {3 , 9}.

5.  Keep 8 away from 9  
   If p₆ = 6 and p₈ = 8, the 8 in position 8 would be adjacent to both
   positions 7 and 9, one of which must contain 9—impossible.  
   Hence p₆ = 8 and p₈ = 6, forcing p₇ = 3 and p₉ = 9 to avoid 8-next-to-9.

6.  Choose the only first-half order that avoids consecutive neighbours  
   We still have to order 5 & 7 (positions 1 & 3) and 2 & 4 (positions 2 & 4)
   so that no consecutive numbers touch.  A quick check of the four possible
   orders shows that the sole acceptable arrangement is

   p₁ = 5 , p₂ = 2 , p₃ = 7 , p₄ = 4.

7.  Assemble the whole sequence  
   5  2  7  4  1  8  3  6  9

   Adjacent pairs: (5,2), (2,7), (7,4), (4,1), (1,8), (8,3), (3,6), (6,9);
   none are consecutive integers.  All other requirements are met:

   • digits 2 & 4 are 2nd and 4th; digits 6 & 8 are 6th and 8th.  
   • first-five sum = 5+2+7+4+1 = 19.  
   • last-five sum  = 1+8+3+6+9 = 27.  
   • every digit 1–9 appears exactly once.
