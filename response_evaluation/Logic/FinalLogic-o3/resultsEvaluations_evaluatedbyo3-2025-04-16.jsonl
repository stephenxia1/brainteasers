{"ID": 4, "Question": "Typical \"stars\" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).\nGiven the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?", "Hint": "It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.", "Human Solution": "199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199.

{"ID": 5, "Question": "I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)\nI was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, \"I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.\nNow I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:\n1. The king is next to at least one diamond.\n2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.\n3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.\n4. The ten is next to at least one club.\n5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.\n6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.\n7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.\n8. My ace is not the card on the far left.\"\nThere was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, \"I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!\"\nThe other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.\nWhich suit is it?", "Hint": "The first step is to determine where the ace goes.\nAlso, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?", "Human Solution": "The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):\nX X Q X A\nX X X H X\nAt least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):\nK J Q T A\nX D X H X\nNow we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?\nI held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.\nBut which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.\nTherefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.\nTherefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.

Impossible.\n\n\u2022 If the ace were at an end, it would have one heart neighbour; the second\n  heart would have to be elsewhere, but then the queen cannot arrange to have\n  exactly one heart neighbour without standing next to both hearts.\n  Impossible again.\n\nTherefore X \u2260 H; hearts occur exactly once.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nD.

Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7).

Consider where the Blends smoker can be (clues 10 & 15):  \n    \u2013 If Blends were in 1 or 5 it would have only one neighbour, who would have to have both cats and water, which is impossible for 5 (coffee) and for 1 (Dunhill already fixes neighbour\u2019s horse).  \n    \u21d2 Blends must be in 2, 3, or 4.\n\n12.

Bluemasters must therefore be in the only house still free for both cigar and drink pairing: House 5.  \n    \u21d2 House 5 smokes Bluemasters and drinks beer (clue 12).\n\n17.  Cigars left to place in Houses 3 and 4 are Pall Mall and Prince.  \n    \u2022 If House 3 smoked Prince, its owner would have to be German (clue 13) but House 3 is already the Brit, impossible.  \n    \u21d2 House 3 smokes Pall Mall and keeps birds (clue 6).  \n    \u21d2 House 4 smokes Prince and is the German (clue 13).\n\n18.

{"ID": 20, "Question": "The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?", "Hint": "Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.", "Human Solution": "Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car.

{"ID": 22, "Question": "The Situation:\nThere is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:\nIn the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).\nThe monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: \"white\" or \"black\". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right.

Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.\nIf [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.

{"ID": 37, "Question": "On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.\nOf the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.\nEach night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.\nNow, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:\n\"I see a person with blue eyes.\"\nWho leaves the island? And when do they leave?", "Hint": "What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?", "Human Solution": "All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people.

{"ID": 41, "Question": "In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.\nHow many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)", "Hint": "The number of days depends on the number of red hats.", "Human Solution": "It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nHow this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nIf there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Let R be the number of red-hatted dwarves present that first night (1 \u2264 R \u2264 99 because there is at least one blue hat).  \n\nInduction argument (the same one used in the classical \u201cblue-eyed islander\u201d puzzle).\n\n1.

E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.\nLet's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4.

So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.\nIf I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.\nThis means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4.

Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.\nCompany A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, \"Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.\"  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.

Company B really did need a million dollars to make a profit on such a dangerous job, so at first he truthfully told the Emperor that he \u201ccould not do it for less than $1 000 000\u201d.  \n\n2.  He realised, however, that the Emperor hesitated because another firm had quoted only $800 000.  \n   The Emperor wanted the bridge but he also wanted to feel safe from being over-charged.\n\n3.  So B framed the price in a different way.  \n   He said: \u201cI\u2019ll build the whole bridge exactly to the specifications you gave both firms.  \n   When I am finished you \u2013 and you alone \u2013 may decide what the work was worth and pay me\n\n        \u2022 $200 000 if you think the work is poor,  \n        \u2022 $750 000 if you think it is merely acceptable, or  \n        \u2022 $1 000 000 if you think it is excellent.\u201d\n\n   In other words all the risk lay on B\u2019s shoulders and all the power of decision lay with the Emperor.  \n   From the Emperor\u2019s point of view that was an \u201coffer he could not refuse\u201d: he could always pay less\n   than Company A\u2019s $800 000 if he felt disappointed.\n\n4.  Contractor B then built an outstanding bridge \u2013 on time, on budget, beautifully finished and strong\n    enough for heavy vehicles.  \n\n5.  At the end the Emperor had to choose a payment.  \n    \u2013 Paying only $200 000 would have been blatantly unfair.  \n    \u2013 Paying $750 000 would still have meant under-paying a man who had taken a big risk and had succeeded brilliantly, and it would have broadcast to every other potential investor that the ruler of the islands\n      was willing to short-change honest contractors.  \n    \u2013 Paying the full $1 000 000 was the only honest choice and the best advertisement for the islands\u2019 new, fair-dealing image.\n\n6.  Because the Emperor was a fair and forward-looking ruler, he paid the million dollars.  \n    Contractor B had neither lied nor cheated; he had simply relied on the Emperor\u2019s integrity and on the\n    value the Emperor put on his own reputation.\n\nThus the offer sounded irresistible because the Emperor seemed to hold all the cards, and Company B ended up with the highest amount because the Emperor, after seeing the finished product and thinking about his reputation, voluntarily chose to pay the full $1 000 000.\n\nFinal answer: Company B let the Emperor choose the payment after the bridge was finished ($200 000 if poor, $750 000 if merely adequate, $1 000 000 if excellent).  The risk-free offer sounded perfect, the bridge turned out superb, and the fair-minded Emperor paid the full $1 000 000, so B got the highest amount without any deceit at all.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 61, "Question": "In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.\nThe pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies.

{"ID": 63, "Question": "The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:\n[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.\n[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.\n[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.\n[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.\n[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.\nThe Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).\nBased on this information, which of these statements is accurate?\n1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.\n2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.\n3. The World Series winner is uncertain.\nThe bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.", "Hint": ": In baseball, the points are called \"runs,\" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.", "Human Solution": "The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.\n[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.\n[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying \"there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.\"\n[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:\nPrime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]\nSquare - 0,4,9 [2 games each]\nNeither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]\nSince all of the \"neither prime nor square\" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 \"prime or square\" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.\n[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.\nWe now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd.

Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.

Subtract 5 from 45, leaving 40.  Divide 40 by 2, leaving 20.  20 does not equal 14, so the sum of each group can not be 14.

The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.\nThe Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?", "Hint": "Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way.

One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes.

{"ID": 111, "Question": "Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.\nUnfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.\nBut in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.\nBut this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.\nBut the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.\nUnfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.\nLet's sum up the assumptions:\n1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.\n2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.\n3. The flower doesn't want to die.\n4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.\n5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.\n6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n7. The dog is rational.\n8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.\n9. The dog doesn't want to die.\n10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).\n11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.\n13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.\n14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.\n15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.\nSo now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?", "Hint": " 1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.\nHint 2:\nSince the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.", "Human Solution": "The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)\nBut why will the dog eat the flower?\n1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die\n2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.\n3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.\n4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.\n5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.\n6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.\n7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison\nOK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11).

Formalising the situation\n\u2022 Two players:  the dog (D) and the flower (F).  \n\u2022 F has a costly action P (\u201cproduce poison\u201d) or \u00acP (\u201cdo not produce poison\u201d).  \n  \u2013 Producing poison keeps F alive whatever D later does, but costs it an effort-cost c>0.  \n  \u2013 Not producing poison costs nothing, but if D subsequently eats the flower, F dies.  \n\u2022 After F\u2019s (unobservable) choice, D chooses Eat or \u00acEat.  \n  \u2013 If D eats and the flower is un-poisoned, D surely recovers (pay-off 1).  \n  \u2013 If D eats and the flower is poisoned, D surely dies (pay-off 0).  \n  \u2013 If D does not eat it lives with probability \u00bd (expected pay-off 0.5).  \n\u2022 Common knowledge: both players are perfectly rational and everything in the list\n  1\u201315 of the statement is common knowledge.\n\nB.  The flower\u2019s best-response rule\nGiven any positive probability q that the dog might eat,\n  \u2013 Expected survival if F does NOT poison: 1\u2013q  \n  \u2013 Expected survival if F DOES poison: 1\u2013c  \nHence F prefers to poison whenever q>c.  Because c is merely \u201csome effort\u201d, F will poison\nas soon as it is not absolutely certain (q=0) that the dog will refrain from eating.\n\nC.  Can the flower be absolutely certain that the dog will not eat?\nNo.  There is no communication, no visible commitment, no physical impossibility that\nprevents the dog from choosing Eat.  All F can do is reason about D\u2019s rationality, but\npure reasoning cannot give a probability q=0; \u201cthe dog must not want to eat\u201d is not a\nlogical necessity, merely a strategic consideration.  Hence from F\u2019s point of view\nq>0, so F\u2019s rational move is to produce poison.\n\nD.  The dog\u2019s best response to that knowledge\nThe dog knows every item above, in particular:\n  \u2013 It knows the flower will reason exactly as in B and therefore will in fact poison.\nTherefore the dog evaluates its options:\n  \u2022 Eat \u2192 death with certainty (pay-off 0).  \n  \u2022 Do not eat \u2192 survival probability \u00bd (pay-off 0.5).  \nSince 0.5 > 0, a rational dog chooses \u00acEat.\n\nE.  Consistency (equilibrium check)\nGiven D\u2019s choice \u00acEat, F is still happy with its decision to poison: producing the\npoison costs c but guarantees survival (1\u2013c), while skipping the poison would expose\nit to the still-positive risk that D might deviate and eat (yield 1\u2013q with q>0).  Hence\npoisoning remains its best move.  The strategy pair\n\u2003\u2003(F: P,\u2003D: \u00acEat)\nis therefore a Nash equilibrium.\n\nConclusion\nBecause the flower will rationally manufacture poison (to eliminate even the slightest\nchance of being eaten), the dog realises that eating would be fatal and therefore opts\nnot to eat.\n\nFinal answer: the dog will not eat the flower.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.\n**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.\n**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.\n**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.\n*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

We know that three of the chapters are, in this order, (Sense, Alex's, Descartes).

We know that \"Jung\" comes before Toby's chapter.  This leaves chapters 1 and 4.  If \"Jung\" is chapter 4, Toby's would be 5, but we know that 5 is Kiera's, so \"Jung\" has to be chapter 1.  This makes \"Kant\" chapter 4, and Alex's chapter.  This means that Joans has to be the 3rd or the 5th because of the order between Joan's chapter and \"Kant\" that we were already given, and we already know that Kiera has the 5th chapter.

{"ID": 148, "Question": "There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin.

First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.\nNow let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other.

If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.\nSince there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.\nSince there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.\nFact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son. Therefore, the siblings in rooms A and C must be HEF Jr. and his sister, and one of them must be the lead actor.

The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.\nThe lions are special:\n1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.\n2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).\n3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.\n4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.\nNow, here's the kicker:\n5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).\n6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).\nAssumptions:\n1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.\n2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.\n3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.\nSo now the question:\nWill that one sheep get eaten or not and why?", "Hint": "There are two hints.

Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.\nNow look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.\nSo now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.\nWe can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.\nYou can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Step-by-step reasoning (backward induction)\n\nNotation  \nS(N) = \u201ca situation with N lions and 1 sheep\u201d\n\nGoal  \nFor every N decide whether the sheep is safe (no lion will touch it) or doomed (some lion will certainly eat it).  \nA lion will eat the sheep only when he can prove that doing so will not later cause him to be eaten after he turns into a sheep.\n\nBase cases  \nN = 0\u2003(0 lions)\u2003The sheep is obviously safe.  \nN = 1\u2003(1 lion)\u2003If the lion eats the sheep he becomes a sheep but there will then be 0 lions, so he cannot be eaten.  \n\u2003\u2003=> In S(1) the lone lion does eat the sheep.

However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.\n25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.

With B\u2082 = 1 only two choices exist: 11 or 21.\n\n   \u2013 If 2nd set = 11, then 4\u00d711 = 44, hence the 4th set reversed is 44 and\n     the 4th set itself is 44.  But the 4th set must contain the only 8.\n     \u21d2 11 impossible.\n\n   \u2013 Therefore 2nd set = 21.  \n     Clue 4 then gives 4\u00d721 = 84, so the reversed 4th set is 84 and the 4th\n     set itself is 48, which indeed contains exactly one 8.\n\n\u2022 Collect all digits now present:\n  39 \u2013 21 \u2013 66 \u2013 48  uses 1,2,3,4,6,8,9 exactly once each; 5 and 7 are absent.\n  Every clue is satisfied, and no set exceeds 90.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFinal answer: 39-21-66-48", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}
{"ID": 190, "Question": "A warden at a prison decides to give some prisoners a chance to escape by working together to solve a puzzle.

The prisoners will get a chance to discuss a strategy together, which they will all follow, then they will be marched out into a large room where they will see everybody else's hat color. Each prisoner will then simultaneously guess which of the two hat colors they have. If every one of them is right, or every one of them is wrong, they will all go free. However, the prisoners will not be allowed to communicate in any way during this process. Also, the warden will hear their strategy and place hats any way he can to prevent them from going free.

They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.\nYou quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.

The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.\nIn this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.

It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.\nThe team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.

{"ID": 242, "Question": "A tourist group of 86 people broke up into two groups. The smaller group went to the beach, and the bigger group went to see a water mill.

The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then \u00bc(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then \u00bc(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation \u00bc(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.\nIf c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since \"couples\" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.\no+8o=9o.\nSo 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even.

{"ID": 4, "Question": "Typical \"stars\" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).\nGiven the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?", "Hint": "It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.", "Human Solution": "199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make.

This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nLeonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow\nHoward's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Howard \u2013 10th-level Halfling thief, armed with a dagger, expert against kobolds  \nLeonard \u2013 16th-level Hobbit merchant, armed with a crossbow, expert against orcs  \nPenny \u2013 20th-level Elf archbishop, armed with a bolo, expert against chimeras  \nRaj \u2013 32nd-level Gremlin sorcerer, hurls fireballs, expert against giants  \nSheldon \u2013 24th-level Ogre paladin, brandishes a mace, expert against harpies  \n\nFinal answer: Howard 10 Halfling Thief Dagger Kobolds; Leonard 16 Hobbit Merchant Crossbow Orcs; Penny 20 Elf Archbishop Bolo Chimeras; Raj 32 Gremlin Sorcerer Fireballs Giants; Sheldon 24 Ogre Paladin Mace Harpies", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}
{"ID": 7, "Question": "Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.\nHere, you are approached by three gods and their herald.\nProblem\nOn the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.\nFirst, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.\nSecond, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.\nFinally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.\nWith your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?", "Hint": "Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?", "Human Solution": "First, ask the god standing in the middle, \"If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?\"\nBy phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (\"would you say ja?\") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.\nIf the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.\nSimilarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.\nThe next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, \"If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?\" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: \"no I would not say yes,\" even though he would; or \"yes I would say no,\" even though he wouldn't.)\nFinally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, \"If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?\" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified).

{"ID": 8, "Question": "Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.\n1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well.

The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.\n3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.\n4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.\n5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip.

{"ID": 20, "Question": "The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?", "Hint": "Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.", "Human Solution": "Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.\nDetective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.\nA prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.\nMr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Let the two illuminated cars be  \n\n\u2003D\u2003= dining-car\u2003\u2003\u2003P\u2003= passenger-car  \n\nand list the ten surviving passengers\n\n\u2003Ms. S, Mr. G, Mr. J, Ms. L, Mr. F, Mr. R, Mr. Q, Ms. P, Mr. K, Ms. W .\n\nThe victim is an eleventh passenger whose sex is not stated.\n\nStep 1 \u2013 consequences that follow from nine of the ten statements  \n(we do not yet decide which one will be false).\n\n\u2022 Ms S: \u201cI was dining with Mr J.\u201d\u2003\u21d2\u2003S, J are in D.

{"ID": 22, "Question": "The Situation:\nThere is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:\nIn the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).\nThe monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: \"white\" or \"black\". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.\nThe monster gives them the whole night to think.\nThe Task:\nDevise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.\nAssumptions:\n1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.\n2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.\n3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional \"white\" or \"black\".\n4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words.

This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.\nLet us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says \"white\". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it.

Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate.

{"ID": 37, "Question": "On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.\nOf the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.\nEach night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.\nNow, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:\n\"I see a person with blue eyes.\"\nWho leaves the island? And when do they leave?", "Hint": "What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?", "Human Solution": "All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you.

Thus after night 100 he still cannot rule either possibility out; in particular he is not yet certain that his own eyes are brown. Because no further public information is ever supplied, no brown-eyed islander will ever become absolutely certain of his own eye colour, so none of them will ever risk an answer.\n\nConclusion  \nExactly the 100 blue-eyed islanders leave, all together, on the 100th night after the guru\u2019s statement; the 100 brown-eyed islanders (and the green-eyed guru) remain behind forever.\n\nFinal answer: The 100 blue-eyed islanders all leave together on the 100th night; no one else ever leaves.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.\nHow many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party?

Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nIf there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat.

{"ID": 43, "Question": "In Numberrangements, you are given an arrangement of letters. The letters represent all of the whole numbers from 1 to the total number of letters used.

The sum of B and G is equal to H.\n5. I is not 1.", "Hint": "Start with casework on clue 2.", "Human Solution": "A=7, B=1, C=9\nD=6, E=2, F=8\nG=4, H=5, I=3\nFrom Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.\nLet's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.\nIf I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.\nThis means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.\nThis leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6.

The handsome-neighbour condition (Buster Artery)\n\n\u201cBuster Artery is the only man standing next to exactly one handsome\nman.\u201d  \nSo B has exactly one handsome neighbour, while each of A, C, D has\neither 0 or 2 handsome neighbours (never exactly 1).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n4.  Put Buster at the left end\n\nIf B were in an interior place, at least one end\u2013man would\nalso have exactly one handsome neighbour (he has only one neighbour),\ncontradicting the uniqueness of B.  \nHence B is at an end; call it place 1.\n\n          B(1) \u2013 A(2) \u2013 3 \u2013 4\n\nBecause B has exactly one handsome neighbour, A is handsome (H).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n5.

{"ID": 57, "Question": "There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.\nHe decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.\nCompany A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, \"Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.\"  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.\nWhy did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?", "Hint": "2 Hints:\n1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.\n2. Use your math and accounting skills", "Human Solution": "Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.\nEach company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full \u00be pay for \u00be of a bridge ($750,000).\nWhen Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.  They figured it was not worth the $200,000 to start even building since it was so dangerous and immediately backed out, forcing the Emperor to pay Company B their full asking price of $1,000,000.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Company B did not come back with three different bids for the very same bridge.  \nHe came back with one contract that contained three completely different\narrangements, all of them spelled out in detail and all of them perfectly fair and\nabove-board.\n\n\u2022 Pay \\$200 000 \u2013 Company B will put up a bare-bones, one-lane structure, but\n  the bridge will belong to Company B, which will have the right to charge and\n  keep every cent of the tolls for as long as the bridge stands.\n\n\u2022 Pay \\$750 000 \u2013 Company B will build a wider, better bridge; ownership (and\n  the toll income) will be shared equally by the government and the company.\n\n\u2022 Pay \\$1 000 000 \u2013 Company B will erect a first-class, two-lane bridge with\n  walks, lighting, and full safety features, and when it is finished it will belong\n  entirely to the country; every penny of toll revenue will go into the Emperor\u2019s\n  treasury.\n\nAfter listening to the details the Emperor needed no time to think:  \neven a modest toll would bring in well over a million dollars in only a few\nyears, and owning the bridge outright was worth far more to the nation than the\n\\$200 000 or \\$750 000 it might save at the start.  \nSo the Emperor quite sensibly chose the third alternative and paid the full\n\\$1 000 000.\n\nBecause the three prices referred to three different, clearly stated\narrangements, Contractor B had been absolutely honest.  \nHe merely framed the choices so that the alternative that paid him the most was\nalso the one that gave the Emperor (and the country) the greatest long-term\nbenefit. Hence Company B received the highest amount without lying, cheating or\nswindling anyone.\n\nFinal answer: Company B offered three entirely different\ncontract/ownership arrangements; the option that cost \\$1 000 000 also gave the\nEmperor sole ownership of the finished bridge and all its future toll revenue,\nso the Emperor rationally chose that alternative and Company B was paid the\nfull \\$1 000 000.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.\nThe friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.\nFinally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.\nHow many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?", "Hint": "Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.\nThen, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG.

{"ID": 61, "Question": "In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.\nThe pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.\nWhat exactly happened there?", "Hint": "Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison", "Human Solution": "The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison. As his own poison he would bring water, which will have no effect on him, but the pharmacist who would drink the water, and then his poison would surely die. When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before.

{"ID": 76, "Question": "With the death of Arthur Minit, the legendary country of MADADIA's only clock maker, no one else had much experience yet with making clocks. The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.\nThe Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?", "Hint": "Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way.

One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes.

{"ID": 111, "Question": "Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.\nUnfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.\nBut in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.\nBut this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.\nBut the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.\nUnfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.\nLet's sum up the assumptions:\n1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.\n2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.\n3. The flower doesn't want to die.\n4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.\n5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.\n6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n7. The dog is rational.\n8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.\n9. The dog doesn't want to die.\n10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).\n11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.\n13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.\n14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.\n15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.\nSo now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?", "Hint": " 1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.\nHint 2:\nSince the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.", "Human Solution": "The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)\nBut why will the dog eat the flower?\n1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die\n2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.\n3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.\n4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.\n5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.\n6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.\n7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison\nOK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).\n8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous\n9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "The key to the problem is to notice that the flower\u2019s only possible reason for producing poison is to make the dog refrain from eating it.  \nBut the dog is told explicitly (assumption 12) that it can never know whether poison has been produced, and the flower knows that the dog cannot know this (assumption 13).  \nTherefore\n\n\u2022 Whatever the flower does, the dog\u2019s information set is the same; the dog\u2019s decision rule cannot be affected by the flower\u2019s (invisible) choice.  \n\u2022 If the dog finally decides to eat the flower, the flower dies whether or not it contains poison.  \n\u2022 If the dog finally decides not to eat, the flower lives, and again the presence of poison is irrelevant for its survival but does impose on it an extra, \u201chard\u201d effort it would prefer to avoid (assumption 5).\n\nConsequently, for the flower\n\n\u2003pay-off when it does NOT make poison  \n\u2003\u2003= 1 if the dog leaves it, 0 if the dog eats it;\n\n\u2003pay-off when it DOES make poison  \n\u2003\u2003= 1 \u2013 (cost of producing poison) if the dog leaves it, 0 if the dog eats it.\n\nBecause 1 \u2013 (cost) < 1, making poison is never better, and sometimes strictly worse.  \nHence a rational flower never produces poison.\n\nKnowing this, the rational dog can treat the flower as certainly non-poisonous.  \nIts choice is then:\n\n\u2003\u2022 Eat the flower \u2003\u2192\u2003survival probability 1.  \n\u2003\u2022 Do not eat \u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003survival probability \u00bd (assumption 15).\n\nSince 1 > \u00bd, the dog maximises its own chance of survival by eating the flower.\n\nTherefore, in the unique rational\u2010choice outcome, the flower does not develop poison and the dog eats it.\n\nFinal answer: The dog will eat the flower.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all four machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the four switches outside the room to the four machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?", "Hint": "Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room....", "Human Solution": "Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room and, by listening, test all six combinations of two back-up switches to find which two match the two \"machine-on\" switches inside the room.

Now, before returning to the room, leave one \"on\" off and one \"off\" on leaving the other \"on\" on and \"off\" off, that is, only two switches are activated.

{"ID": 129, "Question": "During the California Gold Rush, an assessor in San Francisco used a balance to measure out quantities of gold dust. He had a set of weights to place on the balance. The assessor needed to be able to measure out gold dust in exact ounces, no fractions, for every number of ounces starting at 1.\nIf the assessor has four weights, what is the largest number of ounces of gold dust he can measure?\nNote: The answer is not 15 ounces", "Hint": "Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.", "Human Solution": "The maximum weight is 40 ounces.\nThe weights are powers of 3:  1 ounce, 3 ounces, 9 ounces, 27 ounces.\nExample:\n7 ounces \u2013 Plate A: 9 oz. and 1 oz. weights.   Plate B: 3 oz weight and gold\nIn any weighing, each weight can be placed in one of three ways: on the plate with the gold, on the plate without the gold, on the desk next to the balance. So given n weights, there are 3^n possible combinations.\nThrow out the case where all weights are on the table. That leaves 3^n \u2013 1 cases.\nHalf of those cases would weigh negative gold, so eliminate half of these.\nThus, the number of valid combinations for n weights is (3^n \u2013 1) / 2.\nFor four weights, (3^4 \u2013 1) / 2 = (81 \u2013 1) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Let the four integral weights be \n\nw\u2081 \u2264 w\u2082 \u2264 w\u2083 \u2264 w\u2084 .\n\nBecause the assessor uses a balance scale, a weight may be put either\n\u2022 on the same pan as the gold (coefficient +1),  \n\u2022 on the opposite pan (coefficient \u20131), or  \n\u2022 not used (coefficient 0).  \n\nThus, with k weights every measurement corresponds to a choice of\ncoefficients \u20131, 0, 1 for those k weights; the net amount of gold that can\nbe balanced is any integer lying between \u2013(w\u2081+\u2026+w_k) and +(w\u2081+\u2026+w_k).\n\nStep 1.  Determine the conditions the weights must satisfy.\n\nAssume that with the first k\u20131 weights we can already obtain every integer\namount from 1 up to S_{k\u20131}=w\u2081+\u2026+w_{k\u20131}.  \nTo be able to weigh S_{k\u20131}+1 ounces, the k-th weight w_k must satisfy\n\nw_k \u2264 2S_{k\u20131}+1.

Show every amount 1\u201340 can indeed be weighed.\n\nEvery integer n with |n| \u2264 40 has a balanced-ternary expansion\nn = a\u2081\u00b71 + a\u2082\u00b73 + a\u2083\u00b79 + a\u2084\u00b727 with each a_j \u2208 {\u20131,0,1}.  \nPutting weight w_j on the side opposite the gold if a_j = +1, on the same\nside if a_j = \u20131, and leaving it off if a_j = 0 balances exactly n ounces.\nHence every whole number of ounces from 1 through 40 is obtainable.\n\nStep 4.  Show that no four weights can reach 41 ounces.\n\nFrom (\u2605) we saw that after k\u20131 weights the sum S_{k\u20131} is the\nlargest amount already attainable; if w_k were bigger than 2S_{k\u20131}+1,\nthe amount S_{k\u20131}+1 could not be weighed.  \nApplying this recursively from the minimal first weight 1 forces the sums\nS_k to be 1, 4, 13, 40.  Therefore 40 is the absolute maximum reachable\nwith four weights; 41 ounces cannot be guaranteed.\n\nConclusion: With four integral weights placed on either pan, the greatest consecutive amount of gold dust that can be measured, starting from 1 ounce, is 40 ounces, achievable with weights of 1 oz, 3 oz, 9 oz, and 27 oz.\n\nFinal answer: 40", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.

{"ID": 148, "Question": "There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?", "Hint": "Divide the coins into 3 groups", "Human Solution": "Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.\nNow let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.\nAnd that's that.

If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men.

And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.\nFact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son.

{"ID": 150, "Question": "There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants.

Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.\n2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.\n3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.\nSo now the question:\nWill that one sheep get eaten or not and why?", "Hint": "There are two hints.

Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.\nNow look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.\nSo now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.\nWe can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself).

You spend lots of money on selfish things, and are finding yourself very short of money.  The show has refused to let you back on after you meanly insulted the host.\nBut you are sneakier than that.  Now, your son has applied to be a contestant and has successfully made it on.  He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.\nHe is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!\nYou grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.\nThe combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.

From 1 and 6, Mrs. Johnston and Mrs. Williams both have male partners, therefore from 5, Mrs. Smith's partner could have only been Mrs. Jones.

{"ID": 193, "Question": "It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.\nYou quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...", "Hint": "If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.

No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.\nWhat else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!

(Otherwise Q would know P, which is\nimpossible.)  Thus (0,8) is a married pair.\n\nStep 2.  Remove that couple and repeat.  \nAfter deleting P and Q, seven people remain.  Their acquaintance numbers are the\nseven integers\n\n\u20031,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nExactly the same argument shows that  \n\u20031 is married to 7,  \n\u20032 is married to 6,  \n\u20033 is married to 5.\n\nStep 3.  One number is left unpaired.  \nAfter the pairings (0,8), (1,7), (2,6), (3,5) have been made, the only number that has\nnot yet been matched is 4, and the only person not yet assigned a partner is your\nspouse S.  Consequently\n\n\u2003S had 4 acquaintances before the party.                          (2)\n\nStep 4.  Determine your own number.  \nFor every k\u22604 the person with k acquaintances is married to the person with 8\u2013k\nacquaintances.  Hence the spouse of the person with 4 acquaintances must have\n8\u20134 = 4 acquaintances.  But S is the person with 4 acquaintances, and the only\npossible spouse for S is you.  Therefore\n\n\u2003You also had 4 acquaintances before the party.                   (3)\n\nConclusion.  \nPrior to the party your spouse knew exactly four of the eight guests who were not\nyou, and you likewise knew exactly four of them.\n\nFinal answer:  Your spouse knew 4 people beforehand, and you also knew 4.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

Repeating this reasoning, keep subtracting 11 (because \u201cyour reply\u201d +\n    \u201chis reply\u201d can total at most 10 + 1 = 11) to obtain the whole chain of\n    \u201csafe\u201d numbers\n\n           50, 39, 28, 17, 6, \u20135 \u2026\n\n    Any time you say one of these numbers (other than 50 itself) you can,\n    on your next turn, jump to the next one in the list no matter what your\n    opponent does, and eventually you will land on 50.\n\n4.  Therefore every number not in this list is losing for the player who\n    must play from it, because that player can be moved onto the list by the\n    opponent.  Conversely, every number in the list is winning for the\n    player who has just spoken it.\n\n5.  At the start Gretchen may choose any number between 1 and 10.  The only\n    \u201csafe\u201d number in that range is 6.  By beginning with 6 she leaves Henry\n    in a losing position.\n\n    \u2022  If Henry now says anything from 7 to 16, Gretchen answers 17.  \n    \u2022  Whatever Henry says from 18 to 27, she answers 28.  \n    \u2022  Whatever Henry says from 29 to 38, she answers 39.  \n    \u2022  Whatever Henry says from 40 to 49, she answers 50 and wins.\n\nHence Gretchen can force a win, and she must start with\n\nFinal answer: 6", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.

The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then \u00bc(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then \u00bc(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation \u00bc(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.\nIf c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since \"couples\" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.\no+8o=9o.\nSo 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even.

Choose one prisoner to be the COUNTER (call him C).  \n    The other 22 prisoners are ORDINARY prisoners.\n\n2.

Initial knowledge: both A and B are OFF.  \n    Every prisoner can remember two private facts:  \n      \u2022 whether he is the Counter or an Ordinary prisoner, and  \n      \u2022 if he is ordinary, whether he has already \u201creported\u201d once.\n\n4.  What each prisoner does when he is taken to the switch room\n\n   ORDINARY prisoner P  \n   a) If P has never reported before and he finds switch A in the OFF  \n      position, he flips switch A from OFF to ON (this is his single,  \n      irrevocable \u201cI have been here\u201d report) and thereafter marks himself  \n      as \u201creported\u201d.  \n   b) In every other situation (A is ON, or P has reported already)  \n      P flips switch B (changing its state from whatever it was to the  \n      opposite).  He never touches switch A again.\n\n   COUNTER C  \n   a) If switch A is ON, C flips it to OFF and increases his mental count  \n      by one.  \n   b) If switch A is OFF, C flips switch B (so that he satisfies the rule  \n      of moving exactly one switch).  His mental count is unchanged.\n\n5.  The moment C\u2019s mental count reaches 22 he announces  \n      \u201cAll of us have visited the switch room.\u201d\n\nWhy this works\n\n\u2022  Only an Ordinary prisoner who has never reported before is ever allowed to\n   turn switch A from OFF to ON.  Thus each of the 22 Ordinaries will make\n   that change at most once.\n\n\u2022  Whenever switch A is found ON, it must have been turned ON by some\n   Ordinary prisoner who had not yet reported.  The next time the Counter\n   is led into the room he will see A ON, turn it OFF, and add 1 to his\n   count.  Therefore each Ordinary prisoner\u2019s first successful report is\n   registered exactly once in the Counter\u2019s tally.\n\n\u2022  Because the warden selects prisoners at random and gives unlimited time,\n   every Ordinary prisoner is taken to the room infinitely many times.\n   If a particular Ordinary prisoner has not yet reported, sooner or later\n   he will enter when A is OFF and succeed in turning it ON.  Hence every\n   one of the 22 Ordinaries will eventually be counted.\n\n\u2022  When the Counter has accumulated 22 counts he knows that each of the 22\n   Ordinaries has reported once, which means every one of the 23 prisoners\n   has been in the switch room at least once (the Counter himself obviously\n   has).  At that instant the declaration is certainly correct.\n\n\u2022  It is impossible for the Counter to reach 22 prematurely: the only way\n   his count increases is by turning A OFF after finding it ON, and that can\n   happen at most once for each Ordinary prisoner.\n\nHence the strategy is safe (no false declaration) and sure to succeed (a\ntrue declaration will eventually be made).\n\nFinal answer:  Use switch A for counting and switch B as a harmless toggle.  \nOne prisoner is the Counter.  Each ordinary prisoner flips A from OFF to ON\nexactly once (the first time he finds A OFF), otherwise flips B.  The\nCounter flips A from ON to OFF, adding 1 to his tally, otherwise flips B.\nWhen his tally reaches 22 he announces that everyone has visited; the\nannouncement is then certainly true.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).\nGiven the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?", "Hint": "It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.", "Human Solution": "199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "Let n be the number of equally-spaced points on a circle (here n = 1000).  \nPick a fixed step length d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n\u20131) and join every point to the point that is d places farther round the circle, continuing until we get back to the start.\n\nFor this drawing to be\n\n\u2022 continuous (one never lifts the pencil),  \n\u2022 non-repeating (every point is visited exactly once),\n\nthe step d must be coprime to n, i.e. gcd(n, d)=1.  \n(If gcd(n, d)=g>1, the drawing splits into g separate smaller polygons.)\n\nAmong the numbers 1,\u2026,n\u20131 the count of those coprime to n is Euler\u2019s totient function \u03c6(n).\n\nHowever, the two step sizes d and n\u2013d produce mirror-image drawings, so they are regarded as the same \u201cstar\u201d.  \nAlso d=1 (and equivalently d=n\u20131) gives the perimeter of the polygon, not a star, and is excluded.\n\nHence\n\nnumber of distinct n-point stars = (\u03c6(n) \u2013 2) / 2.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nCompute \u03c6(1000):\n\n1000 = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 5\u00b3  \n\u03c6(1000) = 1000\u00b7(1 \u2013 1/2)\u00b7(1 \u2013 1/5)  \n          = 1000\u00b7(1/2)\u00b7(4/5)  \n          = 400.\n\nFinally,\n\n(\u03c6(1000) \u2013 2) / 2 = (400 \u2013 2) / 2 = 398 / 2 = 199.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nFinal answer: 199", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.\n11. Raj's character isn't the elf.\n12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.\n13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.", "Hint": "Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Human Solution": "Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nLeonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow\nHoward's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "Step\u2013by\u2013step reasoning\n\n1.  From clue 8 the lowest level is 10; that character uses a dagger and is not Penny.  \n2.  Clue 3 says the bolo\u2013user\u2019s level is twice the halfling\u2019s level, so the halfling must be the 10-level character and the bolo\u2013user is at level 20.  \n3.  Clue 4 sets three consecutive levels eight points apart.  Let the cross-bow user be X, then the paladin is X+8 and Raj is X+16.  \n   \u2022  X cannot be 10 (that weapon is a dagger), so X\u226416.  \n   \u2022  Because clue 1 tells us one character is a 24-level ogre, it is convenient to choose X=16 \u2192 paladin = 24 \u2192 Raj = 32.  \n4.  Now the five distinct levels are 10, 16, 20, 24, 32.  (The 24-level ogre is the paladin.)  \n5.  Clue 6 puts the elf 10 levels above the kobold-fighter.  The only 10-gap inside the set is 10\u219220, so  \n   kobold-fighter level 10 and elf level 20 (who therefore wields the bolo; note that the elf \u201cdoesn\u2019t care for cross-bows\u201d, satisfied because the cross-bow is at 16).  \n6.  Clue 7: the chimera-fighter is 4 levels higher than Leonard.  A 4-gap in the set is 16\u219220, so Leonard is level 16 and the 20-level elf fights chimeras.  (Clue 7 also says Leonard is not the archbishop.)  \n7.  Summarise what we have so far\n\n   level 10 \u2013 dagger, halfling, kobolds, (player not Penny)  \n   level 16 \u2013 cross-bow, Leonard,  \n   level 20 \u2013 bolo, elf, chimeras  \n   level 24 \u2013 paladin, ogre  \n   level 32 \u2013 Raj  \n\n8.  Clue 10: the giant-fighter never uses a mace.  Weapons left for levels 24 and 32 are mace & fire-balls.  Clue 1 says the fire-ball user is a different character from the 24-level ogre, so  \n   \u2022  lvl 24 ogre must use the mace,  \n   \u2022  lvl 32 (Raj) uses fire-balls \u2192 Raj fights the giants (he does not use a mace, so clue 10 is safe).  \n9.  Clue 5 forbids a hobbit from fighting giants, hence Raj is not a hobbit.  Races still unassigned are gremlin & hobbit; therefore Raj is a gremlin and the only place left for hobbit is level 16 (Leonard).  \n10.  Clue 13 bans Howard from the harpies, so the harpy-fighter must be someone else.  \n   The lvl 24 character (still race ogre, weapon mace) is the only one whose monster is not yet set; it can\u2019t be kobolds, chimeras, or giants and (from clue 1) not orcs, so it must be harpies.  \n   Therefore level 24 is Sheldon (not Penny, not Raj and not Howard because Howard can\u2019t fight harpies).  \n11.  From clue 1 the five \u201cheadline\u201d characters are distinct:  \n      \u2013 Penny\u2019s character (so Penny cannot be any of the other four),  \n      \u2013 the 24-level ogre (Sheldon),  \n      \u2013 the thief,  \n      \u2013 the fire-ball user (Raj),  \n      \u2013 the orc-fighter.  \n    Since Raj and Sheldon already fill two of these roles and Penny must be different from them, Penny must be the level-20 elf (already identified).  \n12.  The cross-bow user (Leonard, level 16) is still missing a monster; orcs are the only monster type not yet taken, so Leonard fights orcs \u2013 satisfying the \u201corc-fighter\u201d slot.  \n13.  The thief must be different from Penny, Sheldon, Raj and Leonard, so it is Howard (level 10 halfling).  \n14.  Occupations still to be assigned are archbishop, merchant and sorcerer.  \n     \u2022  Gremlins (Raj) cannot be archbishop or merchant (clue 9) so Raj is the sorcerer.  \n     \u2022  Leonard (hobbit) is already barred from being archbishop (clue 7), hence Leonard is the merchant and Penny is the archbishop.\n\nThe completed table\n\nPlayer   Level  Race     Occupation Weapon     Monster speciality\nHoward   10     halfling thief      dagger     kobolds\nLeonard  16     hobbit   merchant   cross-bow  orcs\nPenny    20     elf      archbishop bolo       chimeras\nSheldon  24     ogre     paladin    mace       harpies\nRaj      32     gremlin  sorcerer   fire-balls giants\n\nAll thirteen clues are satisfied, and the five \u201cheadline\u201d characters in clue 1 are distinct.\n\nFinal answer:  \n\u2022 Howard\u2019s character is a 10-level halfling thief who wields a dagger and specialises in kobolds.  \n\u2022 Leonard\u2019s character is a 16-level hobbit merchant who uses a cross-bow and fights orcs.  \n\u2022 Penny\u2019s character is a 20-level elf archbishop who throws bolos and battles chimeras.  \n\u2022 Sheldon\u2019s character is a 24-level ogre paladin who swings a mace and combats harpies.  \n\u2022 Raj\u2019s character is a 32-level gremlin sorcerer who casts fire-balls and slays giants.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}
{"ID": 7, "Question": "Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.\nHere, you are approached by three gods and their herald.\nProblem\nOn the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.\nFirst, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.\nSecond, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.\nFinally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment.

As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (\"would you say ja?\") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.\nIf the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.\nSimilarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.\nThe next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, \"If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?\" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: \"no I would not say yes,\" even though he would; or \"yes I would say no,\" even though he wouldn't.)\nFinally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, \"If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?\" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified).

There are 5 working days: 25, 27, 28, 29, 30 May (no work on Sunday 26 May).\n\n2.  \u201cThree days after he dug \u2026 radishes he planted peppers\u201d must mean three working days later.  \n\u2003So the only possible pairs are (25\u219229) or (27\u219230).  We will keep both in mind.\n\n3.  \u201cOn one week\u2019s last day he planted the east side.\u201d  \n\u2003Saturday, 25 May, is the week\u2019s last day in our span, so the EAST side was planted 25 May.\n\n4.  Let us take the pair (25 May = Radishes, 29 May = Peppers).  \n\u2003(This will turn out to be the only pair that works.)\n\n5.  \u201cOne day before he planted the broccoli he worked in the WEST side.\u201d  \n\u2003Therefore WEST-side planting is 27 May and Broccoli is 28 May (26 May is impossible).\n\n6.  Broccoli is \u201cnot on the west side and not on the 29th\u201d; 28 May is fine and is not west.\n\n7.  From (5) WEST side is 27 May.  It must therefore contain some vegetable other than Broccoli.\n\n8.  Row information:  \n\u2003\u2022 South side has 3 rows.  \n\u2003\u2022 4-rows planting occurred first, then the 3-rows planting, then the 2-rows planting.  \n\u2003\u2022 Lettuce < 3 rows; Peppers > Broccoli; Radishes > Broccoli but < Tomatoes; NW corner has an even number of rows (2 or 4) and is not Peppers or Tomatoes.\n\n9.  Put Radishes (already fixed on 25 May) into 4 rows \u2014 they are the earliest planting, satisfying the \u201c4-rows first\u201d rule and leaving room above (Tomatoes) and below (Broccoli).\n\n10. South-side 3-row planting must be 29 May (because 27 May is West, 28 May is Broccoli, 25 May is East).  \n\u2003The only vegetable already on 29 May is Peppers, so Peppers are the SOUTH-side crop with 3 rows.\n\n11.  Peppers (3 rows) > Broccoli, so Broccoli must have 1 or 2 rows.  \n\u2003Choose 1 row for Broccoli, leaving the even number 2 available for the NW corner.\n\n12.  \u201cSouth one day before Lettuce\u201d: 29 May (South) \u2192 Lettuce 30 May.  \n\u2003Lettuce must be < 3 rows, so assign it 2 rows.  That puts Lettuce in the NW corner (even rows, not Peppers/Tomatoes).\n\n13.  The only vegetable left unplaced is Tomatoes.  \n\u2003Tomatoes cannot be East or NW, so Tomatoes go to the remaining unfilled place: the WEST side (27 May).  \n\u2003Tomatoes must have the only remaining unused row-count, 5 rows.\n\n14.

Observe what 15 \u201crows\u201d we may reasonably try to use.  \n    A regular pentagon supplies 5 straight\u2010line edges.  \n    The five long diagonals of that pentagon form a regular five-pointed star (a\n    pentagram); the star consists of 5 more straight lines.  \n    Finally the 5 chords that join the five intersection points of the star form a\n    smaller (inner) pentagon \u2013 another 5 straight lines.  \n    Hence the figure made by drawing an ordinary pentagram together with both the\n    outer and inner pentagons naturally gives\n          5 (outer edges) + 5 (star lines) + 5 (inner edges) = 15 straight lines,\n    exactly the number of rows we want.\n\n2.

{"ID": 20, "Question": "The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?", "Hint": "Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.", "Human Solution": "Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.\nDetective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.\nA prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.\nMr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "Let  \n\nDining car  = D  \nPassenger car = P  \n\nPassengers (with genders) :  \nMs. S (f), Mr. G (m), Mr. J (m), Ms. L (f), Mr. F (m), Mr. R (m), Mr. Q (m), Ms. P (f), Mr. K (m), Ms. W (f) + an unknown victim V (sex still undetermined at this point).\n\nBecause only ONE person is lying, nine statements must be simultaneously true.  \nStart by treating every statement as true and write down the unavoidable consequences.\n\n1.

{"ID": 22, "Question": "The Situation:\nThere is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:\nIn the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).\nThe monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: \"white\" or \"black\". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.\nThe monster gives them the whole night to think.\nThe Task:\nDevise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.\nAssumptions:\n1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.\n2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.\n3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional \"white\" or \"black\".\n4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words.

This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.\nLet us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says \"white\".

If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it.

And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "Let us label the people in the line  \n\n\u2003#10  #9  #8\u2002\u2026\u2002#2\u2002#1\u2003                      \n(the monster questions #10 first, #1 last).\n\nWhite = W, Black = B.\n\nGoal  \nAgree on a rule that allows every person, when it is his turn, to work out the colour of his own hat from:\n\n\u2022 what he sees in front of him,  \n\u2022 what he has already heard said, and  \n\u2022 the single word (\u201cwhite\u201d or \u201cblack\u201d) he will himself utter.\n\nA classical trick is to use the first word spoken only as a piece of coded information for the others; that first speaker may or may not survive, but everyone after him can be made 100 % safe.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nThe agreement made during the night\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. We will talk about the PARITY (evenness / oddness) of black hats.  \n   Even number of black hats  \u2192 code-word \u201cblack\u201d.  \n   Odd  number of black hats  \u2192 code-word \u201cwhite\u201d.\n\n2.

Every later speaker keeps in his head the same \u201crunning parity\u201d of black hats that SHOULD have appeared so far (according to #10\u2019s announcement), continually updating it by\n\n   \u2022 subtracting (mod 2) every black hat he can still see in front of him;  \n   \u2022 subtracting (mod 2) every \u201cblack\u201d that has already been spoken behind him  \n      (because any earlier correct guess of \u201cblack\u201d put one more black hat into the\n      total that #10 had in mind).\n\n   When it is his own turn, the running parity tells him what his own hat must be:\n\n   If the running parity currently says \u201cblack\u201d is still needed,  \n     my hat is black \u2013 I say \u201cblack\u201d.  \n   If it says \u201cwhite\u201d is still needed,  \n     my hat is white \u2013 I say \u201cwhite\u201d.\n\nBecause each person from #9 down to #1 can perform this calculation perfectly, every one of them will name his colour correctly.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nWhy the scheme works\n--------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 #10\u2019s single word fixes for everyone the parity of black hats among persons #1-#9.  \n\n\u2022 Suppose #9 is now to speak.  He sees #1-#8.  Let k be the number of black hats he sees.  \n  If #10 said \u201cblack\u201d (even) and k is even, then #9 must be white;  \n  if #10 said \u201cblack\u201d and k is odd, then #9 must be black;  \n  if #10 said \u201cwhite\u201d (odd) the conclusions are reversed.  \n  Hence #9 is certain.\n\n\u2022 After #9\u2019s correct announcement the others know whether #9\u2019s hat was black or white and therefore can update the running parity before #8 speaks, and so on.  Induction shows that #8, #7, \u2026, #1 will all be correct.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nGuaranteed outcome\n--------------------------------------------------\nPerson #10 survives with probability \u00bd.  \nPersons #9, #8, \u2026, #1 survive with probability 1.\n\nThus at least 9 out of the 10 (90 %) are saved for sure, and there is a 50 % chance that all 10 survive.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nA concrete example\n--------------------------------------------------\nSuppose the actual hats (seen from the back) are  \n\n#10 ?  #9 B  #8 W  #7 B  #6 B  #5 W  #4 W  #3 B  #2 W  #1 W\n\n1. #10 sees 4 black hats in front (even) \u2192 says \u201cblack\u201d.  \n   (He lives if his own hat is black.)\n\nRunning parity required among #1-#9: even.\n\n2. #9 sees 4 blacks among #1-#8 (even).  \n   Even is already satisfied, so his own hat must be white.  \n   He says \u201cwhite\u201d and survives.\n\n3. #8 now knows that so far the running parity is still even and that he sees\n   3 blacks ahead (odd).  To make the overall parity even, his own hat must be black.\n   He says \u201cblack\u201d and survives.\n\n4. Everyone updates; the procedure repeats down the line. All remaining 7 people are certain and survive.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nFinal answer\n--------------------------------------------------\nHave #10 announce the parity of black hats in front of him: say \u201cblack\u201d if he sees an even number of black hats, \u201cwhite\u201d if he sees an odd number.  Every later speaker keeps track of the parity that should still hold, compares it with what he sees ahead and has already heard behind, and from that deduces his own colour with certainty.  Consequently #9, #8, \u2026, #1 are all saved, while #10 survives with 50 % probability.  Hence at least 9 out of the 10 islanders (90 %) are guaranteed to live, which is the optimal attainable rate under the rules.\n\nFinal answer: an optimal strategy guarantees 9 survivors (and, with 50 % probability, all 10).", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}
{"ID": 23, "Question": "\"Congratulations, Great-Aunt Nora!\"  The voice of Victor Summ, her eldest nephew, was tired, but exultant.  Her older sister was the first grandparent among the five Shekrie siblings.\n\"Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.\"  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.\nNora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  \"You're on, 'Daddy'.

She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.\"\nNora yelped.  \"You had *eleven*,\" then her left brain caught up, \"no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.\"\n\"De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.\"\n\"So they got it sorted out?\"\n\"Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!\"\n\"So what did they do?\"\n\"Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.\"\nHe took a cleansing breath.  \"On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?\"\n\"I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?\"\nVic broke in, \"He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.\"\nCorman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  \"Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.

Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1).

Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate.

They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.\nEach night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave.

{"ID": 41, "Question": "In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.\nHow many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party?

He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nIf there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast.

E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.\nLet's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.\nIf I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.\nThis means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.\nThis leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6.

The four booths form a straight line.  \n    For an end booth the number of neighbouring booths is 1, for an inner booth it is 2.\n\n2.

An end booth can only give T-count 0 or 1 (never 2).  \n    Hence both end booths must have T-count 0, otherwise Wym-Inar would not be unique.\n\n4.  Agurgle (Uranus) has two neighbours (Clue 2), so he must occupy an inner booth.\n\n5.

Because the aliens in booths 1 and 4 must have T-count 0, Agurgle (booth 2) and Wym-Inar (booth 3) are NOT tentacled.  \n    For Wym-Inar to have T-count 1, exactly one of his neighbours must be tentacled, i.e. the alien in booth 4 is tentacled, the alien in booth 2 is not.  \n    So the tentacle pattern is\n\n       T  F  F  T       (T = tentacled, F = not tentacled)\n\n7.

{"ID": 57, "Question": "There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.\nHe decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.\nCompany A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, \"Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.\"  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.\nWhy did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?", "Hint": "2 Hints:\n1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.\n2. Use your math and accounting skills", "Human Solution": "Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.\nEach company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full \u00be pay for \u00be of a bridge ($750,000).\nWhen Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.  They figured it was not worth the $200,000 to start even building since it was so dangerous and immediately backed out, forcing the Emperor to pay Company B their full asking price of $1,000,000.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "Step-by-step reasoning\n\n1.

Everybody knew the job was dangerous and there was a real chance that\n    company A would run out of money, equipment or nerve in the middle of the\n    project.  If that happened the Emperor would have to find somebody else,\n    lose time, and almost certainly spend far more than the original\n    $800 000.  The cheap bid therefore carried considerable risk.\n\n3.  Company B came back with an \u201cinsurance\u2013type\u201d proposal that used\n    company A\u2019s offer as part of the plan.  B told the Emperor:\n\n       \u201cYour total outlay will never exceed one million dollars and the\n        bridge will definitely be finished.

For a\n                      further $750 000 I will salvage whatever A has done\n                      and finish the bridge.  (The $250 000 A has already\n                      been paid + the $750 000 you give me = $1 000 000.)  \n\n        \u2022 $1 000 000 \u2013 If you wish to avoid all risk or if A refuses to start,\n                      let me build the bridge from scratch for this price.\u201d\n\n4.  What these three figures mean for the Emperor\n\n       \u2022 A succeeds:  he has paid A $800 000 and B $200 000 \u2013 exactly\n         $1 000 000.  \n\n       \u2022 A fails part-way:  he will have paid A $250 000 (roughly the value\n         of the part completed) and B $200 000 + $750 000 \u2013 again\n         $1 000 000.  \n\n       \u2022 A never starts, or the Emperor prefers the sure thing:  he pays B\n         the full $1 000 000.  \n\n   No matter what happens, the bridge is completed and the total cost is\n   capped at one million dollars.\n\n5.  Why the Emperor accepted  \n    Spending an extra $200 000 above A\u2019s bare bid bought him a rock-solid\n    completion guarantee and removed every financial surprise that the risky\n    project might spring on his small country.  That certainty was well worth\n    the premium, so he accepted B\u2019s scheme.\n\n6.  What actually happened  \n    Company A, after looking more closely at the dangers, declined to begin\n    the work.  Under the agreed terms the Emperor invoked the third option\n    and ordered B to do the whole job.  Consequently B received the full\n    $1 000 000, all in strict accordance with the contract\u2014no lies, no\n    cheating, no swindle.\n\nFinal answer: Company B sold the Emperor an \u201cinsurance\u201d contract: $200 000 was a non-refundable premium guaranteeing that, whatever company A did or failed to do, the bridge would be finished for a total cost that would never exceed $1 000 000.  When company A finally backed out, the Emperor used the contract\u2019s third option and paid B the full $1 000 000, so B honestly ended up with the highest amount.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}
{"ID": 58, "Question": "A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.\nAfter this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.\nThe friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens.

{"ID": 61, "Question": "In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.\nThe pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.\nWhat exactly happened there?", "Hint": "Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison", "Human Solution": "The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison.

When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before.

{"ID": 104, "Question": "Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.\nManny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, \"I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.\"\nMoe answers, \"IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.\"\nJack thinks for a bit, and then says, \"Now I know all of our numbers.\"\nMr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.\nWhat numbers does she say they each are holding?", "Hint": "Do casework on what Moe can have.", "Human Solution": "Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.\nFrom Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.\nThere are 12 triples for (Manny, Moe, Jack) that satisfy all three statements. They are:\n(1, 2, 11)\n(1, 6, 7)\n(1, 10, 3)\n(3, 2, 9)\n(3, 6, 5)\n(3, 10, 1)\n(5, 2, 7)\n(5, 6, 3)\n(7, 2, 5)\n(7, 6, 1)\n(9, 2, 3)\n(11, 2, 1)\nSince Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.\nMr. Simkin suggests to Gretchen that she may have a career in law enforcement if she can further hone these impressive deductive reasoning skills.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "Let  \n\u2006\u2006m = Manny\u2019s number,\u2003n = Moe\u2019s number,\u2003p = Jack\u2019s number,\u2003m+n+p = 14.\n\nSTEP 1.

Moe speaks.  \nHe knows n (his own number) and that n \u2260 p, and he hears Manny\u2019s remark, which lets him deduce m is odd.  \nMoe now says he knows all three numbers are distinct, i.e. he is certain n \u2260 m as well.\n\nIf n were odd, m could equal n (since m is also odd) whenever 14 \u2013 2n were positive.  \nExample: n = 3 would allow (m,n,p) = (3,3,8).  \nThus, with an odd n, Moe could not be sure that m \u2260 n.  \nTherefore n must be even.\n\nSo n \u2208 {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}.\n\nSTEP 3.

{"ID": 111, "Question": "Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.\nUnfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.\nBut in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.\nBut this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.\nBut the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.\nUnfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.\nLet's sum up the assumptions:\n1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.\n2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.\n3. The flower doesn't want to die.\n4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.\n5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.\n6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n7. The dog is rational.\n8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.\n9. The dog doesn't want to die.\n10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).\n11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.\n13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.\n14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.\n15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.\nSo now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?", "Hint": " 1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.\nHint 2:\nSince the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.", "Human Solution": "The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)\nBut why will the dog eat the flower?\n1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die\n2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.\n3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.\n4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.\n5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.\n6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.\n7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison\nOK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).\n8.

What does the flower want?  \n   \u2013 It dislikes the hard work of making poison (assumption 5).  \n   \u2013 It dislikes being eaten even more (assumption 3).  \n   Hence the flower will produce poison only if that is necessary to keep it alive (assumption 6).\n\n3. What does the dog know?  \n   \u2013 It knows every point in step 2 (assumptions 10 & 11).  \n   \u2013 It also knows it can never observe whether poison was made (assumption 12).  \n   Therefore its decision cannot be based on any direct information about poison.  \n   It must choose a single policy, E or \u00acE, that will be carried out regardless of what the flower actually did (hint 1).\n\n4. How will a rational flower reason about the dog?  \n   The flower knows the dog is rational (assumption 2).  \n   Consequently it predicts what the dog\u2019s single policy will be and then acts in its own best interest:  \n   \u2022 If the flower predicts E, it chooses P (poison) to avoid being eaten.  \n   \u2022 If the flower predicts \u00acE, it chooses \u00acP, sparing itself the trouble of making poison.\n\n5. From the dog\u2019s point of view the two consistent \u201cpackages\u201d of behaviour are therefore  \n      (a)  E  &  P        (dog eats, flower poisons)  \n      (b) \u00acE  & \u00acP        (dog does not eat, flower does not poison)\n\n   Any other combination would be irrational for at least one of them.\n\n6.

Because the dog\u2019s own choice is what determines which package is logically consistent, it selects \u00acE.  \n   Knowing this, the flower has no reason to make poison and therefore selects \u00acP.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe unique pair of actions compatible with common knowledge of perfect rationality is\n      Dog: do not eat the flower.  \n      Flower: do not produce poison.\n\nFinal answer: The dog will not eat the flower, because if it intended to eat, the rational flower would certainly have produced poison, killing the dog; by refraining from eating, the dog at least keeps its 50 % chance of surviving the virus.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 123, "Question": "In a wood-cutting factory, four large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are four back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all four machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the four switches outside the room to the four machines inside.

Now, before returning to the room, leave one \"on\" off and one \"off\" on leaving the other \"on\" on and \"off\" off, that is, only two switches are activated.

The centre (former Scarlets, new Downers) cannot be McGuyver (he is former Mountaineers), so it is Grippley:  \n   Grippley = Centre, former Scarlets, new Downers.\n\n9.

A position that attains 14.  \n   One convenient way is to use every \u201c\\\u201d diagonal except the one through a8,  \n   and to use every \u201c/\u201d diagonal except  h1\u2013a8  is repeated just once.  \n   A concrete set of squares that realises this is  \n\n        a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, b8, g1, h1, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7.\n\n   Written in coordinate form (file,rank \u2192 (column,row)) they are  \n\n        a1(0,0), a2(0,1), a3(0,2), a4(0,3), a5(0,4), a6(0,5),  \n        b8(1,7), g1(6,0),  \n        h1(7,0), h3(7,2), h4(7,3), h5(7,4), h6(7,5), h7(7,6).\n\n   \u2022  Each of the 14 \u201c\\\u201d diagonals \u22126,\u22125,\u22124,\u22123,\u22122,\u22121,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 is occupied exactly once.  \n   \u2022  Each of the 14 \u201c/\u201d diagonals 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 is occupied exactly once.  \n   \u2022  Hence no two bishops share a diagonal and none can capture another.\n\nBecause the upper bound 14 is achieved, it is the maximum possible.\n\nFinal answer: 14 bishops, for example on the squares  \na1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, b8, g1, h1, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}
{"ID": 129, "Question": "During the California Gold Rush, an assessor in San Francisco used a balance to measure out quantities of gold dust. He had a set of weights to place on the balance. The assessor needed to be able to measure out gold dust in exact ounces, no fractions, for every number of ounces starting at 1.\nIf the assessor has four weights, what is the largest number of ounces of gold dust he can measure?\nNote: The answer is not 15 ounces", "Hint": "Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.", "Human Solution": "The maximum weight is 40 ounces.\nThe weights are powers of 3:  1 ounce, 3 ounces, 9 ounces, 27 ounces.\nExample:\n7 ounces \u2013 Plate A: 9 oz. and 1 oz. weights.   Plate B: 3 oz weight and gold\nIn any weighing, each weight can be placed in one of three ways: on the plate with the gold, on the plate without the gold, on the desk next to the balance. So given n weights, there are 3^n possible combinations.\nThrow out the case where all weights are on the table. That leaves 3^n \u2013 1 cases.\nHalf of those cases would weigh negative gold, so eliminate half of these.\nThus, the number of valid combinations for n weights is (3^n \u2013 1) / 2.\nFor four weights, (3^4 \u2013 1) / 2 = (81 \u2013 1) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "Step 1.

Choose each weight as large as the gap\u2010free condition allows  \nStart with no weights: T0 = 0.\n\nWeight 1.  Condition (2) with T0 = 0 gives w1 \u2264 1.

Condition (2) with T2 = 4 gives w3 \u2264 2\u00b74 + 1 = 9.  Take w3 = 9.  \nNow T3 = 4 + 9 = 13.\n\nWeight 4.  Condition (2) with T3 = 13 gives w4 \u2264 2\u00b713 + 1 = 27.  Take w4 = 27.  \nNow T4 = 13 + 27 = 40.\n\nStep 4.  Verify that every integer 1 \u2013 40 is attainable  \nBecause each choice above met the equality in (2), the construction guarantees there\nare no gaps, so every number from 1 up to the new total T4 is obtainable.\n(Equivalently, 1, 3, 9, 27 are the first four powers of 3; balanced-ternary\nrepresentation covers every integer from 1 through (3\u2074\u22121)/2 = 40.)\n\nStep 5.

In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

We know that \"Jung\" comes before Toby's chapter.  This leaves chapters 1 and 4.  If \"Jung\" is chapter 4, Toby's would be 5, but we know that 5 is Kiera's, so \"Jung\" has to be chapter 1.

Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.\n2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.\n3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.\nSo now the question:\nWill that one sheep get eaten or not and why?", "Hint": "There are two hints.

{"ID": 163, "Question": "Well... The Winning Combination is back.. but with a twist!  You are a millionaire... but you have now become very greedy and a cheater.  You spend lots of money on selfish things, and are finding yourself very short of money.  The show has refused to let you back on after you meanly insulted the host.\nBut you are sneakier than that.  Now, your son has applied to be a contestant and has successfully made it on.  He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.\nHe is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!\nYou grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.\nThe combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.

The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).\nHurry, Dad, hurry!\"", "Hint": "The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.", "Human Solution": "The solution is 49-21-75-88.\nFirst of all, we know that there are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination and that every other digit appears at least once (clue 5).\nOK, we'll start on the first set.\nWe know it's a square number (clue 6).\nThe only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:\n25\n49\n81\nNow, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.\nSo you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.\n81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.\n25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.\nSo that leaves with 49.\n49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.\nNow we know this much:\n49-21-??-??\nNow we must work on the last two sets.\nClue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.\nHere are the possible combinations:\n11-24\n12-25\n14-27\n15-28\n28-41\n29-42\n41-54\n42-55\n44-57\n45-58\n58-71\n59-72\n71-84\n72-85\n74-87\n75-88\n78-91\n79-92\n81-94\n82-95\n84-97\n85-98\nNow, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.\nCurrently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.\nSo now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:\n58-71\n75-88\n72-85\nNow, we read clue 4.

You must be careful that you take just one of each because taking more of either can have serious side effects.\nTaking Sildenafil without taking Citrate, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the Sildenafil pills and one of the Citrate pills at one time. Therefore, you open up the Sildenafil bottle, and you tap one Sildenafil pill into your hand. You put that bottle aside and you open the Citrate bottle. You do the same, but by mistake, two Citrates fall into your hand with the Sildenafil pill.\nNow, here's the problem.

On a day in January, the two friends set both clocks correctly at 12:00 noon. \"Do you realize,\" asked Joe, \"that the next time both of our clocks will show exactly the same time will be on your 47th birthday?\" Smoe agreed.

This is when the slow clock loses six hours, and the fast one gains six hours. This will take 90 days. In 90 days they will come together at 6:00. On a calendar, there are 90 days between noon January 31, and noon May 1 in years with no leap year. If Smoe had been born in 1933, his 47th birthday would have been in 1980, a leap year.

How fast the two clocks separate  \n   \u2022  One clock gains 10 s every real hour.  \n   \u2022  The other loses 10 s every real hour.  \n   \u2022  Hence the two readings drift apart by  \n        10 s + 10 s = 20 s each real hour  \n        = 20 s / h \u00d7 24 h = 480 s per day  \n        = 8 min per day.\n\n2.  When will the two readings coincide again?  \n    The dial of a grandfather clock repeats every 12 hours (720 minutes).  \n    We need the two readings to differ by an integral multiple of 12 h in\n    order to look the same.  \n    Smallest positive multiple \u2192 12 h = 720 min.  \n           8 min per day \u00d7 N days = 720 min  \n           N = 720 / 8 = 90 days.  \n\n    So the NEXT time the two clocks agree is exactly 90 days after they were\n    set.\n\n3.

He prepares a colored hat for every one of them and tells them the rules. The hats can be either black or white and will be placed on everyone's head.  The prisoners will get a chance to discuss a strategy together, which they will all follow, then they will be marched out into a large room where they will see everybody else's hat color. Each prisoner will then simultaneously guess which of the two hat colors they have. If every one of them is right, or every one of them is wrong, they will all go free. However, the prisoners will not be allowed to communicate in any way during this process. Also, the warden will hear their strategy and place hats any way he can to prevent them from going free.

Why the hint points to parity (even / odd)  \n    With two people the only global fact both can compute from what they see is  \n    \u201care the two hats equal or different?\u201d.  \n    With three (or more) people the strongest common fact everybody can compute is  \n    \u201cis the total number of white hats I see even or odd?\u201d.  \n    The crucial observation:  \n       What a white-hatted prisoner sees and what a black-hatted prisoner sees  \n       differ in parity by exactly one.\n\n3.  The strategy the prisoners adopt during their pre-game meeting  \n    \u2022 Each prisoner silently counts how many white hats he sees.  \n    \u2022 If he sees an even number he will say \u201cblack\u201d.  \n      If he sees an odd number he will say \u201cwhite\u201d.  \n      (They can of course agree on the opposite convention; it doesn\u2019t matter.)\n\n4.  Why this works \u2013 the formal proof  \n    Let H\u2081, H\u2082, \u2026 , H\u2099 be the real hat colours (0 = black, 1 = white).  \n    Let P = H\u2081 + H\u2082 + \u2026 + H\u2099 (mod 2) be the parity of the total number of white hats.  \n\n    What prisoner k can see is  \n            S\u2096 = H\u2081 + \u2026 + H\u2096\u208b\u2081 + H\u2096\u208a\u2081 + \u2026 + H\u2099   (mod 2)  \n          = P \u2212 H\u2096 (mod 2).  \n\n    His announced guess G\u2096 is  \n            G\u2096 = 0  if S\u2096 is even        \u2192  G\u2096 = S\u2096  \n                 1  if S\u2096 is odd         \u2192  G\u2096 = S\u2096  \n\n          So  G\u2096 = S\u2096 = P \u2212 H\u2096   (mod 2)  \n          \u21d2  G\u2096 = H\u2096  when P = 0 (total number of whites even)  \n          \u21d2  G\u2096 = 1 \u2212 H\u2096 when P = 1 (total number of whites odd).\n\n    Therefore  \n        \u2022 If P = 0, every G\u2096 equals H\u2096  \u2192 everybody is right.  \n        \u2022 If P = 1, every G\u2096 equals 1 \u2212 H\u2096 \u2192 everybody is wrong.  \n\n    In either case the whole group satisfies the warden\u2019s release condition.\n\n5.  Why the warden cannot foil them  \n    Whatever assignment of hats the warden chooses fixes the parity P.  \n    Their rule automatically puts them in the \u201call right\u201d state when P = 0  \n    and in the \u201call wrong\u201d state when P = 1.  \n    The warden has no third option, so he cannot prevent their escape.\n\n6.

Column C must also contain two portraits whose names begin with the same letter (clue 2).  \n   Putting Horse in 3C gives one \u2018H\u2019.

When questioned, the four guards made the following statements in their defence:\nNorris McDim:\nA) I did not leave the door open.\nB) Morris was the one who did it.\nNobby Shifty:\nA) I was not the one who was on duty that evening.\nB) Norris was on duty.\nMorris the Daft:\nA) Nobby was the one on duty that evening.\nB) I hoped Torks G'Arbage would escape.\nRobby O'Mental:\nA) I did not leave the door open.\nB) I was not surprised that Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape.\nConsidering that, in total, three statements are true and five statements are false, which guard is guilty?", "Hint": "For each person, assume they did it. Count how many truthful statements there are?", "Human Solution": "Robby left the door open.\nThe one truth given is that all 4 guards hoped that Torks G'Arbage would escape, so statement B from Morris is a truth.\nThere are only 3 truthful statements.\nIf Norris had done it, then Nobby made 2 truthful statements and Robby's statement A would be true; making a total of 4 truths, so it can't be Norris.\nIf Nobby had done it, statement A from Norris would be true, both of Morris's statements would be true, and Robby's statement A would be true; again a total of 4, so it can't be Nobby.\nIf Morris had left the cell open, both of Norris's statements would be true, as would Nobby's statement A, Morris's statement B, and Robby's statement A; a total of 5 truths.\nIn Robby's case, in detail:\nNorris A True\nB False\nNobby A True\nB False\nMorris A False\nB True\nDave A False\nB False (why did he bother to leave the\ncell door open?)", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "Let  \n\nG = the guard who was on duty that evening (and who therefore left the door open).\n\nWrite the eight statements in a form that can be evaluated for every possible choice of G.\n\n1.

Looking at the chronology:\n\n  1.  2 (June \u2192 Emma)\u2003\u21d2\u2003June had no sugar at step 2, so June was not an original sugar bowl.  \n  2. 10 (Daniel-Emma-Alice mix)\u2003\u21d2\u2003Daniel and Alice had no sugar at step 10, so neither was an\n     original sugar bowl.  \n  3. 14 (Tina\u2013Emma mix)\u2003\u21d2\u2003Tina had no sugar at step 14, so Tina was not an original sugar bowl.  \n  4. 11 (Oscar\u2013Quinn mix)\u2003\u21d2\u2003Oscar had no sugar at step 11, so Oscar was not an original sugar bowl.  \n  5. 15 (Kaleb\u2013Quinn mix)\u2003\u21d2\u2003Kaleb had no sugar at step 15, so Kaleb was not an original sugar bowl.\n\nWe have already ruled out Emma and Quinn themselves, so the list of\npeople who definitely did \u200bnot\u200b start with sugar is\n\n       {Alice, Daniel, Emma, June, Kaleb, Oscar, Quinn, Tina}.\n\nNext look at the very first few steps, because they are the only times\nbefore step 14 at which Tina could have been contaminated.\n\nStep 6\u2003(Watt \u2194 Tina)  \nStep 7\u2003(Flare \u2194 Tina)\n\nHence Tina could have obtained sugar only from Watt or from Flare.\nSince we already know Tina had no sugar by step 14, it follows that\n\n       Flare and Watt could not have had sugar before step 7.\n\nBut Flare had already mixed with Gabbi in step 5, and Gabbi had mixed\nwith June in step 4; therefore Gabbi (and June, already excluded) also\ncould not be original sugar bowls.

The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.\nIn this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.

The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then \u00bc(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then \u00bc(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation \u00bc(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.\nIf c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since \"couples\" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.\no+8o=9o.\nSo 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even.

{"ID": 247, "Question": "You are a spy trying to gain access to a high profile building that contains very classified information.
