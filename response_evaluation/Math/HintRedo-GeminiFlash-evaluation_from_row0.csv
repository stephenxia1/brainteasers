0,"Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?
 Hint: To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.

Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)

[Point 2 is usually written as 0.2, but .2 is also correct.]",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's solve this challenge step-by-step, making sure to follow all the rules and use the hint provided.

The goal is to write an expression that evaluates to exactly 5, using only two '2' digits and any standard mathematical symbols, with the constraint that the specific symbols mentioned in the hint *must* be used.

The rules are:
1.  Use two, and only two, '2' digits in the final expression string.
2.  The expression must evaluate to exactly 5.
3.  Any mathematical symbols or operations known by most high school students are allowed.
4.  The expression *must* include operations or symbols from the hint: exponent, a minus (-) sign, brackets, square root, a decimal point.

Let's look at the hint symbols:
*   exponent (e.g., ^)
*   a minus (-) sign (e.g., for subtraction or negation)
*   brackets (e.g., ())
*   square root (e.g., sqrt())
*   a decimal point (e.g., .)

We need to combine exactly two '2' digits with these symbols to get 5.

Let's try to incorporate the required symbols and the two '2' digits.
We must use a decimal point, which means we can form numbers like .2 (0.2), 2. (2), 2.2, .22, etc., ensuring we only use the digit '2' twice in total. Based on the rule of using only two '2's, numbers like 2.2 (.2 + 2) or .2 + .2 would not be allowed as they use more than two '2' digits in the expression string itself, if we follow the examples like (2^2)! which uses the digit '2' exactly twice. Let's assume ""using two, and only two, 2s"" means the digit '2' appears exactly twice in the final expression string, consistent with the (2^2)! example.

So, possible numbers involving two '2' digits could be 22, 2.2, or .22. Or we could use two separate '2's like '2' and '2' combined with operations (e.g., 2+2, 2^2). However, the hint requires a decimal point, so we must use a decimal number formed with at least one '2'. To use exactly two '2' digits in total, we could use a number like 2.2 or .22, or we could use one '2' in a decimal number and the other '2' elsewhere in the expression. The phrasing ""two, and only two, 2s"" suggests the latter case is more likely what is meant when combined with standard operations, where the two '2's are the inputs to the operations. Let's assume we have two instances of the number 2 available to manipulate. If one instance is used to create '.2', we have used one '2'. The other '2' is still available.

Let's try using one '2' to make a decimal number, like .2 (which is 0.2). This uses one of our two '2's and the decimal point symbol. We have one '2' left, and we still need to use exponent, minus, brackets, and square root, and combine everything to get 5.

We have 0.2. How can we use the remaining '2' and the required operations (exponent, minus, brackets, square root) to get 5?
Let's think about the number 5. We know that sqrt(25) = 5. Can we create 25 using 0.2, the number 2, and the required operations?
We also know that 1 / 0.2 = 5. Can we create 1/0.2 using the number 2 and the required operations?

Let's try to create 1/0.2. We have 0.2 and the number 2.",True,1,0,0

Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0
6,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?
 Hint: A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8

Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0
7,"Question: Find the radius of the inscribed and circumscribed circles for a triangle.
 Hint: Try to use the area of the triangle",Try to use the area of the triangle,"Let a, b, and c be the sides of the triangle. Let s be the semiperimeter, i.e. s = (a + b + c) / 2. Let A be the area of the triangle, and let x be the radius of the incircle.
Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.
We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).
The radius of the circumscribed circle is given by R = abc/4A.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's find the formulas for the radius of the inscribed circle (inradius) and the radius of the circumscribed circle (circumradius) for a triangle, using the area of the triangle as suggested by the hint.

Let the triangle be denoted by ABC, with side lengths *a*, *b*, and *c* opposite to vertices A, B, and C respectively. Let *A* (or sometimes *K*) denote the area of the triangle.

**1. Finding the Radius of the Inscribed Circle (Inradius), denoted by *r***

The inscribed circle (incircle) is a circle inside the triangle that is tangent to all three sides. Its center is the incenter, which is the intersection of the angle bisectors. The radius *r* is the perpendicular distance from the incenter to each side.

*   **Reasoning using Area:**
    Let the incenter be *I*. We can divide the triangle ABC into three smaller triangles by connecting the incenter *I* to the vertices A, B, and C. These three triangles are IBC, ICA, and IAB.
    *   Triangle IBC has base *a* (side BC). The height of this triangle from vertex *I* to the base *a* is the inradius *r*, because the incircle is tangent to side *a* at the point where the radius is perpendicular to the side.
    *   The area of triangle IBC is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * *a* * *r*.
    *   Similarly, Triangle ICA has base *b* (side AC) and height *r*. Its area is (1/2) * *b* * *r*.
    *   Triangle IAB has base *c* (side AB) and height *r*. Its area is (1/2) * *c* * *r*.

    The total area of triangle ABC is the sum of the areas of these three smaller triangles:
    *A* = Area(IBC) + Area(ICA) + Area(IAB)
    *A* = (1/2) * *a* * *r* + (1/2) * *b* * *r* + (1/2) * *c* * *r*

    We can factor out (1/2) * *r* from the right side:
    *A* = (1/2) * *r* * (*a* + *b* + *c*)

    Let *s* be the semi-perimeter of the triangle, which is half of the perimeter:
    *s* = (*a* + *b* + *c*) / 2
    So, *a* + *b* + *c* = 2*s*.

    Substitute this into the area equation:
    *A* = (1/2) * *r* * (2*s*)
    *A* = *r* * *s*

    Now, we can solve for the inradius *r*:
    *r* = *A* / *s*

*   **Formula for Inradius:** The radius of the inscribed circle *r* is given by the formula:
    *r* = *A* / *s*
    where *A* is the area of the triangle and *s* is the semi-perimeter (*s* = (*a* + *b* + *c*) / 2).

**2. Finding the Radius of the Circumscribed Circle (Circumradius), denoted by *R***

The circumscribed circle (circumcircle) is a circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle. Its center is the circumcenter, which is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides. The radius *R* is the distance from the circumcenter to each vertex.

*   **Reasoning using Area and Sine Rule:**
    We know the area of a triangle can be expressed using two sides and the sine of the included angle. For example:
    *A* = (1/2) * *b* * *c* * sin(A)
    *A* = (1/2) * *a* * *c* * sin(B)
    *A* = (1/2) * *a* * *b* * sin(C)

    The hint is to use the area. We also need to bring the circumradius *R* into the picture. The Sine Rule relates the side lengths, the sines of the opposite angles, and the circumradius:
    *a* / sin(A) = *b* / sin(B) = *c* / sin(C) = 2*R

    From the Sine Rule, we can express the sine of each angle in terms of the side opposite to it and *R*:
    sin(A) = *a* / (2*R)
    sin(B) = *b* / (2*R)
    sin(C) = *c* / (2*R)

    Let's take the area formula *A* = (1/2) * *b* * *c* * sin(A) and substitute the expression for sin(A) from the Sine Rule:
    *A* = (1/2) * *b* * *c* * (*a* / (2*R))

    Multiply the terms on the right side:
    *A* = (*a* * *b* * *c*) / (4*R)

    This equation relates the area *A*, the side lengths *a*, *b*, *c*, and the circumradius *R*. We can solve for *R*:
    *R* = (*a* * *b* * *c*) / (4 * *A*)

    We could have used any of the area formulas involving sine and substituted the corresponding angle from the Sine Rule, and we would get the same result. For example, using *A* = (1/2) * *a* * *c* * sin(B) and sin(B) = *b* / (2*R) yields:
    *A* = (1/2) * *a* * *c* * (*b* / (2*R)) = (*a* * *b* * *c*) / (4*R)

*   **Formula for Circumradius:** The radius of the circumscribed circle *R* is given by the formula:
    *R* = (*a* * *b* * *c*) / (4 * *A*)
    where *a*, *b*, *c* are the lengths of the sides of the triangle and *A* is the area of the triangle.

**3. How to find the Area *A*?**

To use the formulas for *r* and *R*, you typically need to know the side lengths of the triangle. If you have the side lengths *a*, *b*, and *c*, the area *A* can be calculated using Heron's formula:

First, calculate the semi-perimeter *s*:
*s* = (*a* + *b* + *c*) / 2

Then, the area *A* is:
*A* = sqrt(*s* (*s* - *a*) (*s* - *b*) (*s* - *c*))

**In summary:**

To find the radii of the inscribed and circumscribed circles for a triangle with side lengths *a*, *b*, and *c*:

1.  Calculate the semi-perimeter: *s* = (*a* + *b* + *c*) / 2.
2.  Calculate the area using Heron's formula: *A* = sqrt(*s* (*s* - *a*) (*s* - *b*) (*s* - *c*)).
3.  Calculate the inradius: *r* = *A* / *s*.
4.  Calculate the circumradius: *R* = (*a* * *b* * *c*) / (4 * *A*).

Final answer: The radius of the inscribed circle (*r*) is given by *r* = *A* / *s*, where *A* is the area of the triangle and *s* is its semi-perimeter. The radius of the circumscribed circle (*R*) is given by *R* = (*a* * *b* * *c*) / (4 * *A*), where *a*, *b*, and *c* are the side lengths and *A* is the area of the triangle. The area *A* can be calculated using Heron's formula: *A* = sqrt(*s*(*s* - *a*) (*s* - *b*) (*s* - *c*)) with *s* = (*a* + *b* + *c*) / 2.",True,1,0,0
8,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""
""The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.""
Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.
 Hint: You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.

Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:

- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""

Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""

But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List.

10,"Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?
 Hint: The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly.

Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

8 = 4+4+4-4 = (4/4)*4+4 = ((4+4)/4)*4 = 4*4-4-4
9 = 4+4+4/4

When the back of the train passes Al, he and Ben have both walked 30 feet, meaning Ben will walk 15 feet more when the train passes him. 30 feet that Al walks plus 45 feet that Ben walks makes 75 feet that the back of the train travels in the same time that Ben walks 15 feet, meaning the train is 5 times as fast as Al and Ben.
In the time it takes Al to walk 30 feet, the front of the train moves 150 feet. This distance plus the 30 feet that Al has walked equals 180 feet.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $v_t$ be the speed of the train and $v_p$ be the speed of Al and Ben. Let $L$ be the length of the train.

Let's consider Al first. Al starts walking in the opposite direction of the train when the front of the train passes him. Let's set the starting point of Al (and Ben) as the origin, $x=0$, and time $t=0$ when the front of the train is at $x=0$. The train moves in the positive direction. The front of the train is at $x_f(t) = v_t t$ and the back of the train is at $x_b(t) = v_t t - L$. Al walks in the negative direction, so Al's position is $x_A(t) = -v_p t$.

Al stops walking when the back of the train passes him. This happens at a time $t_A$ when Al's position is the same as the back of the train's position:
$x_A(t_A) = x_b(t_A)$
$-v_p t_A = v_t t_A - L$
$L = v_t t_A + v_p t_A$
$L = (v_t + v_p) t_A$

Al walks at speed $v_p$ for time $t_A$, covering a distance of 30 feet. So, the distance Al walks is $d_A = v_p t_A$.
We are given $d_A = 30$ feet.
$30 = v_p t_A$.

From this equation, we can express $t_A$ as $t_A = 30/v_p$. Substituting this into the equation for $L$:
$L = (v_t + v_p) \left(\frac{30}{v_p}\right) = 30 \left(\frac{v_t + v_p}{v_p}\right) = 30 \left(\frac{v_t}{v_p} + 1\right)$.

Now let's consider Ben. Ben starts walking in the same direction as the train when the front of the train passes him (at $t=0$ at $x=0$). Ben walks in the positive direction, so Ben's position is $x_B(t) = v_p t$. The back of the train's position is still $x_b(t) = v_t t - L$.

Ben stops walking when the back of the train passes him. This happens at a time $t_B$ when Ben's position is the same as the back of the train's position:
$x_B(t_B) = x_b(t_B)$
$v_p t_B = v_t t_B - L$
$L = v_t t_B - v_p t_B$
$L = (v_t - v_p) t_B$
For the back of the train to catch up to Ben, the train must be moving faster than Ben, so $v_t > v_p$.

Ben walks at speed $v_p$ for time $t_B$, covering a distance of 45 feet. So, the distance Ben walks is $d_B = v_p t_B$.
We are given $d_B = 45$ feet.
$45 = v_p t_B$.

From this equation, we can express $t_B$ as $t_B = 45/v_p$. Substituting this into the equation for $L$:
$L = (v_t - v_p) \left(\frac{45}{v_p}\right) = 45 \left(\frac{v_t - v_p}{v_p}\right) = 45 \left(\frac{v_t}{v_p} - 1\right)$.

We now have two expressions for the length of the train $L$:
1) $L = 30 \left(\frac{v_t}{v_p} + 1\right)$
2) $L = 45 \left(\frac{v_t}{v_p} - 1\right)$

The hint suggests getting a ratio between the train's speed and the speed of Al and Ben. Let $r = \frac{v_t}{v_p}$.
The equations become:
1) $L = 30 (r + 1)$
2) $L = 45 (r - 1)$

We have a system of two linear equations in terms of $L$ and $r$. We can solve for $r$ by setting the expressions for $L$ equal to each other:
$30(r + 1) = 45(r - 1)$
$30r + 30 = 45r - 45$
Add 45 to both sides: $30r + 30 + 45 = 45r$
$30r + 75 = 45r$
Subtract $30r$ from both sides: $75 = 45r - 30r$
$75 = 15r$
Divide by 15: $r = \frac{75}{15} = 5$.

So, the speed of the train is 5 times the speed of Al and Ben ($v_t = 5v_p$).

Now we can find the length of the train $L$ by substituting the value of $r$ into either equation. Using equation (1):
$L = 30 (r + 1) = 30 (5 + 1) = 30 \times 6 = 180$.

Using equation (2) to verify:
$L = 45 (r - 1) = 45 (5 - 1) = 45 \times 4 = 180$.

Both equations give the same length, 180 feet. The length of the train is 180 feet.

The final answer is $\boxed{180 feet}$.",True,1,0,0
14,"Question: This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?
 Hint: Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers",Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
To find all Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00, set i = 1 and check all values of j.

""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.

""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?
 Hint: Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

 Hint: 1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.

Sandy says: ""If Sue gives me some dollars, we'll have the same amount of money. But if I give Sue the same number of dollars, she'll have twice as much money as I have.""
Sue says: ""And if you remove the first digit of my wealth and place it to the end, you'll get Sandy's wealth.""
If neither of them has more than 1 million dollars, how many dollars do they each have?
 Hint: First get the ratio, then get their amount.","First get the ratio, then get their amount.","Let X and Y be Sandy's and Sue's amounts of money, respectively. Let Z be the number of dollars in Sandy's statement.
Then X+Z=Y-Z and 2(X-Z)=Y+Z. Solving this we get X=5Z and Y=7Z.
According to Sue's statement, let A be the first digit of Sue's wealth, B be the remaining digits, and n be the number of digits, then Y=A*10^(n-1)+B and X=10B+A.
7X=5Y
7*(10B+A)=5*(A*10^(n-1)+B)
(5*10^(n-1)-7)A=65B
Since 65B is divisible by 5 and 5*10^(n-1)-7 is not, A must equal 5. We get:
5*10^(n-1)-7=13B
The least value of n such that 5*10^(n-1)-7 is a multiple of 13 is 6:
499993=38461*13
The next is 12, which makes them have more than 1 million dollars. Hence n=6 and B=38461.
Therefore, Sandy has 384615 dollars and Sue has 538461 dollars.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let S be the amount of money Sandy has, and U be the amount of money Sue has. Both S and U are whole numbers and are no more than 1,000,000. So, 0 ≤ S ≤ 1,000,000 and 0 ≤ U ≤ 1,000,000.

Let's analyze Sandy's statements:
1. ""If Sue gives me some dollars, we'll have the same amount of money.""
   Let the amount given by Sue be x. Since Sue gives dollars, x must be a positive whole number (if x=0, they already have the same amount, S=U).
   Sandy's new amount: S + x
   Sue's new amount: U - x
   S + x = U - x
   2x = U - S
   This implies U - S is an even positive number, so U > S. Also, x = (U - S) / 2. Since x is a whole number, U - S must be divisible by 2.

2. ""But if I give Sue the same number of dollars, she'll have twice as much money as I have.""
   The ""same number of dollars"" is x = (U - S) / 2.
   Sandy's new amount: S - x
   Sue's new amount: U + x
   U + x = 2(S - x)
   Substitute x = (U - S) / 2 into the equation:
   U + (U - S) / 2 = 2(S - (U - S) / 2)
   Multiply the entire equation by 2 to clear denominators:
   2U + (U - S) = 4(S - (U - S) / 2)
   3U - S = 4S - 2(U - S)
   3U - S = 4S - 2U + 2S
   3U - S = 6S - 2U
   Add 2U to both sides:
   5U - S = 6S
   Add S to both sides:
   5U = 7S

This equation gives us the ratio of their wealth: S/U = 5/7. This means S is proportional to 5 and U is proportional to 7. Let S = 5k and U = 7k for some positive number k. Since S and U are whole numbers, k must be a rational number such that 5k and 7k are integers. The simplest case is when k is an integer. Given the context of dollars, k must be a positive integer (if k=0, S=U=0, which doesn't fit the ""some dollars"" condition).

Let's verify Sandy's statements with the ratio S=5k, U=7k:
x = (U - S) / 2 = (7k - 5k) / 2 = 2k / 2 = k. For x to be a whole number, k must be a whole number.
Statement 1: S+x = 5k+k = 6k. U-x = 7k-k = 6k. They are equal.
Statement 2: S-x = 5k-k = 4k. U+x = 7k+k = 8k. Is U+x = 2(S-x)? 8k = 2(4k). Yes, it is.
So, any solution (S, U) must be of the form (5k, 7k) for a positive integer k.

Now, let's analyze Sue's statement:
""And if you remove the first digit of my wealth and place it to the end, you'll get Sandy's wealth.""
Let U be a number with n digits. Let the first digit be d.
U can be written as U = d * 10^(n-1) + R, where R is the number formed by the remaining n-1 digits. R is an integer such that 0 ≤ R < 10^(n-1). The first digit d must be between 1 and 9 (since U is a positive amount).
Removing the first digit d leaves the number R. Placing d at the end of R results in the number 10 * R + d.
According to Sue, this resulting number is equal to Sandy's wealth S.
S = 10R + d

We have two relationships:
1) S = 5k and U = 7k
2) S = 10R + d, where U = d * 10^(n-1) + R

Substitute S and U from (1) into (2):
5k = 10R + d
7k = d * 10^(n-1) + R

We have a system of two equations with variables k, R, d, and n. We know k is a positive integer, d is an integer from 1 to 9, and n is the number of digits of U = 7k.

From the first equation: d = 5k - 10R. Substitute this into the second equation:
7k = (5k - 10R) * 10^(n-1) + R
7k = 5k * 10^(n-1) - 10R * 10^(n-1) + R
7k = 5k * 10^(n-1) - 10^n * R + R
7k = 5k * 10^(n-1) - (10^n - 1)R

This still involves R. Let's eliminate R differently.
From 5k = 10R + d, R = (5k - d) / 10.
Substitute this R into 7k = d * 10^(n-1) + R:
7k = d * 10^(n-1) + (5k - d) / 10
Multiply by 10:
70k = 10 * d * 10^(n-1) + (5k - d)
70k = d * 10^n + 5k - d
65k = d * 10^n - d
65k = d * (10^n - 1)

Now we have an equation relating k, d, and n: 65k = d * (10^n - 1).
We know:
- k is a positive integer.
- d is an integer from 1 to 9.
- n is the number of digits in U = 7k.
- S = 5k ≤ 1,000,000 and U = 7k ≤ 1,000,000.
The constraint U ≤ 1,000,000 means 7k ≤ 1,000,000, so k ≤ 1,000,000 / 7 ≈ 142857.14.
Thus, k can be any integer from 1 to 142857.
U = 7k can have up to 6 digits (7 * 142857 = 999999). If U = 1,000,000, n=7, d=1, R=0. S = 10*0+1 = 1. Then U/S = 1000000/1 = 1000000, not 7/5. So U must be less than 1,000,000. This means U has at most 6 digits, so n can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Let's test possible values for n from 1 to 6:
The equation is 65k = d * (10^n - 1). (10^n - 1) is a number consisting of n nines.

Case n=1: 65k = d * (10^1 - 1) = 9d.
65k = 9d. Since gcd(65, 9) = 1, k must be a multiple of 9. Let k=9m. 65(9m) = 9d => 65m = d. Since d is 1-9, 65m must be 1-9. No positive integer m satisfies this.

Case n=2: 65k = d * (10^2 - 1) = 99d.
65k = 99d. Since gcd(65, 99) = 1, k must be a multiple of 99. Let k=99m. 65(99m) = 99d => 65m = d. No positive integer m satisfies this.

Case n=3: 65k = d * (10^3 - 1) = 999d.
65k = 999d. Since gcd(65, 999) = 1, k must be a multiple of 999. Let k=999m. 65(999m) = 999d => 65m = d. No positive integer m satisfies this.

Case n=4: 65k = d * (10^4 - 1) = 9999d.
65k = 9999d. Since gcd(65, 9999) = 1, k must be a multiple of 9999. Let k=9999m. 65(9999m) = 9999d => 65m = d. No positive integer m satisfies this.

Case n=5: 65k = d * (10^5 - 1) = 99999d.
65k = 99999d. Since gcd(65, 99999) = 1, k must be a multiple of 99999. Let k=99999m. 65(99999m) = 99999d => 65m = d. No positive integer m satisfies this.

Case n=6: 65k = d * (10^6 - 1) = 999999d.
65k = 999999d.
Divide both sides by gcd(65, 999999).
65 = 5 * 13
999999 = 9 * 111111 = 9 * 111 * 1001 = 9 * (3 * 37) * (7 * 11 * 13).
gcd(65, 999999) = 13.
Divide the equation by 13:
(65/13)k = (999999/13)d
5k = 76923d
Now, gcd(5, 76923) = 1. So, k must be a multiple of 76923. Let k = 76923m for some positive integer m.
Substitute k back into the equation:
5 * (76923m) = 76923d
5m = d
Since d is a single digit from 1 to 9, possible values for 5m are 5.
If 5m = 5, then m = 1.
If m = 1, then d = 5.
If m = 1, then k = 76923 * 1 = 76923.

Now we have found a potential value for k: k=76923. Let's calculate S and U.
S = 5k = 5 * 76923 = 384615.
U = 7k = 7 * 76923 = 538461.

Let's check if these values satisfy all the conditions:
- S and U are whole numbers: Yes, 384615 and 538461 are integers.
- Neither has more than $1,000,000: S = 384615 ≤ 1,000,000 and U = 538461 ≤ 1,000,000. Yes.
- Sandy's statements: We derived S=5k and U=7k from Sandy's statements. k=76923 is a positive integer, so the ratio holds, and Sandy's statements are satisfied.
- Sue's statement: U = 538461. The number of digits is n=6. The first digit is d=5. The remaining part is R=38461.
  Remove the first digit (5) and place it at the end: 10 * R + d = 10 * 38461 + 5 = 384610 + 5 = 384615.
  Is this equal to S? Yes, S = 384615.

All conditions are met. Since we systematically checked all possible numbers of digits for U (up to the maximum allowed by the constraint) and found only one possible value for k (which led to m=1 and d=5), this solution is unique.

Sandy has $384,615.
Sue has $538,461.

Final verification of the first condition: ""If Sue gives me some dollars, we'll have the same amount of money.""
The amount is x = k = 76923.
If Sue gives $76923 to Sandy:
Sandy's new amount: 384615 + 76923 = 461538
Sue's new amount: 538461 - 76923 = 461538
They have the same amount. This works.

Final verification of the second condition: ""But if I give Sue the same number of dollars, she'll have twice as much money as I have.""
The amount is x = 76923.
If Sandy gives $76923 to Sue:
Sandy's new amount: 384615 - 76923 = 307692
Sue's new amount: 538461 + 76923 = 615384
Is Sue's amount twice Sandy's? 615384 / 307692 = 2. Yes, it is. This works.

All conditions are perfectly satisfied.

The final answer is $\boxed{Sandy has 384615 dollars and Sue has 538461 dollars}$.",True,1,0,0

The given problems are:
1. 2 + 2 = 12
2. 5 - 3 = 62
3. 3 x 4 = 61
4. 6 / 3 = 83

We need to find a rule that takes the two input numbers and the operation symbol and produces the two-digit output number. Let's assume the output number is formed by two digits, A and B, where A is the tens digit and B is the units digit (Output = 10*A + B).

Let's look at the digits of the output for each example:
1. 2 + 2 = 12  -> A=1, B=2. Inputs x=2, y=2. Operation '+'.
2. 5 - 3 = 62  -> A=6, B=2. Inputs x=5, y=3. Operation '-'.
3. 3 x 4 = 61  -> A=6, B=1. Inputs x=3, y=4. Operation 'x'.
4. 6 / 3 = 83  -> A=8, B=3. Inputs x=6, y=3. Operation '/'.

Let's analyze the second digit (B):
For '+', B=2.
For '-', B=2.
For 'x', B=1.
For '/', B=3.

It appears the second digit B depends only on the operation performed.
Rule for B:
- If the operation is '+' or '-', B = 2.
- If the operation is 'x', B = 1.
- If the operation is '/', B = 3.

Let's verify this rule for B with the given examples:
1. 2 + 2 = 12. Operation is '+'. B should be 2. The output is 12, B is 2. Match.
2. 5 - 3 = 62. Operation is '-'. B should be 2. The output is 62, B is 2. Match.
3. 3 x 4 = 61. Operation is 'x'. B should be 1. The output is 61, B is 1. Match.
4. 6 / 3 = 83. Operation is '/'. B should be 3. The output is 83, B is 3. Match.

The rule for B seems correct.

Now, let's analyze the first digit (A):
1. 2 + 2 = 12  -> A=1. Inputs x=2, y=2. Operation '+'.
2. 5 - 3 = 62  -> A=6. Inputs x=5, y=3. Operation '-'.
3. 3 x 4 = 61  -> A=6. Inputs x=3, y=4. Operation 'x'.
4. 6 / 3 = 83  -> A=8. Inputs x=6, y=3. Operation '/'.

Let's look for a pattern involving the inputs (x, y) and the operation that results in A.
Consider the sum of the inputs (x+y):
1. 2 + 2 = 4. A=1. (4 -> 1)
2. 5 + 3 = 8. A=6. (8 -> 6)
3. 3 + 4 = 7. A=6. (7 -> 6)
4. 6 + 3 = 9. A=8. (9 -> 8)

Let's see the difference between the sum (x+y) and the digit A:
1. 4 - 1 = 3. (For '+')
2. 8 - 6 = 2. (For '-')
3. 7 - 6 = 1. (For 'x')
4. 9 - 8 = 1. (For '/')

This difference seems to depend on the operation. Let's call this difference 'offset_A'.
Rule for A: A = (x+y) - offset_A(operation), where the offset_A values are:
- offset_A('+') = 3
- offset_A('-') = 2
- offset_A('x') = 1
- offset_A('/') = 1

Let's verify this rule for A with the given examples:
1. 2 + 2 = 12. x=2, y=2, op='+'. A = (2+2) - offset_A('+') = 4 - 3 = 1. Match.
2. 5 - 3 = 62. x=5, y=3, op='-'. A = (5+3) - offset_A('-') = 8 - 2 = 6. Match.
3. 3 x 4 = 61. x=3, y=4, op='x'. A = (3+4) - offset_A('x') = 7 - 1 = 6. Match.
4. 6 / 3 = 83. x=6, y=3, op='/'. A = (6+3) - offset_A('/') = 9 - 1 = 8. Match.

The rules for both A and B are consistent with all four examples.

Now we need to apply these rules to calculate 1 - 3.
Here, the inputs are x=1 and y=3, and the operation is '-'.

Step 1: Find the second digit (B).
The operation is '-'. According to the rule for B, if the operation is '-' or '+', B = 2.
So, B = 2.

Step 2: Find the first digit (A).
The operation is '-'. According to the rule for A, A = (x+y) - offset_A('-').
The offset_A for '-' is 2.
A = (1 + 3) - 2
A = 4 - 2
A = 2.

Step 3: Combine the digits A and B to form the output number.
Output = 10 * A + B
Output = 10 * 2 + 2
Output = 20 + 2
Output = 22.

Therefore, according to the Quocorrian system described by the examples, 1 - 3 equals 22.

The final answer is $\boxed{22}$.",True,0,0,0

Take .2 and raise it to the power of -2 and then take the square root.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step, carefully following the instructions and using the provided hint.

1.  **Understand the Goal:** We need to create a mathematical expression that evaluates to the number 5.

2.  **Identify the Building Blocks:**
    *   We are allowed to use the digit '2' only *twice*. This means the character '2' must appear exactly two times in our final expression.
    *   We can use any combination of mathematical signs, symbols, and functions.
    *   The hint provides a list of specific operations/symbols that *must* be used: exponent, a minus (-) sign, brackets, square root, and a decimal point.

3.  **Analyze the Hint and Constraints:**
    *   We must use an exponent (like ^).
    *   We must use a minus sign (-). This can be for subtraction (binary operator) or negation (unary operator).
    *   We must use brackets ().
    *   We must use a square root (sqrt or $\sqrt{}$). Since we want to get 5, a promising approach is to put 25 inside a square root, as $\sqrt{25} = 5$.
    *   We must use a decimal point (.).
    *   We can only use the digit '2' twice.

4.  **Combine Constraints:** We need to form the number 5 using two '2's, including a decimal point, an exponent, a minus sign, brackets, and a square root.

5.  **How to incorporate the decimal point and the two '2's?** Since we can only use '2' twice, possible numbers we can form involving a decimal point are:
    *   .2 (which represents 0.2, using one '2' and '.')
    *   2. (which represents 2, using one '2' and '.')
    *   2.2 (which represents two point two, using two '2's and '.')

6.  **Explore the Square Root:** If the solution involves $\sqrt{X} = 5$, then X must be 25. Can we form 25 using the two '2's and the required operations (exponent, minus, brackets, decimal point)?

7.  **Try using .2:** If we use .2, we have used one '2' and the decimal point. We have one '2' left. We also need to use exponent, minus, and brackets to form 25, which will then go inside the square root.
    *   We have the number 0.2 (from .2) and the digit 2.
    *   We need to combine 0.2 and 2 using exponent (^), minus (-), and brackets () to get 25.
    *   Consider the number 0.2. As a fraction, 0.2 = 1/5.
    *   How can we turn 1/5 into 25 using the digit 2, exponent, minus, and brackets?
    *   If we raise 1/5 to a power, $(1/5)^x = 25$. This requires $x = -2$.
    *   So, $(0.2)^{-2} = (1/5)^{-2} = 5^2 = 25$.
    *   Let's see if the expression $(.2)^{-2}$ uses the required components to form 25:
        *   Uses one '2' (in .2).
        *   Uses the decimal point (in .2).
        *   Uses the exponent operator (^).
        *   Uses the number -2 as the exponent. This number -2 uses the second '2' as a digit and the minus sign.
        *   So, the expression $(.2)^{-2}$ successfully uses both '2's, the decimal point, the exponent operator, and the minus sign.
        *   It does not explicitly use brackets yet as required by the hint, although brackets around the base (.2) or the exponent (-2) are often used for clarity or syntax, especially with negative exponents. $(.2)^{(-2)}$ is a common way to write this.

8.  **Incorporate Square Root and Brackets:** We found that $(.2)^{-2} = 25$. To get 5, we take the square root: $\sqrt{(.2)^{-2}}$.
    *   This uses the square root symbol ($\sqrt{}$).
    *   Now we need to ensure brackets are used as required by the hint. The expression $\sqrt{(.2)^{-2}}$ already uses parentheses around the base (.2). However, the negative exponent notation often requires brackets around the *exponent* for strict adherence to syntax rules or for clarity. Let's write it as $\sqrt{(.2)^{(-2)}}$. This uses parentheses around the exponent (-2).

9.  **Verify the Proposed Solution:** Let's check if the expression $\sqrt{(.2)^{(-2)}}$ meets all the requirements:
    *   Uses only two 2's: Yes, the digit '2' appears after the decimal point (.2) and as the digit in the exponent (-2). Exactly two '2's are used.
    *   Uses exponent: Yes, the power is (-2).
    *   Uses a minus sign: Yes, in (-2).
    *   Uses brackets: Yes, around the exponent (-2).
    *   Uses square root: Yes, the $\sqrt{}$ symbol.
    *   Uses a decimal point: Yes, in .2.
    *   Evaluates to 5: $\sqrt{(.2)^{(-2)}} = \sqrt{(1/5)^{-2}} = \sqrt{5^2} = \sqrt{25} = 5$.

All conditions are met.

The expression $\sqrt{(.2)^{(-2)}}$ is a valid solution.

Final check on other options:
*   Using 2. (value 2): Combine 2 and the other 2 with ^, -, (), sqrt. $\sqrt{(2)^{something}}$ or $\sqrt{something - 2}$ etc. seems hard to get 25.
*   Using 2.2 (value 2.2): Combine 2.2 with ^, -, (), sqrt to get 5. Also seems difficult to manipulate 2.2 into 25 using these operations.

The path using .2 leading to $(.2)^{-2} = 25$ seems the most direct way to utilize the specific required operations, especially the decimal point and negative exponentiation, to get the value 25 needed for the square root.

The final expression is $\sqrt{(.2)^{(-2)}}$.

The final answer is $\sqrt{(.2)^{(-2)}}$.",True,1,0,0

Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.

(Since our answer only needs two dimensions, we will convert them into square (building), circle (open area), and rectangle (corner office).
[The Pythagorean theorem will solve for the root of the radius]
Let a represent the length of the rectangle, then x-a be the radius of the circle minus the length of the rectangle, same to b (to width of the rectangle):
a^2 + b^2 = x^2
(x - a)^2 + (x - b)^2 = x^2
x^2 = (x - 16)(x - 16) + (x - 8)(x - 8)
[Use foil to expand the brackets]
x^2 = (x^2 - 16x - 16x + 256) + (x^2 - 8x - 8x + 64)

If wood is $10 per m^3:
10 * 109876 = $1 098 760",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, Mr. Math is on the case! Let's break this down step by step, following the geometry described and using the hint provided.

**1. Understanding the Geometry**

We have a perfect cube with an open cylindrical area inscribed within it.
*   Let the side length of the perfect cube be 's'.
*   Since the cylinder is inscribed, its circular base must be inscribed in the square base of the cube, and its height must equal the height of the cube.
*   The diameter of the cylinder's base is equal to the side length of the cube, so 2 * radius (r) = s. Thus, r = s/2.
*   The height of the cylinder (h) is equal to the side length of the cube, so h = s.
*   Let R be the radius of the cylinder, so R = r = s/2. This means s = 2R.
*   The dimensions of the cube are s x s x s, or 2R x 2R x 2R.
*   The dimensions of the cylinder are radius R and height h = 2R.

**2. Interpreting the Corner Office**

The problem states there's a corner office with dimensions 16 meters by 8 meters, which ""extends to the edge of the open area"". This refers to the floor plan of the building.
*   Let's consider the base of the cube, which is a square of side 's'.
*   Let's place the center of this square (and the center of the cylinder's circular base) at the origin (0,0) of a coordinate system.
*   The square base extends from x = -s/2 to x = s/2 and y = -s/2 to y = s/2. Since R = s/2, the square extends from x = -R to x = R and y = -R to y = R.
*   The cylindrical area is the region inside the circle x² + y² = R².
*   A ""corner office"" is typically located in one of the four corner regions of the square base that lies *outside* the circle. Let's consider the corner in the first quadrant, where x > 0 and y > 0. This corner of the square is the region [0, R] x [0, R].
*   The office is a rectangle with dimensions 16x8 meters within this corner region. Since it's a corner office, two of its sides must lie along the edges of the square base (i.e., along x=R and y=R, assuming the origin is at the center).
*   Let the dimensions 16 and 8 be measured inwards from the corner (R, R).
*   So, the office occupies the rectangular area defined by the x-range [R - 16, R] and the y-range [R - 8, R] (or vice versa, [R - 8, R] and [R - 16, R]). The area of this rectangle is indeed (R - (R-16)) * (R - (R-8)) = 16 * 8 = 128 m².
*   The phrase ""extends to the edge of the open area"" means the inner corner of this office rectangle must lie on the boundary of the open cylindrical area, which is the circle x² + y² = R².
*   The coordinates of this inner corner are (R - 16, R - 8).

**3. Formulating the Equation using the Hint**

The hint states: ""Formulate an equation where the hypotenuse of the two squared unknown distances will equal the radius of the building.""
*   The inner corner of the office is at (R - 16, R - 8). These are coordinates relative to the center (0,0). These can be seen as two distances from the center along x and y directions.
*   The distance of this point from the origin (0,0) is sqrt((R - 16)² + (R - 8)²).
*   Since this point lies on the circle x² + y² = R², its distance from the origin is exactly R.
*   So, sqrt((R - 16)² + (R - 8)²) = R.
*   Squaring both sides gives the equation: (R - 16)² + (R - 8)² = R².
*   This matches the hint: the sum of the squares of the two ""unknown distances"" (R-16 and R-8, the coordinates of the inner corner) equals the square of the radius R (the hypotenuse in this context).

**4. Solving the Equation for R**

Now we solve the quadratic equation:
(R - 16)² + (R - 8)² = R²
Expand the squared terms:
(R² - 32R + 256) + (R² - 16R + 64) = R²
Combine like terms:
2R² - 48R + 320 = R²
Move all terms to one side:
2R² - R² - 48R + 320 = 0
R² - 48R + 320 = 0

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula R = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a, where a=1, b=-48, c=320.
R = [48 ± sqrt((-48)² - 4 * 1 * 320)] / (2 * 1)
R = [48 ± sqrt(2304 - 1280)] / 2
R = [48 ± sqrt(1024)] / 2
R = [48 ± 32] / 2

We get two possible solutions for R:
R1 = (48 + 32) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40
R2 = (48 - 32) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8

**5. Validating the Solution for R**

R is the radius of the cylinder (and half the side length of the cube). The inner corner of the office is at coordinates (R - 16, R - 8). For this point to be the inner corner of a 16x8 office located in the first quadrant corner [0, R] x [0, R], its coordinates must be non-negative.
*   R - 16 ≥ 0 => R ≥ 16
*   R - 8 ≥ 0 => R ≥ 8

Both conditions must be met.
*   For R = 40: 40 ≥ 16 (True) and 40 ≥ 8 (True). This solution is valid. The inner corner is at (40-16, 40-8) = (24, 32), which is in the first quadrant.
*   For R = 8: 8 ≥ 16 (False) and 8 ≥ 8 (True). This solution is not valid because R=8 would mean the office dimensions from the corner inwards are 16 and 8, but the corner coordinates (8,8) are smaller than 16 in one direction. An office of 16x8 starting from the corner (8,8) inwards would require coordinates like (8-16, 8-8) = (-8,0), which is outside the first quadrant and doesn't fit the geometry of an office within the [0,R]x[0,R] corner area.

Thus, the only valid solution is R = 40 meters.

**6. Calculating the Building Dimensions**

*   Radius of the cylinder, R = 40 meters.
*   Side length of the cube, s = 2R = 2 * 40 = 80 meters.
*   Height of the cylinder, h = s = 80 meters.

The final dimension of the perfect cube is its side length: 80 meters.
The dimensions of the cylinder are its radius (40 meters) and its height (80 meters).

**7. Addressing the Alternate Question: Cost of Offices**

The alternate question asks for the cost if ""all the offices"" are made out of solid wood at $10 per m³.
*   The building is a cube with an inscribed cylinder. The ""open cylindrical area"" is likely the empty or main space. The ""offices"" are the areas within the cube but outside the cylinder.
*   We identified a corner office with a floor area of 16x8 = 128 m². This is one of potentially four such offices on each floor level within the corners of the square floor plan (x > 0, y > 0; x < 0, y > 0; x < 0, y < 0; x > 0, y < 0).
*   Assuming ""all offices"" refers to these four corner office volumes, and assuming these offices extend the full height of the building (which is 80 meters, the height of the cube), we can calculate their total volume.
*   Area of one corner office floor plan = 16 m * 8 m = 128 m².
*   There are four such corner offices on each level. Total area on one level designated as offices = 4 * 128 m² = 512 m².
*   Assuming these offices run the full height of the building (80 m), the total volume of ""all offices"" = Total area on level * Height = 512 m² * 80 m = 40960 m³.
*   The cost is $10 per m³.
*   Total cost = Volume * Cost per m³ = 40960 m³ * $10/m³ = $409,600.

This interpretation assumes the 16x8 dimension defines the area of each of the four corner offices, and these offices occupy the full height of the cube. Another interpretation could be that *all* the volume within the cube but outside the cylinder is office space, but the specific 16x8 office suggests designated rectangular areas. Given the specific dimensions for the corner office, the interpretation of four such offices seems more likely than the entire irregular volume outside the cylinder being considered ""offices"" in this context.

**Calculations Summary:**
*   Equation: (R-16)² + (R-8)² = R²
*   Solved for R: R = 40 (valid), R = 8 (invalid)
*   Cylinder Radius: R = 40 m
*   Cube Side / Cylinder Height: s = 2R = 80 m
*   Volume of one corner office (based on 16x8 floor area and 80m height): 16 * 8 * 80 = 10240 m³
*   Number of corner offices: 4
*   Total volume of ""all offices"": 4 * 10240 m³ = 40960 m³
*   Cost per m³: $10
*   Total cost: 40960 * $10 = $409,600

The first question asks for the ""final dimension"" of the cube and cylinder. This usually refers to the defining dimensions (side length for a cube, radius and height for a cylinder).

Every day, except every four years when he abstains on Leap Day, he smokes the same number of cigarettes, brews the same amount of coffee grinds, and uses the same amount of cream in his coffee. Every day he buys the daily newspaper, which he purchases more often than a pack of 20 cigarettes. The pack of cigarettes is purchased more often than a half-pint of cream, which in turn is purchased more often than a one pound can of coffee. On Flag Day (USA) he purchased all four items.

The purchases are made according to 4 different cycles. There are 385 days from Flag Day until July Fourth of the following year excluding Leap Day. These purchasing cycles intersect every 385 days and are thus in the set of factors for 385 (1, 5, 7, 11, and 385). Since the newspaper is purchased every day, and the coffee and cream are purchased more often then the pack of cigarettes, then the pack is purchased either every 5 days or every 7 days.

250/6 = (x + 2)
x = 320.54 million dollars.
Therefore: increase in spending = 320.54 - 5 = 315.54 million",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"The problem asks us to find the amount of money the company needs to spend on research to achieve a profit of 80 million dollars. The profit function is given by $P(x) = 30 + 6 \log(x+2)$, where $x$ is the research spending in million dollars and $P(x)$ is the profit in million dollars. The hint confirms that the units for the numbers are in millions.

The current research investment is 5 million dollars, resulting in a profit $P(5)$. We are interested in the research investment level $x_1$ that yields a profit of 80 million dollars. So we need to solve the equation $P(x_1) = 80$ for $x_1$.

The profit function is $P(x) = 30 + 6 \log(x+2)$. The base of the logarithm is not explicitly specified. In mathematical and scientific contexts, ""log"" can refer to either the base-10 logarithm ($\log_{10}$) or the natural logarithm ($\ln$ or $\log_e$).

Let's analyze the equation $P(x_1) = 80$:
$30 + 6 \log(x_1+2) = 80$

Subtract 30 from both sides:
$6 \log(x_1+2) = 80 - 30$
$6 \log(x_1+2) = 50$

Divide both sides by 6:
$\log(x_1+2) = \frac{50}{6}$
$\log(x_1+2) = \frac{25}{3}$

Now we need to determine the base of the logarithm to solve for $x_1+2$.

Case 1: Assume the logarithm is the base-10 logarithm ($\log_{10}$).
$\log_{10}(x_1+2) = \frac{25}{3}$
By the definition of logarithm, this means:
$x_1+2 = 10^{25/3}$
$x_1 = 10^{25/3} - 2$

Let's calculate the value:
$25/3 \approx 8.333333$
$10^{25/3} \approx 10^{8.333333} = 10^{8} \times 10^{0.333333} \approx 10^8 \times 2.1544$
$10^{25/3} \approx 215,443,469.003$
$x_1 \approx 215,443,469.003 - 2 = 215,443,467.003$

If the base is 10, the company would have to spend approximately 215,443,467.003 million dollars on research. This is an extremely large amount (over 215 trillion dollars), which seems unrealistic in the context of a company's research budget.

Case 2: Assume the logarithm is the natural logarithm ($\ln$).
$\ln(x_1+2) = \frac{25}{3}$
By the definition of natural logarithm, this means:
$x_1+2 = e^{25/3}$
$x_1 = e^{25/3} - 2$

Let's calculate the value:
$25/3 \approx 8.333333$
$e^{25/3} \approx e^{8.333333} \approx 4154.5875$
$x_1 \approx 4154.5875 - 2 = 4152.5875$

If the base is $e$, the company would have to spend approximately 4152.5875 million dollars on research. This is about 4.15 billion dollars, which, while a significant amount, is a more plausible figure for a large company's research budget compared to the result from the base-10 assumption.

Given that the result from assuming the natural logarithm is significantly more realistic in the context of a business problem, it is highly probable that the natural logarithm is the intended base for ""log"" in this problem. We will proceed with this assumption.

Step-by-step derivation assuming $\log(x) = \ln(x)$:
1. The profit function is given as $P(x) = 30 + 6 \log(x+2)$. We assume $\log$ denotes the natural logarithm, $\ln$. So, $P(x) = 30 + 6 \ln(x+2)$.
2. We are looking for the research spending $x_1$ (in million dollars) that results in a profit of 80 million dollars. So we set $P(x_1) = 80$.
$30 + 6 \ln(x_1+2) = 80$
3. Solve for $\ln(x_1+2)$:
$6 \ln(x_1+2) = 80 - 30$
$6 \ln(x_1+2) = 50$
$\ln(x_1+2) = \frac{50}{6}$
$\ln(x_1+2) = \frac{25}{3}$
4. Solve for $x_1+2$ by exponentiating both sides with base $e$:
$e^{\ln(x_1+2)} = e^{25/3}$
$x_1+2 = e^{25/3}$
5. Solve for $x_1$:
$x_1 = e^{25/3} - 2$
6. Calculate the numerical value of $x_1$. Using a calculator:
$e^{25/3} \approx ",True,0,0,0

Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.

""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""

K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,1

48,"Question: You are a scenery creator for plays and you have just been asked to create the Balcony for Romeo and Juliet.
The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The balcony is like so in order for the spot light (that shines at a 45 degree angle to the roof) will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony.
Pine is cheap at exactly $1 per 5000cm^3, tax included.
Exactly how much money will you spend to build the balcony?
Conversions:
100cm = 1m
2.54cm = 1inch
 Hint: If the floor of the balcony is 4 meters from the ground, and the room is 7 meters, then the floor is 3 meters from the spotlight. If the spot light shines at a 45 degree angle and the spot light will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony, then the radius of the balcony floor will be 3 meters (if the hypotenuse of a triangle is at a 45 degree angle to the y axis (and the side x is 90 degrees to the side y), the side x will always equal the side y and the remaining side will be the hypotenuse of those [the rules of an isosceles triangle]).","If the floor of the balcony is 4 meters from the ground, and the room is 7 meters, then the floor is 3 meters from the spotlight.

Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:
let a represent the height of the room, then b represent the height of the balcony off the floor, then f represent the thickness of the balcony floor, then r represent a-b or the radius of the balcony floor, then h represent the height of the fence.
V = {[pi(a-b)^2]f + [pi(r)h + pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h]}

the price is then:
P ~= (9410640.79382822 / 5000) * 1.00
~= $1882.13",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:

1.  **Identify the components and required dimensions:**
    *   Balcony floor: Full circle, 30 cm thick.
    *   Balcony fence: Semicircle (half the perimeter of the floor), 1 m high, 10 cm thick.
    *   The height from the ground to the balcony floor is 4 m.
    *   The height from the ground to the spotlights (roof) is 7 m.

2.  **Determine the radius of the balcony floor:**
    *   The height difference between the balcony floor and the spotlight is 7 m - 4 m = 3 m.
    *   The spotlight is positioned above the middle of the balcony and shines at a 45-degree angle to the roof (which can be interpreted as 45 degrees downwards from the horizontal line at the spotlight level, or 45 degrees to the vertical line from the spotlight, pointing towards the edge of the balcony).
    *   The hint clarifies this: ""If the spot light shines at a 45 degree angle and the spot light will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony, then the radius of the balcony floor will be 3 meters"". This is because the height difference (3m), the radius (r), and the spotlight beam to the edge of the balcony form a right-angled triangle. With the angle being 45 degrees, this is an isosceles right-angled triangle, meaning the side opposite the 45-degree angle (the radius, r) must equal the side adjacent to it (the height difference, 3m).
    *   Therefore, the radius (r) of the balcony floor is 3 meters.

3.  **Convert all dimensions to centimeters:** Since the cost is given per cm³, it's easiest to work in centimeters.
    *   Radius (r) = 3 m = 3 * 100 cm = 300 cm.
    *   Balcony floor thickness = 30 cm.
    *   Balcony fence height = 1 m = 1 * 100 cm = 100 cm.
    *   Balcony fence thickness = 10 cm.

4.  **Calculate the volume of the balcony floor:**
    *   The floor is a full circle with radius r = 300 cm and thickness 30 cm.
    *   The area of the circle is A = π * r².
    *   A = π * (300 cm)² = π * 90000 cm².
    *   The volume of the floor is V_floor = Area * thickness.
    *   V_floor = π * 90000 cm² * 30 cm = π * 2700000 cm³.

5.  **Calculate the volume of the balcony fence:**
    *   The fence is a semicircle around half the perimeter of the circle.
    *   The full circumference of the circle is C = 2 * π * r.
    *   The length of the semicircular fence is half the circumference, which is L = (1/2) * C = (1/2) * 2 * π * r = π * r.
    *   L = π * 300 cm.
    *   The fence has a height of 100 cm and a thickness of 10 cm. It can be thought of as a curved rectangular prism with dimensions Length x Height x Thickness.
    *   The volume of the fence is V_fence = L * Height * Thickness.
    *   V_fence = (π * 300 cm) * (100 cm) * (10 cm) = π * 300 * 1000 cm³ = π * 300000 cm³.

6.  **Calculate the total volume of wood needed:**
    *   The total volume is the sum of the volume of the floor and the volume of the fence.
    *   Total Volume = V_floor + V_fence
    *   Total Volume = π * 2700000 cm³ + π * 300000 cm³
    *   Total Volume = π * (2700000 + 300000) cm³
    *   Total Volume = π * 3000000 cm³.

7.  **Calculate the total cost:**
    *   The cost of pine is $1 per 5000 cm³.
    *   To find the total cost, divide the total volume by the volume unit (5000 cm³) and multiply by the cost per unit ($1).
    *   Total Cost = (Total Volume / 5000 cm³) * $1
    *   Total Cost = (π * 3000000 cm³ / 5000 cm³) * $1
    *   Total Cost = (π * (3000000 / 5000)) * $1
    *   Total Cost = (π * 600) * $1
    *   Total Cost = 600π dollars.

8.  **Provide a numerical answer:** Since ""Exactly how much money"" usually implies a specific dollar amount in this context, we use a numerical value for π. Using a standard approximation (e.g., from a calculator):
    *   Total Cost ≈ 600 * 3.1415926535... dollars
    *   Total Cost ≈ 1884.9555921... dollars

    Rounding to the nearest cent (two decimal places) is standard for currency.
    *   Total Cost ≈ $1884.96.

The total cost to build the balcony is approximately $1884.96.

49,"Question: The game of penultimate frisbee has two scoring moves: the bungee and the wedgie.
Each type of score is worth an odd prime number of points, with a bungee being worth more than a wedgie.  If the largest score that can never be achieved in a game is 95 points (no matter how long the game lasts), how many points is each move worth?
 Hint: If the two moves are worth p and q, the largest score that can not be
achieved by some combination  of bungees and wedgies is p*q-p-q.","If the two moves are worth p and q, the largest score that can not be

The largest score that can not be achieved by some combination of p and q points, with p relatively prime to q, is p*q-p-q = (p-1)*(q-1)-1.
So 96 must be factorable as (p-1)*(q-1), for odd primes p and q.
Since the prime factorization of 96 = 2^5*3, and each of the two
factors must be even, the possible factorizations are:
2*48
4*24
8*12
16*6
Only the last factorization yields two factors each of which is one less
than an odd prime, so 17 and 7 must be the two primes we seek.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $b$ be the number of points for a bungee and $w$ be the number of points for a wedgie.
According to the problem statement, $b$ and $w$ are odd prime numbers.
Also, a bungee is worth more than a wedgie, so $b > w$.
The total score in a game is given by $n_b \cdot b + n_w \cdot w$, where $n_b$ and $n_w$ are non-negative integers representing the number of bungees and wedgies, respectively.
We are given that the largest score that can never be achieved is 95 points.
The hint states that if the two moves are worth $p$ and $q$, the largest score that cannot be achieved is $p \cdot q - p - q$. This formula, known as the Frobenius number, is valid when $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers.
Let $p=b$ and $q=w$. The largest unachievable score is $bw - b - w$.
We are given that this value is 95. So, we have the equation:
$bw - b - w = 95$.

To solve this equation for $b$ and $w$, we can rearrange it. Add 1 to both sides:
$bw - b - w + 1 = 95 + 1$
$(b - 1)(w - 1) = 96$.

Let $X = b - 1$ and $Y = w - 1$. So, $X \cdot Y = 96$.
Since $b$ and $w$ are odd prime numbers, the smallest possible value for an odd prime is 3. Thus, $b \ge 3$ and $w \ge 3$.
This means $b - 1 \ge 2$ and $w - 1 \ge 2$, so $X \ge 2$ and $Y \ge 2$.
Also, since $b$ and $w$ are odd, $b-1$ and $w-1$ must be even. So $X$ and $Y$ are even integers.
The condition $b > w$ implies $b - 1 > w - 1$, so $X > Y$.

We need to find pairs of factors $(X, Y)$ of 96 such that $X > Y$, $X$ and $Y$ are both even, $X \ge 2$, and $Y \ge 2$.
First, let's list the pairs of factors $(X, Y)$ of 96 with $X > Y$:
(96, 1), (48, 2), (32, 3), (24, 4), (16, 6), (12, 8).

Now, we filter these pairs based on the conditions that $X$ and $Y$ must be even and $Y \ge 2$:
1. (96, 1): $Y=1$ is not even and $Y < 2$. Invalid.
2. (48, 2): $X=48$ (even), $Y=2$ (even). $X > Y$ and $Y \ge 2$. This is a potential pair for $(X, Y)$.
   If $(X, Y) = (48, 2)$, then $b = X + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49$ and $w = Y + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.
   We check if $b$ and $w$ are odd primes with $b > w$:
   $w=3$ is an odd prime. $b=49 = 7^2$, which is not a prime number. Invalid.
3. (32, 3): $Y=3$ is not even. Invalid.
4. (24, 4): $X=24$ (even), $Y=4$ (even). $X > Y$ and $Y \ge 2$. This is a potential pair for $(X, Y)$.
   If $(X, Y) = (24, 4)$, then $b = X + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25$ and $w = Y + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5$.
   We check if $b$ and $w$ are odd primes with $b > w$:
   $w=5$ is an odd prime. $b=25 = 5^2$, which is not a prime number. Invalid.
5. (16, 6): $X=16$ (even), $Y=6$ (even). $X > Y$ and $Y \ge 2$. This is a potential pair for $(X, Y)$.
   If $(X, Y) = (16, 6)$, then $b = X + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17$ and $w = Y + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7$.
   We check if $b$ and $w$ are odd primes with $b > w$:
   $b=17$ is a prime number. Is it odd? Yes.
   $w=7$ is a prime number. Is it odd? Yes.
   Is $b > w$? $17 > 7$. Yes.
   This pair $(b, w) = (17, 7)$ satisfies all the conditions. Let's verify the formula: $17 \times 7 - 17 - 7 = 119 - 17 - 7 = 102 - 7 = 95$. This is correct.
   We also need to check if $b$ and $w$ are relatively prime for the formula to be valid. $\gcd(17, 7) = 1$ since 17 and 7 are distinct prime numbers. The formula is applicable.
6. (12, 8): $X=12$ (even), $Y=8$ (even). $X > Y$ and $Y \ge 2$. This is a potential pair for $(X, Y)$.
   If $(X, Y) = (12, 8)$, then $b = X + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13$ and $w = Y + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9$.
   We check if $b$ and $w$ are odd primes with $b > w$:
   $b=13$ is an odd prime. $w=9 = 3^2$, which is not a prime number. Invalid.

The only pair $(b, w)$ that satisfies all the given conditions is $(17, 7)$.
Since a bungee is worth more than a wedgie ($b > w$), the bungee is worth 17 points and the wedgie is worth 7 points.

Final verification:
- Are 17 and 7 odd prime numbers? Yes.
- Is the bungee worth more than the wedgie? $17 > 7$, yes.
- Is the largest score that cannot be achieved 95? Using the formula with $p=17$ and $q=7$: $17 \times 7 - 17 - 7 = 119 - 24 = 95$. Yes.

The solution fits all the criteria.

The final answer is $\boxed{Bungee: 17 \text{ points}, Wedgie: 7 \text{ points}}$.",True,1,0,0

Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3.

She then turns 90 degrees to her right, then walks in that exact direction until she is directly north of where she first turned 45 degrees. She then turns and faces directly north. She walks twice as far as she has already walked and turns left. She then walks a 1/4 as far as she has walked at an angle of 45 degrees. She then turns north and walks twice as far as she has previously walked north. She then turns right and takes 9 steps. She picks up the ruby and walks the same distance she has previously walked in the maze, but instead she continues walking east. After she walks this far, she sits down on a bench in the maze and is arrested. How long did the girl spend walking in the maze until she was arrested? She walked twice as fast after she got the ruby. Answer in seconds.

The puzzle is:
```
  HI
x TO
----
JRRO
```
Each letter represents a unique digit from 0 to 9.
We are given the following hints:
1.  R = 7
2.  H = 4
3.  I ≠ 1

Let's substitute the known values into the puzzle:
```
  4I
x TO
----
J77O
```

From the structure of the multiplication and the result J77O, we know:
*   HI is the number 40 + I.
*   TO is the number 10T + O.
*   JRRO is the number 1000J + 700 + 70 + O = 1000J + 770 + O.

So, we have the equation:
(40 + I) * (10T + O) = 1000J + 770 + O

Also, J must be a non-zero digit since it's the leading digit of a four-digit number. T must be a non-zero digit since it's the leading digit of a two-digit number. H=4 and R=7 are given.

Let's examine the units digit of the multiplication.
The units digit of (4I) * (TO) is the units digit of I * O.
The units digit of JRRO is O.
So, the units digit of I * O must be O.
This means I * O ≡ O (mod 10), or O * (I - 1) ≡ 0 (mod 10).

This congruence holds if:
*   O = 0 (then O * (I-1) = 0, which is 0 mod 10).
*   I - 1 = 0, so I = 1 (then O * 0 = 0, which is 0 mod 10). However, the hint states I ≠ 1, so this possibility is ruled out.
*   O and (I-1) have factors that multiply to 10 (e.g., O is a multiple of 5 and I-1 is even, or O is even and I-1 is a multiple of 5).

Let's list the digits already used: H=4, R=7.
The letters H, I, T, O, J, R must all represent unique digits.

Possibility 1: O = 0.
If O=0, then I * 0 = 0, and the units digit of the product is 0. This matches J77O where O=0.
If O=0, then the letters used are {4, 7, 0} plus I, T, J.
I must be a digit from 0-9, not equal to 4, 7, 0, or 1 (hint). So I ∈ {2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}.
T must be a digit from 1-9, not equal to 4, 7, 0, I. T ≠ 0.
J must be a digit from 1-9, not equal to 4, 7, 0, I, T. J ≠ 0.

The equation becomes (40 + I) * (10T + 0) = 1000J + 770 + 0
(40 + I) * 10T = 1000J + 770
Divide by 10: (40 + I) * T = 100J + 77

The right side, 100J + 77, is a number ending in 77.
So, the units digit of (40 + I) * T must be 7.
Let's check the possible values for I ∈ {2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}:
*   If I=2, (42) * T ends in 7. The units digit of 2*T must be 7. No digit T gives this (2*T gives an even units digit).
*   If I=3, (43) * T ends in 7. The units digit of 3*T must be 7. This requires T=9 (since 3*9=27).
    Let's check if I=3, O=0, T=9 works. Used digits {4, 7, 0, 3, 9}. Available for J: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}.
    (40 + 3) * 9 = 43 * 9 = 387.
    This should be 100J + 77. If 387 = 100J + 77, then 100J = 310, J = 3.1. Not an integer. This case fails.
*   If I=5, (45) * T ends in 7. The units digit of 5*T must be 7. No digit T gives this (5*T ends in 0 or 5).
*   If I=6, (46) * T ends in 7. The units digit of 6*T must be 7. No digit T gives this (6*T gives an even units digit).
*   If I=8, (48) * T ends in 7. The units digit of 8*T must be 7. No digit T gives this (8*T gives an even units digit).
*   If I=9, (49) * T ends in 7. The units digit of 9*T must be 7. This requires T=3 (since 9*3=27).
    Let's check if I=9, O=0, T=3 works. Used digits {4, 7, 0, 9, 3}. Available for J: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}.
    (40 + 9) * 3 = 49 * 3 = 147.
    This should be 100J + 77. If 147 = 100J + 77, then 100J = 70, J = 0.7. Not an integer, and J cannot be 0 anyway. This case fails.

So, O cannot be 0.

Possibility 2: O * (I-1) ≡ 0 (mod 10), with O ≠ 0 and I ≠ 1.
This means O and (I-1) share factors of 10.
The digits used are H=4, R=7. I cannot be 4, 7, or 1. O cannot be 4, 7, or I.

*   Case 2a: O is a multiple of 5 (O=5) and I-1 is even (I is odd).
    O=5. I is odd, I ≠ 1, I ≠ 4, I ≠ 7, I ≠ O(5). So I ∈ {3, 9}.
    *   If I=3, O=5. Used digits {4, 7, 5, 3}. (I-1 = 2, O=5. 5*2 = 10, ends in 0. I*O = 3*5=15, ends in O=5. Correct).
        Available for T, J: {0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9}. T≠0, J≠0, T≠J. T, J ∈ {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}.
        Equation: (43) * (10T + 5) = 1000J + 775
        430T + 215 = 1000J + 775
        430T = 1000J + 560
        43T = 100J + 56
        43T - 100J = 56
        Since 100J is even and 56 is even, 43T must be even, so T must be even.
        Possible T from {1, 2, 6, 8, 9} are {2, 6, 8}.
        If T=2: 43*2 - 100J = 56 => 86 - 100J = 56 => 100J = 30 => J=0.3 (Not integer/Not allowed).
        If T=6: 43*6 - 100J = 56 => 258 - 100J = 56 => 100J = 202 => J=2.02 (Not integer).
        If T=8: 43*8 - 100J = 56 => 344 - 100J = 56 => 100J = 288 => J=2.88 (Not integer).
        This possibility fails.
    *   If I=9, O=5. Used digits {4, 7, 5, 9}. (I-1 = 8, O=5. 5*8 = 40, ends in 0. I*O = 9*5=45, ends in O=5. Correct).

61,"Question: Car 1 started from Point A towards point B. At the same time Car 2 started from point B towards A. They crossed each other at point C. After which, Car 1 reached point B in another 9 hrs, and Car 2 reached point A in another 4 hrs. If both the cars maintained a constant speed throughout the journey, and the speed of Car 1 was 36 miles/hr(mph), then what was the speed of Car 2?
 Hint: One can represent the time taken by each car in terms of distance and rate (with some unknown variables); then, set these expressions equal","One can represent the time taken by each car in terms of distance and rate (with some unknown variables); then, set these expressions equal","54 miles/hr.
Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).
Thus we get b = 11664/216 = 54.
Thus speed of Car 2 = 54 miles/hr",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $v_1$ be the speed of Car 1 and $v_2$ be the speed of Car 2. We are given that $v_1 = 36$ miles/hr.
Let $A$ be the starting point of Car 1 and $B$ be the starting point of Car 2. They meet at point $C$.
Let $t$ be the time taken for both cars to travel from their starting points to the meeting point $C$. Since they started at the same time and met at $C$, they traveled for the same amount of time until they met.
Let $d_{AC}$ be the distance from point A to point C, and $d_{BC}$ be the distance from point B to point C.

Step 1: Represent the distances covered by each car until they meet at C in terms of their speeds and the time taken to meet.
Car 1 travels from A to C in time $t$ with speed $v_1$. The distance covered is $d_{AC}$.
So, $d_{AC} = v_1 \times t$.
Car 2 travels from B to C in time $t$ with speed $v_2$. The distance covered is $d_{BC}$.
So, $d_{BC} = v_2 \times t$.

Step 2: Represent the distances covered by each car after meeting at C in terms of their speeds and the given times taken for the remaining journey.
After meeting at C, Car 1 travels from C to B. The distance is $d_{CB}$, which is the same as $d_{BC}$. The time taken is given as 9 hours.
So, $d_{BC} = v_1 \times 9$.
After meeting at C, Car 2 travels from C to A. The distance is $d_{CA}$, which is the same as $d_{AC}$. The time taken is given as 4 hours.
So, $d_{AC} = v_2 \times 4$.

Step 3: Set the expressions for the distances equal. We have two expressions for $d_{AC}$ and two expressions for $d_{BC}$.
Equating the expressions for $d_{AC}$:
$v_1 \times t = v_2 \times 4$. (Equation 1)
Equating the expressions for $d_{BC}$:
$v_2 \times t = v_1 \times 9$. (Equation 2)

Step 4: Solve the system of equations for the unknown speed $v_2$. We have two equations with two unknowns, $t$ and $v_2$ (since $v_1$ is known).
From Equation 1, we can express $t$ in terms of $v_1$ and $v_2$:
$t = \frac{4 v_2}{v_1}$.

Step 5: Substitute this expression for $t$ into Equation 2:
$v_2 \times \left(\frac{4 v_2}{v_1}\right) = v_1 \times 9$.
$\frac{4 v_2^2}{v_1} = 9 v_1$.

Step 6: Solve for $v_2$. Multiply both sides of the equation by $v_1$:
$4 v_2^2 = 9 v_1^2$.
Take the square root of both sides. Since speeds are positive, we take the positive square root:
$\sqrt{4 v_2^2} = \sqrt{9 v_1^2}$.
$2 v_2 = 3 v_1$.

Step 7: Substitute the given speed of Car 1, $v_1 = 36$ mph, into the equation from Step 6:
$2 v_2 = 3 \times 36$.
$2 v_2 = 108$.

Step 8: Divide by 2 to find $v_2$:
$v_2 = \frac{108}{2} = 54$.

The speed of Car 2 was 54 miles/hr.

Final check:
If $v_1 = 36$ mph and $v_2 = 54$ mph, let's find the time to meet $t$.
From $2 v_2 = 3 v_1$, we have $\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{2}{3}$.
From Equation 1, $t = \frac{4 v_2}{v_1} = 4 \times \frac{v_2}{v_1} = 4 \times \frac{3}{2} = 6$ hours.
From Equation 2, $t = \frac{9 v_1}{v_2} = 9 \times \frac{v_1}{v_2} = 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6$ hours.
So, they met after 6 hours.
Distance AC = $v_1 \times t = 36 \times 6 = 216$ miles.
Distance BC = $v_2 \times t = 54 \times 6 = 324$ miles.
After meeting, Car 1 travels from C to B (distance 324 miles) at speed 36 mph. Time taken = $\frac{324}{36} = 9$ hours. This matches the given information.
After meeting, Car 2 travels from C to A (distance 216 miles) at speed 54 mph. Time taken = $\frac{216}{54} = 4$ hours. This matches the given information.
All the conditions are satisfied.

The final answer is $\boxed{54 \text{ mph}}$.",True,1,0,0

63,"Question: Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.
""I know that voice!  C'mon down.""
""Who is it?"" Eileen prodded.
""Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?""
Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.
""Why should I?""
""I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.""
""Is that the new Sinatra CD?""
""No, it's the world's greatest snack.""
""I'm hungry, too!"" the other voice whined.
""Who's up there with you?""  Patty asked.
""I'll bet I know!"" Eileen called.  ""It's obvious!""
Patty's face lit up in realization.  ""Robin!"" they laughed together.
A pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.
""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""
""We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.""
""What are those?""
""You know what a perfect number is?""
""Sure,"" Patty interjected, ""a number equal to the sum of its divisors.""
""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.  What are the four quantities in the sequence?
 Hint: You can leave out numbers that are primes (sum of proper divisors is 1) or the product of two primes (sum of divisors will be less than 100).

64,"Question: The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with ""rock"", 2 points with ""scissors"", and 1 point with ""paper"".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one ""throw"", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.

(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"The problem asks for a strategy (a mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) that allows a player to maintain their balance of chips over time, without knowing anything about the opponents' strategies. This is a classic game theory problem.

Let the three choices be Rock (R), Paper (P), and Scissors (S). Let the probabilities of choosing R, P, and S be $p_R$, $p_P$, and $p_S$ respectively. We are looking for a mixed strategy $(p_R, p_P, p_S)$ where $p_R, p_P, p_S \ge 0$ and $p_R + p_P + p_S = 1$.

The payoffs for winning are given, and losing means the opponent wins the corresponding amount from you. Let's define the payoff matrix $M$ where $M_{ij}$ is the payoff for you if you choose row $i$ and your opponent chooses column $j$. Let the order of strategies be R, P, S.

The payoffs are:
- Rock beats Scissors: Winner gets 3 chips. $M_{RS} = +3$, $M_{SR} = -3$.
- Scissors beats Paper: Winner gets 2 chips. $M_{SP} = +2$, $M_{PS} = -2$.
- Paper beats Rock: Winner gets 1 chip. $M_{PR} = +1$, $M_{RP} = -1$.
- Ties (R-R, P-P, S-S) result in 0 payoff. $M_{RR} = M_{PP} = M_{SS} = 0$.

The payoff matrix is:
       | R   | P   | S
-------|-----|-----|-----
R      | 0   | -1  | +3
P      | +1  | 0   | -2
S      | -3  | +2  | 0

This is a zero-sum game, as confirmed by Hint (2). What one player wins, the other loses. The sum of payoffs for both players in any encounter is zero (e.g., R vs S, A gets +3, B gets -3; total 0).
The game is also symmetric, as confirmed by Hint (3). The game structure and payoffs are the same for all players. This means if a strategy $(p_R, p_P, p_S)$ is optimal for one player, the same strategy is optimal for the other player. In a symmetric zero-sum game, the value of the game is 0, and the Nash Equilibrium strategy involves both players using the same mixed strategy.

The goal is to ""maintain your balance of chips,"" knowing nothing about the opponent. This means finding a strategy that yields an expected payoff of at least 0, regardless of the opponent's strategy. In a zero-sum game, the strategy that maximizes your minimum possible expected payoff (the maximin strategy) is also the strategy that minimizes your opponent's maximum possible expected payoff (the minimax strategy). For a symmetric zero-sum game with value 0, this strategy is the unique Nash Equilibrium strategy. This strategy guarantees an expected payoff of 0 against any opponent strategy.

Let your mixed strategy be $(p_R, p_P, p_S)$ and your opponent's mixed strategy be $(q_R, q_P, q_S)$. The expected payoff for you is:
$E(p, q) = p_R (0 \cdot q_R - 1 \cdot q_P + 3 \cdot q_S) + p_P (1 \cdot q_R + 0 \cdot q_P - 2 \cdot q_S) + p_S (-3 \cdot q_R + 2 \cdot q_P + 0 \cdot q_S)$
$E(p, q) = p_R (-q_P + 3q_S) + p_P (q_R - 2q_S) + p_S (-3q_R + 2q_P)$

To find the Nash Equilibrium strategy $(p_R, p_P, p_S)$, this strategy must be a best response to itself. This means that any pure strategy played with non-zero probability in the mixed strategy must yield the same expected payoff against the opponent's (identical) mixed strategy. Since the game value is 0, this common expected payoff must be 0.
Let $(p_R, p_P, p_S)$ be the equilibrium strategy. If $p_R > 0$, $p_P > 0$, and $p_S > 0$, then the expected payoff of playing R, P, or S against $(p_R, p_P, p_S)$ must all be equal to 0.

Expected payoff of playing R against $(p_R, p_P, p_S)$:
$E_R(p) = 0 \cdot p_R - 1 \cdot p_P + 3 \cdot p_S = -p_P + 3p_S$

Expected payoff of playing P against $(p_R, p_P, p_S)$:
$E_P(p) = 1 \cdot p_R + 0 \cdot p_P - 2 \cdot p_S = p_R - 2p_S$

Expected payoff of playing S against $(p_R, p_P, p_S)$:
$E_S(p) = -3 \cdot p_R + 2 \cdot p_P + 0 \cdot p_S = -3p_R + 2p_P$

Setting these expected payoffs to 0:
1) $-p_P + 3p_S = 0 \implies p_P = 3p_S$
2) $p_R - 2p_S = 0 \implies p_R = 2p_S$
3) $-3p_R + 2p_P = 0$

We also have the constraint $p_R + p_P + p_S = 1$.
Substitute the expressions for $p_R$ and $p_P$ from (1) and (2) into the sum constraint:
$(2p_S) + (3p_S) + p_S = 1$
$6p_S = 1$
$p_S = 1/6$

Now find $p_R$ and $p_P$:
$p_R = 2p_S = 2(1/6) = 1/3$
$p_P = 3p_S = 3(1/6) = 1/2$

The mixed strategy is $(p_R, p_P, p_S) = (1/3, 1/2, 1/6)$.
Let's check if this satisfies the third equation: $-3(1/3) + 2(1/2) = -1 + 1 = 0$. Yes, it does.
The probabilities are non-negative and sum to $1/3 + 1/2 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 3/6 + 1/6 = 6/6 = 1$.

This strategy $(1/3, 1/2, 1/6)$ is the Nash Equilibrium strategy. Its expected payoff against any opponent strategy $(q_R, q_P, q_S)$ is:
$E((1/3, 1/2, 1/6), q) = (1/3)(-q_P + 3q_S) + (1/2)(q_R - 2q_S) + (1/6)(-3q_R + 2q_P)$
$= -1/3 q_P + q_S + 1/2 q_R - q_S - 1/2 q_R + 1/3 q_P$
$= (-1/3 + 1/3)q_P + (1 - 1)q_S + (1/2 - 1/2)q_R = 0 \cdot q_P + 0 \cdot q_S + 0 \cdot q_R = 0$.

This strategy guarantees an expected payoff of 0 chips per round, regardless of what the opponent plays. This is exactly the strategy that ""maintains your balance of chips throughout the evening"".

Let's check Hint (1): ""The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.""
The strategy 1:1:1 corresponds to probabilities (1/3, 1/3, 1/3).
If the opponent throws only Rock ($q_R=1, q_P=0, q_S=0$), the expected payoff for strategy (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) is:
$E((1/3, 1/3, 1/3), (1,0,0)) = (1/3)E_R(1,0,0) + (1/3)E_P(1,0,0) + (1/3)E_S(1,0,0)$
$E_R(1,0,0) = 0$ (R vs R)
$E_P(1,0,0) = 1$ (P vs R, win 1)
$E_S(1,0,0) = -3$ (S vs R, lose 3)
Expected payoff = $(1/3)(0) + (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(-3) = (1/3)(1-3) = -2/3$.
An expected loss of 2/3 chips per round means this strategy loses chips against an opponent playing only Rock. Our derived strategy (1/3, 1/2, 1/6) yields an expected payoff of 0 against an opponent playing only Rock, as shown above.

The best strategy for maintaining your balance of chips is to play Rock with probability 1/3, Paper with probability 1/2, and Scissors with probability 1/6.

Final answer should state the probabilities for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

Final check of reasoning:
1. Understand the game: It's Rock-Paper-Scissors with non-standard payoffs.
2. Define the payoff matrix.
3. Identify the game type: Zero-sum, symmetric.
4. Goal: Maintain chip balance, knowing nothing about the opponent. This means finding a strategy with an expected payoff of 0 against any opponent strategy. In a symmetric zero-sum game, this is the Nash Equilibrium strategy, which has a value of 0.
5. Calculate the Nash Equilibrium strategy: Set the expected payoffs of pure strategies against the mixed strategy equal to the game value (0) and solve the system of equations along with the probability sum constraint.
6. Verify the result: Check if the strategy yields an expected payoff of 0 against arbitrary opponent strategies. Check against hints.

All steps are followed and verified. The derived strategy is consistent with the properties of the game and the problem statement.

The final answer is the set of probabilities for choosing Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

The final answer is $\boxed{Rock: 1/3, Paper: 1/2, Scissors: 1/6}$.",True,1,0,0
65,"Question: The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
Assume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.  What is the lowest card total at which you can be assured you will not be required to drink a glass of milk through your nose in order to break a tie for the maximum 4 points?
 Hint: Create the largest tie",Create the largest tie,"If all four players hold the same number of cards, the lowest card total that would never require a tie-break is 142.
If all four players hold the same number of cards, the highest single hand card total at which a tie-breaker might be needed is 141.  In this case, the two players who would be required to drink milk through their noses would each have had a hand consisting of a joker and two 8s, 9s, 10s, jacks, queens and kings.  Any score above 141 can not be duplicated in a single hand of Snapoker, thus making 142 the lowest total to which a tie-breaker will not need to be applied.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

67,"Question: Jack and Jill are climbing down a vertical wall.  They both use ropes hanging from the ceiling of a huge room.  They start at the same time from the top of the wall which is 16 meters tall.  The race is divided into two stages; the first 8 meters and the last 8 meters.  A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.
Who will reach the ground first and how many additional minutes will it take the loser to finish the race?
 Hint: Solve for their distance travelled at appropriate time increments",Solve for their distance travelled at appropriate time increments,"Jack will win the race and it will take an additional half minute to catch up with him.
Jacks moves 0.8 meters vertically in each step movement:
According to Pythagoras theorem for right angled triangle:
A^2 = B^2+C^2 (where A is the hypotenuse)
Replacing A by the diagonally crossed distance, B by the distance between Jack's feet and C by the vertically climbed distance:
1^2 = 0.6^2+C^2
C = 0.8 m
Jill moves 1 meter vertically in each hop.
According to the circle circumference calculation:
Circumference = Diameter * Pi

68,"Question: Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.
""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""
Assuming everything has integer weights, what were the two types of weights that Joseph suggested?
 Hint: Try it out with small numbers. What is the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of 3s and 4s? The answer is 5. Try it out with other numbers. You'll find a pattern eventually.",Try it out with small numbers. What is the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of 3s and 4s? The answer is 5. Try it out with other numbers. You'll find a pattern eventually.,"The two weights are 11 and 13.
If you played around with the hint, you'll realize that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of Xs and Ys is equal to (X-1)(Y-1) - 1.
We are told that the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of a combination of the two weights is 119.
Thus,
119 = (x-1)(y-1) - 1
120 = (x-1)(y-1)
From here, we only have to list 120's factors: (1,120), (2,60), (3,40), (4,30), (5,24), (6,20), (8,15), (10,12).  There are 8 possible combinations.
However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.
Try it out. You can't make 119 using only 11s and 13s but you can make 120 and above using only 11s and 13s.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let the two types of weights be $w_1$ and $w_2$. We are given that $w_1$ and $w_2$ are integers and $w_1 > 10$ and $w_2 > 10$.
The problem states that any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights, but 119 pounds cannot be. This means that the set of weights measurable using $w_1$ and $w_2$ in non-negative integer combinations ($a \cdot w_1 + b \cdot w_2$ for $a, b \ge 0$) includes all integers greater than 119, and 119 is the largest integer that cannot be expressed in this form.

This is a classic problem in number theory, known as the Frobenius Coin Problem. For two positive integers $w_1$ and $w_2$, the largest integer that cannot be expressed in the form $a \cdot w_1 + b \cdot w_2$ for non-negative integers $a, b$ is called the Frobenius number, denoted by $g(w_1, w_2)$.

For the set of sums $\{a \cdot w_1 + b \cdot w_2 \mid a, b \in \mathbb{N}_0\}$ to contain all integers greater than some number, it is necessary and sufficient that $\gcd(w_1, w_2) = 1$. If $\gcd(w_1, w_2) = d > 1$, then any sum $a \cdot w_1 + b \cdot w_2$ will be a multiple of $d$. In this case, only multiples of $d$ can be measured, so it is impossible to measure all integers above any given number if $d > 1$. The problem implies that all integers above 119 are measurable, so we must have $\gcd(w_1, w_2) = 1$.

Joseph's statement ""as long as the two weights are not both even"" supports this. If both weights were even, their $\gcd$ would be at least 2, and only even numbers could be measured. This would contradict the ability to measure *any* object above a certain weight.

For two relatively prime positive integers $w_1$ and $w_2$, the Frobenius number is given by the formula $g(w_1, w_2) = w_1 w_2 - w_1 - w_2$.
The problem states that 119 pounds cannot be measured, but any object above 119 pounds can be. This means the Frobenius number is 119.
So, we have the equation $w_1 w_2 - w_1 - w_2 = 119$.

We can rearrange this equation:
$w_1 w_2 - w_1 - w_2 + 1 = 119 + 1$
$(w_1 - 1)(w_2 - 1) = 120$.

We are looking for two integers $w_1$ and $w_2$ such that:
1. $w_1 > 10$ and $w_2 > 10$.
2. $(w_1 - 1)(w_2 - 1) = 120$.
3. $\gcd(w_1, w_2) = 1$.

From condition 1, $w_1 - 1 > 10 - 1 = 9$ and $w_2 - 1 > 10 - 1 = 9$.
Let $x = w_1 - 1$ and $y = w_2 - 1$. We need to find pairs of integers $(x, y)$ such that $xy = 120$, $x > 9$, and $y > 9$.

Let's list the integer factor pairs of 120:
(1, 120), (2, 60), (3, 40), (4, 30), (5, 24), (6, 20), (8, 15), (10, 12).
We need both factors to be greater than 9. Let's examine the pairs $(x, y)$ with $x \le y$:
- (1, 120): $x=1 \ngtr 9$.
- (2, 60): $x=2 \ngtr 9$.
- (3, 40): $x=3 \ngtr 9$.
- (4, 30): $x=4 \ngtr 9$.
- (5, 24): $x=5 \ngtr 9$.
- (6, 20): $x=6 \ngtr 9$.
- (8, 15): $x=8 \ngtr 9$.
- (10, 12): $x=10 > 9$ and $y=12 > 9$. This pair satisfies the condition.

So, the only pair $(x, y)$ with $x \le y$ satisfying $xy=120$, $x>9$, $y>9$ is $(10, 12)$.
If $(x, y) = (10, 12)$, then $w_1 - 1 = 10 \implies w_1 = 11$, and $w_2 - 1 = 12 \implies w_2 = 13$.

Now we check if these values satisfy all conditions:
1. $w_1 = 11 > 10$ and $w_2 = 13 > 10$. (Satisfied)
2. $(w_1 - 1)(w_2 - 1) = (11 - 1)(13 - 1) = 10 \times 12 = 120$. (Satisfied)
3. $\gcd(w_1, w_2) = \gcd(11, 13)$. Since 11 and 13 are prime numbers and they are not equal, they are relatively prime. $\gcd(11, 13) = 1$. (Satisfied)

The solution $(x, y) = (10, 12)$ gives the set of weights $\{11, 13\}$. If we had chosen $(x, y) = (12, 10)$, it would give $w_1 = 13, w_2 = 11$, which is the same set of weights.

Let's verify the other details mentioned in the problem with $w_1=11$ and $w_2=13$:
- ""system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds."" The smallest weight that can be measured is $\min(11, 13) = 11$. So weights 1, 2, ..., 10 cannot be measured. Both weights are heavier than 10 pounds. (Satisfied)
- ""Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?! 'Yes, yes, and no.'""
  - 300 pounds: We need $11a + 13b = 300$ for $a, b \ge 0$. Since 300 > 119, it must be possible. For example, $11(19) + 13(7) = 209 + 91 = 300$. (Yes)
  - 90 pounds: We need $11a + 13b = 90$ for $a, b \ge 0$. For example, $11(7) + 13(1) = 77 + 13 = 90$. (Yes)
  - 69 pounds: We need $11a + 13b = 69$ for $a, b \ge 0$.
    If $b=0$, $11a=69$ (no integer $a$).
    If $b=1$, $11a=69-13=56$ (no integer $a$).
    If $b=2$, $11a=69-26=43$ (no integer $a$).
    If $b=3$, $11a=69-39=30$ (no integer $a$).
    If $b=4$, $11a=69-52=17$ (no integer $a$).
    If $b=5$, $11a=69-65=4$ (no integer $a$).
    If $b \ge 6$, $13b \ge 13 \times 6 = 78 > 69$. So no non-negative solution for $a$.
    Thus, 69 pounds cannot be measured. (No)
The checks match Joseph's answers.

The hint about the largest number not expressible as a sum of 3s and 4s being 5 also aligns with the Frobenius number formula: $g(3, 4) = 3 \times 4 - 3 - 4 = 12 - 7 = 5$.",True,1,0,0

Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","There are multiple possible age combinations for the mathematician's children that would result in the same age as well as the same bus number otherwise the second mathematician can determine the ages of the children given the first mathematician's age and number of children.
Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't — he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10.

73,"Question: Achmed and Ali were camel-drivers and on one day they decided to quit their job. They wanted to become shepherds. So they went to the market and sold all their camels. The amount of money (dinars) they received for each camel was the same as the total number of camels they owned. With that money they bought as many sheep as possible at 10 dinars a sheep. With the money that was left they bought a goat.
On their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, ""I take the last sheep and you can get the goat"". ""That's not fair,"" said Achmed, ""a goat costs less than a sheep"". ""OK,"" Ali said, ""then I will give you one of my dogs and then we are even"". And Achmed agreed.

A sheep is 10 dinars, but what does a goat cost?
The money they received for their camels is a square. And the digit in the tens-place of this square is odd (total money / 10 dinars), because they could not divide the sheep equally.
Now the interesting thing is that all squares with an odd tens-place end with a 6. (16^2 = 256, 24^2 = 576). So a goat must cost 6 dinars.

74,"Question: Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?
 Hint: The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","The minimum number of weights is 5.
weight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0
weight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1
weight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2
weight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3
weight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4
All five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.
The progression from one stone to one mass would be:
1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this problem down step by step, using logical reasoning and the hint.

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The problem asks for the *minimum* number of weights needed to measure any integer weight from 1 stone up to 1 mass using a balance scale.

2.  **Determine the Range of Weights to Measure:**
    *   The base unit is a stone.
    *   1 lump = 11 stone.
    *   1 mass = 11 lumps = 11 * 11 stone = 121 stone.
    *   We need to be able to measure any weight from 1 stone to 121 stone.

3.  **Understand the Tool:** A balance scale. This is crucial. With a balance scale, you can place weights on *both* sides of the scale.
    *   To measure an unknown weight 'W', you place 'W' on one side.
    *   You then use your set of known weights {w1, w2, w3, ...}.
    *   You can place some of these weights on the opposite side of 'W' and some on the same side as 'W'.
    *   If the scale balances, the sum of the weights on one side equals the sum of the weights on the other side.
    *   Let's say you put weight W on the left. You put weights {w_a, w_b, ...} on the right side and {w_x, w_y, ...} on the left side (with W). The scale balances when W + w_x + w_y + ... = w_a + w_b + ...
    *   This means W = (w_a + w_b + ...) - (w_x + w_y + ...).
    *   So, any weight W that can be measured must be representable as a sum *and/or* difference of the available weights. If we have a set of weights {w1, w2, ..., wk}, any measurable weight W must be expressible in the form W = c1*w1 + c2*w2 + ... + ck*wk, where each coefficient ci can be +1 (weight on the opposite side), -1 (weight on the same side), or 0 (weight not used).

4.  **Connect to Number Systems:** The ability to represent any integer as a sum of multiples of base powers, where the multipliers can be -1, 0, or +1, is characteristic of a *balanced* number system.
    *   A standard base-b system uses coefficients {0, 1, ..., b-1}.
    *   A balanced base-b system typically uses coefficients {- (b-1)/2, ..., (b-1)/2}.
    *   With coefficients {-1, 0, 1}, we are looking at a balanced ternary system (base 3).

5.  **Hypothesize the Weights:** Based on the connection to balanced ternary, the ideal set of weights for a balance scale are powers of 3. Let's assume the weights are {3^0, 3^1, 3^2, ...}.

6.  **Determine the Number of Weights Needed:** Let's say we use k weights: {3^0, 3^1, ..., 3^(k-1)}.
    *   The weights are {1, 3, 9, ..., 3^(k-1)} stone.
    *   Using these weights and coefficients {-1, 0, 1}, the smallest measurable *positive* weight is 1 stone (using only the 3^0 = 1 weight with coefficient +1).
    *   The largest possible weight we can measure is when all coefficients are +1: 1*3^0 + 1*3^1 + ... + 1*3^(k-1) = 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^(k-1).
    *   This is a geometric series sum: (3^k - 1) / (3 - 1) = (3^k - 1) / 2.
    *   Any integer from -(3^k-1)/2 to +(3^k-1)/2 can be uniquely represented in balanced ternary using these k weights.
    *   We need to measure any integer weight from 1 to 121. This means the maximum weight we can measure must be at least 121.
    *   So, we need (3^k - 1) / 2 >= 121.

7.  **Solve the Inequality for k:**
    *   (3^k - 1) / 2 >= 121
    *   3^k - 1 >= 2 * 121
    *   3^k - 1 >= 242
    *   3^k >= 243

    *   Now, we need to find the smallest integer k such that 3^k is greater than or equal to 243.
    *   3^1 = 3
    *   3^2 = 9
    *   3^3 = 27
    *   3^4 = 81
    *   3^5 = 243

    *   So, 3^k >= 243 requires k >= 5.
    *   This means we need at least 5 weights.

8.  **Identify the Weights:** With k=5, the weights should be the first 5 powers of 3:
    *   3^0 = 1 stone
    *   3^1 = 3 stone
    *   3^2 = 9 stone
    *   3^3 = 27 stone
    *   3^4 = 81 stone

9.  **Verify Sufficiency and Minimality:**
    *   With weights {1, 3, 9, 27, 81}, the maximum weight measurable is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 stone.
    *   As shown in step 6, using balanced ternary representation, any integer weight from 1 up to 121 can be measured by placing the weights on the appropriate side of the balance scale.
    *   Step 7 showed that k must be at least 5 to cover the range up to 121.
    *   Therefore, 5 weights are both necessary and sufficient.

10. **Consider the Hint:** ""The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights."" This aligns perfectly with our solution. The weights (1, 3, 9, 27, 81) are based on powers of 3, not powers of 11. The number eleven is only used to define the *range* of weights (1 to 121 stone). The hint reinforces that we should not expect weights like 1 stone, 11 stone, 121 stone, which would be base-11 weights.

11. **Consider the Title Hint:** Without the actual title, we can only guess its intent. If the title hinted at ""ternary"" or ""balance scale weights"", it would strongly suggest powers of 3. The structure of the problem itself (balance scale measuring a range) is a strong indicator of this classic type of weighing puzzle solved by using powers of 3.

12. **Final Solution Construction:**
    *   Define the problem's range (1 to 121 stone).
    *   Explain the balance scale mechanism allowing sums and differences of weights.
    *   Introduce the concept of balanced ternary (base 3) and its relation to coefficients {-1, 0, 1}.
    *   Identify powers of 3 as the optimal weights.
    *   Calculate the range covered by k powers of 3 using a balance scale.
    *   Determine the minimum k needed to cover the range 1-121.
    *   List the resulting weights.

The solution requires a set of weights that are powers of 3, allowing any required weight W (from 1 to 121) to be expressed in the form W = c0*3^0 + c1*3^1 + c2*3^2 + ... where each ci is -1, 0, or +1.

To cover the range up to 121, we need weights such that the sum of the positive coefficients (minus the sum of the negative coefficients) can equal 121. The maximum weight representable is 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^(k-1) = (3^k - 1)/2.

We need (3^k - 1)/2 >= 121
3^k - 1 >= 242
3^k >= 243

Since 3^5 = 243, we need k >= 5.
The minimum number of weights is 5.
The weights are 3^0, 3^1, 3^2, 3^3, and 3^4 stone.

These weights are:
1 stone
3 stone
9 stone
27 stone
81 stone

With these 5 weights, any weight from 1 to 121 stone can be measured. For example, to measure 2 stone, you place the item on one side, the 3-stone weight on the other side, and the 1-stone weight on the same side as the item (Item + 1 = 3). To measure 121 stone, you place the item on one side and all five weights (1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121) on the other side.

The hint ""The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights"" is perfectly consistent with this solution, as the weights are based on powers of 3, not 11.

The final answer is $\boxed{1, 3, 9, 27, 81 \text{ stone}}$.",True,1,0,0

77,"Question: I always remember the days when I was at high school, whiling away my time with my friends. Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.
Considering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?
He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.
 Hint: divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.",divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.,"Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24
This is for 12 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =
24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.
Now let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.
Here H can take values from 0 to 23.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 0 to 7 i.e., 8 values, for H = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 0 to 5 i.e., 6 values, for H = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 0 to 4 i.e., 5 values, for H = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20.

83,"Question: Oh no! Our flag has fallen down from the flag pole (stupid cheap string)! Quick, we need to figure out how much string we need to get it back up there...
The problem is, I don't remember its exact length!
All I can remember is that the pole was built to be exactly 14 times the height of the flag.
The flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system.
The string wraps evenly around the pole 4 times.
The string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag (the returning string is built into the pole).

Use the Pythagorean theorem.","If the pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground and the flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system, then the flag must be 1 meter high.

If the string wraps around in 4 even rotations, that means the rectangle divided on the y plane into 4 equal sections would represent one rotation per section. Finding the hypotenuse of each section (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) would then yield the distance covered per rotation.

s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ ({1400-100-100}/4) ^ 2 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ 90 000 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 1206.561796
Therefore, the string covers approximately 1206.561796 cm in 12 meters when there are 4 even rotations.
( Or: The string = number of rotations {#to multiply by the amount of distance covered in ONE rotation} [ ([total distance covered]/4 {#to equal the height in one rotation} ) ^ 2 + circumference ^ 2 {#to equal the width in one rotation  ] ^ square root {#to calculate the distance of the string in one rotation} )
{#} = comment",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break down this problem step by step, using all the information provided and the hint.

1.  **Determine the height of the pulley system:**
    The problem states the pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground.
    Let $h_p$ be the height of the pulley system.
    $h_p = 1$ meter.

2.  **Determine the height of the flag:**
    The problem states the flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system.
    Let $H_f$ be the height of the flag.
    $H_f = h_p = 1$ meter.

3.  **Determine the height of the flag pole:**
    The problem states the pole was built to be exactly 14 times the height of the flag.
    Let $H_p$ be the height of the pole.
    $H_p = 14 \times H_f = 14 \times 1 \text{ meter} = 14 \text{ meters}$.

4.  **Determine the vertical distance the string covers on the pole:**
    The string goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag. When the flag is raised to the top of the pole, the bottom of the flag is at the top of the pole. The string starts at the pulley system which is 1 meter off the ground, and goes up to the top of the pole which is 14 meters off the ground.
    The vertical distance the string covers along the pole is the difference in height between the top of the pole and the pulley system.
    Vertical distance = $H_p - h_p = 14 \text{ meters} - 1 \text{ meter} = 13 \text{ meters}$.
    This vertical distance will form one leg of the right triangle used in the Pythagorean theorem.

5.  **Determine the horizontal distance covered by the string in its rotations:**
    The string wraps evenly around the pole 4 times. The problem provides the diameter of the pole as 10cm. The circumference of the pole is $C = \pi \times \text{diameter}$.
    Diameter $D = 10 \text{ cm} = 10 \text{ cm} \times \frac{1 \text{ m}}{100 \text{ cm}} = 0.1 \text{ meters}$.
    Circumference $C = \pi \times 0.1 \text{ meters}$.
    If we were to calculate the total horizontal distance covered by the string wrapping 4 times based *only* on the diameter, it would be $4 \times C = 4 \times \pi \times 0.1 \text{ meters} = 0.4\pi \text{ meters}$.

    However, the hint states: ""The string covers 12 meters of distance in 4 rotations.""
    This hint provides a specific value for the ""distance in 4 rotations"". When using the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of a helix, the horizontal leg of the right triangle corresponds to the total horizontal distance covered in the specified number of rotations.
    The hint's value (12 meters) for ""distance in 4 rotations"" directly gives us the horizontal distance to use in the Pythagorean theorem. This value overrides the calculation based on the diameter and number of rotations, as it is provided as a specific fact related to the string's path.

    So, the horizontal distance for the 4 rotations is 12 meters. This will form the other leg of the right triangle used in the Pythagorean theorem.

6.  **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the string:**
    The string path forms a helix which, when the cylinder's surface is unrolled, becomes the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
    The vertical leg of the triangle is the vertical distance the string covers (13 meters).
    The horizontal leg of the triangle is the total horizontal distance covered in the rotations (12 meters, from the hint).
    Let $L$ be the length of the string that wraps around the pole. According to the Pythagorean theorem:
    $L^2 = (\text{Vertical distance})^2 + (\text{Horizontal distance})^2$
    $L^2 = (13 \text{ meters})^2 + (12 \text{ meters})^2$
    $L^2 = 169 \text{ m}^2 + 144 \text{ m}^2$
    $L^2 = 313 \text{ m}^2$

7.  **Calculate the length of the string:**
    $L = \sqrt{313 \text{ m}^2} = \sqrt{313}$ meters.

    Since 313 is a prime number, $\sqrt{313}$ cannot be simplified further.
    The question asks for ""how much string do we need"". The calculated length $L$ is the length of the string segment that goes from the pulley system at 1m up to the top of the pole at 14m, wrapping around the pole. The problem states that the returning string is built into the pole, implying this is the only segment of string we need to consider replacing or measuring.

The length of the string needed is $\sqrt{313}$ meters.

The final answer is $\boxed{\sqrt{313} \text{ meters}}$.",True,0,0,0

If the class average is 4 less than the average of the boys' average marks and the girls' average marks, find the minimum double digit number of students in the class.
 Hint: One can set the product of the total number of girls and boys as one variable and the sum of the number of girls and boys as another variable ",One can set the product of the total number of girls and boys as one variable and the sum of the number of girls and boys as another variable ,"The minimum double digit strength of the class is 18.
Let the number of girls in the class be X and the number of boys in the class be Y.
Then the average marks of the girls and boys is Y and X respectively.
Class average
= (Total marks/Total number of students)
= (Total marks scored by girls and boys/Total number of students in the class)
= ((Y*X + X*Y)/(Y+X))
= ((2*X*Y)/(X+Y))
The average of the boys' average and the girls' average
= (X+Y)/2
It is given that the class average is 4 less than the average of the boys' average marks and the girls' average marks.
Hence
(X+Y)/2 - ((2*X*Y)/(X+Y)) = 4
Multiplying the above equation throughout by 2*(X+Y), we get
(X+Y)^2 - 4*X*Y = 8*(X+Y)
X^2 + Y^2 + 2*X*Y - 4*X*Y = 8*(X+Y)
X^2 + Y^2 - 2*X*Y = 8*(X+Y)
(X-Y)^2 = 8*(X+Y)

It is given that the minimum double digit strength of the class has to be found.
Therefore the minimum double digit strength of the class = X+Y = 18.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $G$ be the number of girls in the class and $B$ be the number of boys.
Let $A_g$ be the average marks of girls and $A_b$ be the average marks of boys.

According to the problem statement, we have:
1. The average marks of girls is equal to the number of boys: $A_g = B$.
2. The average marks of boys is equal to the number of girls: $A_b = G$.

The total marks of girls is $T_g = G \times A_g = G \times B$.
The total marks of boys is $T_b = B \times A_b = B \times G$.
The total number of students in the class is $N = G + B$.
The total marks of the class is $T_c = T_g + T_b = GB + BG = 2GB$.
The average marks of the class is $A_c = \frac{T_c}{N} = \frac{2GB}{G+B}$.

The problem also states that the class average is 4 less than the average of the boys' average marks and the girls' average marks.
The average of the boys' average marks and the girls' average marks is $\frac{A_g + A_b}{2}$.
So, $A_c = \frac{A_g + A_b}{2} - 4$.

Substitute the expressions for $A_c$, $A_g$, and $A_b$:
$\frac{2GB}{G+B} = \frac{B + G}{2} - 4$.

Let's use the hint. Let $S = G+B$ be the sum of the number of girls and boys, and $P = GB$ be the product of the number of girls and boys.
The equation becomes:
$\frac{2P}{S} = \frac{S}{2} - 4$.

Rearranging the equation:
$\frac{2P}{S} = \frac{S - 8}{2}$.
$4P = S(S - 8)$.
$4P = S^2 - 8S$.

The number of girls ($G$) and boys ($B$) are positive integers. $G$ and $B$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - Sx + P = 0$.
For the roots to be real, the discriminant must be non-negative. The discriminant is $D = S^2 - 4P$.
Substituting $4P = S^2 - 8S$, we get:
$D = S^2 - (S^2 - 8S) = 8S$.

For $G$ and $B$ to be integers, the discriminant $D$ must be a perfect square. Let $D = k^2$ for some non-negative integer $k$.
$8S = k^2$.
This means $8S$ must be a perfect square. For $8S = 2^3 S$ to be a perfect square, the power of 2 in the prime factorization of $S$ must be odd, and the other prime factors of $S$ must have even powers (i.e., form a perfect square).
Let $S = 2^{2m+1} \cdot l^2$ for some non-negative integer $m$ and odd integer $l$.
$8S = 2^3 \cdot 2^{2m+1} \cdot l^2 = 2^{2m+4} \cdot l^2 = (2^{m+2} \cdot l)^2$.
So $k = 2^{m+2} \cdot l$. Since $l$ is odd, $k$ is an integer.
The number of students $S=G+B$ must be positive, so $S \ge 1+1=2$. Thus $k^2=8S$ must be positive, so $k$ must be a positive integer. $m+2 \ge 2$.

The roots of $x^2 - Sx + P = 0$ are $x = \frac{S \pm \sqrt{D}}{2} = \frac{S \pm \sqrt{8S}}{2}$.
So, $G = \frac{S + \sqrt{8S}}{2}$ and $B = \frac{S - \sqrt{8S}}{2}$ (or vice versa).

For $G$ and $B$ to be integers, $\sqrt{8S}$ must be an integer $k$. This is satisfied since $8S$ is a perfect square.
Also, $S \pm k$ must be even integers.
From $8S=k^2$, $S = k^2/8$. Since $S$ is an integer, $k^2$ must be divisible by 8. For $k^2$ to be divisible by 8, the prime factorization of $k^2$ must contain $2^j$ with $j \ge 3$. Since $j$ is even, $j \ge 4$. So $k^2$ must be divisible by 16. This means $k$ must be divisible by 4.
So $k$ is a multiple of 4, $k=4m'$ for some integer $m'$.
$S = \frac{(4m')^2}{8} = \frac{16m'^2}{8} = 2m'^2$.
Thus $S$ must be of the form $2 \times (\text{a perfect square})$.
Since $k=4m'$, $k$ is always even.
$S = 2m'^2$ is always even.
So $S \pm k$ is always even ($even \pm even = even$). Thus $G$ and $B$ will be integers.

For $G$ and $B$ to be positive integers, we must have $\frac{S - \sqrt{8S}}{2} > 0$.
$S - \sqrt{8S} > 0$.
$S > \sqrt{8S}$.
Since $S=G+B \ge 2$, $S$ is positive. We can square both sides:
$S^2 > 8S$.
Since $S>0$, we can divide by $S$:
$S > 8$.

So, $S$ must be of the form $2m'^2$ for some integer $m'$, and $S > 8$.
$2m'^2 > 8 \implies m'^2 > 4$.
Since $m'$ is an integer, $m'^2$ must be a perfect square greater than 4. The possible values for $m'^2$ are $9, 16, 25, 36, \ldots$.
The possible values for $S = 2m'^2$ are:
If $m'^2 = 9$, $S = 2 \times 9 = 18$.
If $m'^2 = 16$, $S = 2 \times 16 = 32$.
If $m'^2 = 25$, $S = 2 \times 25 = 50$.
And so on. The possible values for $S$ are $\{18, 32, 50, 72, 98, \ldots\}$.

We need to find the minimum double digit number of students in the class. The total number of students is $S$.
The possible values for $S$ are $18, 32, 50, 72, 98, \ldots$.
All these values are double digit numbers.
The minimum value in this set is 18.

Let's check if $S=18$ yields positive integer values for $G$ and $B$.
$S=18$. $\sqrt{8S} = \sqrt{8 \times 18} = \sqrt{144} = 12$.
$G, B = \frac{18 \pm 12}{2}$.
$G = \frac{18+12}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15$.
$B = \frac{18-12}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3$.
So the number of girls is 15 and the number of boys is 3 (or vice versa). Both are positive integers. The total number of students is $15+3=18$, which is a double digit number.

The smallest possible value for $S$ that satisfies $S=2m'^2$ and $S>8$ is 18. Since this results in positive integer values for $G$ and $B$, it is a valid number of students.
Since we are looking for the minimum double digit number of students, and 18 is the smallest value in the set of possible numbers of students $\{18, 32, 50, \ldots\}$ which are all double digit, the minimum is 18.

The final answer is $\boxed{18}$.",True,1,0,0
85,"Question: Below there are sixteen numbers. Assuming that any three of the numbers may be drawn at random, what are the chances that three numbers will be drawn whose sum equals six?

 Hint: nan",,"This is a bit tricky and I initially thought the answer was 1/16 or 6.2% but it is really 2/7 or 28.6%.
Either drawing '2 2 2' or some combination of '1 2 3' adds up to be 6. The chances of getting '2 2 2' are 5/16 (5 2s out of 16) times 4/15 (4 2s left out of 15) times 3/14 (3 2s left out of 14). This is 5/16 * 4/15 * 3/14 which equals 1/56.
The chances of getting some combination of '1 2 3' is equal to 6/16 (6 1s in the list) times 5/15 (5 2s out of 15 numbers left) times 5/14 (5 3s out of 14 numbers left) times the number of different combinations of '1 2 3' which is 6. This is 6/16 * 5/15 * 5/14 * 6 which equals 15/56.
1/56 + 15/56 = 16/56 or 2/7 or ~28.6%.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let the set of sixteen numbers be denoted by $S$. The numbers are given in a 4x4 grid:
1 2 3 1
2 3 1 2
3 1 2 3
1 2 3 1

First, let's determine the frequency of each number in the set $S$.
Counting the number of 1s: There are 2 in the first row, 1 in the second, 1 in the third, and 2 in the fourth. Total number of 1s is $2+1+1+2=6$.
Counting the number of 2s: There is 1 in the first row, 2 in the second, 1 in the third, and 1 in the fourth. Total number of 2s is $1+2+1+1=5$.
Counting the number of 3s: There is 1 in the first row, 1 in the second, 2 in the third, and 1 in the fourth. Total number of 3s is $1+1+2+1=5$.
The total number of elements is $6+5+5=16$, which is correct.

We are drawing three numbers at random from these sixteen numbers. This means we are selecting a combination of 3 numbers from the 16 available numbers. The order in which the numbers are drawn does not matter, and the drawing is without replacement. We assume that each of the sixteen numbers is distinct based on its position in the grid, so we are choosing a subset of 3 distinct items from the 16 items.

The total number of ways to choose 3 numbers from 16 is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n=16$ and $k=3$.
Total number of combinations = $\binom{16}{3} = \frac{16!}{3!(16-3)!} = \frac{16!}{3!13!} = \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14}{3 \times 2 \times 1}$.
Total number of combinations = $\frac{16 \times 15 \times 14}{6} = 16 \times 5 \times 7 = 80 \times 7 = 560$.
So, there are 560 possible ways to draw three numbers from the sixteen numbers.

Next, we need to find the number of combinations of three numbers from the set $S$ whose sum equals six. The possible numbers available are 1, 2, and 3. We need to find sets of three numbers $\{a, b, c\}$ from $\{1, 2, 3\}$ such that $a+b+c=6$. The possible sets of positive integers that sum to 6 are:
1. {1, 2, 3}: $1+2+3=6$.
2. {2, 2, 2}: $2+2+2=6$.
Other possible combinations of three integers from $\{1, 2, 3\}$ like {1, 1, 4}, {1, 3, 2}, etc., are just permutations of {1, 2, 3} or involve numbers not in the set {1, 2, 3} if we consider partitions of 6 into 3 parts. The only sets of three numbers from the available values {1, 2, 3} that sum to 6 are {1, 2, 3} and {2, 2, 2}.

Now we need to count how many ways we can draw these combinations from the given set of sixteen numbers, considering the frequencies of each number.
The set $S$ contains six 1s, five 2s, and five 3s.

Case 1: The three numbers drawn are 1, 2, and 3.
To form this combination, we need to choose one number with the value 1, one number with the value 2, and one number with the value 3.
Number of ways to choose one 1 from the six 1s is $\binom{6}{1} = 6$.
Number of ways to choose one 2 from the five 2s is $\binom{5}{1} = 5$.
Number of ways to choose one 3 from the five 3s is $\binom{5}{1} = 5$.
The total number of ways to choose one 1, one 2, and one 3 is the product of the number of ways to choose each: $\binom{6}{1} \times \binom{5}{1} \times \binom{5}{1} = 6 \times 5 \times 5 = 150$.

Case 2: The three numbers drawn are 2, 2, and 2.
To form this combination, we need to choose three numbers with the value 2 from the five 2s available in the set.
Number of ways to choose three 2s from the five 2s is $\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = \frac{20}{2} = 10$.

The total number of favorable combinations (where the sum of the three numbers is 6) is the sum of the numbers of ways in Case 1 and Case 2.
Total number of favorable combinations = 150 + 10 = 160.

The probability of drawing three numbers whose sum equals six is the ratio of the number of favorable combinations to the total number of possible combinations.
Probability = $\frac{\text{Number of favorable combinations}}{\text{Total number of combinations}} = \frac{160}{560}$.

Now, we simplify the fraction:
$\frac{160}{560} = \frac{16}{56}$.
Both 16 and 56 are divisible by 8.
$16 \div 8 = 2$
$56 \div 8 = 7$
So, the probability is $\frac{2}{7}$.

The final answer is $\boxed{\frac{2}{7}}$.",True,1,0,0

According to the problem, the essay was more than 1000 pages but less than 10,000 pages. So, $1000 < P < 10000$.

Let $D(P)$ be the total number of digits used to number all the pages from 1 to $P$.
We need to calculate $D(P)$ for $P$ in the range $1000 < P < 10000$.
The pages from 1 to $P$ consist of:
- Single-digit pages: 1 to 9. There are 9 such pages, contributing $9 \times 1 = 9$ digits.
- Two-digit pages: 10 to 99. There are $99 - 10 + 1 = 90$ such pages, contributing $90 \times 2 = 180$ digits.
- Three-digit pages: 100 to 999. There are $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$ such pages, contributing $900 \times 3 = 2700$ digits.
- Four-digit pages: 1000 to $P$. Since $P > 1000$, there are $(P - 1000) + 1 = P - 999$ such pages. Each of these pages contributes 4 digits. The total number of digits from these pages is $(P - 999) \times 4$.

The total number of digits $D(P)$ is the sum of digits from all these ranges:
$D(P) = (\text{digits for 1-9}) + (\text{digits for 10-99}) + (\text{digits for 100-999}) + (\text{digits for 1000-P})$
$D(P) = 9 + 180 + 2700 + (P - 999) \times 4$
$D(P) = 2889 + 4P - 3996$
$D(P) = 4P - 1107$

The problem states that the number of digits used ($D(P)$) was a multiple of the number of actual pages ($P$). This means $D(P) = k \cdot P$ for some positive integer $k$.
Substituting the expression for $D(P)$:
$4P - 1107 = kP$

We are looking for an integer $P$ such that $1000 < P < 10000$, and this equation holds for some positive integer $k$.
We can rearrange the equation to solve for $k$:
$k = \frac{4P - 1107}{P} = \frac{4P}{P} - \frac{1107}{P} = 4 - \frac{1107}{P}$

Since $k$ must be a positive integer, $4 - \frac{1107}{P}$ must be a positive integer.
Let's use the given range of $P$ ($1000 < P < 10000$) to determine the possible range for $k$.

From $P > 1000$, we have $\frac{1}{P} < \frac{1}{1000}$.
Multiplying by 1107 (which is positive): $\frac{1107}{P} < \frac{1107}{1000} = 1.107$.

From $P < 10000$, we have $\frac{1}{P} > \frac{1}{10000}$.
Multiplying by 1107: $\frac{1107}{P} > \frac{1107}{10000} = 0.1107$.

Combining these inequalities, we get:
$0.1107 < \frac{1107}{P} < 1.107$

Now, substitute this into the expression for $k = 4 - \frac{1107}{P}$.
Since $0.1107 < \frac{1107}{P} < 1.107$, we can subtract this from 4:
$4 - 1.107 < 4 - \frac{1107}{P} < 4 - 0.1107$
$2.893 < k < 3.8893$

Since $k$ must be a positive integer, the only integer value for $k$ in the interval $(2.893, 3.8893)$ is $k = 3$.

Now that we know $k=3$, we can substitute this value back into the equation $D(P) = kP$:
$4P - 1107 = 3P$

Solve for $P$:
$4P - 3P = 1107$
$P = 1107$

We need to check if this value of $P$ satisfies the initial condition $1000 < P < 10000$.
$1000 < 1107 < 10000$. This condition is satisfied.

Thus, the number of pages in the essay is 1107.
Let's verify the number of digits for $P=1107$:
$D(1107) = 4(1107) - 1107 = 4428 - 1107 = 3321$.
Is $D(1107)$ a multiple of $P=1107$?
$3321 / 1107 = 3$. Yes, it is a multiple (with $k=3$).

The hint mentions observing the number of digits for 1000 pages.
$D(1000) = 4(1000) - 1107 = 4000 - 1107 = 2893$.
The ratio $D(1000)/1000 = 2893/1000 = 2.893$.
The hint also asks to think about the ratio between digits and pages ($k = D(P)/P$) and what whole number ($k$) would need to be achieved.
Our calculation showed that for $P > 1000$, the ratio $k = 4 - 1107/P$ starts from 2.893 (when P=1000) and increases as P increases. The range $1000 < P < 10000$ limits this ratio to $2.893 < k < 3.8893$. The only integer ratio in this range is 3. This confirms our value for $k$.

The final answer is $\boxed{1107}$.",True,1,0,0

How many natural numbers less than a googol are both the square of a square and the cube of a cube?

 Hint: Represent any such numbers as N^y where y is some positive real number",Represent any such numbers as N^y where y is some positive real number,"599
The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.
The 36th root of a googol is

90,"Question: What is the 1000th prime number?
 Hint: It is smaller than 10000",It is smaller than 10000,7919,GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's find the 1000th prime number using the hint that it is smaller than 10000.

**Reasoning Steps:**

1.  **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the 1000th number in the sequence of prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...).

2.  **Strategy:** To find the 1000th prime number, we need to generate a list of prime numbers in increasing order until we have at least 1000 of them. The hint tells us that the 1000th prime is less than 10000. This means we only need to generate primes up to some number less than or equal to 10000. A standard method for generating a list of prime numbers up to a given limit is the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

3.  **Choosing the Limit for the Sieve:** The hint says the 1000th prime is less than 10000. Therefore, if we run the Sieve of Eratosthenes up to 10000, we are guaranteed to find the 1000th prime within this range. Let's set our limit N = 10000.

4.  **Applying the Sieve of Eratosthenes (up to N=10000):**
    *   Create a list of boolean values (or marks) for numbers from 0 to N (10000). Initially, assume all numbers from 2 up to N are potentially prime. We can represent this with a boolean array `isPrime` where `isPrime[i]` is `True` if `i` is potentially prime, and `False` otherwise.
    *   Initialize `isPrime[0]` and `isPrime[1]` to `False` because 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.
    *   Initialize all other entries `isPrime[i]` for i from 2 to N to `True`.
    *   Start with the first prime number, p = 2.
    *   Iterate through the list starting from p. If `isPrime[p]` is `True` (meaning p is a prime number we haven't ruled out yet):
        *   Mark all multiples of p greater than or equal to p*p as not prime. We do this by setting `isPrime[i]` to `False` for `i = p*p, p*p + p, p*p + 2p, ...` up to N. (We start marking from p*p because any smaller multiple of p, like 2p, 3p, ..., (p-1)p, would have already been marked as composite by their smaller prime factors 2, 3, ..., p-1 respectively when we processed those smaller primes).
    *   Move to the next number greater than p. If `isPrime[p+1]` is `True`, set the new p to p+1 and repeat the marking process. If `isPrime[p+1]` is `False`, it means p+1 is composite, so move to the next number after p+1, and so on, until we find the next number `p'` where `isPrime[p']` is `True`.
    *   Continue this process with the next unmarked number as the new prime `p`. We only need to continue this process up to `p*p <= N`. This is because if a number `m <= N` is composite, it must have at least one prime factor less than or equal to `sqrt(m)`. So, if we sieve up to `sqrt(N)`, all composite numbers up to N will be marked. `sqrt(10000) = 100`. So, we sieve with primes up to 100.

5.  **Executing the Sieve (Conceptual or Computational):**
    *   Initialize `isPrime[0...10000]` with `False` at 0, 1 and `True` elsewhere.
    *   For p = 2: `isPrime[4], isPrime[6], isPrime[8], ...` up to 10000 are set to `False`.
    *   For p = 3: `isPrime[9], isPrime[12], isPrime[15], ...` up to 10000 are set to `False`. (Note: 6 was already marked by 2).
    *   For p = 5: `isPrime[25], isPrime[30], isPrime[35], ...` up to 10000 are set to `False`.
    *   ... Continue this for p = 7, 11, 13, ..., up to p = 97 (the largest prime less than or equal to 100).

6.  **Collecting and Counting the Primes:** After the sieve is complete, iterate through the `isPrime` array from 2 to 10000. Any index `i` where `isPrime[i]` is still `True` corresponds to a prime number. Collect these prime numbers in a list and count them.

7.  **Finding the 1000th Prime:** List the primes found: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ... Keep track of the count as you list them. The number corresponding to the 1000th count is our answer.

8.  **Performing the Listing and Counting (Using a computational approach as manual would be prohibitive):**
    *   Start with `count = 0`.
    *   Iterate `num` from 2 to 10000.
    *   If `isPrime[num]` is `True`:
        *   Increment `count`.
        *   If `count` reaches 1000, then `num` is the 1000th prime number. Stop and record `num`.

9.  **Result of the Sieve and Counting:** Performing the Sieve up to 10000 and counting reveals that there are 1229 prime numbers up to 10000. The 1000th prime number in this sequence is 7919.

10. **Verification:** Is 7919 prime? Yes. Is it less than 10000? Yes.

The 1000th prime number is indeed 7919.

92,"Question: You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?
(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.

(2): m > l > x > s
(3): 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650, divided by 25 gives...
(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186
(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186
Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.
The solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10. This is a total of 35 slushes, and therefore 35 coupons given out. 35 * $0.75 = $26.25 in losses from the coupons. $46.50 - $26.25 = $20.25 net profit when accounting for the coupons. You made your goal!",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main goal is to determine if the net profit, after accounting for the cost of the free slushes given away via coupons, reached at least $20.

2.  **Analyze the Costs and Profits per Slush Size:**
    *   We are given the selling price, cup cost, and ingredient cost per ounce for each size.
    *   The ingredient cost is 6 cents per ounce.
    *   The cost of ingredients for each size is:
        *   Small (12 oz): 12 oz * 6 cents/oz = 72 cents
        *   Medium (20 oz): 20 oz * 6 cents/oz = 120 cents
        *   Large (32 oz): 32 oz * 6 cents/oz = 192 cents
        *   X-large (40 oz): 40 oz * 6 cents/oz = 240 cents
    *   The total cost per slush is the cup cost plus the ingredient cost:
        *   Small: 3 cents (cup) + 72 cents (ingredients) = 75 cents
        *   Medium: 5 cents (cup) + 120 cents (ingredients) = 125 cents
        *   Large: 8 cents (cup) + 192 cents (ingredients) = 200 cents
        *   X-large: 10 cents (cup) + 240 cents (ingredients) = 250 cents
    *   The profit per slush is the selling price minus the total cost:
        *   Small: $1.50 (150 cents) - 75 cents = 75 cents = $0.75. (Matches hint)
        *   Medium: $2.25 (225 cents) - 125 cents = 100 cents = $1.00. (Matches hint)
        *   Large: $3.75 (375 cents) - 200 cents = 175 cents = $1.75. (Matches hint)
        *   X-large: $4.50 (450 cents) - 250 cents = 200 cents = $2.00. (Matches hint)
    *   The cost of making a small slush (which is the cost of the free slush given via coupon) is 75 cents or $0.75.

3.  **Set up the Profit Equation:**
    *   Let S, M, L, and X be the number of small, medium, large, and x-large slushes sold, respectively. These must be positive integers.
    *   The total profit before accounting for coupons is given as $46.50.
    *   The total profit is the sum of the profits from each size sold:
        $0.75 * S + $1.00 * M + $1.75 * L + $2.00 * X = $46.50

4.  **Incorporate Sales Relationships and Constraints:**
    *   ""medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls!"": M = 4S.
    *   ""followed by large, then x-large, and finally small"": M > L > X > S.
    *   Substitute M = 4S into the inequality: 4S > L > X > S.
    *   Substitute M = 4S into the profit equation:
        $0.75 * S + $1.00 * (4S) + $1.75 * L + $2.00 * X = $46.50
        $0.75S + $4.00S + $1.75L + $2.00X = $46.50
        $4.75S + $1.75L + $2.00X = $46.50
    *   Multiply the equation by 4 to remove decimals:
        19S + 7L + 8X = 186

5.  **Solve the Diophantine Equation with Inequality Constraints:**
    *   We need to find positive integer solutions for S, L, and X that satisfy 19S + 7L + 8X = 186 and 4S > L > X > S.
    *   From the profit equation 19S + 7L + 8X = 186, since L > S and X > S, we have 7L > 7S and 8X > 8S.
    *   Therefore, 19S + 7L + 8X > 19S + 7S + 8S = 34S.
    *   So, 186 > 34S, which means S < 186 / 34 ≈ 5.47.
    *   Possible positive integer values for S are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

    *   Let's test each possible value of S:

            *   For L > 13, 7L will be greater than 91, leading to a negative value for 8X, which is not possible for positive X. No solution for S=5.

    *   The only integer solution satisfying the conditions is S=4, L=10, X=5.
    *   From M = 4S, we get M = 4 * 4 = 16.
    *   Check the number of sales: S=4, M=16, L=10, X=5.
    *   Check the order: M > L > X > S => 16 > 10 > 5 > 4. This is true.
    *   Check the total profit: $0.75(4) + $1.00(16) + $1.75(10) + $2.00(5) = $3.00 + $16.00 + $17.50 + $10.00 = $46.50. This matches the given profit.

6.  **Calculate the Coupon Loss:**
    *   A coupon for a free small slush is given with every slush purchased.
    *   The total number of slushes purchased is S + M + L + X = 4 + 16 + 10 + 5 = 35.
    *   So, 35 coupons were given out.
    *   The loss per coupon is the cost to make one small slush, which is $0.75.
    *   The total loss due to coupons is the number of coupons multiplied by the cost per coupon: 35 * $0.75.
    *   Total loss = 35 * (3/4) = 105/4 = $26.25.

7.  **Calculate the Net Profit:**
    *   The net profit is the profit before coupons minus the total loss due to coupons.
    *   Net profit = $46.50 - $26.25 = $20.25.

8.  **Compare Net Profit to the Goal:**
    *   The net profit goal was $20.
    *   The calculated net profit is $20.25.
    *   Is $20.25 >= $20? Yes.

9.  **Conclusion:** The net profit after accounting for the coupon losses is $20.25, which meets the goal of profiting $20.

The final answer is $\boxed{Yes}$.",True,1,1,0
93,"Question: Question Mark is very proud with himself. He has just designed his very own function machine. When a number goes into this machine, a different number comes out. A basic formula is used to determine what comes out. If:
3 -> 90
4 -> 272
5 -> 650
6 -> 1332
7 -> 2450
What will come out if 10 goes in?
 Hint: Take some power of each input and try to see how close you get to the output",Take some power of each input and try to see how close you get to the output,"10100. The formula is n^4 + n^2. In other words:
3^4 (81) + 3^2 (9) = 90
4^4 (256) + 4^2 (16) = 272
5^4 (625) + 5^2 (25) = 650
6^4 (1296) + 6^2 (36) = 1332
7^4 (2401) + 7^2 (49) = 2450
And therefore:
10^4 (10000) + 10^2 (100) = 10100",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let the input number be $x$ and the output number be $f(x)$. We are given the following input-output pairs:
$x=3 \rightarrow f(3) = 90$
$x=4 \rightarrow f(4) = 272$
$x=5 \rightarrow f(5) = 650$
$x=6 \rightarrow f(6) = 1332$
$x=7 \rightarrow f(7) = 2450$

We need to find the formula for the function $f(x)$ and then determine the output when the input is 10, i.e., find $f(10)$.

The hint suggests taking some power of each input and seeing how close we get to the output. Let's try the first few powers of the input $x$.

Calculate $x^2$ for the given inputs:
$3^2 = 9$
$4^2 = 16$
$5^2 = 25$
$6^2 = 36$
$7^2 = 49$
These values are much smaller than the outputs.

Calculate $x^3$ for the given inputs:
$3^3 = 27$
$4^3 = 64$
$5^3 = 125$
$6^3 = 216$
$7^3 = 343$
These values are still significantly smaller than the outputs.

Calculate $x^4$ for the given inputs:
$3^4 = 81$
$4^4 = 256$
$5^4 = 625$
$6^4 = 1296$
$7^4 = 2401$
These values are relatively close to the given output values. Let's examine the difference between the actual output $f(x)$ and $x^4$ for each input $x$:
For $x=3$: $f(3) - 3^4 = 90 - 81 = 9$
For $x=4$: $f(4) - 4^4 = 272 - 256 = 16$
For $x=5$: $f(5) - 5^4 = 650 - 625 = 25$
For $x=6$: $f(6) - 6^4 = 1332 - 1296 = 36$
For $x=7$: $f(7) - 7^4 = 2450 - 2401 = 49$

The differences we found are 9, 16, 25, 36, 49. We recognize these numbers as the squares of the inputs:
$9 = 3^2$
$16 = 4^2$
$25 = 5^2$
$36 = 6^2$
$49 = 7^2$

This suggests a pattern where the difference between $f(x)$ and $x^4$ is $x^2$.
So, we can write the relationship as $f(x) - x^4 = x^2$.
Rearranging this equation gives us the formula for the function:
$f(x) = x^4 + x^2$.

Let's verify this formula using the given input-output pairs:
For $x=3$: $f(3) = 3^4 + 3^2 = 81 + 9 = 90$. (Matches the given output)
For $x=4$: $f(4) = 4^4 + 4^2 = 256 + 16 = 272$. (Matches the given output)
For $x=5$: $f(5) = 5^4 + 5^2 = 625 + 25 = 650$. (Matches the given output)
For $x=6$: $f(6) = 6^4 + 6^2 = 1296 + 36 = 1332$. (Matches the given output)
For $x=7$: $f(7) = 7^4 + 7^2 = 2401 + 49 = 2450$. (Matches the given output)

The formula $f(x) = x^4 + x^2$ holds true for all the given examples.

Now, we need to find what comes out if the input is 10. This means we need to calculate $f(10)$ using the formula we found:
$f(10) = 10^4 + 10^2$.

Calculate the powers of 10:
$10^4 = 10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 10000$
$10^2 = 10 \times 10 = 100$

Now, substitute these values into the formula for $f(10)$:
$f(10) = 10000 + 100 = 10100$.

Thus, if 10 goes into the function machine, the number 10100 will come out.

The final answer is $\boxed{10100}$.",True,1,0,0

Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.

 Hint: Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

The title hints you can easily go on to find for a ten-digit number that otherwise has same characteristics.","Answer-
397.
397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.
102?  Is 204 = 201 + 1?  No.
103?  Is 206 = 301 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds even.]
396?  Is 792 = 693 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds again.]
The answer given is the only one that passes.
As for extra points, an infinite number of 9's can be added between the 3 and the 7 without spoiling the major characteristics.

96,"Question: An iterative equation is one where an initial value is put into the equation to obtain a result, which is in turn put back into the equation as an input and the process is repeated for either a fixed number of times or until a final value is achieved (where you get the same number out as you put in).
For example, if you start with the iterative equation,
A{n+1} = 1/A{n} + 1
And you put in an initial value of 1, you would get 2 as the result.  Put the 2 back in as the input and you would get 1.5, and so on.

To prove to yourself that this is right, assume that for a sufficiently large number of iterations, A{n+1} = A{n}, so you can rewrite the equation as:
A(A+1) = A + 2
... A^2 + A = A + 2
... A^2 = 2
... A = SQRT(2) !",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step, following the logic and the hint provided.

1.  **Understand the Goal:** We need to find a simple iterative equation $A_{n+1} = f(A_n)$ that converges to $\sqrt{2}$. The function $f(A)$ should only use addition and division. The convergence should be such that after 5 iterations, starting from almost any value (like 1 or 0), the result is a good approximation of $\sqrt{2}$ (accurate to 3 decimal places or < 0.1% error). The equation itself should not contain square roots.

2.  **Understand Fixed Points:** The problem mentions a ""final value is achieved (where you get the same number out as you put in)"". This means the iterative process converges to a fixed point $L$, such that $L = f(L)$. We want this fixed point to be $\sqrt{2}$. So, we need $f(\sqrt{2}) = \sqrt{2}$.

3.  **Use the Hint: Start with $A^2 = 2$.** The value we want the iteration to converge to is $A = \sqrt{2}$. This satisfies $A^2 = 2$. We need to rearrange $A^2 = 2$ into the form $A = f(A)$ using only addition and division, such that $f(A) = A$ is equivalent to $A^2 = 2$.

4.  **Manipulate $A^2 = 2$ to find $A = f(A)$:**
    *   We want to create an expression involving $A$ such that when the expression equals $A$, the original equation $A^2=2$ is satisfied.
    *   Let's try adding $kA$ to both sides of $A^2=2$:
        $A^2 + kA = 2 + kA$
    *   We want to isolate $A$ on the left side as $A = f(A)$. Factor $A$ on the left:
        $A(A+k) = 2 + kA$
    *   Now, divide by $(A+k)$:
        $A = (2 + kA) / (A + k)$
    *   This gives us a potential iterative function: $f(A) = (kA + 2) / (A + k)$.
    *   Let's check the fixed point again: If $L = (kL + 2) / (L + k)$, then $L(L+k) = kL+2$, which means $L^2 + kL = kL + 2$, simplifying to $L^2 = 2$. This fixed point is indeed $\sqrt{2}$ (and $-\sqrt{2}$).

5.  **Choose the Value of $k$ based on Operator Constraint:** The function $f(A) = (kA + 2) / (A + k)$ uses addition, division, and multiplication by the constant $k$. The hint states ""The only mathematical operators you need are addition and division.""
    *   If we choose $k=0$, $f(A) = 2/A$. The iteration is $A_{n+1} = 2/A_n$. Let's test this with $A_0=1$: $A_1=2$, $A_2=1$, $A_3=2$, ... This does not converge.
    *   If we choose $k=1$, $f(A) = (A + 2) / (A + 1)$. This function uses only addition and division. This looks promising. Let's check this iterative equation: $A_{n+1} = (A_n + 2) / (A_n + 1)$.

6.  **Test the Candidate Equation: $A_{n+1} = (A_n + 2) / (A_n + 1)$**
    *   Check Fixed Point: $L = (L+2)/(L+1) \implies L(L+1) = L+2 \implies L^2+L = L+2 \implies L^2=2$. Correct fixed points.
    *   Check Operators: Uses only addition and division. Correct.
    *   Check Initial Values: The equation is defined unless $A_n = -1$. If we start with $A_0 \neq -1$, will $A_n$ ever be -1? $A_{n} = (A_{n-1}+2)/(A_{n-1}+1) = -1 \implies A_{n-1}+2 = -(A_{n-1}+1) \implies A_{n-1}+2 = -A_{n-1}-1 \implies 2A_{n-1} = -3 \implies A_{n-1} = -3/2$. So, the iteration is undefined if $A_0 = -3/2$, or if $A_n = -3/2$ for some $n \geq 0$. For any other initial value (positive or almost any negative), it should converge. This fits the ""almost any"" criteria.
    *   Check Convergence Speed and Accuracy (5 iterations): Let's start with $A_0 = 1$ as in the problem's example.
        *   $A_0 = 1$
        *   $A_1 = (1 + 2) / (1 + 1) = 3/2 = 1.5$
        *   $A_2 = (1.5 + 2) / (1.5 + 1) = 3.5 / 2.5 = 35 / 25 = 7/5 = 1.4$
        *   $A_3 = (1.4 + 2) / (1.4 + 1) = 3.4 / 2.4 = 34 / 24 = 17/12 \approx 1.416666...$
        *   $A_4 = (17/12 + 2) / (17/12 + 1) = (17/12 + 24/12) / (17/12 + 12/12) = (41/12) / (29/12) = 41/29 \approx 1.413793...$
        *   $A_5 = (41/29 + 2) / (41/29 + 1) = (41/29 + 58/29) / (41/29 + 29/29) = (99/29) / (70/29) = 99/70$
        *   $99/70 \approx 1.4142857...$
    *   Compare $A_5$ to $\sqrt{2}$: $\sqrt{2} \approx 1.41421356...$
        *   Accuracy to 3 decimal places: $1.41428...$ rounded to 3 decimal places is $1.414$. This matches $\sqrt{2}$ rounded to 3 decimal places. Correct.
        *   Accuracy less than 0.1%: The error is $|A_5 - \sqrt{2}| \approx |1.4142857 - 1.41421356| \approx 0.000072$.
        *   Percentage error = $(|A_5 - \sqrt{2}| / \sqrt{2}) \times 100\% \approx (0.000072 / 1.41421356) \times 100\% \approx 0.005\%$. This is much less than 0.1%. Correct.

7.  **Alternative Manipulation (Leading to Newton's Method):** The hint ""Try beginning with the expression: $A^2 = 2$"" can also be interpreted in another way.
    *   $A^2 = 2 \implies A = 2/A$. This doesn't converge on its own.
    *   If $A_n$ is an approximation, then $\sqrt{2}$ is between $A_n$ and $2/A_n$. A common approach is to average them:
        $A_{n+1} = (A_n + 2/A_n) / 2$.
    *   This uses addition and division (division by $A_n$ and division by 2). Division by 2 is equivalent to multiplication by 1/2. The problem asks for *only* addition and division. While division by a constant is a type of division, the structure $(A_n + 2) / (A_n + 1)$ seems to fit the ""addition and division"" description more strictly, as it's a single division of a sum by a sum.
    *   Let's check the convergence of $A_{n+1} = (A_n + 2/A_n)/2$ for $A_0=1$:
        *   $A_0 = 1$
        *   $A_1 = (1 + 2/1) / 2 = 3/2 = 1.5$
        *   $A_2 = (1.5 + 2/1.5) / 2 = (1.5 + 4/3) / 2 = (3/2 + 4/3) / 2 = (9/6 + 8/6) / 2 = (17/6) / 2 = 17/12 \approx 1.41666...$
        *   $A_3 = (17/12 + 2/(17/12)) / 2 = (17/12 + 24/17) / 2 = ((17^2 + 12 \times 24) / (12 \times 17)) / 2 = (289 + 288) / 204 / 2 = 577 / 408 \approx 1.414215...$
    *   By $A_3$, this method is already accurate to 5 decimal places. This converges significantly *faster* than described by the problem (which required 5 steps for 3 d.p. or 0.1% accuracy). Therefore, $A_{n+1} = (A_n + 2)/(A_n + 1)$ is a better fit for the described convergence speed.

8.  **Final Check:** The equation $A_{n+1} = (A_n + 2)/(A_n + 1)$ meets all criteria:
    *   Iterative.
    *   Fixed point is $\sqrt{2}$.
    *   Uses only addition and division.
    *   No square root expressions.
    *   Single-order algebra in the $A_n$ terms within the function.
    *   Converges for almost any initial value.
    *   With $A_0=1$, $A_5 = 99/70$ provides the specified accuracy.

The problem is likely pointing towards the equation derived from $A = (kA + 2)/(A + k)$ with $k=1$, or from manipulating $A^2=2$ as $A^2+A = A+2 \implies A(A+1) = A+2 \implies A = (A+2)/(A+1)$.

The equation is $A_{n+1} = (A_n + 2) / (A_n + 1)$.

Final check of the calculation for $A_5$ accuracy:
$\sqrt{2} \approx 1.41421356$
$A_5 = 99/70 \approx 1.41428571$
Absolute error = $|1.41428571 - 1.41421356| \approx 0.00007215$.
$\sqrt{2}$ to 3 decimal places is $1.414$. $A_5$ to 3 decimal places is $1.414$. Accuracy met.

98,"Question: Suppose you're in a hallway lined with 100 closed lockers.
You begin by opening every locker. Then you close every second locker. Then you go to every third locker and open it (if it's closed) or close it (if it's open).  Let's call this action toggling a locker. Continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n.  After 100 passes, where you toggle only locker #100, how many lockers are open?
 Hint: Think about this can be related to the number of factors of each number",Think about this can be related to the number of factors of each number,"Answer: 10 lockers are left open:
Lockers #1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.
Each of these numbers are perfect squares. This problem is based on the factors of the locker number.
Each locker is toggled by each factor; for example, locker #40 is toggled on pass number 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40.  That's eight toggles: open-closed-open-closed-open-closed-open-closed.
The only way a locker could be left open is if it is toggled an odd number of times. The only numbers with an odd number of factors are the perfect
squares. Thus, the perfect squares are left open.
For example, locker #25 is toggled on pass number 1, 5, and 25 (three toggles): open-closed-open.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let's analyze the state of each locker. Initially, all 100 lockers are closed. Let's denote the state of locker $k$ by $S_k$, where $S_k=0$ for closed and $S_k=1$ for open. Initially, $S_k=0$ for $k=1, 2, \dots, 100$.

There are 100 passes. In pass $n$, we visit every $n$th locker and toggle its state. Toggling means changing the state from closed to open, or from open to closed.
Locker $k$ is visited during pass $n$ if $k$ is a multiple of $n$. This means $n$ must be a divisor of $k$.
Since there are 100 passes, numbered $n=1, 2, \dots, 100$, locker $k$ (where $1 \le k \le 100$) is visited and toggled during pass $n$ if $n$ is a divisor of $k$ and $1 \le n \le 100$.
Since $k \le 100$, any divisor $n$ of $k$ must be less than or equal to $k$, and thus less than or equal to 100. So, locker $k$ is toggled exactly on every pass $n$ where $n$ is a divisor of $k$.

Let's consider the state of locker $k$ after 100 passes. Its state changes every time it is toggled.
Initially, locker $k$ is closed (state 0).
If it is toggled once, it becomes open (state 1).
If it is toggled twice, it becomes closed (state 0 -> 1 -> 0).
If it is toggled three times, it becomes open (state 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1).
In general, after $m$ toggles, the final state of locker $k$ will be open if $m$ is odd, and closed if $m$ is even.

The number of times locker $k$ is toggled is equal to the number of its divisors. Let $d(k)$ denote the number of divisors of $k$.
So, locker $k$ will be open after 100 passes if and only if $d(k)$ is an odd number.

Now, we need to determine for which numbers $k$ (from 1 to 100) the number of divisors $d(k)$ is odd.
Let the prime factorization of $k$ be $k = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \dots p_r^{e_r}$, where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers and $e_i \ge 1$ are integers.
The number of divisors of $k$ is given by the formula $d(k) = (e_1+1)(e_2+1)\dots(e_r+1)$.
For $d(k)$ to be an odd number, every factor $(e_i+1)$ in the product must be an odd number.
For $(e_i+1)$ to be odd, the exponent $e_i$ must be an even number.
So, $d(k)$ is odd if and only if all the exponents $e_1, e_2, \dots, e_r$ in the prime factorization of $k$ are even.

If all exponents $e_i$ are even, we can write $e_i = 2f_i$ for some non-negative integers $f_i$.
Then $k = p_1^{2f_1} p_2^{2f_2} \dots p_r^{2f_r} = (p_1^{f_1} p_2^{f_2} \dots p_r^{f_r})^2$.
This shows that $k$ is a perfect square.
Conversely, if $k$ is a perfect square, $k = m^2$ for some integer $m$. Let the prime factorization of $m$ be $m = p_1^{g_1} p_2^{g_2} \dots p_r^{g_r}$. Then $k = m^2 = (p_1^{g_1} p_2^{g_2} \dots p_r^{g_r})^2 = p_1^{2g_1} p_2^{2g_2} \dots p_r^{2g_r}$. The exponents in the prime factorization of $k$ are $2g_i$, which are all even. Thus, $d(k) = (2g_1+1)(2g_2+1)\dots(2g_r+1)$, which is a product of odd numbers, and therefore is odd.

So, locker $k$ is open after 100 passes if and only if $k$ is a perfect square.

We need to find the number of open lockers, which is the number of perfect squares between 1 and 100, inclusive.
These are the numbers $k$ such that $k = m^2$ for some integer $m$, and $1 \le k \le 100$.
This inequality becomes $1 \le m^2 \le 100$. Taking the square root of all parts (and considering positive $m$ since $k$ is positive), we get $\sqrt{1} \le m \le \sqrt{100}$, which simplifies to $1 \le m \le 10$.
The possible integer values for $m$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
The corresponding perfect squares are:
$1^2 = 1$
$2^2 = 4$
$3^2 = 9$
$4^2 = 16$
$5^2 = 25$
$6^2 = 36$
$7^2 = 49$
$8^2 = 64$
$9^2 = 81$
$10^2 = 100$
These are 10 numbers. The next perfect square is $11^2 = 121$, which is greater than 100.

Thus, there are 10 perfect squares between 1 and 100. These are the lockers that will be open.
The lockers that are open are numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.
There are 10 such lockers.

The final answer is $\boxed{10}$.",True,1,0,0

We are given the following conditions:
1. When $N$ is divided by 2, the remainder is 1. This can be written as $N \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$.
2. When $N$ is divided by 3, the remainder is 2. This can be written as $N \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$.
3. When $N$ is divided by 4, the remainder is 3. This can be written as $N \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$.
4. When $N$ is divided by 5, the remainder is 4. This can be written as $N \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$.

8. When $N$ is divided by 9, the remainder is 8. This can be written as $N \equiv 8 \pmod{9}$.

We are also given that $N < 3000$.

Let's look at the congruences. We can notice a pattern in the remainders. In each case, the remainder is one less than the divisor.
$N \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$ is equivalent to $N \equiv 2-1 \pmod{2}$, or $N \equiv -1 \pmod{2}$.
$N \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ is equivalent to $N \equiv 3-1 \pmod{3}$, or $N \equiv -1 \pmod{3}$.
$N \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$ is equivalent to $N \equiv 4-1 \pmod{4}$, or $N \equiv -1 \pmod{4}$.
$N \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$ is equivalent to $N \equiv 5-1 \pmod{5}$, or $N \equiv -1 \pmod{5}$.
$N \equiv 5 \pmod{6}$ is equivalent to $N \equiv 6-1 \pmod{6}$, or $N \equiv -1 \pmod{6}$.
$N \equiv 6 \pmod{7}$ is equivalent to $N \equiv 7-1 \pmod{7}$, or $N \equiv -1 \pmod{7}$.
$N \equiv 7 \pmod{8}$ is equivalent to $N \equiv 8-1 \pmod{8}$, or $N \equiv -1 \pmod{8}$.
$N \equiv 8 \pmod{9}$ is equivalent to $N \equiv 9-1 \pmod{9}$, or $N \equiv -1 \pmod{9}$.

So we have $N \equiv -1$ modulo each of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
This means that $N - (-1)$ is divisible by each of these numbers.
In other words, $N+1$ is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
Therefore, $N+1$ is a common multiple of these numbers.
The smallest positive common multiple of a set of numbers is their least common multiple (LCM).
So, $N+1$ must be a multiple of LCM(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).

We need to calculate the LCM of {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
Let's find the prime factorization of each number:
$2 = 2^1$
$3 = 3^1$
$4 = 2^2$
$5 = 5^1$
$6 = 2 \times 3$
$7 = 7^1$
$8 = 2^3$
$9 = 3^2$

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
The prime factors involved are 2, 3, 5, and 7.
Highest power of 2: $2^3$ (from 8)
Highest power of 3: $3^2$ (from 9)
Highest power of 5: $5^1$ (from 5)
Highest power of 7: $7^1$ (from 7)

LCM(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = $2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 = 8 \times 9 \times 5 \times 7 = 72 \times 35$.
$72 \times 35 = 72 \times (30 + 5) = 72 \times 30 + 72 \times 5 = 2160 + 360 = 2520$.

So, $N+1$ is a multiple of 2520.
This means $N+1 = 2520k$ for some integer $k$.
Since $N$ is a number, it is implicitly positive. $N \ge 1$.
$N+1 \ge 2$. So $2520k \ge 2$. Since 2520 > 0, $k$ must be positive. So $k$ is a positive integer.
$N = 2520k - 1$.

We are given that $N < 3000$.
$2520k - 1 < 3000$.
$2520k < 3001$.
$k < \frac{3001}{2520}$.

Let's calculate the value of $\frac{3001}{2520}$:
$\frac{3001}{2520} \approx 1.190079...$
So, $k < 1.190079...$.

Since $k$ must be a positive integer, the only possible value for $k$ that satisfies $0 < k < 1.190079...$ is $k=1$.

Substitute $k=1$ into the expression for $N$:
$N = 2520 \times 1 - 1 = 2520 - 1 = 2519$.

Let's check if $N=2519$ satisfies all the given conditions.
$N = 2519$.
$2519 < 3000$ (True).
$2519 \div 2$: $2519 = 2 \times 1259 + 1$. Remainder is 1. (Correct)
$2519 \div 3$: $2519 = 3 \times 839 + 2$. Remainder is 2. (Correct)
$2519 \div 4$: $2519 = 4 \times 629 + 3$. Remainder is 3. (Correct)
$2519 \div 5$: $2519 = 5 \times 503 + 4$. Remainder is 4. (Correct)
$2519 \div 6$: $2519 = 6 \times 419 + 5$. Remainder is 5. (Correct)
$2519 \div 7$: $2519 = 7 \times 359 + 6$. Remainder is 6. (Correct)
$2519 \div 8$: $2519 = 8 \times 314 + 7$. Remainder is 7. (Correct)
$2519 \div 9$: $2519 = 9 \times 279 + 8$. Remainder is 8. (Correct)

All conditions are satisfied for $N=2519$.
If we consider $k=2$, $N = 2520 \times 2 - 1 = 5040 - 1 = 5039$, which is not less than 3000. Any larger integer value for $k$ would give an even larger number.

Thus, the only number that satisfies all the conditions is 2519.

The hint ""-1 mod LCM(2, 3, 4, ..., 8, 9)"" means that $N \equiv -1 \pmod{\text{LCM}(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)}$. This confirms our deduction that $N+1$ is a multiple of the LCM.

 Hint: Start from the last digits.",Start from the last digits.,"First, there are ten different letters in this equation: E, F, I, N, O, R, S, T, X, Y. Therefore, every digit from 0 to 9 is used.
Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.
If T=8, then R=X+3, we can have R=6, X=3, or R=7, X=4.
If R=6, X=3, the remaining digits are 2, 4, 7, and again we can't choose S=F+1.
If R=7, X=4, the remaining digits are 2, 3, 6, where 3=2+1. Hence S=3, F=2.

When the two cars race in opposite directions, they meet every 30 seconds. This means that in 30 seconds, the sum of the distances covered by both cars is equal to the length of the track.
The distance covered by car 1 in 30 seconds is $30x$.
The distance covered by car 2 in 30 seconds is $30y$.
According to the problem and the hint, we have the equation:
$30x + 30y = 1800$
Dividing this equation by 30, we get:
$x + y = 60$ (Equation 1)

When the two cars race in the same direction, they meet every 120 seconds. This means that in 120 seconds, the faster car gains one full lap (1800 meters) on the slower car. Let's assume, without loss of generality, that car 1 is faster than car 2, so $x \geq y$.
In 120 seconds, car 1 travels a distance of $120x$ meters.
In 120 seconds, car 2 travels a distance of $120y$ meters.
The difference in the distance traveled is equal to the length of the track:
$120x - 120y = 1800$
Dividing this equation by 120, we get:
$x - y = 15$ (Equation 2)
If we assumed $y > x$, the equation would be $120y - 120x = 1800$, which simplifies to $y - x = 15$. In either case, the absolute difference of the speeds is 15, i.e., $|x - y| = 15$.

We now have a system of two linear equations:
1) $x + y = 60$
2) $x - y = 15$ (assuming $x \geq y$)

We can use the method of elimination to solve this system, as suggested by the hint. Add Equation 1 and Equation 2:
$(x + y) + (x - y) = 60 + 15$
$2x = 75$
$x = \frac{75}{2}$
$x = 37.5$

Now substitute the value of $x$ into Equation 1 to find $y$:
$37.5 + y = 60$
$y = 60 - 37.5$
$y = 22.5$

The speeds of the two cars are 37.5 m/s and 22.5 m/s. This result assumes $x \geq y$, which is consistent with $37.5 \geq 22.5$. If we had started with the assumption $y > x$, we would have the system $x+y=60$ and $y-x=15$, which would lead to $y=37.5$ and $x=22.5$. In both cases, the speeds of the two cars are 37.5 m/s and 22.5 m/s.

We can check our answer:
When moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is $x+y = 37.5 + 22.5 = 60$ m/s. The time to meet is $\frac{1800}{60} = 30$ seconds, which matches the problem statement.
When moving in the same direction, their relative speed (difference in speeds) is $|x-y| = |37.5 - 22.5| = 15$ m/s. The time for the faster car to gain a lap on the slower car is $\frac{1800}{15} = 120$ seconds, which also matches the problem statement.

The speeds of the two cars are 37.5 m/s and 22.5 m/s.

In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.

Solving for x:
x= 42.985 degrees",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break down this problem step by step, following the logic suggested by the hint.

**1. Understand the Problem:**

We have hot water at 105°F and cold water at 45°F. We want to mix them to get a temperature of 98.6°F. The hot water faucet is turned on all the way, which we can assume means it's turned to its maximum rotation. The maximum rotation for each faucet is 360 degrees. We need to find out how much the cold water faucet needs to be rotated to achieve the target temperature.

**2. Interpret the Hint:**

The hint says: ""Add how much you've rotated each and divide by the total rotation to get the average temperature.""

Let's consider what this likely means in the context of mixing temperatures. The final temperature of a mixture is a weighted average of the temperatures of the components, where the weights are typically the amounts (volumes or flow rates) of each component. The problem links rotation to flow/amount. It's reasonable to assume that the flow rate of water from each faucet is proportional to how much it is rotated (or how open it is).

So, if R_hot is the rotation of the hot faucet and R_cold is the rotation of the cold faucet, the flow rate from the hot faucet is proportional to R_hot, and the flow rate from the cold faucet is proportional to R_cold. The hint suggests that the mixed temperature (average temperature) is calculated using the rotations as weights in the average:

T_mix = (R_hot * T_hot + R_cold * T_cold) / (R_hot + R_cold)

This formula represents the weighted average of the temperatures, where the weights are the rotations of the faucets. This interpretation aligns with how temperature mixing problems are usually solved when flow rates are proportional to a control mechanism (like rotation).

**3. Identify the Knowns and Unknowns:**

*   Hot water temperature (T_hot) = 105°F
*   Cold water temperature (T_cold) = 45°F
*   Target mixed temperature (T_mix) = 98.6°F
*   Maximum rotation for each faucet = 360 degrees
*   Hot water faucet is turned on all the way. This means the rotation of the hot faucet (R_hot) = 360 degrees.
*   We need to find the rotation of the cold faucet (R_cold).

**4. Set up the Equation:**

Using the weighted average formula derived from the hint's interpretation, we substitute the known values:

98.6 = (360 * 105 + R_cold * 45) / (360 + R_cold)

**5. Solve the Equation for R_cold:**

We need to isolate R_cold in the equation.

*   **Step 5a: Multiply both sides by the denominator** to get rid of the fraction.
    98.6 * (360 + R_cold) = 360 * 105 + R_cold * 45

*   **Step 5b: Distribute** the 98.6 on the left side.
    (98.6 * 360) + (98.6 * R_cold) = (360 * 105) + (45 * R_cold)

*   **Step 5c: Perform the multiplications** for the constant terms.
    98.6 * 360 = 35496
    360 * 105 = 37800

*   **Step 5d: Substitute** these calculated values back into the equation.
    35496 + 98.6 * R_cold = 37800 + 45 * R_cold

*   **Step 5e: Gather the terms containing R_cold** on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side. Let's move the R_cold terms to the left and the constant terms to the right.
    Subtract 45 * R_cold from both sides:
    35496 + 98.6 * R_cold - 45 * R_cold = 37800 + 45 * R_cold - 45 * R_cold
    35496 + (98.6 - 45) * R_cold = 37800

    Subtract 35496 from both sides:
    35496 - 35496 + 53.6 * R_cold = 37800 - 35496
    53.6 * R_cold = 2304

*   **Step 5f: Isolate R_cold** by dividing both sides by 53.6.
    R_cold = 2304 / 53.6

*   **Step 5g: Calculate the value** of R_cold.
    R_cold ≈ 43

So, the required rotation for the cold water faucet is approximately 43 degrees.

**6. Verify the Solution (Optional but Recommended):**

Let's plug R_cold = 43 degrees back into the mixed temperature formula to see if we get approximately 98.6°F.

T_mix = (R_hot * T_hot + R_cold * T_cold) / (R_hot + R_cold)
T_mix = (360 * 105 + 43 * 45) / (360 + 43)
T_mix = (37800 + 1935) / (403)
T_mix = 39735 / 403
T_mix ≈ 98.598°F

This is very close to the target temperature of 98.6°F, confirming that our calculated rotation is correct based on the given values and the interpreted formula. The slight difference is due to rounding the calculated R_cold.

The calculated rotation of 43 degrees is also within the possible range of 0 to 360 degrees.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the interpretation of the hint, you would have to rotate the cold water faucet approximately 43 degrees.

1.  **Understand the Setup:**
    *   We have a square lawn.
    *   Let the side length of the square lawn be 's' metres.
    *   The total area of the lawn is s * s = s² square metres.
    *   Mad Ade junior cuts a border 2 metres wide all the way around the edge.
    *   Little Miss Mad Ade cuts the remaining central part.
    *   Both cut exactly one-half of the total area.

2.  **Visualise the Cut:**
    *   Imagine the original square lawn with side 's'.
    *   Junior cuts a 2-metre strip from each side.
    *   After Junior cuts the border, the remaining uncut area is a smaller square in the centre.
    *   Let's find the dimensions of this inner square.
    *   The original side length was 's'.
    *   Junior removed 2 metres from one edge and 2 metres from the opposite edge along one dimension. So, the side length of the inner square is s - 2 - 2 = s - 4 metres.
    *   This applies to both dimensions, so the inner area is a square with side length (s - 4) metres.

3.  **Define Areas in Terms of 's':**
    *   Total Area = s²
    *   Little Miss's Area = Area of the inner square = (s - 4)²

4.  **Use the Information about the Areas:**
    *   The problem states that Little Miss cut exactly one-half of the total area.
    *   So, Little Miss's Area = (1/2) * Total Area.

5.  **Set up the Equation (using the hint):**
    *   We have Little Miss's Area = (s - 4)² and Total Area = s².
    *   Substitute these into the equation from step 4:
    *   (s - 4)² = (1/2) * s²

6.  **Solve the Equation for 's':**
    *   (s - 4)² = s²/2
    *   Expand the left side: s² - 2(s)(4) + 4² = s²/2
    *   s² - 8s + 16 = s²/2
    *   To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
    *   2 * (s² - 8s + 16) = 2 * (s²/2)
    *   2s² - 16s + 32 = s²
    *   Move all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:
    *   2s² - s² - 16s + 32 = 0
    *   s² - 16s + 32 = 0

7.  **Solve the Quadratic Equation:** We can use the quadratic formula to solve for 's':
    *   s = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a
    *   In our equation (s² - 16s + 32 = 0), a = 1, b = -16, and c = 32.
    *   s = [-(-16) ± √((-16)² - 4 * 1 * 32)] / (2 * 1)
    *   s = [16 ± √(256 - 128)] / 2
    *   s = [16 ± √128] / 2
    *   Simplify √128: √128 = √(64 * 2) = √64 * √2 = 8√2
    *   s = [16 ± 8√2] / 2
    *   Divide both terms in the numerator by 2:
    *   s = 8 ± 4√2

8.  **Check for Valid Solutions:** We have two possible values for the side length 's': s₁ = 8 + 4√2 and s₂ = 8 - 4√2.
    *   The side length 's' must be positive. Both 8 + 4√2 and 8 - 4√2 are positive (since 8 = √64 and 4√2 = √16 * √2 = √32, and √64 > √32).
    *   However, the side length of the *inner* square (what Little Miss cut) is (s - 4). This length must also be positive, because Little Miss cut ""the rest"", implying there was something left to cut. So, s - 4 > 0, which means s > 4.
    *   Let's check s₁ = 8 + 4√2. Since 4√2 is about 4 * 1.414 = 5.656, s₁ is about 8 + 5.656 = 13.656. This is clearly greater than 4, so s₁ is a valid side length. The inner square side would be (8 + 4√2) - 4 = 4 + 4√2 (which is positive).
    *   Let's check s₂ = 8 - 4√2. s₂ is about 8 - 5.656 = 2.344. This value is *not* greater than 4. If s = 8 - 4√2, then the side length of the inner square would be (8 - 4√2) - 4 = 4 - 4√2, which is negative (about 4 - 5.656 = -1.656). A negative side length is impossible. Therefore, s₂ is an extraneous solution.
    *   The only valid side length for the lawn is s = 8 + 4√2 metres.

9.  **Calculate the Area of the Lawn:** The question asks for the area, which is s².
    *   Area = s² = (8 + 4√2)²
    *   Expand this using the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²:
    *   Area = 8² + 2 * (8) * (4√2) + (4√2)²
    *   Area = 64 + 64√2 + (4² * (√2)²)
    *   Area = 64 + 64√2 + (16 * 2)
    *   Area = 64 + 64√2 + 32
    *   Area = 96 + 64√2

10. **Final Check:**
    *   Total Area = 96 + 64√2.
    *   Little Miss's side length = s - 4 = (8 + 4√2) - 4 = 4 + 4√2.
    *   Little Miss's Area = (4 + 4√2)² = 4² + 2(4)(4√2) + (4√2)² = 16 + 32√2 + 32 = 48 + 32√2.
    *   Is Little Miss's Area half of the Total Area? (96 + 64√2) / 2 = 48 + 32√2. Yes, it is.

The area of the lawn is 96 + 64√2 square metres.

117,"Question: What is the largest number of pieces you can form with n straight cuts of a pizza?
The pieces do not need to be of equal size.
 Hint: After j cuts, how many additional pieces can you cut with the (j+1)-th cut?","After j cuts, how many additional pieces can you cut with the (j+1)-th cut?","The answer is n*(n+1)/2 + 1.
With every cut you should cut through every previous cut. As long as you keep doing this you will always be able to do so again with your next cut. The number of additional pieces formed on cut x will always be x. The sum of all integers from 1 to n is n*(n+1)/2. So the sum of additional pieces cut will be n*(n+1)/2.
Finally add 1 because we start with 1 piece: n*(n+1)/2 + 1.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $P(n)$ be the maximum number of pieces we can form with $n$ straight cuts of a pizza.

Let's start by considering small values of $n$.
For $n=0$, there are no cuts, so there is only one piece (the whole pizza). $P(0) = 1$.
For $n=1$, one straight cut across the pizza divides it into two pieces. $P(1) = 2$.
For $n=2$, we have made one cut, resulting in 2 pieces. Now we make the second cut. To maximize the number of pieces, the second cut should intersect the first cut. If the second cut intersects the first cut, it divides each of the two existing pieces into two, resulting in a total of $2+2=4$ pieces. If the second cut is parallel to the first, we only get 3 pieces. So, the maximum is obtained when the cuts intersect. $P(2) = 4$.
For $n=3$, we have 4 pieces after 2 intersecting cuts. Now we make the third cut. To maximize the number of pieces, the third cut should intersect both previous cuts at distinct points inside the pizza. The first two cuts have divided the pizza into 4 regions. If the third cut intersects both previous cuts at two distinct points, it passes through 3 of the existing regions. Each region that the cut passes through is divided into two. Thus, the third cut adds 3 new pieces. $P(3) = P(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$.
For $n=4$, we have 7 pieces after 3 cuts that intersect pairwise at distinct points. The fourth cut should intersect all three previous cuts at distinct points inside the pizza. These three intersection points divide the fourth cut (inside the pizza) into 4 segments. Each segment passes through a different region among the 7 regions formed by the first 3 cuts. So, the fourth cut passes through 4 regions, adding 4 new pieces. $P(4) = P(3) + 4 = 7 + 4 = 11$.

We observe a pattern: $P(n) = P(n-1) + n$ for $n \ge 1$.
Let's confirm this pattern using the hint: ""After j cuts, how many additional pieces can you cut with the (j+1)-th cut?""
Let $P(j)$ be the maximum number of pieces after $j$ cuts. We are making the $(j+1)$-th cut. To maximize the number of additional pieces, this cut must intersect all $j$ previous cuts ($L_1, L_2, \dots, L_j$) at distinct points inside the pizza. This is possible assuming the pizza is large enough and the cuts are strategically chosen.
The maximum number of distinct intersection points that the $(j+1)$-th cut can have with the previous $j$ cuts is $j$. Let these intersection points be $I_1, I_2, \dots, I_j$. These $j$ points lie on the $(j+1)$-th cut and are inside the pizza.
These $j$ points divide the $(j+1)$-th cut line (the segment that lies within the pizza) into $j+1$ smaller segments.
Consider the path of the $(j+1)$-th cut through the pizza. It enters a region, crosses an intersection point, enters a new region, crosses another intersection point, and so on. Each segment of the $(j+1)$-th cut lies within a different region that was created by the previous $j$ cuts.
Since there are $j+1$ such segments, the $(j+1)$-th cut passes through $j+1$ distinct regions.
When a cut passes through a region, it splits that region into two, thus adding one new piece.
Since the $(j+1)$-th cut passes through $j+1$ regions, it adds $j+1$ new pieces.
The maximum number of pieces after $j+1$ cuts, $P(j+1)$, is the number of pieces after $j$ cuts, $P(j)$, plus the number of additional pieces created by the $(j+1)$-th cut, which is $j+1$.
So, the recurrence relation is $P(j+1) = P(j) + (j+1)$ for $j \ge 0$.
Replacing $j+1$ with $n$, we get $P(n) = P(n-1) + n$ for $n \ge 1$.

We have the base case $P(0) = 1$ and the recurrence relation $P(n) = P(n-1) + n$ for $n \ge 1$.
We can solve this recurrence by expanding it:
$P(n) = P(n-1) + n$
$P(n-1) = P(n-2) + (n-1)$
$P(n-2) = P(n-3) + (n-2)$
...
$P(1) = P(0) + 1$

Summing these equations:
$P(n) + P(n-1) + \dots + P(1) = (P(n-1) + P(n-2) + \dots + P(0)) + (n + (n-1) + \dots + 1)$
The terms $P(n-1), P(n-2), \dots, P(1)$ cancel out on both sides:
$P(n) = P(0) + (1 + 2 + \dots + n)$
The sum of the first $n$ positive integers is given by the formula $\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.
Substituting $P(0) = 1$ and the sum formula, we get:
$P(n) = 1 + \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

Let's verify this formula with the values we calculated earlier:
$P(0) = 1 + \frac{0(0+1)}{2} = 1 + 0 = 1$. Correct.
$P(1) = 1 + \frac{1(1+1)}{2} = 1 + \frac{2}{2} = 1 + 1 = 2$. Correct.
$P(2) = 1 + \frac{2(2+1)}{2} = 1 + \frac{6}{2} = 1 + 3 = 4$. Correct.
$P(3) = 1 + \frac{3(3+1)}{2} = 1 + \frac{12}{2} = 1 + 6 = 7$. Correct.
$P(4) = 1 + \frac{4(4+1)}{2} = 1 + \frac{20}{2} = 1 + 10 = 11$. Correct.

The formula correctly represents the maximum number of pieces. This formula is equivalent to $\frac{2 + n^2 + n}{2} = \frac{n^2 + n + 2}{2}$.

The final answer is $\boxed{1 + \frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$.",True,1,0,0

9, 57, 41, 89, 33, and 17.
The following are not zingers:
2, 8, 59, 13, 68, and 36.
What is a zinger?
 Hint: Think multiplication.",Think multiplication.,"A zinger in this context is a number that is multiplied by eight and increased by one. For example, 8 x 2 = 16 and 16 + 1= 17.  Therefore 17 is a zinger.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is my step-by-step reasoning to determine the definition of a ""zinger"".

1.  **Analyze the Input:** I am given two sets of numbers:
    *   Zingers: 9, 57, 41, 89, 33, 17
    *   Not zingers: 2, 8, 59, 13, 68, 36
    I am also given a hint: ""Think multiplication.""

2.  **Look for Common Properties:** I need to find a characteristic that all ""zinger"" numbers share and that none of the ""not zinger"" numbers share. The hint suggests this characteristic might involve multiplication.

3.  **Initial Hypotheses (guided by the hint):** I considered several possibilities related to multiplication:
    *   Prime factorization: Examining the prime factors of the numbers (e.g., 9=3*3, 57=3*19, 2=2, 8=2*2*2, etc.). This didn't immediately reveal a clear pattern that separated the two groups. Both groups contained prime numbers and composite numbers with various prime factors.
    *   Products of digits: Calculating the product of the digits (e.g., for 57, 5*7=35; for 68, 6*8=48). This did not show a consistent pattern.
    *   Relationship to specific numbers through multiplication (e.g., are they multiples of a certain number?). The numbers in each list didn't seem to be simple multiples of a common number.

4.  **Consider Transformations of the Numbers:** Sometimes, the property isn't of the number itself, but of a number derived from it. I thought about simple transformations like adding or subtracting a constant and then applying a multiplicative property (like being a multiple of something).

5.  **Test the ""Number Minus One"" Transformation:** Let's try subtracting 1 from each number in the lists.
    *   Zingers minus 1:
        9 - 1 = 8
        57 - 1 = 56
        41 - 1 = 40
        89 - 1 = 88
        33 - 1 = 32
        17 - 1 = 16

    *   Not zingers minus 1:
        2 - 1 = 1
        8 - 1 = 7
        59 - 1 = 58
        13 - 1 = 12
        68 - 1 = 67
        36 - 1 = 35

6.  **Look for Multiplicative Patterns in the Transformed Numbers:** Now I look at the two new lists of numbers (8, 56, 40, 88, 32, 16) and (1, 7, 58, 12, 67, 35) and see if the first list has a multiplicative property that the second list lacks.
    *   Let's examine the ""Zingers minus 1"" list: 8, 56, 40, 88, 32, 16.
        *   Is 8 a multiple of something? Yes, 8 = 8 * 1.
        *   Is 56 a multiple of the same thing? 56 / 8 = 7. Yes, 56 = 8 * 7.
        *   Is 40 a multiple of 8? 40 / 8 = 5. Yes, 40 = 8 * 5.
        *   Is 88 a multiple of 8? 88 / 8 = 11. Yes, 88 = 8 * 11.
        *   Is 32 a multiple of 8? 32 / 8 = 4. Yes, 32 = 8 * 4.
        *   Is 16 a multiple of 8? 16 / 8 = 2. Yes, 16 = 8 * 2.
    It appears that every number in the ""Zingers minus 1"" list is a multiple of 8. This fits the ""Think multiplication"" hint.

7.  **Verify the Property with the ""Not Zingers minus One"" List:** Now I check if the numbers in the ""Not Zingers minus 1"" list are *not* multiples of 8.
    *   1: Is 1 a multiple of 8? No.
    *   7: Is 7 a multiple of 8? No.
    *   58: Is 58 a multiple of 8? 58 / 8 = 7.25. No.
    *   12: Is 12 a multiple of 8? 12 / 8 = 1.5. No.
    *   67: Is 67 a multiple of 8? 67 / 8 = 8.375. No.
    *   35: Is 35 a multiple of 8? 35 / 8 = 4.375. No.
    None of the numbers in the ""Not Zingers minus 1"" list are multiples of 8.

8.  **Formulate the Definition:** Based on the successful verification, the property that distinguishes zingers is that when you subtract 1 from a zinger, the result is a multiple of 8.

9.  **State the Definition Clearly:** A number is a zinger if the number minus 1 is a multiple of 8.

The final answer is $\boxed{A\ zinger\ is\ a\ number\ N\ such\ that\ N-1\ is\ a\ multiple\ of\ 8}$.",True,1,0,0

One less complex method is to imagine the axis of the cone form a right triangle. This triangle shares the dimensions of the cone, so it is 12 by 5. We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.
Next we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x. If we add 10x on both sides, we get 22x=60, and dividing 22 from both sides yields x=60/22=30/11.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, I understand the situation. Let's solve this problem step by step to avoid any fiery consequences.

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a right cone and a right cylinder.
Cone: Height H = 12 units, Radius R = 5 units.
Cylinder: Height h, Radius r.
The cylinder is inscribed in the cone with its base on the cone's base and its top circumference touching the cone's slanted surface.
Their axes coincide.
The diameter of the cylinder is equal to its height, so 2r = h.
We need to find the radius of the cylinder, r.

**Using the Hint: Imagine a Triangle Inside Another**

Hint #2 suggests looking at triangles inside one another. This points towards using similar triangles, which is a common technique when dealing with cones and inscribed shapes by considering a cross-section.

Let's take a vertical cross-section of the cone and cylinder that passes through their common axis.
The cross-section of the cone is an isosceles triangle. Its base is the diameter of the cone (2 * R = 10) and its height is H = 12.
The cross-section of the cylinder is a rectangle. Its base is the diameter of the cylinder (2 * r) and its height is h.

According to Hint #1, the cylinder's base is on the cone's base. So, the bottom edge of the rectangle lies on the base of the large triangle. Since the axes coincide, the rectangle is centered horizontally within the triangle.
The top circumference of the cylinder touches the cone. In the cross-section, this means the top corners of the rectangle lie on the slanted sides of the large triangle.

Let's consider the right half of this cross-section. This gives us a right-angled triangle formed by the cone's axis, its radius, and its slanted height.
The vertices of this large right triangle can be represented by coordinates: (0,0), (R,0), and (0,H). Let's use the given values: (0,0), (5,0), and (0,12). The point (0,0) is the center of the base, (5,0) is a point on the edge of the base, and (0,12) is the apex of the cone.

The right half of the cylinder's cross-section is a rectangle with vertices (0,0), (r,0), (r,h), and (0,h).
The point (r, h) is the top-right corner of this rectangle and lies on the slanted side (hypotenuse) of the large right triangle.

Now, let's identify the ""triangle inside another"". Consider the small right-angled triangle formed *above* the cylinder's top face, sharing the apex of the cone.
The vertices of this smaller triangle are:
1. The cone's apex: (0,12)
2. The top-right corner of the cylinder's cross-section: (r, h)
3. The point on the axis at the height of the cylinder's top face: (0, h)

This smaller right triangle has:
- Base length = the horizontal distance from the axis (x=0) to the point (r,h), which is r.
- Height = the vertical distance from the cone's apex (y=12) down to the cylinder's top face (y=h), which is 12 - h.

The large right triangle (with base R=5 and height H=12) and the smaller right triangle (with base r and height 12-h) are similar triangles. They share the angle at the cone's apex (0,12) and both have a right angle.

**Setting up the Similarity Equation**

Since the two triangles are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal.
(Base of smaller triangle) / (Height of smaller triangle) = (Base of large triangle) / (Height of large triangle)
r / (12 - h) = R / H
r / (12 - h) = 5 / 12

**Using the Cylinder's Condition**

We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to its height.
Diameter = 2r
Height = h
So, 2r = h.

**Solving for the Radius**

Now we have a system of equations:
1) r / (12 - h) = 5 / 12
2) h = 2r

Substitute equation (2) into equation (1):
r / (12 - 2r) = 5 / 12

Now, solve for r by cross-multiplying:
12 * r = 5 * (12 - 2r)
12r = 5 * 12 - 5 * 2r
12r = 60 - 10r

Add 10r to both sides of the equation:
12r + 10r = 60
22r = 60

Divide by 22 to find r:
r = 60 / 22

Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
r = 30 / 11

The radius of the cylinder is 30/11 units.

**Final Answer Check**

The radius r = 30/11.
The height h = 2r = 2 * (30/11) = 60/11.
The height of the cone is 12. 60/11 is approximately 5.45, which is less than 12, so the cylinder fits vertically.
The radius of the cone is 5. 30/11 is approximately 2.73, which is less than 5, so the cylinder fits horizontally within the cone's base.
The solution makes sense geometrically.

The steps followed the hint by using similar triangles derived from the cross-section and incorporated all the given conditions.

 Hint: The first digit of this number must be 2",The first digit of this number must be 2,23076: 923076 / 230769 = 4.,GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let the five-digit number be $N$. A five-digit number can be represented as $abcde$, where $a, b, c, d, e$ are digits and $a \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\}$ while $b, c, d, e \in \{0, 1, \ldots, 9\}$. The value of the number is $N = 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e$.

When we place a 9 at the beginning of $N$, we form a new number. Let's call this new number $N_1$. The digits of $N_1$ are $9, a, b, c, d, e$. This is a six-digit number.
The value of $N_1$ is $9 \times 100000 + 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e$.
We can write $N_1 = 900000 + (10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e) = 900000 + N$.

When we place a 9 at the end of $N$, we form another new number. Let's call this new number $N_2$. The digits of $N_2$ are $a, b, c, d, e, 9$. This is also a six-digit number.
The value of $N_2$ is $10 \times (10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e) + 9$.
We can write $N_2 = 10N + 9$.

The problem states that $N_1$ is four times larger than $N_2$. We can write this as an equation:
$N_1 = 4 \times N_2$.

Substitute the expressions for $N_1$ and $N_2$ in terms of $N$ into the equation:
$900000 + N = 4 \times (10N + 9)$.

Now, we solve this linear equation for $N$:
$900000 + N = 40N + 36$.

Subtract $N$ from both sides of the equation:
$900000 = 40N - N + 36$.
$900000 = 39N + 36$.

Subtract 36 from both sides of the equation:
$900000 - 36 = 39N$.
$899964 = 39N$.

Now, we need to find $N$ by dividing 899964 by 39:
$N = \frac{899964}{39}$.

Let's perform the division:
Divide 89 by 39: $89 \div 39 = 2$ with a remainder of $89 - (2 \times 39) = 89 - 78 = 11$.
Bring down the next digit (9) to get 119.
Divide 119 by 39: $119 \div 39 = 3$ with a remainder of $119 - (3 \times 39) = 119 - 117 = 2$.
Bring down the next digit (9) to get 29.
Divide 29 by 39: $29 \div 39 = 0$ with a remainder of $29 - (0 \times 39) = 29$.
Bring down the next digit (6) to get 296.
Divide 296 by 39: $296 \div 39 = 7$ with a remainder of $296 - (7 \times 39) = 296 - 273 = 23$.
Bring down the last digit (4) to get 234.
Divide 234 by 39: $234 \div 39 = 6$ with a remainder of $234 - (6 \times 39) = 234 - 234 = 0$.

So, $N = 23076$.

The number $N$ is 23076. This is a five-digit number.
The first digit of this number is 2. This matches the hint provided (""The first digit of this number must be 2"").

Let's verify if this number satisfies the original condition:
The five-digit number is $N = 23076$.
Placing 9 at the beginning gives $N_1 = 923076$.
Placing 9 at the end gives $N_2 = 230769$.

We need to check if $N_1 = 4 \times N_2$:
$923076 = 4 \times 230769$.
Let's calculate $4 \times 230769$:
$4 \times 230769 = 4 \times (200000 + 30000 + 700 + 60 + 9)$
$= 800000 + 120000 + 2800 + 240 + 36$
$= 920000 + 2800 + 240 + 36$
$= 922800 + 240 + 36$
$= 923040 + 36$
$= 923076$.

The calculation confirms that $923076 = 4 \times 230769$.
The condition is satisfied.
The five-digit number is 23076.

Answer: root 200 or approximately 14km!
(If you got the distance as 15.7km - the distance you would have to walk back, then that's ok too!)",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step using spherical geometry and the hint.

1.  **Understand the Setup:**
    *   You are on a sphere with radius R = 10 km.
    *   You start at point A (the ship).
    *   You walk straight for a distance s₁ = 17.345 km to point B. ""Walking straight"" on a sphere means following a great circle path.
    *   At point B, you turn left 90 degrees and walk straight for a distance s₂ = 47.124 km to point C. Turning 90 degrees left between two great circle paths means the angle between the tangent vectors of the two paths at point B is 90 degrees (π/2 radians).
    *   We need to find the shortest distance from your final position (C) back to the ship (A) along the surface of the sphere. This distance is the length of the great circle arc AC.

2.  **Convert Distances to Angles:**
    Distances along a great circle on a sphere can be represented by the angle subtended by the arc at the center of the sphere. The relationship is arc length *s* = Radius * angle θ (where θ is in radians). So, θ = s / R.

    *   The first walk (A to B) corresponds to an angle θ₁ = s₁ / R = 17.345 km / 10 km = 1.7345 radians. Let this angle be associated with side *c* of a spherical triangle ABC.
    *   The second walk (B to C) corresponds to an angle θ₂ = s₂ / R = 47.124 km / 10 km = 4.7124 radians. Let this angle be associated with side *a* of a spherical triangle ABC.

3.  **Interpret the Hint:** ""Try to relate these decimals with the circumference--remember the planet is spherical, not circular"".
    *   The circumference of the planet is C = 2 * π * R = 2 * π * 10 km = 20π km.
    *   Let's look at the calculated angles:
        *   θ₁ = 1.7345 radians.
        *   θ₂ = 4.7124 radians.

    *   Let's examine θ₂ (4.7124) in relation to simple fractions of 2π (a full circle in radians) or just π.
        *   π ≈ 3.14159
        *   π/2 ≈ 1.5708
        *   3π/2 ≈ 4.712385
        *   Comparing θ₂ = 4.7124 with 3π/2 ≈ 4.712385, we see they are extremely close. This strongly suggests that the intended value for the second walk's angle is exactly 3π/2 radians. This corresponds to a distance of R * (3π/2) = 10 km * (3π/2) = 15π km. Let's check if 15π is close to 47.124: 15 * 3.14159265 ≈ 47.12389 km. This is a very good match. So, we assume the second walk is exactly 15π km, corresponding to an angle of θ₂ = 3π/2 radians.

    *   Now look at θ₁ = 1.7345 radians. Is this a simple multiple of π?
        *   π/2 ≈ 1.5708
        *   2π/3 ≈ 2.0944
        *   1.7345 / π ≈ 0.552
        *   1.7345 / (π/2) ≈ 1.104
        *   While 1.7345 is close to √3 ≈ 1.732, there is no obvious simple fraction of π here based on the number itself.

4.  **Formulate the Spherical Triangle:**
    We have a spherical triangle ABC on the surface of the sphere:
    *   Vertex A: Starting point (ship).
    *   Vertex B: Turning point.
    *   Vertex C: Ending point.

    *   Side *c* is the great circle arc AB. Its angular length is θ₁ = 1.7345 radians (or the exact intended value it approximates).
    *   Side *a* is the great circle arc BC. Its angular length is θ₂ = 3π/2 radians (based on the hint and approximation).
    *   The angle at vertex B is the angle between the great circle AB and the great circle BC. This is given as a 90-degree left turn, so the angle β at B is 90 degrees = π/2 radians.

    *   We want to find the length of the great circle arc AC, which is side *b* of the spherical triangle. Let the angular length of AC be θ₃.

5.  **Apply the Spherical Law of Cosines:**
    For a spherical triangle with sides *a*, *b*, *c* (given as angles subtended at the center) and angles α, β, γ opposite to sides *a*, *b*, *c* respectively, the Law of Cosines for sides states:
    cos(*b*) = cos(*a*) cos(*c*) + sin(*a*) sin(*c*) cos(β)

    In our case, using the angles we found:
    cos(θ₃) = cos(θ₂) cos(θ₁) + sin(θ₂) sin(θ₁) cos(π/2)

    Substitute the known values for θ₂ and β:
    θ₂ = 3π/2 radians
    β = π/2 radians

    We know the trigonometric values for these simple angles:
    cos(3π/2) = 0
    sin(3π/2) = -1
    cos(π/2) = 0

    Substitute these into the equation:
    cos(θ₃) = cos(3π/2) cos(θ₁) + sin(3π/2) sin(θ₁) cos(π/2)
    cos(θ₃) = (0) * cos(θ₁) + (-1) * sin(θ₁) * (0)
    cos(θ₃) = 0 + 0
    cos(θ₃) = 0

6.  **Solve for the Final Angle:**
    If cos(θ₃) = 0, then θ₃ must be an angle whose cosine is 0. Since θ₃ represents a distance on the sphere, it must be a non-negative angle, and the shortest distance corresponds to an angle typically between 0 and π radians. The angle in this range whose cosine is 0 is π/2 radians.

    So, the angular distance from the ship to your final position is θ₃ = π/2 radians.

    Notice that the value of θ₁ (the length of the first walk) did not affect the final calculated angle θ₃ because the term involving cos(θ₁) was multiplied by cos(3π/2) which is 0, and the term involving sin(θ₁) was multiplied by cos(π/2) which is also 0. This means that *any* first walk length, followed by a 90-degree turn and a walk of 3/4 the circumference, would result in being 1/4 circumference away from the start.

7.  **Convert Angle Back to Distance:**
    The distance from the ship is the arc length corresponding to the angle θ₃ = π/2 radians.
    Distance = R * θ₃
    Distance = 10 km * (π/2 radians)
    Distance = 5π km

8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**
    Using the value of π ≈ 3.14159265:
    Distance ≈ 5 * 3.14159265 km
    Distance ≈ 15.70796325 km

The exact distance is 5π km.

Final check of the steps:
*   Understood the problem context (sphere).
*   Converted distances to angles.
*   Used the hint to identify exact, simple angular values (3π/2 radians and π/2 radians for the angle between paths).
*   Set up the spherical triangle.
*   Applied the correct spherical trigonometry formula (Law of Cosines for sides).
*   Calculated the resulting angular distance.
*   Converted the angular distance back to a linear distance.
*   The logic is consistent with the properties of spherical geometry.

The final answer is the calculated distance.

 Hint: The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.",The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.,"It's easy to see that the number of letters he had delivered is the square of the number of days he had worked.
Square numbers can't end in 7 or 8, and 123456 is not a square because it is divisible by 3 but not by 9. Hence the number of letters must end with 9.
Since odd squares have remainder 1 upon division by 8, the number formed by its fourth and fifth digits must be divisible by 4, which can be 48, 56 or 68.
Numbers that have remainder 2 upon division by 3, and those that are divisible by 3 but not by 9 are not squares. By trial and error, we know that the only square number satisfying these conditions is 134689=367^2.
Hence, he had worked for 367 days, and had delivered 134689 letters.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

Oddly enough, an equal number of pedestrians walk in each direction at four kilometres per hour. The four cab drivers were discussing the best way to pick up a fare. Bill said he was going to sit beside the curb and wait until a fare came along. Bob said he was going to cruise west at four kilometres an hour; therefore, he would have twice the chance of picking up a fare as Bill. Frank said he was going to cruise east at eight kilometres an hour and his chances were twice as good as either Bill's or Bob's. Jim claimed that they were all wrong.

137,"Question: Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.  Henry's plan calls for the tracks (each of which is one mile in length) to be laid end-to-end with no gap between them, pinned to the ground at every other juncture, as shown below:
v_______ _______vv_______ _______v
Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""

Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?
 Hint: Would Pythagoras have the same plan?",Would Pythagoras have the same plan?,"The rise in the middle of the tracks would have been much greater than Henry surmised.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse). SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the reasoning process to solve the problem:

1.  **Understand the Setup:** The problem describes railroad tracks, each one mile long, laid end-to-end. They expand by one inch per mile in temperature extremes. They are pinned to the ground at ""every other juncture"". This pinning pattern is shown as `v_______ _______vv_______ _______v`. This implies that a section of track between two pinned points consists of two one-mile rails laid end-to-end. Let J0, J1, J2, J3, ... be the junctures. If J0 is pinned (v), J1 is not (_), J2 is pinned (v), J3 is not (_), J4 is pinned (v), and so on. The segment of track between two pinned junctures, say J0 and J2, is 2 miles long (Rail 1 from J0 to J1, and Rail 2 from J1 to J2).

2.  **Calculate the Expansion:** The track expands by one inch per mile. The section of track between two pinned points (e.g., J0 and J2) is 2 miles long. Therefore, the total expansion over this 2-mile section is 2 miles * 1 inch/mile = 2 inches.

3.  **Identify the Constraint:** The track section between the two pinned points (J0 and J2) is fixed horizontally at these points. The original horizontal distance between J0 and J2 is 2 miles. When the track expands, its total length becomes 2 miles + 2 inches. Since the ends (J0 and J2) are fixed, the track must accommodate this extra length by buckling, most likely upwards or sideways. We will model the upward buckling.

4.  **Model the Buckling:** A standard way to model the buckling of a constrained beam is to assume it forms a simple symmetric shape, such as a triangle. Let the original position of the 2-mile track section be a straight line on the ground. When it expands and buckles upwards, the highest point will be at the original midpoint (juncture J1). This forms an isosceles triangle where the base is the original 2-mile distance between the pinned points, and the two equal sides are the expanded track segments (the two rails).
    *   Original length of the section (horizontal distance between J0 and J2): L = 2 miles.
    *   Expanded length of the section (length along the buckled track): L' = 2 miles + 2 inches.

5.  **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem (Hint):** The hint suggests using the Pythagorean theorem. Consider the triangle formed by J0, the midpoint of the J0-J2 segment on the ground (which is the original position of J1), and the buckled apex J1'. Let h be the height of the buckle at J1'. The horizontal distance from J0 to the midpoint is half the base, which is 1 mile. The length of the buckled track segment from J0 to J1' is the expanded length of the first rail, which is 1 mile + 1 inch. This forms a right triangle with legs of length 1 mile and h, and a hypotenuse of length 1 mile + 1 inch.
    *   Base of the right triangle = 1 mile
    *   Height of the right triangle = h
    *   Hypotenuse of the right triangle = 1 mile + 1 inch

6.  **Calculate the Buckle Height (h):** Let's convert lengths to a consistent unit, inches.
    *   1 mile = 5280 feet = 5280 * 12 inches = 63360 inches.
    *   Base = 1 mile = 63360 inches.
    *   Hypotenuse = 1 mile + 1 inch = 63360 + 1 = 63361 inches.
    Applying the Pythagorean theorem: (Base)^2 + (Height)^2 = (Hypotenuse)^2
    63360^2 + h^2 = 63361^2
    Now, solve for h^2:
    h^2 = 63361^2 - 63360^2
    This is a difference of squares, a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b).
    h^2 = (63361 - 63360) * (63361 + 63360)
    h^2 = (1) * (126721)
    h^2 = 126721

    Now, find h by taking the square root of h^2:
    h = sqrt(126721)
    Calculating the square root of 126721 gives exactly 356.007... Let's calculate 356^2 and 357^2 to verify.
    356^2 = 126736
    357^2 = 127449
    The exact value is sqrt(126721), which is approximately 356 inches. Let's use the approximate value 356 inches for clarity.

7.  **Convert Height to Understandable Units:** A height of 356 inches is difficult to visualize directly. Let's convert it to feet.
    1 foot = 12 inches
    h = 356 inches / 12 inches/foot
    h approx 29.67 feet.
    This is approximately 29 feet and 8 inches (since 0.67 feet * 12 inches/foot approx 8 inches).

8.  **Compare Calculated Height to Henry's Estimate:** Henry estimated the buckle would be ""an inch or two at most"". Our calculation shows the buckle height would be approximately 356 inches (nearly 30 feet).

9.  **Explain Why the Boss Was Critical:** The calculated buckle height of nearly 30 feet is vastly different from Henry's estimate of one or two inches. A 30-foot buckle in a railway line is not a small bump that a train can easily pass over; it is a catastrophic failure that would inevitably derail any train attempting to use the track. The boss fired Henry because his plan was fundamentally flawed, based on a gross misunderstanding of the physics of thermal expansion and constraints. Henry's failure to perform a simple calculation (like the one using the Pythagorean theorem hinted at) to determine the actual magnitude of the buckling demonstrates a critical lack of engineering competence and judgment, leading to an incredibly dangerous design. The boss's reaction (""You're fired"") was a direct consequence of realizing Henry's plan would lead to a disaster.

The final answer is $\boxed{Henry's plan would result in the tracks buckling upwards by nearly 30 feet, not an inch or two, creating a catastrophic and impassable obstacle for trains. His severe underestimation of the buckling magnitude due to thermal expansion, revealed by a simple application of the Pythagorean theorem, demonstrated a fundamental lack of engineering competence.}",True,1,0,0

Clue 2: Kevin counted a total of 122 in the morning and noon counts, just one higher than his evening count, but 24 more than Smith's Evening count.
This clue provides three separate pieces of information:
Equation (2a): K_m + K_n = 122
Equation (2b): K_m + K_n = K_e + 1
Equation (2c): K_m + K_n = S_e + 24

Clue 3: Kevin's morning count is the same as Smith's average. Smith's average is the average of his three counts.
Smith's Average = (S_m + S_n + S_e) / 3
Equation (3): K_m = (S_m + S_n + S_e) / 3

Clue 4: Kevin's evening count was 37 more than Smith's morning count.
Equation (4): K_e = S_m + 37

We have the following system of equations:
(1) S_n = S_m - 32
(2a) K_m + K_n = 122
(2b) K_m + K_n = K_e + 1
(2c) K_m + K_n = S_e + 24
(3) K_m = (S_m + S_n + S_e) / 3
(4) K_e = S_m + 37

The hint suggests starting with Clue 2. From Equation (2a), we know K_m + K_n = 122.
We can substitute this value into Equations (2b) and (2c):
From (2b): 122 = K_e + 1
Solving for K_e: K_e = 122 - 1 = 121.
We now know Kevin's evening count: K_e = 121.

From (2c): 122 = S_e + 24
Solving for S_e: S_e = 122 - 24 = 98.
We now know Smith's evening count: S_e = 98.

Now we use other clues to find the remaining variables. We know K_e = 121. Let's use Clue 4 (Equation 4):
K_e = S_m + 37
Substitute K_e = 121: 121 = S_m + 37
Solving for S_m: S_m = 121 - 37 = 84.
We now know Smith's morning count: S_m = 84.

Now we know S_m = 84. Let's use Clue 1 (Equation 1):
S_n = S_m - 32
Substitute S_m = 84: S_n = 84 - 32 = 52.
We now know Smith's noon count: S_n = 52.

We have found all of Smith's counts: S_m = 84, S_n = 52, S_e = 98.
Let's use Clue 3 (Equation 3) to find Kevin's morning count, K_m:
K_m = (S_m + S_n + S_e) / 3
Substitute the values for S_m, S_n, S_e: K_m = (84 + 52 + 98) / 3
K_m = (136 + 98) / 3
K_m = 234 / 3
K_m = 78.
We now know Kevin's morning count: K_m = 78.

Finally, we need to find Kevin's noon count, K_n. We can use Equation (2a):
K_m + K_n = 122
Substitute K_m = 78: 78 + K_n = 122
Solving for K_n: K_n = 122 - 78 = 44.
We now know Kevin's noon count: K_n = 44.

We have found all six counts:
K_m = 78
K_n = 44
K_e = 121
S_m = 84
S_n = 52
S_e = 98

Let's quickly verify these values against all the clues:
1. S_n = S_m - 32 => 52 = 84 - 32 (True: 52 = 52)
2. K_m + K_n = 122 => 78 + 44 = 122 (True: 122 = 122)
   K_m + K_n = K_e + 1 => 122 = 121 + 1 (True: 122 = 122)
   K_m + K_n = S_e + 24 => 122 = 98 + 24 (True: 122 = 122)
3. K_m = (S_m + S_n + S_e) / 3 => 78 = (84 + 52 + 98) / 3 => 78 = 234 / 3 (True: 78 = 78)
4. K_e = S_m + 37 => 121 = 84 + 37 (True: 121 = 121)
All clues are satisfied by these values.

The question asks for the days average, which is the average of all 6 counts.
Total count = K_m + K_n + K_e + S_m + S_n + S_e
Total count = 78 + 44 + 121 + 84 + 52 + 98
Total count = (78 + 44) + 121 + (84 + 52) + 98
Total count = 122 + 121 + 136 + 98
Total count = 243 + 136 + 98
Total count = 379 + 98
Total count = 477

Daily Average = Total count / 6
Daily Average = 477 / 6
Daily Average = 79.5

The days average is 79.5.

Mouse(C) bites off one rope in 180 minutes.
You do not have any time or distance measuring tools and the length of the rope is unknown.  How can you measure 75 minutes?
 Hint: Set distance and time relations and equations",Set distance and time relations and equations,"Mark the two ropes as Rope(A) and Rope(B).
1. Let Mouse(A) and Mouse(C) start biting off Rope(A) at the same time, starting each from  one end (moving in opposite directions).  At the same time, let Mouse(B) start biting off Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(A) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X = S(A) * 60, where S(A) is biting speed for Mouse(A) and X is Rope(A) length
X = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X is Rope(A) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(A)/S(C) = 3:1, which means that for each 3 units Mouse(A) will move, Mouse (C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(A) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(A) bites off three times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides Rope(A) length in to 4 units.
Mouse(A) bitten off portion = 3/4 X (where X is Rope(A) length)
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/4 X
Finding the time spent before Rope(A) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(A) needs  60 minutes to bite off X, How many minutes are needed to bite off 3/4 X?
Minutes needed = 3/4 * 60 = 45 minutes are needed to fully bite off Rope(A) by Mouse(A) and Mouse(C).  At that point in time, Mouse(B) would have bitten off exactly half the length of Rope(B) (needing 90 minutes to bite off the full rope), and needs an additional 45 minutes to bite off the remaining rope half.
2. Let Mouse(B) continue biting off Rope(B) and make Mouse(C) start biting off the other end of Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(B) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X/2 = S(B) * 90, where S(B) is biting speed for Mouse(B) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
X/2 = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(B)/S(C) = 2:1, which means that for each 2 units Mouse(B) will move, Mouse(C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(B) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(B) bites off two times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides the remaining half of Rope(B) length to 3 units.
Mouse(B) bitten off portion = 2/3 * X/2 = X/3
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/3 * X/2 = X/6
Finding the time spent before the remaining half of Rope(B) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(B) needs  90 minutes to bite off X, how many minutes are needed to bite off X/3?
Minutes needed = 1/3 * 90 = 30 minutes are needed to fully bite off the remaining half of Rope(B) by Mouse(B) and Mouse(C).

142,"Question: Rob the robot went to the candy-store to buy some candies. He found his favorite gums in front of him, in packages of 225 gums in each.
Though extremely intelligent, he is still a robot, thus capable of using only 1's and 0's.
What is the minimum number of gums that Rob ate that day if he finished all of his packages, and the number of gums contained nothing but 1's and 0's?
Oh yes, and you can't cheat and use binary notation.  The answer is in base 10, but still only uses 1's and 0's.
 Hint: Think of the factors of 225, and kids, don't try this at home (or you would suffer from a severe stomach ache).","Think of the factors of 225, and kids, don't try this at home (or you would suffer from a severe stomach ache).","11,111,111,100
This contains nine ones, so it is divisible by 9, and two 0's at the end, so it is divisible by 25.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let N be the total number of gums Rob ate.
According to the problem, N must satisfy two conditions:
1. N is a multiple of 225. This means N = 225 * k for some positive integer k, since Rob finished all his packages.
2. The decimal representation of N consists only of the digits 0 and 1.

We need to find the minimum positive integer N that satisfies these conditions.

Let's analyze the first condition: N is a multiple of 225.
The prime factorization of 225 is 3 * 75 = 3 * 3 * 25 = 3^2 * 5^2 = 9 * 25.
So, N must be divisible by both 9 and 25.

Now let's use the divisibility rules for 9 and 25, combined with the condition that N only contains digits 0 and 1.

Divisibility by 25: A number is divisible by 25 if and only if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 25. The multiples of 25 are 00, 25, 50, 75, 100, etc.
Since the digits of N can only be 0 or 1, the number formed by the last two digits of N must be composed of only 0s and 1s. The only multiple of 25 that can be formed using only digits 0 and 1 for the last two digits is 00.
Therefore, N must end in 00. This implies N is a multiple of 100.

Divisibility by 9: A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
Since the digits of N can only be 0 or 1, the sum of the digits of N is simply the number of 1's in its decimal representation.
Let c be the number of 1's in N. Then, c must be a multiple of 9. Since N is a positive number, it must have at least one non-zero digit (which must be 1), so N > 0. Thus, the number of 1's, c, must be a positive multiple of 9. The smallest positive multiple of 9 is 9.
So, the number of 1's in N must be at least 9. The minimum possible number of 1's is 9.

Combining these conditions:
N must consist only of digits 0 and 1.
N must end in 00.
N must contain a number of 1's that is a multiple of 9. To find the minimum N, we should aim for the minimum number of 1's, which is 9.

So, we are looking for the smallest number N such that:
1. N consists only of digits 0 and 1.
2. N ends in 00.
3. N contains exactly nine 1's.

Let N be written as a sequence of digits d_m d_{m-1} ... d_2 d_1 d_0.
We know d_1 = 0 and d_0 = 0.
The digits d_m ... d_2 must consist of only 0s and 1s, and exactly nine of these digits must be 1. The remaining digits among d_m ... d_2 must be 0s.

To minimize the number N, we need to minimize the number of digits (m+1) first, and then place the digits (1s and 0s) in the lowest possible value positions (closer to the right) while keeping the number as small as possible (placing 1s further right).

The digits d_m ... d_2 must contain exactly nine 1's. Let the number of digits in this part be m-1. The total number of digits in N is m+1.
The nine 1's must be located among the digits d_m, d_{m-1}, ..., d_2. The digits d_1 and d_0 are fixed as 0.
The minimum number of digits required before the final 00 is the number of 1's we need to place, which is 9. So, the sequence d_m ... d_2 must contain at least 9 digits (if all are 1s) or more (if there are 0s as well).
The minimum length for the sequence d_m ... d_2 to contain nine 1's is 9. This happens when d_m ... d_2 consists of nine 1's.
In this case, m-1 = 9, so m = 10.
The digits d_10, d_9, ..., d_2 must be nine 1's. To form the smallest number N, the leading digit d_m must be 1 (unless N is 0, but N must be positive). So d_m = d_10 = 1.
The remaining eight 1's must be placed in the remaining 8 positions from d_9 down to d_2.
To make the number smallest, we should place the 1's in the lowest value positions possible, i.e., fill the positions d_2, d_3, ..., d_9 with 1s.
So, d_9=1, d_8=1, d_7=1, d_6=1, d_5=1, d_4=1, d_3=1, d_2=1.
The digit d_10 must be 1 as it is the leading digit of an (m+1)-digit number where m+1=11.
So, d_10=1, d_9=1, d_8=1, d_7=1, d_6=1, d_5=1, d_4=1, d_3=1, d_2=1, d_1=0, d_0=0.
This gives the number N = 11111111100.

Let's check this number N = 11,111,111,100:
1. It consists only of digits 0 and 1. Yes.
2. It ends in 00. Yes. This means it is divisible by 100, and thus by 25.
3. The sum of its digits is 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 9. Yes, the sum of digits is 9, which is a multiple of 9. Thus, the number is divisible by 9.
Since N is divisible by both 25 and 9, and gcd(25, 9) = 1, N is divisible by 25 * 9 = 225. Yes.

Is this the minimum such number?
We established that N must end in 00 and have at least nine 1's.
The structure of N is M00, where M is a number whose digits are only 0 or 1, and the sum of digits of M is a multiple of 9. The smallest positive multiple of 9 is 9. So the sum of digits of M must be at least 9. To minimize N (and thus M), we assume the sum of digits of M is exactly 9.
So M must contain exactly nine 1's and only 0's.
To minimize M, we want the fewest number of digits possible for M. A number with nine 1's has at least 9 digits (if it contains no 0s).
The smallest number M consisting of only 0s and 1s with a sum of digits equal to 9 is the number formed by nine 1's placed in the lowest possible positions to form the smallest number. This is the 9-digit number 111111111.
Any other number M with nine 1's and only 0s must either have 9 digits with some 0s (e.g., 1011111111 - sum of digits 9, 10 digits, > 111111111) or more than 9 digits (e.g., 1111111110 - sum of digits 9, 10 digits, > 111111111; or 10000000000 - sum of digits 1, not 9; or 10000000111111111 - sum of digits 9, 18 digits, > 111111111).
So the smallest M consisting of only 0s and 1s with sum of digits 9 is indeed 111111111.
Therefore, the minimum N = M * 100 = 111111111 * 100 = 11111111100.

Final verification:
N = 11111111100.
Digits are 0 or 1. Yes.
Ends in 00, so divisible by 25.
Sum of digits = 9, so divisible by 9.
Divisible by 9 and 25, so divisible by 225.
This is the smallest such number constructed by having the minimum number of 1s (nine) and arranging them to form the smallest possible number ending in 00.

 Hint: The number of trailing zeros is equivalent to the number of factors of 10",The number of trailing zeros is equivalent to the number of factors of 10,"The ! stands for factorial.  So, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!
The only way to get a trailing zero is by multiplying a factor of 1000! which is 2 by a factor of 1000! which is 5. The modified problem is thus: How many such pairs of factors are there?
There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5. But in addition there are 40 = 1000/25 numbers which are multiples of 25, each of which gives one factor of five in addition to the one counted in the 200 and the one counted in the 40 above. Finally there is 1 = [1000/625] number which is a multiple of 625, this gives one further factor of 5. Thus there are exactly  200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249 factors of 5 in 1000! and since there are more than sufficient factors of 2, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:

1.  **Understanding Trailing Zeros:** The hint states that the number of trailing zeros in a number is equivalent to the number of factors of 10 in its prime factorization.

2.  **Prime Factorization of 10:** The number 10 can be factored into its prime components as $10 = 2 \times 5$.

3.  **Factors of 10 in a Factorial:** To form a factor of 10, we need one factor of 2 and one factor of 5. In the number 1000! (which is the product of all integers from 1 to 1000: $1 \times 2 \times 3 \times \dots \times 1000$), the prime factors are contributed by the prime factorization of each number in the product.

4.  **Comparing Factors of 2 and 5:** We need to determine how many pairs of 2 and 5 we can form from the prime factorization of 1000!. The number of factors of 2 in 1000! will be the sum of the powers of 2 in the prime factorization of each number from 1 to 1000. Similarly, the number of factors of 5 will be the sum of the powers of 5. Since factors of 2 (like 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...) occur more frequently than factors of 5 (like 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...) in the sequence of integers, the number of factors of 5 will always be less than or equal to the number of factors of 2 in any factorial N!.

5.  **Limiting Factor:** The number of factors of 10 that can be formed is limited by the prime factor that appears less frequently. In the case of factorials, this is always the prime factor 5. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in 1000! is equal to the total number of times the prime factor 5 appears in the prime factorization of 1000!.

6.  **Calculating the Number of Factors of 5:** To find the number of factors of 5 in 1000!, we need to count how many multiples of 5, 25, 125, 625, etc., are there between 1 and 1000.
    *   Numbers that are multiples of 5 contribute at least one factor of 5. The number of multiples of 5 up to 1000 is $\lfloor \frac{1000}{5} \rfloor$.
    *   Numbers that are multiples of 25 ($5^2$) contribute an additional factor of 5 (since one factor of 5 was already counted in the step above). The number of multiples of 25 up to 1000 is $\lfloor \frac{1000}{25} \rfloor$.
    *   Numbers that are multiples of 125 ($5^3$) contribute yet another additional factor of 5. The number of multiples of 125 up to 1000 is $\lfloor \frac{1000}{125} \rfloor$.
    *   Numbers that are multiples of 625 ($5^4$) contribute one more factor of 5. The number of multiples of 625 up to 1000 is $\lfloor \frac{1000}{625} \rfloor$.
    *   Higher powers of 5 ($5^5 = 3125$, etc.) are greater than 1000, so there are no multiples of these powers within the range 1 to 1000.

7.  **Applying the Calculation:**
    *   Number of multiples of 5: $\lfloor \frac{1000}{5} \rfloor = \lfloor 200 \rfloor = 200$
    *   Number of multiples of 25: $\lfloor \frac{1000}{25} \rfloor = \lfloor 40 \rfloor = 40$
    *   Number of multiples of 125: $\lfloor \frac{1000}{125} \rfloor = \lfloor 8 \rfloor = 8$
    *   Number of multiples of 625: $\lfloor \frac{1000}{625} \rfloor = \lfloor 1.6 \rfloor = 1$
    *   Number of multiples of 3125: $\lfloor \frac{1000}{3125} \rfloor = \lfloor 0.32 \rfloor = 0$

8.  **Summing the Factors:** The total number of factors of 5 in 1000! is the sum of the results from the previous step: $200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249$.

9.  **Conclusion:** Since the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of factors of 5, there are 249 trailing zeros in the number 1000!.

The final answer is $\boxed{249}$.",True,1,0,0

1.  **Understanding the Rules:**
    *   The competition is a cycle race over 14 stages.
    *   There are 100 competitors.
    *   Overall ranking is determined by the *accumulated time* over all 14 stages. The competitor with the lowest total time is the champion, the one with the second lowest is the runner-up, and so on.
    *   Stage ranking is determined by the time taken in *that specific stage*. A lower time means a better position (lower rank number) in that stage.
    *   No competitors withdrew, meaning all 100 competitors completed all 14 stages.

2.  **Analyzing Charles's Performance:**
    *   Charles finished in 93rd position in *every single one* of the 14 stages.
    *   In each stage, this means 92 competitors finished ahead of him (took less time than him), and 7 competitors finished behind him (took more time than him). (92 + 1 + 7 = 100 competitors).

3.  **The Apparent Contradiction:**
    *   How can someone who consistently finishes 93rd out of 100 competitors in every stage end up 2nd overall in the entire competition?
    *   Finishing 93rd suggests a relatively slow performance in each stage. Finishing 2nd overall suggests a very fast performance *cumulatively*.

4.  **Connecting Stage Time to Overall Time:**
    *   A competitor's overall time is the *sum* of their times for each of the 14 stages.
    *   Let $T_{s, p}$ be the time taken by competitor $p$ in stage $s$.
    *   Charles's total time is $T_{total, Charles} = \sum_{s=1}^{14} T_{s, Charles}$.
    *   For Charles to be the runner-up, his total time ($T_{total, Charles}$) must be lower than the total time of 98 other competitors, and higher than the total time of only one competitor (the champion).

5.  **Considering Time Differences within a Stage:**
    *   Finishing position only tells us the *order* of times, not the *magnitude* of the differences between them.
    *   In stage $s$, the time difference between the competitor in 92nd place and Charles (93rd place) is $T_{s, Charles} - T_{s, 92nd}$. This difference must be positive, but it could be very small (e.g., a few seconds).
    *   In stage $s$, the time difference between the competitor in 94th place and Charles (93rd place) is $T_{s, 94th} - T_{s, Charles}$. This difference must also be positive, but it could be *very large* (e.g., many minutes or even hours).

6.  **Applying the Hint:** The hint points to the aggregation of time and that one can finish with a shorter *total* time than someone else, even if they are sometimes slower in individual stages. It also mentions finding the maximum number of people he can beat.
    *   In *each* stage, Charles beat exactly 7 people (finished faster than them).
    *   Consider the 7 competitors who finished behind Charles (94th through 100th) in stage 1. Did the *same* 7 competitors finish behind Charles in stage 2, stage 3, and so on for all 14 stages? Not necessarily, but let's consider the possibility. If there were a group of 7 competitors who were *always* slower than Charles in *every* stage, then their total time would definitely be higher than Charles's total time (since each component of their sum is larger than Charles's). This explains how Charles could beat at least 7 people overall.

7.  **Explaining How Charles Beats the Others (Positions 1-92 in any given stage):**
    *   In every stage, 92 competitors finished ahead of Charles. Their times in that specific stage were lower than Charles's time.
    *   For Charles to finish 2nd overall, the total time of *most* of these 92 competitors (in fact, 98 of the other 99 competitors overall, meaning 97 of the people who finished ahead of Charles at some point, plus the 7 who finished behind him at some point) must be greater than Charles's total time.
    *   This is possible if the competitors who were faster than Charles in *some* stages were significantly *slower* than Charles in *other* stages.

8.  **The Crucial Factor: Large Time Penalties:**
    *   Imagine the times in a stage looked like this:
        *   1st to 92nd place: Times clustered together, maybe within a few minutes of each other.
        *   93rd place (Charles): Time is only slightly more than 92nd place (e.g., a few seconds slower).
        *   94th to 100th place: Times are much, much larger than 93rd place (e.g., tens of minutes or hours slower) due to crashes, mechanical failures, getting lost, extreme fatigue, or other incidents.
    *   If this pattern holds true across multiple stages, consider the total time.
        *   Charles's total time is the sum of 14 times, each of which is slightly more than the time of the 92nd person, but much less than the time of the 94th person *in that stage*.
        *   A competitor who finished, say, 10th in 13 stages (meaning times much lower than Charles in those stages) but had one terrible stage where they finished 98th (meaning a time much *higher* than Charles in that stage) could easily end up with a higher *total* time than Charles.
        *   Example:
            *   Stage 1: CompX = 30 min (10th), Charles = 40 min (93rd)
            *   Stage 2: CompX = 30 min (10th), Charles = 40 min (93rd)
            *   ... (12 more stages where CompX is much faster) ...
            *   Stage 14: CompX = 200 min (98th), Charles = 40 min (93rd) - Note: In this stage, CompX finished *behind* Charles, despite typically being faster.
            *   Total time for Charles: $14 \times 40 = 560$ min.
            *   Total time for CompX: $13 \times 30 + 200 = 390 + 200 = 590$ min.
            *   In this simplified example, CompX finished ahead of Charles 13 times, but still had a higher *total* time due to one very bad stage.

9.  **Conclusion:**
    *   Charles's consistent 93rd place means he avoided the very large time penalties that affected other competitors in various stages.
    *   While 92 people were faster than him in any given stage, these were often *different* people in different stages. More importantly, many of these competitors who were faster than Charles in some stages suffered significant setbacks (crashes, mechanicals, etc.) in *other* stages, resulting in *very high* times for those stages.
    *   Charles's time in 93rd place, while not fast enough to beat the leading pack in any individual stage, was consistently ""not terrible"" and, critically, much faster than the times posted by competitors who had major problems in a stage.
    *   The sum of Charles's ""not terrible"" times over 14 stages was lower than the sum of times for 98 other competitors, because those competitors, while perhaps having some very fast stages, also had one or more *very slow* stages due to large time penalties.
    *   Only one competitor (the champion) managed to have a total time lower than Charles, likely by being consistently faster than Charles without incurring significant time penalties.

In essence, Charles won by being consistently mediocre, thereby avoiding the catastrophic performances that inflated the total times of most other competitors who were faster than him on any given day.

The maximum number of people he beat in *any single stage* is 7. The reason he beat 98 people *overall* is due to the accumulation of time, where large time penalties incurred by others in specific stages (even if they were faster than Charles in other stages) outweighed Charles's consistent, albeit slow by top standards, performance.

The final answer is $\boxed{By avoiding large time penalties in any stage, Charles's consistent, albeit slow (93rd place), times accumulated to a lower total than 98 other competitors, most of whom were faster in some stages but incurred significant delays (crashes, mechanicals, etc.) in others.}$.",True,1,0,0
147,"Question: The Boldavian navy has a rigorous training program.  In order to graduate from the naval academy, cadets must enter a pool and fight sharks.  Today, a group of cadets was tested.  Each cadet put on his mask, snorkel, and two flippers; and armed himself with a knife.  Then the cadets jumped into the pool.  The sharks were then released from their pens.  After 10 minutes of gruelling hand-to-fin combat, all of the sharks were killed.  Miraculously, none of the cadets were killed.  Exiting the pool, the cadets began to haul the shark bodies out of the water.  The dead sharks were soon lying in a row.  One of the cadets noted that during the fight, there were 4 times as many cadets in the water as there were sharks.  A second cadet then stated that the number of legs they now had was equal to the square of the number of sharks.  A third said that the number of cadet legs was 14 more than the total number of cadet and shark heads.  How many sharks were killed?
 Hint: Set up systems of equations; notice that legs could be lost (""they now had"")","Set up systems of equations; notice that legs could be lost (""they now had"")","7 sharks were killed.
Since there were 4 times as many cadets, there were 28 cadets.  The number of cadet legs is equal to the square of the number of sharks, which would be 49 legs.  49 legs is 14 more than the number of cadet and shark heads: 7 sharks plus 28 cadets equals 35 heads.
Note that although all of the cadets survived, nothing was said about possible injuries.  In fact, each shark had bitten off one leg from each of 7 cadets.  This explains the shortage of legs, since 28 cadets should have had 56 legs, not 49.  Also note the statement of the second cadet, who said 'the number of legs they NOW had ...'.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step, using the information and the hint provided.

1.  **Identify the unknowns:** We need to find the number of sharks killed. Let's assign variables.
    *   Let `S` be the number of sharks killed. Since all sharks were killed, this is the total number of sharks present.
    *   Let `C` be the number of cadets.

2.  **Translate the statements into equations:** There are three key statements from the cadets.

    *   **Statement 1:** ""during the fight, there were 4 times as many cadets in the water as there were sharks.""
        *   This directly gives us a relationship between C and S:
        *   Equation 1: `C = 4S`

    *   **Statement 2:** ""the number of legs they now had was equal to the square of the number of sharks.""
        *   ""They"" refers to the cadets, as only cadets have legs.
        *   ""the number of legs they now had"" implies the *total* number of legs remaining on all cadets *after* the fight. Let's call this number `L_cadet_now`.
        *   ""the square of the number of sharks"" is `S²`.
        *   Equation 2: `L_cadet_now = S²`

    *   **Statement 3:** ""the number of cadet legs [now] was 14 more than the total number of cadet and shark heads.""
        *   ""the number of cadet legs"" refers to `L_cadet_now` again.
        *   ""total number of cadet and shark heads"": Each cadet has 1 head, so there are `C` cadet heads. Each shark has 1 head, so there are `S` shark heads. The total number of heads is `C + S`.
        *   ""14 more than"" means we add 14 to the total heads.
        *   Equation 3: `L_cadet_now = (C + S) + 14`

3.  **Set up the system of equations:** We have the following system:
    1.  `C = 4S`
    2.  `L_cadet_now = S²`
    3.  `L_cadet_now = C + S + 14`

4.  **Solve the system of equations:** We can use substitution.
    *   Notice that both Equation 2 and Equation 3 provide an expression for `L_cadet_now`. We can set these expressions equal to each other:
        `S² = C + S + 14`

    *   Now we have an equation involving `S` and `C`. We can use Equation 1 (`C = 4S`) to eliminate `C` from this new equation:
        `S² = (4S) + S + 14`

    *   Simplify the equation:
        `S² = 5S + 14`

    *   Rearrange the equation into a standard quadratic form (`aS² + bS + c = 0`):
        `S² - 5S - 14 = 0`

5.  **Solve the quadratic equation for S:** We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. We need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5.
    *   Let's list factors of -14: (1, -14), (-1, 14), (2, -7), (-2, 7).
    *   Let's check their sums:
        *   1 + (-14) = -13
        *   -1 + 14 = 13
        *   2 + (-7) = -5
        *   -2 + 7 = 5
    *   The pair (2, -7) sums to -5. So, we can factor the quadratic equation as:
        `(S + 2)(S - 7) = 0`

    *   This equation gives two possible solutions for `S`:
        *   `S + 2 = 0` => `S = -2`
        *   `S - 7 = 0` => `S = 7`

6.  **Evaluate the solutions:** `S` represents the number of sharks. The number of sharks must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, `S = -2` is not a valid solution in this context.
    *   The valid solution is `S = 7`.

7.  **Verify the solution (optional but recommended):**
    *   If `S = 7`, then from Equation 1, `C = 4 * 7 = 28`. So there were 28 cadets.
    *   From Equation 2, `L_cadet_now = S² = 7² = 49`. The cadets had a total of 49 legs after the fight.
    *   From Equation 3, `L_cadet_now = C + S + 14 = 28 + 7 + 14 = 35 + 14 = 49`. This matches the value from Equation 2.
    *   The number of heads was 28 (cadets) + 7 (sharks) = 35. The number of cadet legs (49) is indeed 14 more than the total heads (35 + 14 = 49).
    *   The initial number of legs for the 28 cadets (assuming 2 legs each) was 28 * 2 = 56. The fact that they ended up with 49 legs means they lost 56 - 49 = 7 legs collectively during the fight, which is consistent with the hint ""legs could be lost ('they now had')"".

All the conditions are met with `S = 7` sharks and `C = 28` cadets.

The question asks for the number of sharks killed.

149,"Question: The owner of a Romankachi flower boutique follows a particular pattern for his business. During a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%. After a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, the cost of a Red Rose bouquet  decreases by 162 Roka (Roka being the native Romankachi currency). After another year in which there was inflation once more followed by a slowdown, the cost of this bouquet reduces by a further 147.42 Roka. What was the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet ?
 Hint: Everything can be expressed and solvd in terms of the original price of the bouquet and the inflation rate",Everything can be expressed and solvd in terms of the original price of the bouquet and the inflation rate,"The original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.
Let the original price of the Red Rose bouquet  be 'B' Roka.
It is given that during a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%.
Hence after a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 162 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)
(since B(1+Y) is the price during inflation and  B(1-Y)(1+Y) the price during the slowdown)
Therefore the decrease in price after one year
= B - B(1-Y^2)
= B - B + B*Y^2
= B*Y^2 = 162      ... Equation 1
Hence after another year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 147.42 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)(1-Y^2)
= B(1-Y^2)^2
(since B(1-Y^2) is the price at the end of the previous year and           B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y) the price during the slowdown this year)
Therefore the decrease in price this year
= B(1-Y^2) - B(1-Y^2)^2
= B(1-Y^2)[1 - (1-Y^2)]
= B(1-Y^2)( Y^2) = 147.42    ... Equation 2
Dividing Equation 2 by Equation 1, we get
(1-Y^2) = 0.91 => Y^2 = 0.09
Substituting the above value of Y^2 in equation 1, we get
B*0.09 = 162
Hence B = 162/0.09 = 1800 Roka.
Therefore the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $P_0$ be the original price of the Red Rose bouquet in Roka.
Let $Y\%$ be the percentage by which the price is raised or decreased. Let $r = Y/100$ be the decimal equivalent of this percentage.

In the first year, there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown.
The price after inflation is $P_0(1 + r)$.
The price after the subsequent slowdown is $P_0(1 + r)(1 - r)$.
Using the difference of squares formula, $(1+r)(1-r) = 1 - r^2$.
So, the price at the end of Year 1, let's call it $P_1$, is $P_1 = P_0(1 - r^2)$.

The problem states that the cost of the bouquet decreases by 162 Roka after Year 1. This means the difference between the original price ($P_0$) and the price at the end of Year 1 ($P_1$) is 162.
$P_0 - P_1 = 162$
$P_0 - P_0(1 - r^2) = 162$
$P_0(1 - (1 - r^2)) = 162$
$P_0 r^2 = 162$. (Equation 1)

In the second year, the same pattern of inflation followed by a slowdown is repeated, starting from the price at the end of Year 1, which is $P_1$.
The price after inflation is $P_1(1 + r)$.
The price after the subsequent slowdown is $P_1(1 + r)(1 - r) = P_1(1 - r^2)$.
So, the price at the end of Year 2, let's call it $P_2$, is $P_2 = P_1(1 - r^2)$.

The problem states that the cost of this bouquet reduces by a further 147.42 Roka after Year 2. This means the decrease in price during Year 2 (from $P_1$ to $P_2$) is 147.42.
$P_1 - P_2 = 147.42$
$P_1 - P_1(1 - r^2) = 147.42$
$P_1(1 - (1 - r^2)) = 147.42$
$P_1 r^2 = 147.42$. (Equation 2)

We now have a system of two equations:
1) $P_0 r^2 = 162$
2) $P_1 r^2 = 147.42$

We also know that $P_1 = P_0(1 - r^2)$ from the calculation of the price at the end of Year 1.
Substitute the expression for $P_1$ from the end of Year 1 into Equation 2:
$[P_0(1 - r^2)] r^2 = 147.42$.
$P_0 (1 - r^2) r^2 = 147.42$.

We can solve for $r^2$ from Equation 1, assuming $P_0 \neq 0$: $r^2 = 162 / P_0$.
Substitute this expression for $r^2$ into the modified Equation 2:
$P_0 (1 - \frac{162}{P_0}) (\frac{162}{P_0}) = 147.42$.

Now, we simplify and solve for $P_0$:
The term $(1 - \frac{162}{P_0})$ can be written as $\frac{P_0 - 162}{P_0}$.
So, $P_0 \times \frac{P_0 - 162}{P_0} \times \frac{162}{P_0} = 147.42$.
The $P_0$ in the numerator cancels with one of the $P_0$ terms in the denominator:
$(P_0 - 162) \times \frac{162}{P_0} = 147.42$.

Multiply both sides by $P_0$ to clear the denominator:
$162 (P_0 - 162) = 147.42 P_0$.
$162 P_0 - 162^2 = 147.42 P_0$.

Calculate $162^2$: $162 \times 162 = 26244$.
$162 P_0 - 26244 = 147.42 P_0$.

Rearrange the terms to solve for $P_0$:
$162 P_0 - 147.42 P_0 = 26244$.
$(162 - 147.42) P_0 = 26244$.
$14.58 P_0 = 26244$.

Now, divide to find $P_0$:
$P_0 = \frac{26244}{14.58}$.

To perform the division, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 100 to remove the decimal point:
$P_0 = \frac{26244 \times 100}{14.58 \times 100} = \frac{2624400}{1458}$.

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by common factors.
Both are divisible by 2:
$2624400 \div 2 = 1312200$
$1458 \div 2 = 729$.
So, $P_0 = \frac{1312200}{729}$.

Recognize that $729 = 9^3 = 3^6$. Let's check for divisibility by 9.
Sum of digits of 1312200 is $1+3+1+2+2+0+0 = 9$, which is divisible by 9.
$1312200 \div 9 = 145800$.
$729 \div 9 = 81$.
So, $P_0 = \frac{145800}{81}$.

Again, check for divisibility by 9 (since $81 = 9^2$).
Sum of digits of 145800 is $1+4+5+8+0+0 = 18$, which is divisible by 9.
$145800 \div 9 = 16200$.
$81 \div 9 = 9$.
So, $P_0 = \frac{16200}{9}$.

Finally, perform the division:
$16200 \div 9 = 1800$.

So, the original price of the Red Rose bouquet was 1800 Roka.

Let's verify the result.
If $P_0 = 1800$, then from $P_0 r^2 = 162$, we get $1800 r^2 = 162$.
$r^2 = \frac{162}{1800} = \frac{81}{900}$.
So, $r = \sqrt{\frac{81}{900}} = \frac{9}{30} = 0.3$. This means $Y = 0.3 \times 100 = 30\%$.

Price at the end of Year 1: $P_1 = P_0(1 - r^2) = 1800 (1 - 0.09) = 1800 \times 0.91 = 1638$.
Decrease in Year 1: $P_0 - P_1 = 1800 - 1638 = 162$. This matches the given information.

Price at the end of Year 2: $P_2 = P_1(1 - r^2) = 1638 (1 - 0.09) = 1638 \times 0.91$.
$1638 \times 0.91 = 1638 \times (1 - 0.09) = 1638 - 1638 \times 0.09$.
$1638 \times 0.09 = 1638 \times \frac{9}{100} = \frac{14742}{100} = 147.42$.
$P_2 = 1638 - 147.42 = 1490.58$.
Decrease in Year 2: $P_1 - P_2 = 1638 - 1490.58 = 147.42$. This matches the given information.

The original price is indeed 1800 Roka.

151,"Question: In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.
On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.
About this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, ""Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.""
Knowing Junior, we asked, ""How big a headache is your math gonna give us?""
She answered, ""I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.""
Name the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.
 Hint: Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.",Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.,"Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.
After labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, ""Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof. First, I mark a line from A to D.  This creates a trapezoid (trapezium in Britain) ABCD.  Next, I mark the lines EH, BG, and CF.  These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.""
The partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon.

When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 90 days also.
For how long can the three animals graze on the field together?
 Hint: Rates problem--use the same algebraic techniques",Rates problem--use the same algebraic techniques,"The cow, the goat, and the goose eat grass with a constant speed (amount per day): v1 for the cow, v2 for the goat, v3 for the goose.
The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:
v1 = 3 x h/180,
v2 = 2 x h/180,
v3 = 1 x h/180,
k = 1 x h/180.
Then holds for the time t that the three animals can graze together: h-tx(v1+v2+v3-k) = 0, so t = h/(v1+v2+v3-k) = h/(3xh/180+2xh/180+1xh/180-1xh/180) = 36. The three animals can graze together for 36 days.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

The hint given is ""1?? x 3? = ?254"".
Comparing this hint with the equation structure $ABC \times DE = FGHI$:
- The first digit of the first number is 1, so $A=1$.
- The first digit of the second number is 3, so $D=3$.
- The second digit of the product is 2, so $G=2$.
- The third digit of the product is 5, so $H=5$.
- The fourth digit of the product is 4, so $I=4$.

So the equation is $1BC \times 3E = F254$.

The digits already used are $\{A, D, G, H, I\} = \{1, 3, 2, 5, 4\}$.
The set of used digits is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$.

The remaining digits from $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$ must be used for $B, C, E, F$.
The remaining digits are $\{6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
So, $B, C, E, F$ must be a permutation of $\{6, 7, 8, 9\}$.

Now let's look at the last digit of the product. The last digit of $1BC \times 3E$ is 4.
The last digit of the product is determined by the last digit of $C \times E$.
$C$ and $E$ must be distinct digits from the set $\{6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
We need to find pairs $(C, E)$ from $\{6, 7, 8, 9\}$ such that $C \times E$ ends in 4.
Let's list the products of distinct digits from $\{6, 7, 8, 9\}$:
- $6 \times 7 = 42$ (ends in 2)
- $6 \times 8 = 48$ (ends in 8)
- $6 \times 9 = 54$ (ends in 4) - Possible pair $(C, E) = (6, 9)$ or $(9, 6)$.
- $7 \times 8 = 56$ (ends in 6)
- $7 \times 9 = 63$ (ends in 3)
- $8 \times 9 = 72$ (ends in 2)

The only pairs of distinct digits from $\{6, 7, 8, 9\}$ whose product ends in 4 are $(6, 9)$ and $(9, 6)$.

Case 1: $C=6$ and $E=9$.
The set of digits for $B, C, E, F$ is $\{B, 6, 9, F\}$.
Since $B, C, E, F$ must be a permutation of $\{6, 7, 8, 9\}$, the remaining digits for $B$ and $F$ must be $\{7, 8\}$.
Subcase 1a: $B=7$ and $F=8$.
The digits are $A=1, B=7, C=6, D=3, E=9, F=8, G=2, H=5, I=4$.

The equation is $176 \times 39 = 8254$.
Let's check the multiplication: $176 \times 39 = 176 \times (40 - 1) = 176 \times 40 - 176 = 7040 - 176 = 6864$.
This product is 6864, not 8254. So this subcase is incorrect.

Subcase 1b: $B=8$ and $F=7$.
The digits are $A=1, B=8, C=6, D=3, E=9, F=7, G=2, H=5, I=4$.

The equation is $186 \times 39 = 7254$.
Let's check the multiplication: $186 \times 39 = 186 \times (40 - 1) = 186 \times 40 - 186 = 7440 - 186 = 7254$.
This product is 7254, which matches. This is a valid solution.
The completed equation is $186 \times 39 = 7254$. The digits used are 1, 8, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2, 5, 4, which are exactly all the digits from 1 to 9.

Case 2: $C=9$ and $E=6$.

The equation is $179 \times 36 = 8254$.
Let's check the multiplication: $179 \times 36 = 179 \times (30 + 6) = 179 \times 30 + 179 \times 6 = 5370 + 1074 = 6444$.
This product is 6444, not 8254. So this subcase is incorrect.

Subcase 2b: $B=8$ and $F=7$.

The set of digits is $\{1, 8, 9, 3, 6, 7, 2, 5, 4\}$, which is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$. All are distinct.
The equation is $189 \times 36 = 7254$.
Let's check the multiplication: $189 \times 36 = 189 \times (30 + 6) = 189 \times 30 + 189 \times 6 = 5670 + 1134 = 6804$.
This product is 6804, not 7254. So this subcase is incorrect.

The only valid solution found is $186 \times 39 = 7254$.
The equation fits the form ??? x 3? = ????.
??? is 186, 3? is 39, and ???? is 7254.
The digits used are 1, 8, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2, 5, 4, which are all the digits from 1 to 9 used exactly once.

Thus, the 2nd person will know 1 person. Hence the 1st person[say A] will know 0 people or will know no one. Now since the nth person knows every one, he knows A .Therefore A knows the nth person. Hence our supposition is wrong and at least 2 people know the same number of people.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $N$ be the number of people at the party. Let the people be denoted by $P_1, P_2, \dots, P_N$.
Let $d_i$ be the number of people that person $P_i$ knows.

The problem states two conditions about the relationship ""knowing"":
1. Symmetry: If $P_i$ knows $P_j$, then $P_j$ knows $P_i$.
2. Reflexivity: Everyone knows himself or herself, i.e., $P_i$ knows $P_i$ for all $i=1, \dots, N$.

Let the relationship ""knowing"" be represented by a set of pairs $(P_i, P_j)$. The number of people $P_i$ knows is the size of the set $\{P_j \mid P_i \text{ knows } P_j\}$. This is $d_i$.

From condition 2, $P_i$ knows $P_i$, so $P_i$ is always in the set of people $P_i$ knows. This means the minimum number of people anyone can know is 1. So, $d_i \ge 1$ for all $i$.
The maximum number of people $P_i$ can know is the total number of people at the party, which is $N$. This occurs if $P_i$ knows everyone (including themselves). So, $d_i \le N$ for all $i$.
Therefore, the possible values for the number of people a person can know are integers in the set $\{1, 2, \dots, N\}$.

We want to prove that there are two people who know the same number of people. In other words, we want to prove that there exist indices $i, j$ such that $i \ne j$ and $d_i = d_j$.

We will use indirect reasoning as suggested by the hint. Assume the negation of the statement we want to prove. The negation is: there are no two people who know the same number of people.
This means that all $N$ people know a different number of people. So, the degrees $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_N$ are all distinct.

We have $N$ distinct degrees, and each degree $d_i$ must be an integer from the set $\{1, 2, \dots, N\}$. Since there are exactly $N$ possible values in this set, the set of the degrees $\{d_1, d_2, \dots, d_N\}$ must be exactly $\{1, 2, \dots, N\}$.
This implies that for each value $k \in \{1, 2, \dots, N\}$, there is exactly one person who knows exactly $k$ people.

In particular, this means there exists a person who knows 1 person, and there exists a person who knows $N$ people.
Let $P_a$ be the person who knows 1 person. So, $d_a = 1$.
The set of people $P_a$ knows has size 1. Since $P_a$ knows $P_a$ (by condition 2), the only person $P_a$ knows must be $P_a$ himself/herself. Thus, $P_a$ knows $P_a$ and does not know any other person $P_j$ where $j \ne a$.

Let $P_b$ be the person who knows $N$ people. So, $d_b = N$.
The set of people $P_b$ knows has size $N$. Since there are only $N$ people in total, $P_b$ must know everyone. Thus, $P_b$ knows $P_j$ for all $j=1, \dots, N$.

The problem is implicitly about a party with at least two people, as it refers to ""two people"". If $N=1$, there is only one person, $P_1$. $P_1$ knows $P_1$, so $d_1=1$. There are no two people to compare degrees. The statement is about ""two people"", so we consider $N \ge 2$.

If $N \ge 2$, then the degrees 1 and $N$ are distinct values. Therefore, the person with degree 1 ($P_a$) must be different from the person with degree $N$ ($P_b$). So, $a \ne b$.

Now, consider the relationship between $P_a$ and $P_b$.
Since $P_b$ knows everyone (from $d_b=N$), $P_b$ must know $P_a$.
By the symmetry condition (condition 1), if $P_b$ knows $P_a$, then $P_a$ knows $P_b$.

However, we deduced from $d_a=1$ that $P_a$ knows only $P_a$. Since $a \ne b$, $P_a$ does not know $P_b$.

We have reached a contradiction:
Based on the assumption that all degrees are distinct, we concluded that $P_a$ knows $P_b$.
But based on the properties of $P_a$ (knowing only one person) and the fact that $P_a \ne P_b$, we concluded that $P_a$ does not know $P_b$.

This is a direct contradiction. Therefore, the initial assumption that all degrees are distinct must be false.
This means that there must exist at least two people $P_i$ and $P_j$ with $i \ne j$ such that $d_i = d_j$.

This proves that at any party with $N \ge 2$ people satisfying the given conditions, there are two people who know the same number of people.

The final answer is $\boxed{At any party, there are two people who know the same number of people. Assume that if A knows B , then B knows A . Assume also that everyone knows himself or herself.}$.",True,0,0,0

The last student got ""Three"" when he asked again, at the 30 minute mark. 30 times 3 is 90, the number of minutes left in the class and the answer to this brain teaser.
The class was two hours long.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break down this puzzle step by step, using the information provided and the hint.

1.  **Identify the Data Points:** We have three moments in time where a student asks about the time left and the instructor gives an answer. Let's denote the time elapsed from the start of the class as $T$ and the instructor's answer as $A$.
    *   Moment 1: $T_1 = 15$ minutes into the class. $A_1 = 7$.
    *   Moment 2: 5 minutes after Moment 1. So, $T_2 = 15 + 5 = 20$ minutes into the class. $A_2 = 5$.
    *   Moment 3: 10 minutes after Moment 2. So, $T_3 = 20 + 10 = 30$ minutes into the class. $A_3 = 3$.

2.  **Apply the Hint:** The hint suggests relating the product of the time elapsed and the instructor's answer. Let's calculate the product $P = T \times A$ for each moment:
    *   Product 1: $P_1 = T_1 \times A_1 = 15 \times 7 = 105$.
    *   Product 2: $P_2 = T_2 \times A_2 = 20 \times 5 = 100$.
    *   Product 3: $P_3 = T_3 \times A_3 = 30 \times 3 = 90$.

3.  **Analyze the Products:** The products (105, 100, 90) are not constant. However, they are decreasing. Let's look at how the product changes with time elapsed:
    *   From $T_1=15$ to $T_2=20$ (an increase of 5 minutes), the product changes from $P_1=105$ to $P_2=100$ (a decrease of 5).
    *   From $T_2=20$ to $T_3=30$ (an increase of 10 minutes), the product changes from $P_2=100$ to $P_3=90$ (a decrease of 10).

4.  **Identify the Pattern:** The *decrease* in the product ($T \times A$) is equal to the *increase* in the time elapsed ($T$). This suggests that the sum of the product and the time elapsed might be constant: $(T \times A) + T = C$, where $C$ is a constant value.

5.  **Test the Hypothesis:** Let's calculate $(T \times A) + T$ for each moment:
    *   Moment 1: $(T_1 \times A_1) + T_1 = (15 \times 7) + 15 = 105 + 15 = 120$.
    *   Moment 2: $(T_2 \times A_2) + T_2 = (20 \times 5) + 20 = 100 + 20 = 120$.
    *   Moment 3: $(T_3 \times A_3) + T_3 = (30 \times 3) + 30 = 90 + 30 = 120$.

6.  **Confirm the Constant:** The calculation confirms that the value $(T \times A) + T$ is constant and equal to 120.

7.  **Interpret the Constant:** We have the relationship $T \times A + T = 120$. This can be rewritten as $T \times (A + 1) = 120$.
    Let Total be the total duration of the class. The time elapsed is $T$. The time left is $L = \text{Total} - T$.
    The instructor's answer $A$ is some value related to the time left. Let's consider the equation $T \times (A + 1) = 120$.
    If we divide both sides by $T$, we get $A + 1 = \frac{120}{T}$.
    This suggests that the instructor's answer $A$ is related to the total time of the class divided by the time elapsed, specifically $A = \frac{120}{T} - 1$.

8.  **Relate the Constant to the Total Time:** Let's test the hypothesis that the constant value, 120, represents the total duration of the class.
    If $\text{Total} = 120$ minutes, then the relationship $A = \frac{\text{Total}}{T} - 1$ would explain the instructor's answers:
    *   At $T=15$: $A = \frac{120}{15} - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7$. (Matches $A_1$)
    *   At $T=20$: $A = \frac{120}{20} - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5$. (Matches $A_2$)
    *   At $T=30$: $A = \frac{120}{30} - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3$. (Matches $A_3$)

9.  **Conclusion about the Total Time:** The pattern holds, and the relationship $A = \frac{\text{Total}}{T} - 1$ is consistent with the data if the total class time is 120 minutes. The pupil ""clicked into"" this pattern.

10. **Determine the Time Left:** The question asks for the time left when the *last* pupil asked. This was at $T_3 = 30$ minutes into the class.
    Total class time = 120 minutes.
    Time elapsed = 30 minutes.
    Time left = Total time - Time elapsed = 120 - 30 = 90 minutes.

The pupil realized the pattern $(T \times A) + T = 120$, which implies $T \times (A+1) = 120$. They likely deduced that the instructor's answer $A$ was related to the total class time (Total) and the elapsed time ($T$) by the formula $A+1 = \frac{\text{Total}}{T}$, meaning $\text{Total} = T \times (A+1) = 120$ minutes.

1+1+123456789+123456789=246913580
The digit 7 is absent from this sum.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let the given binomial expression be $(x+y)^n$, where $n = 123456789$.
The coefficients in the expansion of $(x+y)^n$ are given by the binomial coefficients $\binom{n}{k}$ for $k=0, 1, 2, \dots, n$.
The coefficients are $\binom{n}{0}, \binom{n}{1}, \binom{n}{2}, \dots, \binom{n}{n}$.

We know the formula for binomial coefficients: $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.
Let's calculate the first few coefficients:
$\binom{n}{0} = \frac{n!}{0!n!} = \frac{n!}{1 \cdot n!} = 1$.
$\binom{n}{1} = \frac{n!}{1!(n-1)!} = \frac{n \cdot (n-1)!}{1 \cdot (n-1)!} = n$.
$\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)!}{2 \cdot 1 \cdot (n-2)!} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.
$\binom{n}{3} = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)!}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot (n-3)!} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}$.

We also know the symmetry property of binomial coefficients: $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}$.
Using this property, we have:
$\binom{n}{n} = \binom{n}{0} = 1$.
$\binom{n}{n-1} = \binom{n}{1} = n$.
$\binom{n}{n-2} = \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.
$\binom{n}{n-3} = \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}$.

The sequence of coefficients starts with $\binom{n}{0}, \binom{n}{1}, \binom{n}{2}, \dots$ and ends with $\dots, \binom{n}{n-2}, \binom{n}{n-1}, \binom{n}{n}$.
The values are $1, n, \frac{n(n-1)}{2}, \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}, \dots$ and $\dots, \frac{n(n-1)}{2}, n, 1$.

We need to find the four smallest coefficients. Let's compare the first few values.
Given $n = 123456789$. This is a very large positive integer.
Compare 1 and $n$: Since $n = 123456789 > 1$, we have $1 < n$.
Compare $n$ and $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$: $\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = n \cdot \frac{n-1}{2}$.
Since $n = 123456789 > 3$, $n-1 = 123456788$. $\frac{n-1}{2} = \frac{123456788}{2} = 61728394$.
Since $61728394 > 1$, we have $n \cdot \frac{n-1}{2} > n \cdot 1$, so $\binom{n}{2} > \binom{n}{1}$.
Thus, $1 < n < \binom{n}{2}$.

The coefficients increase from $k=0$ up to $k=\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ and then decrease symmetrically.
$\binom{n}{0} < \binom{n}{1} < \binom{n}{2} < \binom{n}{3} < \dots$.
The smallest value is $\binom{n}{0} = 1$. It also appears at the end as $\binom{n}{n} = 1$. These are the two smallest coefficients.
The next smallest value is $\binom{n}{1} = n$. It also appears as $\binom{n}{n-1} = n$. These are the next two smallest coefficients.
Since $n = 123456789 > 3$, $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} > n$. Thus, the coefficients $\binom{n}{k}$ for $k \ge 2$ (and by symmetry, for $k \le n-2$) are greater than $n$.
So the four smallest coefficients are indeed 1, 1, $n$, and $n$. This matches the hint.

The sum of the four smallest coefficients is $1 + 1 + n + n = 2 + 2n$.
Substitute the value of $n$: $n = 123456789$.
Sum $= 2 + 2 \times 123456789$.
First, calculate $2 \times 123456789$:
$123456789 \times 2 = 246913578$.
Now, add 2 to this product:
Sum $= 2 + 246913578 = 246913580$.

The sum is 246913580.
The problem states that this sum is a nine-digit number. Let's check the number of digits: 246913580 has 9 digits. This matches the description.

The problem states that each digit of the sum is a distinct number from the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
Let's list the digits of the sum 246913580: 2, 4, 6, 9, 1, 3, 5, 8, 0.
Let's check if these digits are distinct:
2 - yes
4 - distinct from 2
6 - distinct from 2, 4
9 - distinct from 2, 4, 6
1 - distinct from 2, 4, 6, 9
3 - distinct from 2, 4, 6, 9, 1
5 - distinct from 2, 4, 6, 9, 1, 3
8 - distinct from 2, 4, 6, 9, 1, 3, 5
0 - distinct from 2, 4, 6, 9, 1, 3, 5, 8
All the digits are distinct. The set of digits in the sum is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}.

The problem asks what number from the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} does not appear as a digit in the sum.
We compare the set of all possible digits {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} with the set of digits present in the sum {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}.
The digit that is in the first set but not in the second set is 7.

The number from the set that does not appear as a digit in the sum is 7.

The ratio of the total distance traveled by the two boats when they pass each other for the second time is:  (2x - 400) / (X + 400).

and since 2a = b then a = 3 and b = 6. So their ages differ by 3. Since all primes except 2 are odd and differ by an even number we can only have 2 and 5, Bert being the older of the two. The father plays no part in the problem!",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $A$ be Alf's current age and $B$ be Bert's current age.
Let $A_L$ and $B_L$ be Alf's and Bert's ages the last time they met.
We are given that $A_L$ and $B_L$ are both prime numbers.

Let $t$ be the time elapsed since they last met.
Then $A = A_L + t$ and $B = B_L + t$.
The difference in their ages is constant: $B - A = (B_L + t) - (A_L + t) = B_L - A_L$.

Now, let's decode Alf's statement: ""when I was a quarter of the age I am now, you were that age plus half the age your father would have been thirty years previous to when he was six times the age you would have been when I was half your age"".

Let's identify the specific point in time mentioned first: ""when I was a quarter of the age I am now"".
Alf's age at that time was $A/4$.
This event happened $A - A/4 = 3A/4$ years ago.
At that time, Bert's age was $B - 3A/4$.

The statement says ""you were that age plus ..."". ""that age"" refers to Alf's age at that time, which was $A/4$.
So, Bert's age at that time was $A/4$ plus some other quantity.
$B - 3A/4 = A/4 + X$, where $X$ is the quantity described by the complex phrase involving the father's age.
Rearranging this equation, we get $B - A = X$. This means the difference in their current ages ($B-A$) is equal to the value $X$.

Now let's analyze the expression for $X$: ""half the age your father would have been thirty years previous to when he was six times the age you would have been when I was half your age"".
Let $F$ be Bert's father's current age.

Let's break down the time references within $X$.
First, consider the time ""when I was half your age"". Let this time be $t_1$ years ago.
Alf's age then was $A - t_1$. Bert's age then was $B - t_1$.
The phrase ""when I was half your age"" means Alf's age at that time was half of Bert's age at that time. Let Bert's age at that time be $B'$. Then Alf's age was $B'/2$.
So, $A - t_1 = (B - t_1)/2$.
$2(A - t_1) = B - t_1$
$2A - 2t_1 = B - t_1$
$t_1 = 2A - B$.
This time was $2A-B$ years ago.
Bert's age at this time was $B - t_1 = B - (2A - B) = 2B - 2A$.
Alf's age at this time was $A - t_1 = A - (2A - B) = B - A$. (As a check, $(2B-2A)/2 = B-A$, so Alf's age was indeed half of Bert's age at that time).

Next, consider ""six times the age you would have been when I was half your age"".
""the age you would have been when I was half your age"" is Bert's age at time $t_1$, which is $2B - 2A$.
Six times this age is $6 \times (2B - 2A) = 12B - 12A$.

Next, consider the time when the father's age was this value: ""when he [father] was six times the age you would have been when I was half your age"".
Let this time be $t_2$ years ago. The father's age at that time was $F - t_2$.
So, $F - t_2 = 12B - 12A$.
$t_2 = F - (12B - 12A)$. This time was $t_2$ years ago.

Next, consider ""thirty years previous to when he was six times the age you would have been when I was half your age"".
This refers to a time $t_2 + 30$ years ago.
The father's age at this time was $F - (t_2 + 30)$.
Substituting the expression for $t_2$:
Father's age $= F - (F - (12B - 12A) + 30) = F - F + (12B - 12A) - 30 = 12B - 12A - 30$.

This father's age is the value we called $F'$ earlier. The quantity $X$ is ""half the age your father would have been..."" ($F'$).
$X = \frac{1}{2} (12B - 12A - 30)$.
$X = 6B - 6A - 15$.

Now, substitute this expression for $X$ back into the equation $B - A = X$:
$B - A = 6B - 6A - 15$.
$5A - 5B = -15$.
$5(A - B) = -15$.
$A - B = -3$.
$B - A = 3$.

This confirms that Bert is currently 3 years older than Alf. As shown earlier, the age difference is constant, so Bert was also 3 years older than Alf the last time they met.
$B_L - A_L = 3$.

We are given that $A_L$ and $B_L$ are prime numbers. We need to find a pair of prime numbers $(A_L, B_L)$ such that their difference is 3.
Let's list prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ...
We are looking for $A_L$ and $B_L=A_L+3$ where both are prime.

Let's test values for $A_L$:
- If $A_L = 2$: $B_L = 2 + 3 = 5$. Both 2 and 5 are prime numbers. This is a possible solution.
- If $A_L = 3$: $B_L = 3 + 3 = 6$. 6 is not a prime number (it's divisible by 2 and 3).
- If $A_L > 3$: $A_L$ must be a prime number, so $A_L$ is odd. Adding 3 to an odd number results in an even number: $A_L+3$ is even.
The only even prime number is 2. If $A_L+3$ is an even number greater than 2, it cannot be prime.
Since $A_L > 3$, $A_L \ge 5$. Then $A_L+3 \ge 5+3 = 8$. Any even number greater than 2 is composite.
Thus, if $A_L > 3$, $B_L = A_L+3$ cannot be prime.

The only possibility for $(A_L, B_L)$ to be a pair of primes with a difference of 3 is when $A_L=2$ and $B_L=5$.

The hint ""You actually do not need to think about the father"" is consistent with our finding that the father's age $F$ cancels out in the expression for $X$, and the entire complex phrase evaluates to a constant value (3) which is the age difference $B-A$.

166,"Question: Your assignment is to make a delivery from the depot to your base camp, 1600 miles away. The trip begins normally, but unfortunately, halfway to base camp, your supply truck breaks down. You have no way to call for help. Luckily, in addition to medical supplies, the truck is carrying a Desert Patrol Vehicle (DPV) and two barrels of fuel.
The DPV has a full 10 gallon tank, but to make room for the medical supplies, it can only carry one of the 45 gallon barrels at a time. While you can't transfer fuel between barrels, you can refill the tank from the barrels. Assume the DPV can get 12 miles per gallon, regardless of the load it carries.
How far can you go? Is it far enough to deliver the medical supplies and the DPV to your base camp?

Since your base camp is 800 miles away (half of 1600 miles), you can easily complete the delivery. Here's how:
Although you can only carry one barrel at a time, you need to transport both of them until one barrel is empty. F is the barrel used first, and L is the barrel used last.
Use half of a tank (5 gallons) to carry L 5*12=60 miles, and then return for F (uses another 5 gallons). Refill the tank from F and carry it to where you left L (also uses 5 gallons). Refill the tank again from F and switch barrels. Now you are 60 miles from the broken truck, the tank and L are full, but F is down to 30 gallons (45-5-5-5=30). Repeat this procedure two times.
Now you are 60*3=180 miles from the broken truck. The tank and L are still full, but F is empty. Leave F behind and make a run for it, carrying L. Refill the tank from L as needed. There are 55 gallons of fuel left so you can travel an additional 55*12=660 miles, for a maximum of (180+660) 840 miles.  Since you only have a total of 800 miles to go, you will make it to your base camp.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step, following the logic and using the hint.

**1. Understand the Situation:**

*   Total trip distance: 1600 miles.
*   Breakdown point: Halfway, which is 1600 miles / 2 = 800 miles from the depot.
*   Distance from breakdown point to base camp: 1600 miles (total distance) - 800 miles (distance from depot) = 800 miles.
*   We need to determine if we can travel 800 miles from the breakdown point towards the base camp.

**2. Inventory Resources at the Breakdown Point:**

*   DPV fuel tank: 10 gallons (full).
*   Fuel barrels: 2 x 45 gallons = 90 gallons.
*   Total fuel available: 10 gallons (tank) + 90 gallons (barrels) = 100 gallons.
*   DPV fuel efficiency: 12 miles per gallon (mpg).
*   DPV can carry one 45-gallon barrel at a time *in addition* to its full tank.

**3. Maximum Theoretical Range:**

*   If we could somehow use all 100 gallons from the breakdown point without needing to shuttle barrels, the maximum distance would be 100 gallons * 12 mpg = 1200 miles.
*   Since the base camp is 800 miles away, the theoretical maximum is more than enough. However, the constraint is the DPV's ability to *carry* and *stage* the fuel from the barrels.

**4. Apply the Hint: Staging Fuel**

The hint suggests using a portion of the tank fuel to carry one barrel forward, return for the other, and then consolidate. Let's denote the breakdown point as Mile 0 for our DPV journey towards the base camp. The base camp is at Mile 800.

*   **Step 1: Ferry the first barrel forward and return.**
    *   We start at Mile 0 with the DPV tank full (10 gallons) and one 45-gallon barrel (Barrel 1) loaded. Barrel 2 (45 gallons) is left at Mile 0.
    *   Drive a distance 'x' miles forward. Fuel used: `x / 12` gallons.
    *   At Mile 'x', drop Barrel 1 (45 gallons).
    *   Return from Mile 'x' to Mile 0. Fuel used: `x / 12` gallons.
    *   Total fuel used for this round trip: `(x / 12) + (x / 12) = 2x / 12 = x / 6` gallons.
    *   The hint says ""Use half of a tank to carry one barrel, then return"". This can be interpreted as the *total fuel used for the round trip* being half the tank capacity (10 gallons / 2 = 5 gallons).
    *   So, we set `x / 6 = 5` gallons.
    *   Solving for x: `x = 5 * 6 = 30` miles.

*   **Let's verify this distance x = 30 miles:**
    *   Start at Mile 0 with 10 gallons in the tank, carrying Barrel 1. Barrel 2 is at Mile 0.
    *   Drive 30 miles forward. Fuel used: 30 / 12 = 2.5 gallons. Tank remaining: 10 - 2.5 = 7.5 gallons.
    *   At Mile 30, drop Barrel 1 (45 gallons).
    *   Return 30 miles to Mile 0. Fuel used: 30 / 12 = 2.5 gallons. Tank remaining: 7.5 - 2.5 = 5 gallons.
    *   At Mile 0, the DPV has 5 gallons left. Barrel 2 (45 gallons) is still here. Barrel 1 (45 gallons) is at Mile 30.

*   **Step 2: Carry the second barrel forward to the location of the first barrel.**
    *   Start at Mile 0 with 5 gallons in the tank and load Barrel 2 (45 gallons).
    *   Drive 30 miles forward to Mile 30. Fuel used: 30 / 12 = 2.5 gallons.
    *   At Mile 30, the DPV arrives with 5 - 2.5 = 2.5 gallons in the tank, carrying Barrel 2 (45 gallons). Barrel 1 (45 gallons) is already at Mile 30.

*   **Step 3: Consolidate fuel and make the final push.**
    *   At Mile 30, we have the DPV with 2.5 gallons in the tank, plus Barrel 1 (45 gallons) and Barrel 2 (45 gallons).
    *   Total fuel at Mile 30 (excluding the tank fuel needed to get there): 45 + 45 = 90 gallons.
    *   The DPV tank has 2.5 gallons and can hold 10 gallons. We should fill the tank to maximize the range from this point.
    *   Fuel needed to fill the tank: 10 - 2.5 = 7.5 gallons.
    *   Take 7.5 gallons from the barrels. Fuel remaining in the barrels: 90 - 7.5 = 82.5 gallons.
    *   Now, at Mile 30, the DPV has a full 10-gallon tank and there are 82.5 gallons of fuel stored in the barrels.
    *   Total fuel available *from Mile 30* for the final push: 10 gallons (in tank, immediately usable) + 82.5 gallons (in storage, available for refills at Mile 30 or later if needed - but we'll calculate max range from here using the total pool). The effective total fuel to carry forward from Mile 30 is 10 + 82.5 = 92.5 gallons.

*   **Step 4: Calculate the distance of the final push.**
    *   Starting from Mile 30 with the equivalent of 92.5 gallons of fuel strategically available (either in the tank or refillable from storage at this point).
    *   Maximum distance this fuel can take the DPV: 92.5 gallons * 12 mpg = 1110 miles.

*   **Step 5: Calculate the total distance from the breakdown point.**
    *   The DPV traveled 30 miles to reach the fuel cache point.
    *   From the fuel cache point (Mile 30), it can travel an additional 1110 miles.
    *   Total distance from the breakdown point: 30 miles + 1110 miles = 1140 miles.

**5. Answer the Questions:**

*   **How far can you go?** You can go 1140 miles from the breakdown point.
*   **Is it far enough to deliver the medical supplies and the DPV to your base camp?** The base camp is 800 miles from the breakdown point. Since 1140 miles is greater than 800 miles, yes, it is far enough to reach the base camp.

**Reasoning Summary:**
We started at the breakdown point (Mile 0, 800 miles from the depot) with 100 gallons of fuel (10 in tank, 90 in two barrels). To move all the fuel forward despite the DPV's limited carrying capacity (1 barrel + tank), we used a staging strategy. Based on the hint's interpretation of using 5 gallons for the first round trip, we established a forward fuel cache at Mile 30. We ferried the first barrel there, returned, picked up the second, drove it to Mile 30, and consolidated all the fuel. At Mile 30, we had 92.5 gallons available (10 in the full tank, 82.5 in the barrels). From Mile 30, we could travel an additional 92.5 gallons * 12 mpg = 1110 miles. This makes the total distance traveled from the breakdown point 30 miles + 1110 miles = 1140 miles. Since the base camp is only 800 miles away from the breakdown point, 1140 miles is more than sufficient to reach the destination.

The final answer is $\boxed{1140 \text{ miles, which is enough to reach the base camp}}$.",True,0,0,0

169,"Question: Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.
We were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?
 Hint: Find numbers who do not have a duplicate that will be deleted",Find numbers who do not have a duplicate that will be deleted,"It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.
Hence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.
Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90. These 90 id's will not have a corresponding number when written in reverse order.
Secondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order. For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.
Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.
Therefore total number of valid employee id's possible = 90 + 90 + 360 = 540.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

 Hint: Two of the prices should add to the third price and multiply to 2 to produce equality",Two of the prices should add to the third price and multiply to 2 to produce equality,"£2.85*£1.60*£1.25= £5.70
£2.85+£1.60+£1.25=£5.70",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let the prices of the three magazines be $x, y$, and $z$ in pounds.
According to the problem statement, the sum of the prices is £5.70, and the product of the prices is also £5.70.
This gives us two equations:
1) $x + y + z = 5.70$
2) $x \times y \times z = 5.70$

We are given a hint: ""Two of the prices should add to the third price and multiply to 2 to produce equality"".
Let's assume, without loss of generality, that two of the prices, say $x$ and $y$, add up to the third price $z$. So, $x + y = z$.
The hint also says these two prices ""multiply to 2"". This suggests their product is 2, i.e., $x \times y = 2$. The phrase ""to produce equality"" relates this condition back to the original problem's structure, as we will see.

Let's use the assumption $x + y = z$ to simplify the original equations:
Substitute $x + y = z$ into equation (1):
$(x + y) + z = 5.70$
$z + z = 5.70$
$2z = 5.70$
$z = \frac{5.70}{2} = 2.85$

So, one of the prices is £2.85.

Now substitute $x + y = z$ into equation (2):
$(x \times y) \times z = 5.70$
We already found that $z = 2.85$, so substitute this value:
$(x \times y) \times 2.85 = 5.70$
Now we can solve for the product $x \times y$:
$x \times y = \frac{5.70}{2.85}$
To calculate this fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 100 to work with integers:
$x \times y = \frac{570}{285}$
We can see that $570 = 2 \times 285$.
$x \times y = \frac{2 \times 285}{285} = 2$

So, the product of the other two prices is 2. This confirms the second part of the hint, that the two prices that add to the third must multiply to 2. This property ($xy=2$) arises directly from the original problem's condition ($x+y+z=xyz=5.70$) combined with the hint's condition ($x+y=z$). The ""equality"" produced by the multiplication to 2 refers to the consistency with the original equations.

Now we have a system of equations for the two prices $x$ and $y$:
$x + y = z = 2.85$
$x \times y = 2$

We need to find two numbers whose sum is 2.85 and whose product is 2. These two numbers are the roots of a quadratic equation $t^2 - (x+y)t + xy = 0$.
Substituting the values we found:
$t^2 - 2.85t + 2 = 0$

We can solve this quadratic equation for $t$ using the quadratic formula: $t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=1$, $b=-2.85$, and $c=2$.
$t = \frac{-(-2.85) \pm \sqrt{(-2.85)^2 - 4(1)(2)}}{2(1)}$
$t = \frac{2.85 \pm \sqrt{8.1225 - 8}}{2}$
$t = \frac{2.85 \pm \sqrt{0.1225}}{2}$

Now we need to calculate the square root of 0.1225. We can write $0.1225 = \frac{1225}{10000}$.
$\sqrt{0.1225} = \sqrt{\frac{1225}{10000}} = \frac{\sqrt{1225}}{\sqrt{10",True,0,0,0

If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.
If N=5 and A=1, then E=9. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
If N=2 and A=4, then E=6. R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.
If N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.
If N=2, then since R cannot be 5, R=8, L=5, and I=7.
If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.
Since 1+S+T equals 5 or 15, S+T equals 4 or 14. If S+T=14, then S and T must be 5 and 9, or 6 and 8, in some order. But each of our three scenarios has a letter for at least one of 5 and 9, as well as one for 8. So S+T=4, S and T are 1 and 3 in some order, and O+S=12.
If S=1, then O=11. But since each letter represents only one digit, S=3, T=1, and O=9.
If N=5, then A=1. But since T=1, this cannot work.
If N=4, then I=9. But since O=9, this cannot work.
We are left with one possible scenario:
T=1, N=2, S=3, A=4, L=5, E=6, I=7, R=8, and O=9.

Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).

b + s + f = 120 - 89 = 31",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let B be the cost of one burger, S be the cost of one shake, and F be the cost of one order of fries.
Based on the information given, we can set up the following system of linear equations:

1) The cost for 3 burgers, 7 shakes, and one order of fries is $120:
3B + 7S + F = 120

2) The cost for 4 burgers, 10 shakes, and one order of fries is $164.50:
4B + 10S + F = 164.50

We want to find the cost of an ordinary meal, which is one burger, one shake, and one order of fries. This is the value of B + S + F.

We have a system of two equations with three variables. We are looking for the value of a specific linear combination of the variables (B + S + F). The hint suggests we might be able to find this combination directly without solving for the individual prices of B, S, and F.

Let's try to find coefficients, say $k_1$ and $k_2$, such that a linear combination of Equation 1 and Equation 2 results in an equation with coefficients of 1 for B, S, and F on the left side.
So, we want to find $k_1$ and $k_2$ such that:
$k_1(3B + 7S + F) + k_2(4B + 10S + F) = 1B + 1S + 1F$

Expanding the left side, we get:
$(3k_1 + 4k_2)B + (7k_1 + 10k_2)S + (k_1 + k_2)F$

To match the coefficients of B, S, and F on the right side (which are all 1), we set up a new system of equations for $k_1$ and $k_2$:
a) $3k_1 + 4k_2 = 1$ (matching coefficients of B)
b) $7k_1 + 10k_2 = 1$ (matching coefficients of S)
c) $k_1 + k_2 = 1$ (matching coefficients of F)

We can solve this system for $k_1$ and $k_2$. Let's use equations (a) and (c).
From equation (c), we can express $k_2$ as $k_2 = 1 - k_1$.
Substitute this into equation (a):
$3k_1 + 4(1 - k_1) = 1$
$3k_1 + 4 - 4k_1 = 1$
$-k_1 + 4 = 1$
$-k_1 = 1 - 4$
$-k_1 = -3$
$k_1 = 3$

Now substitute the value of $k_1$ back into the expression for $k_2$:
$k_2 = 1 - k_1 = 1 - 3 = -2$

So, the values for the coefficients are $k_1 = 3$ and $k_2 = -2$.

We should verify if these values also satisfy equation (b):
$7k_1 + 10k_2 = 7(3) + 10(-2) = 21 - 20 = 1$.
Yes, the values $k_1=3$ and $k_2=-2$ satisfy all three conditions simultaneously.

Now, we apply this linear combination to the original equations. We multiply Equation 1 by $k_1=3$ and Equation 2 by $k_2=-2$ and add the results:
$3 \times (3B + 7S + F) + (-2) \times (4B + 10S + F) = 3 \times 120 + (-2) \times 164.50$

Let's compute the left side:
$(9B + 21S + 3F) + (-8B - 20S - 2F)$
$= (9B - 8B) + (21S - 20S) + (3F - 2F)$
$= B + S + F$

This confirms that the left side is indeed the cost of one burger, one shake, and one order of fries.

Now let's compute the right side:
$3 \times 120 - 2 \times 164.50$
$= 360 - 329$
$= 31$

So, the cost of one burger, one shake, and one order of fries is $31.

This method allowed us to find the desired cost directly without needing to find the individual prices of B, S, and F. The fact that there are infinitely many possible combinations of (B, S, F) that satisfy the original equations (as confirmed by the calculation B + 3S = 44.50 and 2S - F = 13.50 derived from the original system, which are two independent equations with three variables) reinforces why the problem is posed to ask for the cost of the combination B + S + F, which is uniquely determined.

The final answer is $\boxed{31}$.",True,1,0,0

Z=96",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $T_k$ be the total score of the team at the end of the $k$-th quarter, for $k=1, 2, 3, 4$. The final score is $T_4$.
Let $S_k$ be the points scored by the team in the $k$-th quarter, for $k=1, 2, 3, 4$.

The total score at the end of quarter $k$ is the sum of the total score at the end of the previous quarter and the points scored in quarter $k$. That is, $T_k = T_{k-1} + S_k$ for $k=2, 3, 4$. The score at the end of the first quarter is simply the points scored in the first quarter, so $T_1 = S_1$.

We are given the following information:
1. Their score at the end of the 1st was 27. So, $T_1 = 27$.
2. In the 2nd quarter, they scored 1/2 of their score at the end of the 2nd, less 1. So, $S_2 = \frac{1}{2} T_2 - 1$.
3. In the 3rd quarter, they scored 1/3 of their score at the end of the 3rd, less 2. So, $S_3 = \frac{1}{3} T_3 - 2$.
4. In the 4th quarter, they scored 1/4 of the total points which they scored in the game (which is $T_4$), less 3. So, $S_4 = \frac{1}{4} T_4 - 3$.

We are asked to find the final score, $T_4$. The hint suggests starting at the beginning, which means starting with the information about the first quarter.

Step 1: Use the information about the 1st quarter.
We are given $T_1 = 27$.

Step 2: Use the information about the 2nd quarter.
We know that the total score at the end of the 2nd quarter is $T_2 = T_1 + S_2$.
We are given the relationship $S_2 = \frac{1}{2} T_2 - 1$.
Substitute this expression for $S_2$ into the equation for $T_2$:
$T_2 = T_1 + (\frac{1}{2} T_2 - 1)$.
Now, substitute the value of $T_1 = 27$:
$T_2 = 27 + \frac{1}{2} T_2 - 1$.
To find $T_2$, rearrange the equation to gather terms involving $T_2$:
$T_2 - \frac{1}{2} T_2 = 27 - 1$
$\frac{1}{2} T_2 = 26$.
Multiply both sides by 2:
$T_2 = 2 \times 26 = 52$.
The score at the end of the 2nd quarter was 52.

Step 3: Use the information about the 3rd quarter.
We know that the total score at the end of the 3rd quarter is $T_3 = T_2 + S_3$.
We are given the relationship $S_3 = \frac{1}{3} T_3 - 2$.
Substitute this expression for $S_3$ into the equation for $T_3$:
$T_3 = T_2 + (\frac{1}{3} T_3 - 2)$.
Now, substitute the value of $T_2 = 52$:
$T_3 = 52 + \frac{1}{3} T_3 - 2$.
To find $T_3$, rearrange the equation to gather terms involving $T_3$:
$T_3 - \frac{1}{3} T_3 = 52 - 2$
$\frac{2}{3} T_3 = 50$.
Multiply both sides by $\frac{3}{2}$:
$T_3 = \frac{3}{2} \times 50 = 3 \times 25 = 75$.
The score at the end of the 3rd quarter was 75.

Step 4: Use the information about the 4th quarter.
We know that the total score at the end of the 4th quarter is $T_4 = T_3 + S_4$. This is the final score.
We are given the relationship $S_4 = \frac{1}{4} T_4 - 3$.
Substitute this expression for $S_4$ into the equation for $T_4$:
$T_4 = T_3 + (\frac{1}{4} T_4 - 3)$.
Now, substitute the value of $T_3 = 75$:
$T_4 = 75 + \frac{1}{4} T_4 - 3$.
To find $T_4$, rearrange the equation to gather terms involving $T_4$:
$T_4 - \frac{1}{4} T_4 = 75 - 3$
$\frac{3}{4} T_4 = 72$.
Multiply both sides by $\frac{4}{3}$:
$T_4 = \frac{4}{3} \times 72 = 4 \times 24 = 96$.
The score at the end of the 4th quarter was 96.

Thus, the final score of the game was 96.

We can check the points scored in each quarter:
$S_1 = T_1 = 27$.
$S_2 = T_2 - T_1 = 52 - 27 = 25$. Check condition: $\frac{1}{2} T_2 - 1 = \frac{1}{2}(52) - 1 = 26 - 1 = 25$. Correct.
$S_3 = T_3 - T_2 = 75 - 52 = 23$. Check condition: $\frac{1}{3} T_3 - 2 = \frac{1}{3}(75) - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23$. Correct.
$S_4 = T_4 - T_3 = 96 - 75 = 21$. Check condition: $\frac{1}{4} T_4 - 3 = \frac{1}{4}(96) - 3 = 24 - 3 = 21$. Correct.
The total score is $S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4 = 27 + 25 + 23 + 21 = 96$, which matches $T_4$.

The final answer is $\boxed{96}$.",True,1,0,0

Kurt finally gave in, and agreed to go in with Rod on a minimum special order of the multi-colored treats.  When the box arrived, they divided the bounty as originally planned.
""Interesting,"" Kurt noted, ""that the number of Rnkfurers you got is the same integer as my percentage.""
Rod did a little mental math.  ""You're right,"" he noted, ""and I think that's the lowest pair of integers we could do that with.""
""Maybe; the next largest set is trivial.  50 Rnkfurers each, and then we'd each have the percentage the other guy got: 50% and 50 Rnkfurers each.""

5 = H
6 = B
7 = E
8 = C
42*2=84
31*2=62
5*7=35
4*2 = 8
Solution: (From 2: means 2nd line etc:)
From 2:  G=1 because A*G = A (A is not 5, because then from 1, F should also be 5)
From 4: F*A has to be a single number so it can only be 2*3 or 2*4 (or vice versa) and C can only be 6 or 8
There are four possibilities here,
4*2 = 8
2*4 = 8
3*2 = 6  or
3*2 = 6
They would give from 1:
42*2 (=84)
24*4 (=92)
32*2 (=64)  or
23*3 (=69)
Can't be 2*4 or 3*2 (because 92 and 69 are not possible), so
A=2
From 2: B is twice something, so it can only be 4 6 or 8 (not 2 because it's already known)
D is half 4 6 or 8, so it can only be 2, 3, or 4

We are given the following equations:
1) FA * A = CF
2) DG * A = BA
3) H * E = DH
4) F * A = C

These equations involve two-digit numbers represented by concatenation of letters (e.g., FA = 10*F + A). Let's rewrite the equations using this notation:
1) (10*F + A) * A = 10*C + F
2) (10*D + G) * A = 10*B + A
3) H * E = 10*D + H
4) F * A = C

We are given the hint that G = 1.
The set of used digits now includes 1. The remaining digits {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} must be assigned to the remaining letters A, B, C, D, E, F, H.

Substitute G = 1 into the equations:
1) (10*F + A) * A = 10*C + F
2) (10*D + 1) * A = 10*B + A
3) H * E = 10*D + H
4) F * A = C

From equation 4), we have C = F * A.
Since C is a single digit from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, F and A must be distinct digits from {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} (since G=1, F and A cannot be 1, and F cannot equal A). Also, C cannot be 1.
Possible pairs (F, A) and their product C (F, A, C must be distinct and not 1):
- If F=2, A=3, C=F*A = 2*3 = 6. (F, A, C) = (2, 3, 6). Used digits so far: {F=2, A=3, C=6, G=1}. Set {1, 2, 3, 6}. Remaining {4, 5, 7, 8}.
- If F=2, A=4, C=F*A = 2*4 = 8. (F, A, C) = (2, 4, 8). Used digits so far: {F=2, A=4, C=8, G=1}. Set {1, 2, 4, 8}. Remaining {3, 5, 6, 7}.
- If F=3, A=2, C=F*A = 3*2 = 6. (F, A, C) = (3, 2, 6). Used digits so far: {F=3, A=2, C=6, G=1}. Set {1, 2, 3, 6}. Same set as (2,3,6).
- If F=4, A=2, C=F*A = 4*2 = 8. (F, A, C) = (4, 2, 8). Used digits so far: {F=4, A=2, C=8, G=1}. Set {1, 2, 4, 8}. Same set as (2,4,8).
Any other combination of distinct F, A from {2..8} results in C > 8 or C=1.

Now, let's test these possibilities using equation 1): (10*F + A) * A = 10*C + F.
Case 1: (F, A, C) = (2, 3, 6).
(10*2 + 3) * 3 = 10*6 + 2
23 * 3 = 62
69 = 62 (False)

Case 2: (F, A, C) = (3, 2, 6).
(10*3 + 2) * 2 = 10*6 + 3
32 * 2 = 63
64 = 63 (False)

Case 3: (F, A, C) = (2, 4, 8).
(10*2 + 4) * 4 = 10*8 + 2
24 * 4 = 82
96 = 82 (False)

Case 4: (F, A, C) = (4, 2, 8).
(10*4 + 2) * 2 = 10*8 + 4
42 * 2 = 84
84 = 84 (True)

So, the only valid combination for (F, A, C) is (4, 2, 8), given G=1.
Current assignments: F=4, A=2, C=8, G=1.
Used digits: {1, 2, 4, 8}.
Remaining digits for B, D, E, H: {3, 5, 6, 7}.

Now use equation 2): (10*D + G) * A = 10*B + A.
Substitute A=2 and G=1:
(10*D + 1) * 2 = 10*B + 2
20*D + 2 = 10*B + 2
20*D = 10*B
B = 2*D

D and B must be distinct digits from {3, 5, 6, 7}.
Let's check possible values for D from this set:
- If D = 3, B = 2 * 3 = 6. D=3 and B=6 are distinct and in {3, 5, 6, 7}. This is a valid possibility.
- If D = 5, B = 2 * 5 = 10. Not a single digit. Invalid.
- If D = 6, B = 2 * 6 = 12. Not a single digit. Invalid.
- If D = 7, B = 2 * 7 = 14. Not a single digit. Invalid.

Thus, D=3 and B=6 is the only valid assignment from equation 2.
Current assignments: F=4, A=2, C=8, G=1, D=3, B=6.
Used digits: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}.
Remaining digits for E and H: {5, 7}.

Finally, use equation 3): H * E = 10*D + H.
Substitute D=3:
H * E = 10*3 + H
H * E = 30 + H
H * E - H = 30
H * (E - 1) = 30

H and E must be distinct digits from {5, 7}.
Let's check the possible pairs for (H, E) from {5, 7}:
Case 5.1: H = 5, E = 7.
Check H * (E - 1) = 30:
5 * (7 - 1) = 5 * 6 = 30. This is true.

Case 5.2: H = 7, E = 5.
Check H * (E - 1) = 30:
7 * (5 - 1) = 7 * 4 = 28. This is false.

So, H=5 and E=7 is the only valid assignment from equation 3.

We have now assigned all letters:
A = 2
B = 6
C = 8
D = 3
E = 7
F = 4
G = 1
H = 5

Let's check if all assigned digits are distinct and belong to the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.
The assigned digits are {2, 6, 8, 3, 7, 4, 1, 5}. This is exactly the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. All digits are distinct and within the required range.

We have already checked that these values satisfy the equations during the derivation process.
1) FA * A = 42 * 2 = 84. CF = 84. (Correct)
2) DG * A = 31 * 2 = 62. BA = 62. (Correct)
3) H * E = 5 * 7 = 35. DH = 35. (Correct)
4) F * A = 4 * 2 = 8. C = 8. (Correct)

He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?
 Hint: You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, I will solve this problem step-by-step using the hint provided and explaining each part of the reasoning.

**Step 1: Define variables and represent the problem visually.**

Let the length of the railway bridge be L kilometers.
The bridge connects location A and location B. We can think of A as the start and B as the end of the bridge.
The man starts at a point M on the bridge.
The man is 3/8 the distance across from A. This means the distance from A to the man (AM) is (3/8)L.
The distance from the man to B (MB) is L - (3/8)L = (5/8)L.

Let the man's running speed be Vm (in kph). This is what we need to find.
Let the train's speed be Vt. We are given Vt = 80 kph.

The train is approaching from A's side. When the man hears the train and decides to run, let's assume the train is at a distance D from A. Since it's approaching from A's side, it's coming from the direction of A towards B. The statement ""If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A"" is the crucial piece of information about the train's starting position relative to the man's decision time. It implies that if the man runs towards A, the train will arrive at A at the exact same moment the man does.

Let's draw a simple diagram:
A -------- M -------- B
|--(3/8)L--|---(5/8)L---|
|---------- L ----------|

The train is approaching from the left (A's side). Let its initial position be T0. The distance T0 to A is D.
T0 -------- A -------- M -------- B
|----- D -----|--(3/8)L--|---(5/8)L---|

**Step 2: Analyze the first scenario: The man runs back to A.**

The man is at M, and he runs towards A. The distance he runs is AM = (3/8)L.
Let t1 be the time it takes for the man to run from M to A.
Using the formula Distance = Rate × Time (D=RT) for the man:
(3/8)L = Vm * t1
So, t1 = (3/8)L / Vm.

In this scenario, the man meets the train at A. This means the train travels from its initial position T0 to A in the same time t1.
The distance the train travels is D.
Using D=RT for the train:
D = Vt * t1
Since Vt = 80 kph, we have:
D = 80 * t1

Now, substitute the expression for t1 from the man's movement into the train's movement equation:
D = 80 * ((3/8)L / Vm)
D = (80 * 3 / 8) * (L / Vm)
D = 30 * (L / Vm)  (Equation 1)
This equation relates the train's initial distance D, the bridge length L, and the man's speed Vm.

**Step 3: Analyze the second scenario: The man runs to B.**

The man is at M, and he runs towards B. The distance he runs is MB = (5/8)L.
Let t2 be the time it takes for the man to run from M to B.
Using D=RT for the man:
(5/8)L = Vm * t2
So, t2 = (5/8)L / Vm.

In this scenario, the train overtakes the man at B. This means the train also travels from its initial position T0 to B in the same time t2.
The total distance the train travels is the distance from T0 to A plus the distance from A to B, which is D + L.
Using D=RT for the train:
D + L = Vt * t2
Since Vt = 80 kph, we have:
D + L = 80 * t2

Now, substitute the expression for t2 from the man's movement into this train equation:
D + L = 80 * ((5/8)L / Vm)
D + L = (80 * 5 / 8) * (L / Vm)
D + L = 50 * (L / Vm)  (Equation 2)
This equation relates the train's initial distance D, the bridge length L, and the man's speed Vm for the second scenario.

**Step 4: Solve the system of equations.**

We have two equations from the two scenarios:
1) D = 30 L / Vm
2) D + L = 50 L / Vm

We want to find Vm. Notice that both equations contain D and L. The hint mentioned that we won't need exact distances L or D. This suggests we can eliminate them.

Substitute the expression for D from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
(30 L / Vm) + L = 50 L / Vm

Now, we need to solve this equation for Vm. Notice that every term contains L. Since L represents the length of the bridge, L must be a positive value (L > 0). We can safely divide the entire equation by L:
(30 / Vm) + 1 = 50 / Vm

**Step 5: Solve for Vm.**

Rearrange the equation to isolate Vm:
1 = 50 / Vm - 30 / Vm
1 = (50 - 30) / Vm
1 = 20 / Vm

Now, multiply both sides by Vm:
Vm * 1 = 20
Vm = 20

The man's running speed is 20 kph.

**Step 6: Verify the answer (optional but recommended).**

Let Vm = 20 kph and Vt = 80 kph. Let L be any positive length, say L = 8 km (this makes the 3/8 and 5/8 distances simpler).
Man's initial position is 3/8 * 8 km = 3 km from A. He is 5 km from B.

Scenario 1: Man runs to A (3 km).
Time taken by man t1 = Distance / Speed = 3 km / 20 kph = 3/20 hours.
Train meets man at A at time t1. Train travels from its starting point (D behind A) to A.
D = Vt * t1 = 80 kph * (3/20) hours = (80 * 3 / 20) km = (4 * 3) km = 12 km.
So, the train starts 12 km behind A.

Scenario 2: Man runs to B (5 km).
Time taken by man t2 = Distance / Speed = 5 km / 20 kph = 5/20 hours = 1/4 hours.
Train meets man at B at time t2. Train travels from its starting point (12 km behind A) to B.
The distance from the train's starting point to B is D + L = 12 km + 8 km = 20 km.
Time taken by train = Distance / Speed = 20 km / 80 kph = 20/80 hours = 1/4 hours.
This matches the time taken by the man (t2 = 1/4 hours).

The calculation holds true for an example length L=8 km and the derived speed Vm=20 kph. The fact that L cancelled out in the derivation confirms the hint that the exact distance is not needed. The speed of the man is indeed 20 kph.

The man's speed is 1/4 of the train's speed. This ratio is directly related to the man's position on the bridge. He is at the (3/8) point. If he runs back, he covers 3 units (of 1/8L). If he runs forward, he covers 5 units. The ratio of these distances is 3:5. The times are in the same ratio (t1:t2 = 3:5). The train covers distance D in time t1 and D+L in time t2. The difference in train's distance (D+L - D = L) is covered in time (t2-t1). Since t1=(3/8)L/Vm and t2=(5/8)L/Vm, the times are proportional to 3/8 and 5/8. Let t1 = (3/8) T and t2 = (5/8) T for some total time unit T related to L/Vm.
D = Vt * (3/8)T
D + L = Vt * (5/8)T
L = Vt * (5/8)T - Vt * (3/8)T = Vt * (2/8)T = Vt * (1/4)T.
Also, T = L/Vm from (5/8)L/Vm = (5/8)T => L/Vm = T * (5/8)/(5/8) or more directly, let T = L/Vm. Then t1=(3/8)T, t2=(5/8)T.
L = Vt * (1/4) * (L/Vm) => 1 = (Vt/Vm) * (1/4) => Vm/Vt = 1/4. This confirms the ratio method derived in thought process.

The reasoning is consistent and leads to a single value for the man's speed.

Final answer structure:
1. State variables and given info.
2. Set up equations for scenario 1 (run to A).
3. Set up equations for scenario 2 (run to B).
4. Solve the system of equations by eliminating D and L.

Final check on the question formatting and constraints:
- Spell out entire reasoning steps. Done.
- Output final answer in ""Final answer: "" format. Will do.
- Excellent mathematician, perfect logic, patient, long chains of reasoning. Hopefully demonstrated.

The problem is a classic relative speed puzzle, and the solution correctly utilizes the relationship between distance, rate, and time under different conditions. The key is recognizing that the time taken by the man in each scenario is the same as the time taken by the train to reach the respective meeting points, and that the length of the bridge cancels out.

One final thought: what if the train starts at A?
If the train starts at A (D=0) when the man is at M ((3/8)L from A):
Scenario 1 (Man runs to A): Man covers (3/8)L. Time t1 = (3/8)L/Vm. Train covers 0 distance to A. This doesn't make sense for a moving train meeting the man at A. This confirms the train must start behind A (D > 0).

What if the train is already past A and between A and M when the man hears it?
Let the train be at distance x from A, where 0 < x < (3/8)L.
Scenario 1 (Man runs to A): Man covers (3/8)L. Time t1 = (3/8)L/Vm. Train covers distance x to reach A. x = Vt * t1 = Vt * (3/8)L/Vm.
Scenario 2 (Man runs to B): Man covers (5/8)L. Time t2 = (5/8)L/Vm. Train covers distance (L-x) to reach B. L-x = Vt * t2 = Vt * (5/8)L/Vm.
Subtracting the first train equation from the second:
(L-x) - x = Vt * (5/8)L/Vm - Vt * (3/8)L/Vm
L - 2x = Vt * (2/8)L/Vm = Vt * (1/4)L/Vm
L - 2 * (Vt * (3/8)L/Vm) = Vt * (1/4)L/Vm
L - Vt * (6/8)L/Vm = Vt * (1/4)L/Vm
L - Vt * (3/4)L/Vm = Vt * (1/4)L/Vm
Divide by L:
1 - (3/4) * (Vt/Vm) = (1/4) * (Vt/Vm)
1 = (1/4) * (Vt/Vm) + (3/4) * (Vt/Vm)
1 = (4/4) * (Vt/Vm)
1 = Vt/Vm
Vm = Vt

If the train starts *between* A and M, the man's speed must be equal to the train's speed. But the problem states he hears it ""approaching *behind* him (from A's side)"", which strongly implies the train is coming from the direction of A and is not yet at his position M, and probably not even at A based on the ""meet at A"" condition. The standard interpretation of this class of problem implies the train is coming from *before* A. My initial assumption that the train starts at a distance D before A (meaning T0 is before A, D > 0) and the meeting at A implies the train reaches A *at the same time* the man does is the correct one based on the common structure of this riddle. The phrasing ""meet the train at A"" when running back to A means they arrive at A simultaneously, with the train having traveled from its starting point to A.

My initial interpretation and subsequent steps are consistent with the standard solution to this classic puzzle.

The phrasing ""approaching behind him (from A's side)"" means the train is coming from the direction of A. The man is walking A to B. So ""behind him"" confirms the train is coming from A towards the man's position M. This direction is consistent with the train starting before A (D>0) or at A (D=0) or between A and M (x>0). The conditions ""meet at A"" and ""meet at B"" are the key. The ""meet at A"" condition means train reaches A when man reaches A. If man runs from M to A, he takes time t1. If train starts at A, it takes 0 time to reach A, implying t1=0, which is not possible for a moving man and a non-zero length AM. So the train *must* start before A, and travel distance D to reach A in time t1.

The interpretation where the train starts at D before A is the correct one.

Final Answer structure is ready.

```
Let L be the length of the bridge from A to B.
The man is at a point M, such that his distance from A is AM = (3/8)L, and his distance from B is MB = L - (3/8)L = (5/8)L.
Let Vm be the man's running speed and Vt be the train's speed. We are given Vt = 80 kph.
The train is approaching from A's side. Let's assume that at the moment the man hears the train and starts running, the train is at a distance D before point A.

Scenario 1: The man runs back to A.
The man runs from M to A, covering a distance of (3/8)L.
Let t1 be the time taken by the man.
Using the formula Distance = Rate × Time (D=RT):
(3/8)L = Vm * t1
So, t1 = (3/8)L / Vm.

The problem states that if he runs back to A, he meets the train at A. This means the train also reaches point A at time t1.
The train travels the distance D from its starting point to A.
Using D=RT for the train:
D = Vt * t1
Substitute the expression for t1:
D = 80 * ((3/8)L / Vm)
D = (80 * 3 / 8) * (L / Vm)
D = 30 L / Vm (Equation 1)

Scenario 2: The man runs to B.
The man runs from M to B, covering a distance of (5/8)L.
Let t2 be the time taken by the man.
Using D=RT for the man:
(5/8)L = Vm * t2
So, t2 = (5/8)L / Vm.

The problem states that if he runs to B, the train overtakes him at B. This means the train also reaches point B at time t2.
The train travels from its starting point (distance D before A) to B. The total distance is D + L.
Using D=RT for the train:
D + L = Vt * t2
Substitute the expression for t2:
D + L = 80 * ((5/8)L / Vm)
D + L = (80 * 5 / 8) * (L / Vm)
D + L = 50 L / Vm (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) D = 30 L / Vm
2) D + L = 50 L / Vm

We can solve this system for Vm. Substitute the expression for D from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
(30 L / Vm) + L = 50 L / Vm

Notice that the term L appears in every part of the equation. Since L represents the length of the bridge, L must be greater than 0. We can divide the entire equation by L:
30 / Vm + 1 = 50 / Vm

Now, solve for Vm. Subtract 30 / Vm from both sides:
1 = 50 / Vm - 30 / Vm
1 = (50 - 30) / Vm
1 = 20 / Vm

Multiply both sides by Vm:
Vm = 20

The man's running speed is 20 kph.
```

This seems complete and correct according to the problem statement and hint.

```text
Final answer: 20 kph
```

Let me just verify that the question expects units in the final answer. ""How fast can the man run?"" and the train speed is given in kph, so the man's speed should also be in kph. Yes, 20 kph is the correct unit.

The hint ""You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to"" is perfectly addressed by L cancelling out.
The hint ""Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT"" is the core formula used in every step.
The hint ""I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively"" was done mentally or explicitly in the scratchpad.

The solution is robust.

The solution does not mention the drawing, but it is implicitly used in setting up the distances AM = (3/8)L and MB = (5/8)L and the train's path D and D+L. It's not strictly necessary to include the drawing in the final reasoning steps, as the distances are defined algebraically.

Consider if there are any edge cases or alternative interpretations. The phrasing ""He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side)"" and the subsequent conditions ""meet at A"" and ""overtake at B"" are standard for this type of riddle, and the interpretation used (train starts before A, arrives at A simultaneously with man, arrives at B simultaneously with man) is the standard one that makes the problem solvable with a unique, non-zero speed for the man.

Everything looks solid.

One final check of the prompt -",True,1,0,0
190,"Question: In a chess tournament conducted by the Romankachi World Chess Federation, every person played one game with every other person in the group. The total number of games that men played between themselves exceeded those played by men with women by 18. If there were 4 women on the tournament, totally how many games were played in the tournament?
 Hint: The only variable needed is the number of men--find different expressions for the total number of games between just men and the number of games between men and women",The only variable needed is the number of men--find different expressions for the total number of games between just men and the number of games between men and women,"Totally 120 games were played in the tournament.
Let N be the number of men in the tournament.
Then the number of games played by men between themselves
= N*(N-1)/2
The number of games played by men with women
= 4*N
(since there were 4 women in the tournament)
It is given that the total number of games that men played between themselves exceeded those played by men with women by 18.
Hence
N*(N-1)/2 - 4*N = 18
N*(N-1) - 8*N = 36
N*N - N - 8*N = 36
N^2 - 9*N - 36 = 0
Factorizing we get,
N^2 - 12*N + 3*N - 36 = 0
N*(N - 12) + 3*(N - 12) = 0
(N - 12)(N + 3) = 0
Hence N = 12 or -3 (not possible).
Hence the number of men in the chess tournament
= N = 12
Therefore the total number of people participating in the chess tournament = 12 + 4 = 16.
The total number of games played in the tournament
= T*(T-1)/2
= 16*15/2
= 120",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.

Step 1: Define variables and given information.
Let $M$ be the number of men in the tournament.
Let $W$ be the number of women in the tournament.
We are given that $W=4$.

Step 2: Determine the total number of people in the tournament.
The total number of people is $M+W = M+4$.

Step 3: Express the number of games between different groups of people.
In a tournament where every person plays one game with every other person, the number of games played between a specific group of players is the number of ways to choose 2 players from that group.
- The number of games played between men themselves ($G_{MM}$) is the number of ways to choose 2 men from $M$. This is given by the combination formula $\binom{M}{2}$.
$G_{MM} = \binom{M}{2} = \frac{M(M-1)}{2}$.

- The number of games played between women themselves ($G_{WW}$) is the number of ways to choose 2 women from $W$. This is given by $\binom{W}{2}$. Since $W=4$,
$G_{WW} = \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times (4-1)}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6$.

- The number of games played between men and women ($G_{MW}$) is the number of pairs consisting of one man and one woman. The number of ways to choose one man is $M$, and the number of ways to choose one woman is $W$. So, the number of pairs is $M \times W$. Since $W=4$,
$G_{MW} = M \times 4 = 4M$.

Step 4: Use the given condition to form an equation.
The problem states that ""The total number of games that men played between themselves exceeded those played by men with women by 18"".
This can be written as: $G_{MM} - G_{MW} = 18$.

Step 5: Substitute the expressions from Step 3 into the equation from Step 4.
Substitute the expressions for $G_{MM}$ and $G_{MW}$ in terms of $M$ into the equation:
$\frac{M(M-1)}{2} - 4M = 18$.

Step 6: Solve the equation for $M$.
To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
$2 \times \left(\frac{M(M-1)}{2}\right) - 2 \times (4M) = 2 \times 18$
$M(M-1) - 8M = 36$
$M^2 - M - 8M = 36$
$M^2 - 9M = 36$
Move all terms to one side to form a standard quadratic equation:
$M^2 - 9M - 36 = 0$.

Factor the quadratic equation. We look for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -9. These numbers are 3 and -12 (since $3 \times -12 = -36$ and $3 + (-12) = -9$).
So, the equation can be factored as:
$(M+3)(M-12) = 0$.

This equation gives two possible values for $M$:
$M+3 = 0 \implies M = -3$.
$M-12 = 0 \implies M = 12$.

Since $M$ represents the number of men, it must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, $M=-3$ is not a valid solution.
The number of men in the tournament is $M=12$.

Step 7: Calculate the total number of games played in the tournament.
The total number of games played is the number of games between all pairs of people. This is the number of ways to choose 2 people from the total number of people, $M+W$.
The total number of people is $M+W = 12+4 = 16$.
The total number of games is $\binom{16}{2}$.

Total games $= \binom{16}{2} = \frac{16 \times (16-1)}{2} = \frac{16 \times 15}{2} = \frac{240}{2} = 120$.

Alternatively, the total number of games is the sum of games within men, within women, and between men and women:
Total games $= G_{MM} + G_{WW} + G_{MW}$.
$G_{MM} = \binom{12}{2} = \frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66$.
$G_{WW} = 6$ (calculated in Step 3).
$G_{MW} = 4M = 4 \times 12 = 48$.
Total games $= 66 + 6 + 48 = 120$.

Both methods yield the same result.

Step 8: Verify the condition.
The condition is $G_{MM} - G_{MW} = 18$.
With $M=12$, $G_{MM} = 66$ and $G_{MW} = 48$.
$66 - 48 = 18$. The condition is satisfied.

The final answer is the total number of games played.

The final answer is: 120",True,1,0,0
191,"Question: There is a number.
1. If it is not a multiple of 4, then it is between 60 and 69.
2. If it is a multiple of 3 it is between 50 and 59.
3. If it is not a multiple of 6 it is between 70 and 79.
What is the number?
 Hint: Eliminate possibilities within 50-79",Eliminate possibilities within 50-79,76,GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let the number be $N$. We are given three conditions:
1. If $N$ is not a multiple of 4, then $60 \le N \le 69$. (Let this be $C_1$)
2. If $N$ is a multiple of 3, then $50 \le N \le 59$. (Let this be $C_2$)
3. If $N$ is not a multiple of 6, then $70 \le N \le 79$. (Let this be $C_3$)

We can analyze these conditions. A conditional statement ""If P, then Q"" is only false when P is true and Q is false. It is true in all other cases (P is false, or Q is true).

Let's denote the properties and ranges:
$P_4$: $N$ is a multiple of 4. $\neg P_4$: $N$ is not a multiple of 4.
$P_3$: $N$ is a multiple of 3. $\neg P_3$: $N$ is not a multiple of 3.
$P_6$: $N$ is a multiple of 6. $\neg P_6$: $N$ is not a multiple of 6.
$R_{50-59}$: $50 \le N \le 59$.
$R_{60-69}$: $60 \le N \le 69$.
$R_{70-79}$: $70 \le N \le 79$.

The conditions are:
$C_1: \neg P_4 \implies R_{60-69}$
$C_2: P_3 \implies R_{50-59}$
$C_3: \neg P_6 \implies R_{70-79}$

We can use the contrapositive of each statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement:
Contrapositive of $C_1$: $\neg R_{60-69} \implies \neg (\neg P_4)$, which is $\neg R_{60-69} \implies P_4$.
This means: If $N < 60$ or $N > 69$, then $N$ is a multiple of 4.

Contrapositive of $C_2$: $\neg R_{50-59} \implies \neg P_3$.
This means: If $N < 50$ or $N > 59$, then $N$ is not a multiple of 3.

Contrapositive of $C_3$: $\neg R_{70-79} \implies \neg (\neg P_6)$, which is $\neg R_{70-79} \implies P_6$.
This means: If $N < 70$ or $N > 79$, then $N$ is a multiple of 6.

The hint suggests eliminating possibilities within the range 50-79. Let's first see if the number must be within this range.
Consider $N < 50$.
$\neg R_{60-69}$ is true ($N < 60$). By contrapositive of $C_1$, $N$ must be a multiple of 4.
$\neg R_{50-59}$ is true ($N < 50$). By contrapositive of $C_2$, $N$ must not be a multiple of 3.
$\neg R_{70-79}$ is true ($N < 70$). By contrapositive of $C_3$, $N$ must be a multiple of 6.
So, if $N < 50$, $N$ must be a multiple of 4, not a multiple of 3, and a multiple of 6.
If $N$ is a multiple of 6, it is necessarily a multiple of 3. This contradicts the requirement that $N$ is not a multiple of 3.
Therefore, no number $N < 50$ can satisfy all conditions.

Consider $N > 79$.
$\neg R_{60-69}$ is true ($N > 69$). By contrapositive of $C_1$, $N$ must be a multiple of 4.
$\neg R_{50-59}$ is true ($N > 59$). By contrapositive of $C_2$, $N$ must not be a multiple of 3.
$\neg R_{70-79}$ is true ($N > 79$). By contrapositive of $C_3$, $N$ must be a multiple of 6.
So, if $N > 79$, $N$ must be a multiple of 4, not a multiple of 3, and a multiple of 6.
Again, if $N$ is a multiple of 6, it is necessarily a multiple of 3. This contradicts the requirement that $N$ is not a multiple of 3.
Therefore, no number $N > 79$ can satisfy all conditions.

The number must be in the range $50 \le N \le 79$. Let's examine the sub-ranges mentioned in the conditions.

Case 1: $50 \le N \le 59$ (i.e., $R_{50-59}$ is true).
$C_2: P_3 \implies R_{50-59}$. Since $R_{50-59}$ is true, this condition is always true for any $N$ in this range, regardless of whether $N$ is a multiple of 3.
$C_1: \neg P_4 \implies R_{60-69}$. Since $N$ is in $50 \le N \le 59$, $R_{60-69}$ is false. For $C_1$ to be true, the premise $\neg P_4$ must be false. This means $P_4$ must be true, so $N$ must be a multiple of 4.
$C_3: \neg P_6 \implies R_{70-79}$. Since $N$ is in $50 \le N \le 59$, $R_{70-79}$ is false. For $C_3$ to be true, the premise $\neg P_6$ must be false. This means $P_6$ must be true, so $N$ must be a multiple of 6.
For $N$ in $50 \le N \le 59$ to satisfy all conditions, it must be a multiple of 4 and a multiple of 6. A number is a multiple of 4 and 6 if and only if it is a multiple of lcm(4, 6) = 12.
The multiples of 12 are ..., 36, 48, 60, ... There are no multiples of 12 in the range 50-59.
So, no number in the range 50-59 satisfies all conditions.

Case 2: $60 \le N \le 69$ (i.e., $R_{60-69}$ is true).
$C_1: \neg P_4 \implies R_{60-69}$. Since $R_{60-69}$ is true, this condition is always true for any $N$ in this range, regardless of whether $N$ is a multiple of 4.
$C_2: P_3 \implies R_{50-59}$. Since $N$ is in $60 \le N \le 69$, $R_{50-59}$ is false. For $C_2$ to be true, the premise $P_3$ must be false. This means $N$ must not be a multiple of 3.
$C_3: \neg P_6 \implies R_{70-79}$. Since $N$ is in $60 \le N \le 69$, $R_{70-79}$ is false. For $C_3$ to be true, the premise $\neg P_6$ must be false. This means $P_6$ must be true, so $N$ must be a multiple of 6.
For $N$ in $60 \le N \le 69$ to satisfy all conditions, it must not be a multiple of 3 and it must be a multiple of 6. This is impossible, because any multiple of 6 is also a multiple of 3.
So, no number in the range 60-69 satisfies all conditions.

Case 3: $70 \le N \le 79$ (i.e., $R_{70-79}$ is true).
$C_3: \neg P_6 \implies R_{70-79}$. Since $R_{70-79}$ is true, this condition is always true for any $N$ in this range, regardless of whether $N$ is a multiple of 6.
$C_1: \neg P_4 \implies R_{60-69}$. Since $N$ is in $70 \le N \le 79$, $R_{60-69}$ is false. For $C_1$ to be true, the premise $\neg P_4$ must be false. This means $P_4$ must be true, so $N$ must be a multiple of 4.
$C_2: P_3 \implies R_{50-59}$. Since $N$ is in $70 \le N \le 79$, $R_{50-59}$ is false. For $C_2$ to be true, the premise $P_3$ must be false. This means $N$ must not be a multiple of 3.
For $N$ in $70 \le N \le 79$ to satisfy all conditions, it must be a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3.
Let's list multiples of 4 in the range 70-79: 72, 76.
Now let's check which of these are not multiples of 3:
72 is a multiple of 3 ($7+2=9$).
76 is not a multiple of 3 ($7+6=13$).
So, the only candidate number in this range is 76.

Let's verify $N=76$ against the original conditions:
1. If 76 is not a multiple of 4 (False), then $60 \le 76 \le 69$ (False). False $\implies$ False is True. Condition 1 holds.
2. If 76 is a multiple of 3 (False), then $50 \le 76 \le 59$ (False). False $\implies$ False is True. Condition 2 holds.
3. If 76 is not a multiple of 6 (True, $76 = 12 \times 6 + 4$), then $70 \le 76 \le 79$ (True). True $\implies$ True is True. Condition 3 holds.

Since all three conditions are satisfied for $N=76$, this is the number.

The final answer is $\boxed{76}$.",True,1,0,0

(7, 315)
(8, 480)
(9, 693)
(10, 960)
(11, 1287)

We are looking for a function $y = f(x)$ that describes this relationship. The hint suggests using a power of the input to get somewhere close to the output. Let's consider the powers of $x$.

Let's compute the first few powers of the inputs and compare them to the outputs:
For $x=7$: $x^2=49$, $x^3=343$. The output is $y=315$. $315$ is close to $343$. The difference is $343 - 315 = 28$.
For $x=8$: $x^2=64$, $x^3=512$. The output is $y=480$. $480$ is close to $512$. The difference is $512 - 480 = 32$.
For $x=9$: $x^2=81$, $x^3=729$. The output is $y=693$. $693$ is close to $729$. The difference is $729 - 693 = 36$.
For $x=10$: $x^2=100$, $x^3=1000$. The output is $y=960$. $960$ is close to $1000$. The difference is $1000 - 960 = 40$.
For $x=11$: $x^2=121$, $x^3=1331$. The output is $y=1287$. $1287$ is close to $1331$. The difference is $1331 - 1287 = 44$.

Let's denote the difference $d(x) = x^3 - y$. The sequence of differences for $x=7, 8, 9, 10, 11$ is $28, 32, 36, 40, 44$.
Let's look at the differences between consecutive terms in this sequence:
$32 - 28 = 4$
$36 - 32 = 4$
$40 - 36 = 4$
$44 - 40 = 4$
The common difference is constant at 4. This indicates that the difference $d(x)$ is a linear function of $x$ with a slope of 4.
Let $d(x) = mx + c$. The slope $m=4$. So $d(x) = 4x + c$.
We can use one of the points to find $c$. For $x=7$, $d(7) = 28$.
$28 = 4(7) + c$
$28 = 28 + c$
$c = 0$.
So, the difference is $d(x) = 4x$.

We have the relationship $x^3 - y = d(x)$, so $x^3 - y = 4x$.
We can rearrange this equation to express $y$ as a function of $x$:
$y = x^3 - 4x$.

Let's verify this formula with all the given input-output pairs:
For $x=7$: $y = 7^3 - 4(7) = 343 - 28 = 315$. (Correct)
For $x=8$: $y = 8^3 - 4(8) = 512 - 32 = 480$. (Correct)
For $x=9$: $y = 9^3 - 4(9) = 729 - 36 = 693$. (Correct)
For $x=10$: $y = 10^3 - 4(10) = 1000 - 40 = 960$. (Correct)
For $x=11$: $y = 11^3 - 4(11) = 1331 - 44 = 1287$. (Correct)

The formula $y = x^3 - 4x$ is consistent with all the given data.
We can also factor this expression: $y = x(x^2 - 4) = x(x-2)(x+2)$.
Let's check this form as well:
For $x=7$: $y = 7(7-2)(7+2) = 7 \times 5 \times 9 = 315$. (Correct)
For $x=8$: $y = 8(8-2)(8+2) = 8 \times 6 \times 10 = 480$. (Correct)
For $x=9$: $y = 9(9-2)(9+2) = 9 \times 7 \times 11 = 693$. (Correct)
For $x=10$: $y = 10(10-2)(10+2) = 10 \times 8 \times 12 = 960$. (Correct)
For $x=11$: $y = 11(11-2)(11+2) = 11 \times 9 \times 13 = 1287$. (Correct)

The function is $f(x) = x^3 - 4x$.
We need to find the output when the input is 20. We need to calculate $f(20)$.
$f(20) = 20^3 - 4(20)$
Calculate $20^3$: $20 \times 20 \times 20 = 400 \times 20 = 8000$.
Calculate $4(20)$: $4 \times 20 = 80$.
Now subtract: $f(20) = 8000 - 80 = 7920$.

Thus, when 20 goes in, 7920 comes out.

The final answer is $\boxed{7920}$.",True,1,0,0
194,"Question: Difficult Danny has acquired his nickname (and some other, less polite nicknames) due to the fact that, whenever he buys anything, he insists upon paying the exact amount, with precisely 100 pieces of currency. Danny wanted an xCube365 (it lasts 365 days before programmatically disabling itself, so that a new one must be purchased), the highly coveted gaming system that had just been released. It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?
 Hint: First, see if there is a denomination that is not used. If so, figure out which denomination that is","First, see if there is a denomination that is not used. If so, figure out which denomination that is","Can at least one of each denomination be used? That totals $186 with only 6 bills, plus at least $94 with the rest of the bills. This is too high. Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.
If a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities. So $100 bill is the denomination that is not used. We now know that at least one of each of the other bills is used. That totals $86 with 5 bills, leaving 95 bills to make the other $144.
There are only 4 ways to make $144 with these denominations, which are listed in order from $1 bills to $50 bills in each of these sets: {84,10,1,0,0}, {89,1,5,0,0}, {89,3,2,1,0}, {94,0,0,0,1}.

198,"Question: Detective Grant was inspecting the scene of the crime. The 50-year-old victim, Joe, had been poisoned by a candy containing cyanide. On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table. John, 46, was found with 5 candies the day after a 4-yr sentence had been turned over a week ago. Jim, 35, had gotten off a 5-yr sentence a few days ago, only to be found dead with 6 candies yesterday.
Grant puzzled over these cases for days, and then -boom- it hit him. There was a pattern in these murders! What pattern did Grant spot?
Each suspect ate a candy before they died.
Life expectancy when the murders were committed was 70 years.

The 23 criminals who got off their sentences, but did not die, chose pure candies.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here are the reasoning steps to identify the pattern:

Step 1: List the known data for each victim based on the provided hint.
We have the following information for each of the four victims:
-   Joe: Age = 50, Sentence = 2 years, Candies Left = 9
-   Jeff: Age = 30, Sentence = 10 years, Candies Left = 3
-   John: Age = 46, Sentence = 4 years, Candies Left = 5
-   Jim: Age = 35, Sentence = 5 years, Candies Left = 6

Step 2: Identify additional relevant information from the problem description.
-   The life expectancy when the murders were committed was 70 years.
-   Each victim ate one poisoned candy. This means the total number of candies involved in each murder is the number of candies left on the table plus the one the victim ate (Total Candies = Candies Left + 1).

Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Candies for each victim.
-   Joe: Total Candies = 9 + 1 = 10
-   Jeff: Total Candies = 3 + 1 = 4
-   John: Total Candies = 5 + 1 = 6
-   Jim: Total Candies = 6 + 1 = 7

Step 4: Consider how the Life Expectancy (LE = 70) might relate to the victim's age and other numbers. A common calculation involving life expectancy and current age is the remaining years of life (Years Remaining = LE - Age).
-   Joe: Years Remaining = 70 - 50 = 20
-   Jeff: Years Remaining = 70 - 30 = 40
-   John: Years Remaining = 70 - 46 = 24
-   Jim: Years Remaining = 70 - 35 = 35

Step 5: Look for a pattern connecting the Years Remaining, Sentence Length, and Total Candies. Let's test potential mathematical relationships between these three values (Years Remaining, Sentence, Total Candies): (20, 2, 10), (40, 10, 4), (24, 4, 6), (35, 5, 7).

Let's try dividing the Years Remaining by the Sentence Length and compare it to the Total Candies.
-   For Joe: Years Remaining / Sentence = 20 / 2 = 10. This matches the Total Candies (10).
-   For Jeff: Years Remaining / Sentence = 40 / 10 = 4. This matches the Total Candies (4).
-   For John: Years Remaining / Sentence = 24 / 4 = 6. This matches the Total Candies (6).
-   For Jim: Years Remaining / Sentence = 35 / 5 = 7. This matches the Total Candies (7).

Step 6: Confirm the pattern. The pattern (Life Expectancy - Age) / Sentence = Candies Left + 1 holds true for all four victims.

Step 7: Articulate the discovered pattern. The pattern is a mathematical relationship between the victim's age, their prison sentence length, the life expectancy, and the total number of candies present at the crime scene.

The pattern Grant spotted is that the number of years remaining in the victim's life (calculated as 70 years minus their current age) divided by the length of their prison sentence equals the total number of candies involved in the murder (the number of candies found on the table plus the one the victim ate).

In mathematical terms, if LE = 70 (Life Expectancy), A = Age, S = Sentence Length, and C = Candies Left, the pattern is:
(LE - A) / S = C + 1

Final check of the pattern with the data:
-   Joe: (70 - 50) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10. Candies Left + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10. (10 = 10)
-   Jeff: (70 - 30) / 10 = 40 / 10 = 4. Candies Left + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4. (4 = 4)
-   John: (70 - 46) / 4 = 24 / 4 = 6. Candies Left + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6. (6 = 6)
-   Jim: (70 - 35) / 5 = 35 / 5 = 7. Candies Left + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7. (7 = 7)

The pattern is consistent across all cases.

Final answer: The pattern Grant spotted is that the number of years remaining in the victim's expected lifespan (70 minus their age) divided by the length of their prison sentence equals the total number of candies present at the crime scene (the number of candies left plus the one the victim ate). This can be expressed mathematically as: (70 - Age) / Sentence = Candies Left + 1.",True,1,0,0

Based on the information given, we can write the following system of linear equations:

1. A packet containing 1 pound of walnuts and 2 pounds of Brazil nuts costs £1.98.
   $1W + 2B = 1.98$ (Equation 1)

2. A packet containing 4 pounds of filberts and 1 pound of walnuts costs £2.48.
   $4F + 1W = 2.48$ (Equation 2)

3. A mixed packet containing 3 pounds of almonds, 1 pound of walnuts, and 1 pound of filberts costs £2.99.
   $3A + 1W + 1F = 2.99$ (Equation 3)

Mad Ade wants to find the cost of a packet containing 1 pound of each type of nut. This cost is represented by the expression $W + B + F + A$.

We have a system of 3 linear equations with 4 variables ($W, B, F, A$). In general, such a system has infinitely many solutions for the individual variables, which aligns with the hint that ""It is impossible to find the cost of each nut individually"". However, it may be possible to find a unique value for a specific linear combination of these variables, such as $W + B + F + A$.

Let's try to express the variables $B$, $F$, and $A$ in terms of $W$ using the given equations.

From Equation 1:
$2B = 1.98 - W$
$B = \frac{1.98 - W}{2} = 0.99 - 0.5W$

From Equation 2:
$4F = 2.48 - W$
$F = \frac{2.48 - W}{4} = 0.62 - 0.25W$

Now, substitute the expression for $F$ into Equation 3:
$3A + W + F = 2.99$
$3A + W + (0.62 - 0.25W) = 2.99$
$3A + W + 0.62 - 0.25W = 2.99$
$3A + 0.75W + 0.62 = 2.99$
$3A = 2.99 - 0.75W - 0.62$
$3A = 2.37 - 0.75W$
$A = \frac{2.37 - 0.75W}{3} = 0.79 - 0.25W$

Now we have expressions for $B$, $F$, and $A$ in terms of $W$:
$B = 0.99 - 0.5W$
$F = 0.62 - 0.25W$
$A = 0.79 - 0.25W$

We want to find the cost of a packet containing 1 pound of each nut, which is $W + B + F + A$. Let's substitute the expressions for $B$, $F$, and $A$ into this sum:
Cost $= W + B + F + A$
Cost $= W + (0.99 - 0.5W) + (0.62 - 0.25W) + (0.79 - 0.25W)$

Now, group the terms involving $W$ and the constant terms:
Cost $= (W - 0.5W - 0.25W - 0.25W) + (0.99 + 0.62 + 0.79)$

Calculate the sum of the coefficients of $W$:
$1 - 0.5 - 0.25 - 0.25 = 1 - (0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25) = 1 - 1.00 = 0$

Calculate the sum of the constant terms:
$0.99 + 0.62 + 0.79 = 1.61 + 0.79 = 2.40$

Substitute these values back into the expression for the cost:
Cost $= (0)W + 2.40$
Cost $= 2.40$

The cost of a packet containing 1 pound of each type of nut is £2.40. The fact that the term involving $W$ canceled out confirms that the value of the expression $W+B+F+A$ is uniquely determined by the given equations, even though the individual values of $W, B, F,$ and $A$ are not. This aligns with the hint provided.

The final answer is $\boxed{£2.40}$.",True,1,0,0
201,"Question: Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Snow, there lived the fair Princess Miyuki, who had always been fascinated by fairy tales and the stories of the wonders of the world. She believed that her sleeping, handsome prince was cursed to be one of the mummies in the pyramids of Egypt, and when she was done being Fantaghiro-saving-her-Romualdo, her prince would then build a beautiful palace as a monument of their love (which of course would be more beautiful than Taj Mahal) where both of them will live happily ever after...
So, you see, that's why Princess Miyuki had refused each and every love declaration or marriage proposal that came her way.
But of course, what's a story without the brave and wise heroic prince? Here comes Prince Hajikidama of the Marbles Kingdom. He's no mummy, but his brilliant(?) brain deduced that in order to win the princess' heart, he'd have to give her what she wanted most - her fantasy, and his token of understanding (her childish delusional nature).
In the end, labouring his mind's creativity department for all its worth, Prince Hajikidama decided that a 'Mountain of Love', reaching so high it collected the never-fallen-snow in Marbles Kingdom, might do the trick. That actually is a tetrahedral-shaped (pyramid with 4 equilateral triangular faces) crystallic marbles-made structure (like a giant pile of apples or oranges at a greengrocer's store) consisting of one marble crowning on the top layer, three on the next-to-top layer, six on the third layer, ten on the fourth layer, and so forth. If there are exactly 1,000,000 layers, specify the total number of marbles needed in the construction of entire mountain.
 Hint: Triangle numbers sum",Triangle numbers sum,"The formula is
S = n(n+1)(n+2)/6
so when n = 1,000,000
S = 166,667,166,667,000,000",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:

1.  **Understand the structure of the mountain:** The problem describes a tetrahedral-shaped structure made of marbles. It specifies the number of marbles in the first few layers:
    *   Layer 1: 1 marble
    *   Layer 2: 3 marbles
    *   Layer 3: 6 marbles
    *   Layer 4: 10 marbles
    and so forth.

2.  **Identify the pattern in the number of marbles per layer:** The sequence of marbles per layer (1, 3, 6, 10, ...) is the sequence of triangular numbers. The k-th triangular number, denoted as $T_k$, is the sum of the first k positive integers: $T_k = 1 + 2 + \dots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.
    *   For k=1: $T_1 = \frac{1(1+1)}{2} = \frac{1 \times 2}{2} = 1$. This matches Layer 1.
    *   For k=2: $T_2 = \frac{2(2+1)}{2} = \frac{2 \times 3}{2} = 3$. This matches Layer 2.
    *   For k=3: $T_3 = \frac{3(3+1)}{2} = \frac{3 \times 4}{2} = 6$. This matches Layer 3.
    *   For k=4: $T_4 = \frac{4(4+1)}{2} = \frac{4 \times 5}{2} = 10$. This matches Layer 4.
    So, the number of marbles in the k-th layer is indeed $T_k$.

3.  **Determine the total number of layers:** The problem states that there are exactly 1,000,000 layers. Let N be the total number of layers, so N = 1,000,000.

4.  **Express the total number of marbles as a sum:** The total number of marbles in the entire mountain is the sum of the marbles in each layer, from the first layer (k=1) up to the last layer (k=N).
    Total marbles = $\sum_{k=1}^{N} (\text{number of marbles in layer k}) = \sum_{k=1}^{N} T_k$.
    Substituting the formula for $T_k$, we get:
    Total marbles = $\sum_{k=1}^{N} \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.

5.  **Recognize the sum as a known mathematical sequence:** The sum of the first N triangular numbers is called the N-th tetrahedral number, denoted as $Te_N$. The formula for the N-th tetrahedral number is $Te_N = \frac{N(N+1)(N+2)}{6}$.
    We can derive this formula:
    $\sum_{k=1}^{N} \frac{k(k+1)}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{N} (k^2+k) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum_{k=1}^{N} k^2 + \sum_{k=1}^{N} k \right)$.
    Using the formulas for the sum of the first N integers ($\sum_{k=1}^{N} k = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}$) and the sum of the first N squares ($\sum_{k=1}^{N} k^2 = \frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6}$), we get:
    Total marbles = $\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6} + \frac{N(N+1)}{2} \right)$
    $= \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6} + \frac{3N(N+1)}{6} \right)$
    $= \frac{1}{2} \frac{N(N+1)}{6} ( (2N+1) + 3 )$
    $= \frac{N(N+1)}{12} (2N+4)$
    $= \frac{N(N+1) 2(N+2)}{12}$
    $= \frac{N(N+1)(N+2)}{6}$.
    The formula is confirmed.

6.  **Substitute the given number of layers into the formula:** We are given N = 1,000,000.
    Total marbles = $Te_{1000000} = \frac{1000000(1000000+1)(1000000+2)}{6}$.

7.  **Perform the calculation:**
    Total marbles = $\frac{1000000 \times 1000001 \times 1000002}{6}$.

8.  **Simplify the calculation:** We can divide one of the terms in the numerator by 6 to simplify the multiplication. Let's divide 1000002 by 6.
    $1000002 \div 6 = 166667$.

9.  **Rewrite the expression and calculate the product:**
    Total marbles = $1000000 \times 1000001 \times 166667$.
    First, calculate the product of 1000001 and 166667:
    $1000001 \times 166667 = (1000000 + 1) \times 166667$
    $= 1000000 \times 166667 + 1 \times 166667$
    $= 166667000000 + 166667$
    $= 166667166667$.

10. **Multiply the result by 1000000:**
    Total marbles = $166667166667 \times 1000000$.
    Multiplying by 1,000,000 (which is $10^6$) is equivalent to adding six zeros to the right of the number.
    Total marbles = $166667166667000000$.

11. **Format the final answer:** The result is 166,667,166,667,000,000.

202,"Question: What is the relationship between these 5 sets of numbers? 1, 1 ; 10, 4 ; 30, 12 ; 100, 16 ; 1000, 64.
 Hint: Bases",Bases,"The first number is base 4, the second base 10.( Base 4 has places 1, 4, 16, 64 and so on)",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's analyze the given sets of numbers and use the hint ""Bases"" to find the relationship.

The 5 sets of numbers are:
1.  (1, 1)
2.  (10, 4)
3.  (30, 12)
4.  (100, 16)
5.  (1000, 64)

Let's call the first number in each pair N1 and the second number N2. We are looking for a consistent rule that relates N1 and N2 across all pairs, using the concept of number bases.

Let's look at the pairs, focusing on the hint ""Bases"". The hint suggests N1 might be a number represented in a certain base, and N2 might be its value in another base (likely base 10, as that's our standard system).

Consider the second pair: (10, 4).
If N1 = 10 is interpreted as a number in some base `b`, its value is `1 * b^1 + 0 * b^0 = b`. If this value equals N2 = 4, then `b = 4`.

Let's test the hypothesis that N1 is a number in base 4, and N2 is its value in base 10.

1.  **Pair (1, 1):**
    *   Let N1 = 1 be a number in base 4 (written as 1₄).
    *   Convert 1₄ to base 10: 1 * 4⁰ = 1.
    *   N2 = 1. This matches.

2.  **Pair (10, 4):**
    *   Let N1 = 10 be a number in base 4 (written as 10₄).
    *   Convert 10₄ to base 10: 1 * 4¹ + 0 * 4⁰ = 4 + 0 = 4.
    *   N2 = 4. This matches.

3.  **Pair (30, 12):**
    *   Let N1 = 30 be a number in base 4 (written as 30₄). Note that the digits used (3 and 0) are valid digits in base 4 (0, 1, 2, 3).
    *   Convert 30₄ to base 10: 3 * 4¹ + 0 * 4⁰ = 12 + 0 = 12.
    *   N2 = 12. This matches.

4.  **Pair (100, 16):**
    *   Let N1 = 100 be a number in base 4 (written as 100₄). The digits used (1 and 0) are valid in base 4.
    *   Convert 100₄ to base 10: 1 * 4² + 0 * 4¹ + 0 * 4⁰ = 16 + 0 + 0 = 16.
    *   N2 = 16. This matches.

5.  **Pair (1000, 64):**
    *   Let N1 = 1000 be a number in base 4 (written as 1000₄). The digits used (1 and 0) are valid in base 4.
    *   Convert 1000₄ to base 10: 1 * 4³ + 0 * 4² + 0 * 4¹ + 0 * 4⁰ = 64 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 64.
    *   N2 = 64. This matches.

The hypothesis holds true for all 5 pairs. The first number in each pair is interpreted as a base-4 number, and the second number is its equivalent value in base 10.

The relationship between the 5 sets of numbers is that for each pair (N1, N2), N2 is the base-10 value of N1 when N1 is interpreted as a number in base 4.

Final check:
*   1 in base 4 is 1 in base 10. (1, 1) -> Correct.
*   10 in base 4 is 1*4 + 0 = 4 in base 10. (10, 4) -> Correct.
*   30 in base 4 is 3*4 + 0 = 12 in base 10. (30, 12) -> Correct.
*   100 in base 4 is 1*4² + 0*4 + 0 = 16 in base 10. (100, 16) -> Correct.
*   1000 in base 4 is 1*4³ + 0*4² + 0*4 + 0 = 64 in base 10. (1000, 64) -> Correct.

The relationship is consistent across all sets.

3) 169 = 12*12+5*5
4) 225 = 12*12+9*9",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is a step-by-step derivation of the common property:

1.  **Identify the given numbers:** The numbers are 25, 100, 169, and 225.
2.  **Identify the known common property:** The problem states that these numbers are perfect squares.
    *   25 = 5²
    *   100 = 10²
    *   169 = 13²
    *   225 = 15²
3.  **Analyze the hint:** The hint provides additional information about 25 and 100:
    *   25 = 16 + 9
    *   100 = 36 + 64
    Notice that the numbers on the right side of the equations (16, 9, 36, 64) are also perfect squares.
    *   16 = 4²
    *   9 = 3²
    *   36 = 6²
    *   64 = 8²
    So, the hint shows that:
    *   25 = 4² + 3²
    *   100 = 6² + 8²
    This suggests that the common property might be related to being expressible as the sum of two other perfect squares. Since 16, 9, 36, and 64 are all positive, the hint implies the sum of two *positive* perfect squares.
4.  **Test the hypothesis for the remaining numbers:** Let's check if 169 and 225 can also be expressed as the sum of two positive perfect squares.
    *   For 169: We need to find two positive perfect squares, a² and b², such that a² + b² = 169.
        Let's list perfect squares less than 169: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144.
        We can check sums:
        1 + 168 (168 not a square)
        4 + 165 (165 not a square)
        ...
        25 + 144 = 169. Yes, 25 = 5² and 144 = 12² are positive perfect squares.
        So, 169 = 5² + 12².
    *   For 225: We need to find two positive perfect squares, c² and d², such that c² + d² = 225.
        Let's list perfect squares less than 225: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196.
        We can check sums:
        1 + 224 (224 not a square)
        ...
        81 + 144 = 225. Yes, 81 = 9² and 144 = 12² are positive perfect squares.
        So, 225 = 9² + 12².
5.  **Confirm the common property:** All four numbers (25, 100, 169, 225) can be expressed as the sum of two positive perfect squares.
    *   25 = 4² + 3²
    *   100 = 6² + 8²
    *   169 = 5² + 12²
    *   225 = 9² + 12²
6.  **Verify that this property is not true for *all* perfect squares:** The question asks for a property *besides* being perfect squares. This means the property should not be true for every perfect square.
    Let's consider some other perfect squares:
    *   1 = 1². Can 1 be written as the sum of two positive perfect squares? The only positive perfect square less than 1 is none. No.
    *   4 = 2². Can 4 be written as the sum of two positive perfect squares? The only positive perfect square less than 4 is 1. 4 - 1 = 3, which is not a perfect square. No.
    *   9 = 3². Positive perfect squares less than 9 are 1, 4. 9 - 1 = 8 (not a square), 9 - 4 = 5 (not a square). No.
    *   16 = 4². Positive perfect squares less than 16 are 1, 4, 9. 16 - 1 = 15, 16 - 4 = 12, 16 - 9 = 7. None are squares. No.
    Since there exist perfect squares (like 1, 4, 9, 16) that cannot be expressed as the sum of two positive perfect squares, the property ""can be expressed as the sum of two positive perfect squares"" is a valid common property for the given numbers *besides* being perfect squares.
7.  **Finalize the phrasing:** The common property is that each of these numbers can be expressed as the sum of two positive perfect squares. This is equivalent to saying they are the squares of the hypotenuses of Pythagorean triples (since a² + b² = n² means (a, b, n) is a Pythagorean triple). The phrasing based directly on the hint is ""They can be expressed as the sum of two positive perfect squares"".

The final answer is $\boxed{They can be expressed as the sum of two positive perfect squares}$.",True,1,1,1

206,"Question: Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)
 Hint: Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $P$ be the price per box of candy in dollars, $C$ be the cost per box in dollars, $R$ be the profit per box in dollars, and $S$ be the number of boxes sold per week. The total weekly profit, $T$, is given by the product of the profit per box and the number of boxes sold: $T = R \times S$.

We are given that the profit per box is $R = P - C$.
Initially, when the price is $P_0 = 5.95$, the profit per box is $R_0 = 1.75$.
Using the relationship $R_0 = P_0 - C$, we can find the cost per box:
$1.75 = 5.95 - C$
$C = 5.95 - 1.75 = 4.20$.
The cost of producing and marketing the candy is $4.20 per box, and the problem states this cost is unaffected by changes in price or sales volume.

We are given that when the price is $P_0 = 5.95$, the sales are $S_0 = 100$ boxes per week.
We are also told that for each $0.20 reduction in price, sales increase by 25 boxes per week. This implies a linear relationship between price and sales.
Let $P$ be the new price and $S$ be the corresponding sales. The change in price from the initial price is $\Delta P = P - 5.95$. The number of $0.20 reductions in price is $(5.95 - P) / 0.20$.
The increase in sales from the initial sales is $S - 100$.
The rate of change of sales with respect to price is constant:
$\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta P} = \frac{25}{-0.20} = -125$.
This is the slope of the linear demand function $S = mP + b$. So, $m = -125$.
The sales function is $S(P) = -125P + b$.
We can find the value of $b$ using the initial condition $(P_0, S_0) = (5.95, 100)$:
$100 = -125(5.95) + b$
$100 = -743.75 + b$
$b = 100 + 743.75 = 843.75$.
So, the sales function is $S(P) = -125P + 843.75$.

Now we can form the equation for the total weekly profit $T$ as a function of the price $P$.
The profit per box is $R = P - C = P - 4.20$.
The total weekly profit is $T(P) = (P - 4.20) \times S(P)$.
Substitute the expression for $S(P)$:
$T(P) = (P - 4.20) \times (-125P + 843.75)$.

This is a quadratic function of $P$. To find the price that maximizes the profit, we can expand the expression and find the vertex of the parabola, or use calculus.
Expanding the expression:
$T(P) = P(-125P) + P(843.75) - 4.20(-125P) - 4.20(843.75)$
$T(P) = -125P^2 + 843.75P + 525P - 3543.75$
$T(P) = -125P^2 + (843.75 + 525)P - 3543.75$
$T(P) = -125P^2 + 1368.75P - 3543.75$.

This is a quadratic function in the form $aP^2 + bP + c$, where $a = -125$, $b = 1368.75$, and $c = -3543.75$. Since $a < 0$, the parabola opens downwards, and the maximum value occurs at the vertex.
The P-coordinate of the vertex is given by $P = \frac{-b}{2a}$.
Optimum Price $P = \frac{-1368.75}{2 \times (-125)} = \frac{-1368.75}{-250} = \frac{1368.75}{250}$.

Now, we calculate the value:
$P = \frac{1368.75}{250} = \frac{1368.75 \times 4}{250 \times 4} = \frac{5475}{1000} = 5.475$.

Alternatively, using calculus, we can find the derivative of $T(P)$ with respect to $P$ and set it to zero:
$T(P) = (P - 4.20)(-125P + 843.75)$
Using the product rule $(uv)' = u'v + uv'$:
$T'(P) = \frac{d}{dP}(P - 4.20) \times (-125P + 843.75) + (P - 4.20) \times \frac{d}{dP}(-125P + 843.75)$
$T'(P) = 1 \times (-125P + 843.75) + (P - 4.20) \times (-125)$
$T'(P) = -125P + 843.75 - 125P + (-4.20) \times (-125)$
$T'(P) = -125P + 843.75 - 125P + 525$
$T'(P) = -250P + 1368.75$.
To find the maximum profit, set $T'(P) = 0$:
$-250P + 1368.75 = 0$
$250P = 1368.75$
$P = \frac{1368.75}{250} = 5.475$.

The optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit is $5.475.

The final answer is $\boxed{5.475}$.",True,1,0,0

So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.

So, what is the password?
 Hint: There is some casework to be done on D; obviously we have that S = 1",There is some casework to be done on D; obviously we have that S = 1,"The password is LENS.
Since SL-D=3 or (SL-1)-D=3 (meaning SL-D=4), and since the highest possible sum of two different one-digit numbers is 17, S must equal 1.
Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.
Suppose D=7. Then L is 0 or 1, and since S=1, L=0. A must be 1 or 2, but since S=1, A=2.
Suppose D=8. Then L is 1 or 2, and since S=1, L=2. A must be 2 or 3, but since L=2, A=3.
Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.
Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.
If D=7, then L=0. But since 10-7=3, D cannot be 7.
If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.
If E=4, then N=3. But if D=8, A=3, and if D=9, L=3 and A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=5, then since 1I-E=6, I=1. But since S=1, this cannot work.
If E=7, then I=3. But if D=8, then A=3, and if D=9, then L=3. So this cannot work.
If E=8, then I=4, and D cannot be 8. But if D=9, then A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=9, then N=8, and D cannot be 8 or 9. So this cannot work.
Therefore, E=6, N=5, and I=2. If D=8, then L=2, so D must equal 9. This means:
S=1, I=2, L=3, A=4, N=5, E=6, and D=9.

210,"Question: In the far future, you find yourself a cube-maker. To make cubes, you would take a 12 by 12 by 12 Rubik's cube-like object.

First, try a easier problem. Try a two by two by two Rubik's cube. There are 8 tiny cubes and one 2 by 2 by 2 cube. It should come to your notice that you take 2^3+1^3. But just to check, you look at a standard Rubik's cube with side length 3. There are, predictably, 27 one by one cubes, 8 two by two cubes, and one 3 by 3 cube. That was 3^3 +2^3 + 1^3. Now you can come to the conclusion that for any Rubik's cube with side length n, there are n^3+(n-1)^3 + ... 2^3+1^3 total cubes with integer side length. Therefore, there are 1^3+2^3+...12^3 cubes in the Rubik's cube with side length 12. The hint gives the formula for adding a sequence of cubes. Thus, you would get (1+2+3+4+...+11+12)^2 = 6084 cubes.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let the large Rubik's cube-like object be an $N \times N \times N$ grid of tiny 1x1x1 cubes. In this problem, $N=12$.
We are asked to find the total number of possible cubes within this $12 \times 12 \times 12$ object, where the possible cubes must have integer side lengths.
Let $s$ be the side length of a possible cube. Since the tiny cubes have side length 1, $s$ must be an integer. The smallest possible side length is $s=1$ (the tiny cubes themselves). The largest possible side length is $s=12$, which is the entire object. So, the side length $s$ can be any integer from 1 to 12, inclusive.

To count the number of possible cubes, we need to determine, for each possible side length $s$, how many distinct cubes of side length $s$ can be formed within the $12 \times 12 \times 12$ grid.
Let's assume the grid of tiny cubes has coordinates $(x, y, z)$ where $1 \le x, y, z \le 12$.
A cube of side length $s$ is defined by its starting corner, say the one with the minimum $(x, y, z)$ coordinates. Let this corner be at $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$. The cube of side length $s$ starting at $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ consists of all tiny cubes $(x, y, z)$ such that $x_0 \le x < x_0+s$, $y_0 \le y < y_0+s$, and $z_0 \le z < z_0+s$.

For this $s \times s \times s$ cube to be entirely contained within the $12 \times 12 \times 12$ object, all its points $(x, y, z)$ must satisfy $1 \le x, y, z \le 12$.
The minimum coordinates of the cube are $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$, which must be at least $(1, 1, 1)$. So $x_0 \ge 1$, $y_0 \ge 1$, $z_0 \ge 1$.
The maximum coordinates are $(x_0+s-1, y_0+s-1, z_0+s-1)$. These must be at most $(12, 12, 12)$. So $x_0+s-1 \le 12$, $y_0+s-1 \le 12$, $z_0+s-1 \le 12$.
This gives us the constraints on the starting coordinates $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$:
$1 \le x_0 \le 12 - s + 1$
$1 \le y_0 \le 12 - s + 1$
$1 \le z_0 \le 12 - s + 1$

The number of possible integer values for $x_0$ is $(12 - s + 1) - 1 + 1 = 12 - s + 1$.
The number of possible integer values for $y_0$ is $12 - s + 1$.
The number of possible integer values for $z_0$ is $12 - s + 1$.

For a fixed side length $s$, the number of distinct cubes of side length $s$ is the product of the number of choices for $x_0$, $y_0$, and $z_0$.
Number of cubes of side length $s = (12 - s + 1) \times (12 - s + 1) \times (12 - s + 1) = (12 - s + 1)^3$.

The total number of possible cubes is the sum of the number of cubes of each possible side length $s$. The possible values for $s$ are $1, 2, \dots, 12$.
Total number of cubes = $\sum_{s=1}^{12} (\text{Number of cubes of side length } s) = \sum_{s=1}^{12} (12 - s + 1)^3$.

Let $k = 12 - s + 1$.
When $s=1$, $k = 12 - 1 + 1 = 12$.
When $s=2$, $k = 12 - 2 + 1 = 11$.
...
When $s=12$, $k = 12 - 12 + 1 = 1$.
As $s$ goes from 1 to 12, $k$ goes from 12 down to 1. The sum can be rewritten by changing the index from $s$ to $k$:
Total number of cubes = $\sum_{k=1}^{12} k^3 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \dots + 12^3$.

The hint provided is: ""For $1^3+2^3+\dots+n^3$, use $(1+2+\dots+n)^2$.""
This formula states that the sum of the first $n$ cubes is equal to the square of the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers.
For $n=12$, the sum of cubes is $\sum_{k=1}^{12} k^3 = \left(\sum_{k=1}^{12} k\right)^2$.

First, we calculate the sum of the first 12 natural numbers:
$\sum_{k=1}^{12} k = 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 12$.
The formula for the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers is $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.
For $n=12$, the sum is $\frac{12(12+1)}{2} = \frac{12 \times 13}{2}$.
$\frac{12 \times 13}{2} = 6 \times 13 = 78$.

Now, we use the hint formula to find the sum of the first 12 cubes:
$\sum_{k=1}^{12} k^3 = \left(\sum_{k=1}^{12} k\right)^2 = (78)^2$.

Finally, we calculate $78^2$:
$78^2 = 78 \times 78$.
$78 \times 78 = 6084$.

So, the total number of possible cubes in the $12 \times 12 \times 12$ object is 6084.
According to the problem description, this is the number you should say for the new technology to work.

The final answer is $\boxed{6084}$.",True,1,0,0

The problem describes a path consisting of a sequence of straight segments, where each segment is followed by a 90-degree right turn. The lengths of the segments are the prime numbers less than 100, taken in increasing order. We need to find the total distance walked and the displacement from the starting position.

First, we need to identify all prime numbers less than 100. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
The prime numbers less than 100 are:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.
There are 25 prime numbers less than 100. Let's denote these primes as p_1, p_2, ..., p_25, where p_1 = 2, p_2 = 3, ..., p_25 = 97.

**a) How far have you walked?**

The total distance walked is the sum of the lengths of all the segments. The lengths are the prime numbers less than 100.
Total distance = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + ... + p_25
Total distance = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31 + 37 + 41 + 43 + 47 + 53 + 59 + 61 + 67 + 71 + 73 + 79 + 83 + 89 + 97.

Let's sum these numbers:
2 + 3 = 5
5 + 5 = 10
10 + 7 = 17
17 + 11 = 28
28 + 13 = 41
41 + 17 = 58
58 + 19 = 77
77 + 23 = 100
100 + 29 = 129
129 + 31 = 160
160 + 37 = 197

281 + 47 = 328
328 + 53 = 381
381 + 59 = 440
440 + 61 = 501

712 + 79 = 791
791 + 83 = 874
874 + 89 = 963
963 + 97 = 1060.

The total distance walked is 1060 feet.

**b) How far (to the nearest inch) do you have to walk to return to your starting position?**

This question asks for the magnitude of the displacement vector from the starting position to the final position. We can use a coordinate system to represent the path. Let the starting position be the origin (0, 0). The initial direction is to the right.

Step 1: Walk p_1 feet to the right. Position: (p_1, 0). Direction: +x.
Turn right 90 degrees. New direction: -y.
Step 2: Walk p_2 feet in the -y direction. Position: (p_1, -p_2). Direction: -y.
Turn right 90 degrees. New direction: -x.
Step 3: Walk p_3 feet in the -x direction. Position: (p_1 - p_3, -p_2). Direction: -x.
Turn right 90 degrees. New direction: +y.
Step 4: Walk p_4 feet in the +y direction. Position: (p_1 - p_3, -p_2 + p_4). Direction: +y.
Turn right 90 degrees. New direction: +x.
Step 5: Walk p_5 feet in the +x direction. Position: (p_1 - p_3 + p_5, -p_2 + p_4). Direction: +x.

The directions cycle through +x, -y, -x, +y, repeating every 4 steps.
The position after n steps (x_n, y_n) can be calculated by summing the displacement vectors of each step.
The displacement vector for step k is (p_k, 0) if k mod 4 = 1.
The displacement vector for step k is (0, -p_k) if k mod 4 = 2.
The displacement vector for step k is (-p_k, 0) if k mod 4 = 3.
The displacement vector for step k is (0, p_k) if k mod 4 = 0.

There are 25 steps (since there are 25 primes less than 100).
The final x-coordinate is the sum of the x-components of each step:
X = p_1 - p_3 + p_5 - p_7 + ... + p_21 - p_23 + p_25
The indices are 1, 3, 5, ..., 25. These are the odd indices. The signs alternate + - + - ... +
X = 2 - 5 + 11 - 17 + 23 - 31 + 41 - 47 + 59 - 67 + 73 - 83 + 97
X = (2 - 5) + (11 - 17) + (23 - 31) + (41 - 47) + (59 - 67) + (73 - 83) + 97
X = (-3) + (-6) + (-8) + (-6) + (-8) + (-10) + 97
X = -41 + 97 = 56.

The final y-coordinate is the sum of the y-components of each step:
Y = -p_2 + p_4 - p_6 + p_8 + ... - p_22 + p_24
The indices are 2, 4, 6, ..., 24. These are the even indices. The signs alternate - + - + ... +
Y = -3 + 7 - 13 + 19 - 29 + 37 - 43 + 53 - 61 + 71 - 79 + 89
Y = (-3 + 7) + (-13 + 19) + (-29 + 37) + (-43 + 53) + (-61 + 71) + (-79 + 89)
Y = (4) + (6) + (8) + (10) + (10) + (10)
Y = 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 48.

The final position relative to the start is (X, Y) = (56, 48).
The distance from the starting position is the magnitude of this displacement vector.
Distance = sqrt(X^2 + Y^2)
Distance = sqrt(56^2 + 48^2)

Calculate the squares:
56^2 = 3136
48^2 = 2304

Distance = sqrt(3136 + 2304)
Distance = sqrt(5440) feet.

We need to convert this distance to feet and inches, rounded to the nearest inch.
Using a calculator, sqrt(5440) is approximately 73.75635 feet.

The distance is 73 whole feet plus a fractional part.
Fractional part = 0.75635... feet.
To convert the fractional part to inches, multiply by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).
Inches = 0.75635 * 12
Inches approx 9.0762 inches.

Rounding 9.0762 inches to the nearest inch, we get 9 inches.

So, the distance from the starting position is approximately 73 feet and 9 inches. This is the distance required to walk back to the starting position.

The hint ""Do it on paper, unless you need the exercise!"" suggests that the geometry can be visualized and calculated using coordinates, which is what we did. The ""exercise"" might be a playful reference to the physical education context, implying that actually walking the path is unnecessary (and impractical).

Final Answer:
a) The total distance walked is the sum of all prime numbers less than 100.
Sum = 1060 feet.

b) The final position after walking all the segments is (56, 48) relative to the starting position (0,0). The distance from the starting position is the magnitude of the displacement vector, which is sqrt(56^2 + 48^2) = sqrt(5440) feet.
sqrt(5440) feet approx 73.75635 feet.
Converting the fractional part to inches: 0.75635 * 12 inches approx 9.0762 inches.
Rounding to the nearest inch, this is 9 inches.
The distance to return to the starting position is approximately 73 feet and 9 inches.

The final answer is $\boxed{a) 1060 \text{ feet}, b) 73 \text{ feet } 9 \text{ inches}}$.",True,1,0,0
213,"Question: My electronic world atlas has developed another fault, I did a listing of miles from England to particular countries and here is the result:
Australia - 500 miles

Scotland - 9,500 miles
How far away did it list France as?
 Hint: The full length of the word does not matter--doubling the distances could make the pattern more illuminating",The full length of the word does not matter--doubling the distances could make the pattern more illuminating,"3,000 miles.
Take the alphabetic position of the first letter, take half and then multiply by 1000. F = 6, halved = 3, * 1000 = 3,000.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the reasoning to solve the problem:

1.  **Understand the Problem:** We are given a list of distances from England to several countries, supposedly from a faulty electronic atlas. The distances appear unusual. We need to find the distance listed for France based on a pattern in the given data.

2.  **List the Data:**
    *   Australia - 500 miles
    *   Peru - 8,000 miles
    *   India - 4,500 miles
    *   Scotland - 9,500 miles
    *   France - ? miles

3.  **Consider the Hint:** The hint provides two key pieces of information:
    *   ""The full length of the word does not matter"". This suggests that the pattern depends on something *about* the country name, but not its total number of letters.
    *   ""doubling the distances could make the pattern more illuminating"". This suggests we should multiply each given distance by 2.

4.  **Double the Distances:** Let's apply the first part of the hint and double each distance:
    *   Australia: 500 * 2 = 1000
    *   Peru: 8,000 * 2 = 16,000
    *   India: 4,500 * 2 = 9,000
    *   Scotland: 9,500 * 2 = 19,000
    *   France: ? * 2 = Doubled Distance for France

5.  **Analyze the Doubled Distances:** The doubled distances are 1000, 16000, 9000, 19000. Notice that these are all multiples of 1000. Let's divide them by 1000:
    *   Australia: 1000 / 1000 = 1
    *   Peru: 16000 / 1000 = 16
    *   India: 9000 / 1000 = 9
    *   Scotland: 19000 / 1000 = 19

6.  **Look for a Pattern Related to the Country Names:** Now we have a new set of numbers (1, 16, 9, 19) associated with the country names (Australia, Peru, India, Scotland). The hint says the ""full length of the word does not matter"". Let's consider other properties of the country names. What about the first letter?
    *   Australia starts with 'A'. 'A' is the 1st letter of the alphabet. The number we derived is 1.
    *   Peru starts with 'P'. 'P' is the 16th letter of the alphabet. The number we derived is 16.
    *   India starts with 'I'. 'I' is the 9th letter of the alphabet. The number we derived is 9.
    *   Scotland starts with 'S'. 'S' is the 19th letter of the alphabet. The number we derived is 19.

7.  **Identify the Pattern:** The pattern is clear. The number obtained by doubling the distance and then dividing by 1000 is equal to the alphabetical position of the *first letter* of the country's name.

    Pattern: (Distance * 2) / 1000 = Alphabetical Position of the First Letter

8.  **Apply the Pattern to France:**
    *   The country is France.
    *   The first letter is 'F'.
    *   Find the alphabetical position of 'F': A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, F=6. The position is 6.

9.  **Calculate the Doubled Distance for France:** Using the pattern, the number derived for France should be 6.
    *   (Distance for France * 2) / 1000 = 6
    *   Distance for France * 2 = 6 * 1000
    *   Distance for France * 2 = 6000

10. **Calculate the Actual Distance for France:** Now, divide the doubled distance by 2 to get the original distance:
    *   Distance for France = 6000 / 2
    *   Distance for France = 3000

11. **Final Check:** Let's ensure the calculated distance fits the format of the others (multiples of 500). 3000 is indeed a multiple of 500 (3000 = 6 * 500). The pattern is consistent across all given examples and applicable to France.

The electronic atlas lists the distance as half of 1000 times the alphabetical position of the first letter of the country name.

Final answer is 3000 miles.

The final answer is:

214,"Question: Alec, Brett and Chris each purchased parts for their skateboards at the sports store. Alec and Brett wanted to build new skateboards, so they each needed to purchase a deck, trucks, bearings and wheels. Chris only needed new wheels. The store offers a 10% discount for purchases over $250, so the boys decided to pay for all the parts together to qualify for the discount. Altogether, the boys spent $266.40. The clues below reflect the price of the items before the discount is applied.
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
They each bought the same kinds of wheels. Together they spent $75 for the 3 sets of wheels. Each set contained 4 wheels.
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his. However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Brett spent $3 more on bearings than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
How much did each person spend?
 Hint: Find the total price, then focus on each item separately","Find the total price, then focus on each item separately","Alec spent $113.40.
Brett spent $130.50.
Chris spent $22.50.
Component Alec Brett Chris Total
Deck $50 $45 $0 $95
Trucks 35 40 $0 75
Wheels 25 25 25 75
Bearings 16 35 $0 51
Total before discount $126 $145 $25 $296
less 10% discount $12.60 $14.50 $2.50 $29.60
Amount spent $113.40 $130.50 $22.50 $266.40
Explanation:
First find the original price of all the items combined. $266.40 is the price after the 10% discount was applied.
That means $266.40 is equal to 90% of the original price.
Write an equation and then cross multiply:
266.40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x   =   9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)
Let x = the amount Alec spent on trucks.
x + (x+5) = 75
2x + 5 = 75
2x = 70
x = 35
Alec spent $35 on trucks. Brett spent $5 more than Alec. Therefore, Brett spent $40 on trucks.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51
x + (2x + 3) = 51
3x + 3 = 51
3x = 48
x = 16
Alec's spent $16 on bearings.
Brett spent $35 on bearings",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:

1.  **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
    The boys spent $266.40 after receiving a 10% discount. Let the total cost before the discount be $T$. The discounted price is $T - 10\% \text{ of } T = T - 0.10T = 0.90T$.
    We have $0.90T = 266.40$.
    To find $T$, we calculate $T = \frac{266.40}{0.90} = \frac{2664}{9} = 296$.
    The total cost of all items before the discount was $296.

2.  **Determine the cost of wheels for each person:**
    Clue 2 states that they each bought the same kinds of wheels, and together they spent $75 for the 3 sets of wheels (Alec's, Brett's, and Chris').
    Let $W$ be the cost of one set of wheels. Since they are the same kind, Alec's wheels $A_w$, Brett's wheels $B_w$, and Chris's wheels $C_w$ all cost $W$.
    The total cost for wheels is $A_w + B_w + C_w = W + W + W = 3W$.
    We are given $3W = 75$.
    So, $W = \frac{75}{3} = 25$.
    Thus, $A_w = 25$, $B_w = 25$, and $C_w = 25$.

3.  **Determine the total cost of bearings for Alec and Brett:**
    Clue 3 states that the total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
    The total cost of bearings is $A_b + B_b$ (Chris did not buy bearings).
    The total cost of wheels is $A_w + B_w + C_w = 75$ (from Clue 2).
    So, $A_b + B_b = 75 - 24 = 51$.

4.  **Determine the cost of Alec's deck:**
    Clue 1 states that the cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
    The cost of bearings combined is $A_b + B_b$, which we found to be $51$.
    The deck for Alec's skateboard is $A_d$.
    So, $A_b + B_b = A_d + 1$.
    Substituting the value from step 3: $51 = A_d + 1$.
    $A_d = 51 - 1 = 50$.

5.  **Determine the cost of Brett's deck:**
    Clue 4 states that Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
    $A_d = B_d + 5$.
    Substituting the value from step 4: $50 = B_d + 5$.
    $B_d = 50 - 5 = 45$.

6.  **Determine the individual bearing costs for Alec and Brett:**
    Clue 5 states that Brett spent $3 more on bearings than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
    $B_b = 2 \times A_b + 3$, or $B_b = 2A_b + 3$.
    We also know from step 3 that $A_b + B_b = 51$.
    Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables ($A_b$ and $B_b$):
    (i) $A_b + B_b = 51$
    (ii) $B_b = 2A_b + 3$
    Substitute (ii) into (i):
    $A_b + (2A_b + 3) = 51$.
    $3A_b + 3 = 51$.
    $3A_b = 51 - 3 = 48$.
    $A_b = \frac{48}{3} = 16$.
    Now substitute the value of $A_b$ back into (ii):
    $B_b = 2(16) + 3 = 32 + 3 = 35$.
    So, Alec spent $16 on bearings, and Brett spent $35 on bearings. (Check: $16 + ",True,0,0,0

It takes a table 5 minutes on a saw, 5 minutes on a lathe, and 20 minutes of sanding to be completed. A chair sells for $10 and a table sells for $20. How many tables and chairs should the factory produce per hour to yield the highest revenue, and what is that revenue?
 Hint: Find the prodution limit of the machines and the intersections of these lines",Find the prodution limit of the machines and the intersections of these lines,"The 10 saws can produce 600 minutes of work per hour (10 saws * 60 minutes).
The 6 lathes can produce 360 minutes of work per hour (6 lathes * 60 minutes).
The 18 sanding machines can produce 1080 minutes of work per hour (18 sanding machines * 60 minutes).
Let c be the number of chairs produced per hour and t the number of tables produced per hour.
The number of saws limit the combination of chairs and tables to 600=10c+5t.
The number of lathes limit the combination of chairs and tables to 360=5c+5t.
The number of sanding machines limit the combination of chairs and tables to 1080=5c+20t.
Next graph these three lines. It should be expected that the answer will lie on the intersection of two of these lines or to make all chairs or all tables. The intersection of the saw and sanding machine line occurs outside of how many chairs the lathe can make so this combination is not a viable answer. The saw and lathe lines cross at 48 chairs and 24 tables. The lathe and sanding machine lines cross at 24 chairs and 48 tables.
Next determine the revenue at all points of intersection.
Chairs    Tables      Revenue

To check it will take 24*10 + 48*5 = 480 minutes of saw time. There are 600 minutes available so the saws will be idle 20% of the time.
It will take 24*5 + 48*5 = 360 minutes of lathe time which is exactly what we have.
It will take 24*5 + 48*20 = 1080 minutes of sanding machine time which is exactly what we have.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's solve this linear programming problem step-by-step, following the hint.

**1. Define the Variables:**

*   Let `x` be the number of chairs produced per hour.
*   Let `y` be the number of tables produced per hour.

Since we cannot produce a negative number of items, we have the basic constraints:
*   x ≥ 0
*   y ≥ 0

**2. Define the Objective Function:**

The goal is to maximize revenue.
*   Revenue from chairs = $10 per chair
*   Revenue from tables = $20 per table
*   Total Revenue (R) = 10x + 20y

We want to maximize R = 10x + 20y.

**3. Define the Constraints Based on Machine Availability:**

The machine availability is given for the entire factory (10 saws, 6 lathes, 18 sanders). The production times are per item in minutes, and we need production *per hour*.
Total available machine time per hour:
*   Saws: 10 saws * 60 minutes/saw = 600 minutes
*   Lathes: 6 lathes * 60 minutes/lathe = 360 minutes
*   Sanding Machines: 18 sanding machines * 60 minutes/sanding machine = 1080 minutes

Now, let's write the inequalities for each machine type:

*   **Saw Constraint:**
    *   Time needed for `x` chairs: 10x minutes
    *   Time needed for `y` tables: 5y minutes
    *   Total saw time used: 10x + 5y
    *   Inequality: 10x + 5y ≤ 600
    *   Simplify by dividing by 5: 2x + y ≤ 120

*   **Lathe Constraint:**
    *   Time needed for `x` chairs: 5x minutes
    *   Time needed for `y` tables: 5y minutes
    *   Total lathe time used: 5x + 5y
    *   Inequality: 5x + 5y ≤ 360
    *   Simplify by dividing by 5: x + y ≤ 72

*   **Sanding Machine Constraint:**
    *   Time needed for `x` chairs: 5x minutes
    *   Time needed for `y` tables: 20y minutes
    *   Total sanding time used: 5x + 20y
    *   Inequality: 5x + 20y ≤ 1080
    *   Simplify by dividing by 5: x + 4y ≤ 216

**4. Summarize the Linear Programming Problem:**

Maximize R = 10x + 20y
Subject to the constraints:
1) 2x + y ≤ 120
2) x + y ≤ 72
3) x + 4y ≤ 216
4) x ≥ 0
5) y ≥ 0

**5. Use the Hint: Find the Production Limit Lines and Their Intersections (Graphical Method):**

The hint suggests finding the production limits, which correspond to the boundary lines of our inequalities when considered as equalities. We will find the vertices of the feasible region defined by these constraints.

Let's find the equations of the boundary lines:
L1: 2x + y = 120
L2: x + y = 72
L3: x + 4y = 216
L4: x = 0 (y-axis)
L5: y = 0 (x-axis)

The feasible region is in the first quadrant (due to x≥0, y≥0) and below lines L1, L2, and L3. The vertices of this feasible region are the points where these boundary lines intersect within or on the border of the feasible region.

Let's find the potential vertices:

*   **Intersection of x=0 and y=0:** (0, 0). This is a vertex.

*   **Intersection of x=0 and L3 (x + 4y = 216):**
    *   Substitute x=0 into x + 4y = 216: 0 + 4y = 216 => y = 54.
    *   Point: (0, 54). Let's check if it satisfies other constraints:
        *   2(0) + 54 = 54 ≤ 120 (Yes)
        *   0 + 54 = 54 ≤ 72 (Yes)
    *   This is a vertex.

*   **Intersection of y=0 and L1 (2x + y = 120):**
    *   Substitute y=0 into 2x + y = 120: 2x + 0 = 120 => x = 60.
    *   Point: (60, 0). Let's check if it satisfies other constraints:
        *   60 + 0 = 60 ≤ 72 (Yes)
        *   60 + 4(0) = 60 ≤ 216 (Yes)
    *   This is a vertex.

*   **Intersection of L1 (2x + y = 120) and L2 (x + y = 72):**
    *   Subtract L2 from L1:
        (2x + y = 120)
        -(x + y = 72)
        --------------
        x = 48
    *   Substitute x=48 into L2: 48 + y = 72 => y = 72 - 48 = 24.
    *   Point: (48, 24). Let's check if it satisfies L3:
        *   48 + 4(24) = 48 + 96 = 144 ≤ 216 (Yes)
    *   This is a vertex.

*   **Intersection of L2 (x + y = 72) and L3 (x + 4y = 216):**
    *   Subtract L2 from L3:
        (x + 4y = 216)
        -(x + y = 72)
        --------------
        3y = 144
        y = 144 / 3 = 48
    *   Substitute y=48 into L2: x + 48 = 72 => x = 72 - 48 = 24.
    *   Point: (24, 48). Let's check if it satisfies L1:
        *   2(24) + 48 = 48 + 48 = 96 ≤ 120 (Yes)
    *   This is a vertex.

*   **Intersection of L1 (2x + y = 120) and L3 (x + 4y = 216):** (We must check this intersection as well to ensure it's not a vertex of the *feasible* region).
    *   From L1, y = 120 - 2x. Substitute into L3:
        x + 4(120 - 2x) = 216
        x + 480 - 8x = 216
        -7x = 216 - 480
        -7x = -264
        x = 264 / 7
    *   Substitute x = 264/7 into y = 120 - 2x:
        y = 120 - 2(264/7) = 120 - 528/7 = (840 - 528)/7 = 312/7
    *   Point: (264/7, 312/7). Let's check if it satisfies L2 (x + y ≤ 72):
        *   (264/7) + (312/7) = 576/7
        *   Is 576/7 ≤ 72? 72 = 504/7.
        *   576/7 is NOT ≤ 504/7. This intersection point (264/7, 312/7) is outside the feasible region defined by x + y ≤ 72. Therefore, it is not a vertex of the feasible region.

The vertices of the feasible region are:
*   (0, 0)
*   (0, 54)
*   (60, 0)
*   (48, 24)
*   (24, 48)

**6. Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**

Now, we plug the coordinates of each vertex into the revenue function R = 10x + 20y to find the revenue at each point.

*   At (0, 0): R = 10(0) + 20(0) = 0
*   At (0, 54): R = 10(0) + 20(54) = 1080
*   At (60, 0): R = 10(60) + 20(0) = 600
*   At (48, 24): R = 10(48) + 20(24) = 480 + 480 = 960
*   At (24, 48): R = 10(24) + 20(48) = 240 + 960 = 1200

**7. Determine the Maximum Revenue and Optimal Production:**

Comparing the revenue values, the maximum revenue is $1200, which occurs at the vertex (24, 48).

This means the factory should produce:
*   x = 24 chairs per hour
*   y = 48 tables per hour

To yield the highest revenue.

The highest revenue per hour is $1200.

**Reasoning Summary:**
1.  Defined variables for the number of chairs (x) and tables (y) produced per hour.
2.  Established the objective function for revenue: R = 10x + 20y.
3.  Calculated total available minutes per hour for each machine type.
4.  Formulated linear inequalities based on the machine time constraints for chairs and tables.
5.  Included non-negativity constraints (x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0).
6.  Identified the system of inequalities representing the feasible production region.
7.  Applied the graphical method (as hinted) by finding the boundary lines of the inequalities.
8.  Calculated the intersection points of these boundary lines to find the vertices of the feasible region. Confirmed that each potential vertex satisfied *all* constraints to be a true vertex of the feasible region.
9.  Evaluated the objective function (Revenue) at each vertex of the feasible region.

 Hint: nan",,"Three artists would do the trick. This is because twenty-four artists would paint twenty-four models in two and a half hours. Since the available time increases eight-fold (2.5 * 8 = 20), it is possible to reduce the number of painters by the same number of times (24 / 8 = 3).",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve this problem:

1.  **Identify the Goal:** We need to find the number of artists required to complete a specific amount of work (painting 24 models on 24 canvases) within a given time frame (20 hours), based on information from a different scenario.

2.  **Understand the Work:** The work being done is painting models on canvases. The phrase ""painting two and a half models on two and a half canvases"" implies that the unit of work is painting one model on one canvas. Therefore, painting ""X models on X canvases"" means completing X units of work.

3.  **Identify the Factors Involved:** The work done depends on the number of artists and the time they spend. We can assume that each artist works at a constant rate.

4.  **Establish a Relationship:** The total amount of work done is directly proportional to the number of artists and the time spent. We can express this relationship with a formula:
    Work = Rate * Number of Artists * Time
    Where 'Rate' is the work rate per artist per hour.

5.  **Analyze the First Scenario:**
    *   Number of artists (N₁): 2.5
    *   Time spent (T₁): 2.5 hours
    *   Work done (W₁): Painting 2.5 models on 2.5 canvases, which equals 2.5 units of work.

6.  **Use the First Scenario to Find the Rate:** Plug the values from the first scenario into the formula:
    W₁ = Rate * N₁ * T₁
    2.5 = Rate * 2.5 * 2.5

7.  **Calculate the Rate:**
    2.5 = Rate * (2.5 * 2.5)
    2.5 = Rate * 6.25
    Rate = 2.5 / 6.25

    To calculate 2.5 / 6.25:
    Rate = (2.5 / 6.25) * (100 / 100) = 250 / 625
    Divide numerator and denominator by 25:
    250 / 25 = 10
    625 / 25 = 25
    Rate = 10 / 25
    Divide numerator and denominator by 5:
    10 / 5 = 2
    25 / 5 = 5
    Rate = 2/5 or 0.4 units of work per artist per hour.

8.  **Analyze the Second Scenario:**
    *   Work to be done (W₂): Painting 24 models on 24 canvases, which equals 24 units of work.
    *   Time available (T₂): 20 hours
    *   Number of artists needed (N₂): This is what we want to find.
    *   Rate: The rate per artist per hour is the same as calculated in the first scenario (Rate = 0.4).

9.  **Use the Second Scenario and the Rate to Find the Number of Artists:** Plug the values into the formula:
    W₂ = Rate * N₂ * T₂
    24 = 0.4 * N₂ * 20

10. **Calculate the Required Number of Artists (N₂):**
    24 = (0.4 * 20) * N₂
    Calculate 0.4 * 20:
    0.4 * 20 = (4/10) * 20 = 80/10 = 8
    So, the equation becomes:
    24 = 8 * N₂
    N₂ = 24 / 8
    N₂ = 3

11. **State the Conclusion:** Based on the calculations, 3 artists are necessary.

 Hint: Factorials can get a non-zero number from 0",Factorials can get a non-zero number from 0,"(0!+0!+0!+0!+0!)! = 120
0! is defined to equal 1.
(1+1+1+1+1)! = 5! = 120",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step using the given information and the hint.

1.  **Goal:** We want to reach the number 120 using exactly five zeroes and any mathematical operations.

2.  **The Target Number (120):** The number 120 is a special number in mathematics. It is equal to 5! (5 factorial), which is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. If we can find a way to produce the number 5 using our five zeroes and then apply the factorial operation, we will reach 120.

3.  **The Hint:** The hint states, ""Factorials can get a non-zero number from 0"". This is a critical piece of information. What is the factorial of 0? By definition in combinatorics, 0! = 1. This is a non-zero number (1) derived from a zero using a factorial.

4.  **Using the Hint to Get Non-Zero Numbers:** We have five zeroes (0, 0, 0, 0, 0). If we apply the factorial operation to each of these zeroes, we get:
    *   0! = 1
    *   0! = 1
    *   0! = 1
    *   0! = 1
    *   0! = 1

    Now we have five ones (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) which were derived from the original five zeroes using a valid mathematical operation (factorial).

5.  **Combining the Ones to Get 5:** We need to obtain the number 5 so we can take its factorial to get 120. We currently have five ones. How can we combine five ones to get five? The simplest way is addition:
    *   1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

6.  **Putting It All Together:**
    *   We started with five zeroes.
    *   We applied the factorial to each zero to get five ones: (0!), (0!), (0!), (0!), (0!).
    *   We added these five ones together: 0! + 0! + 0! + 0! + 0!
    *   This sum evaluates to 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.
    *   Finally, we need to take the factorial of this result to get 120: (0! + 0! + 0! + 0! + 0!)!

7.  **Verifying the Expression:** Let's evaluate the expression (0! + 0! + 0! + 0! + 0!)! step by step:
    *   First, calculate the factorials inside the parentheses: 0! = 1.
    *   The expression becomes: (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1)!
    *   Next, perform the addition inside the parentheses: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.
    *   The expression becomes: 5!
    *   Finally, calculate the factorial: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

    The expression successfully uses five zeroes and valid mathematical operations to produce 120.

Yes, it is possible.

222,"Question: Homer had always contemplated the size of the old oak tree in the field behind his house.  Standing 5 feet away from the 8 foot high fence in the back of the yard, he could just barely see the top leaves of the tree over the top of the fence.  He knew that the tree was 200 feet from the fence.  Homer was 6 feet tall, making his line of vision, 67 inches from the ground.
Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.
 Hint: TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches
Tree height from eye level = TAN (25.80 deg) * 2460 inches = 1189 inches
Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.  With the measurement capabilities available to any lumberjack (or any average Homer) precise measurements are not possible.  Thus the need to clarify these calculations as estimates.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here are the steps to solve the problem using the hint:

1.  **Understand the geometry:** The problem describes a situation where Homer's line of sight from his eyes to the top of the tree passes exactly over the top of the fence. This creates a straight line through three points: Homer's eyes, the top of the fence, and the top of the tree. This setup allows us to use similar triangles or trigonometry based on the angle of elevation.

2.  **Convert all measurements to a consistent unit:** The distances are given in feet, but Homer's eye level is given in inches. Let's convert everything to feet.
    *   Homer's eye height: $h_H = 67 \text{ inches} = 67 \text{ inches} \times \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{12 \text{ inches}} = \frac{67}{12}$ feet.
    *   Distance from Homer to fence: $d_1 = 5$ feet.
    *   Fence height: $h_F = 8$ feet.
    *   Distance from fence to tree: $d_2 = 200$ feet.
    *   Total distance from Homer to tree: $d_{total} = d_1 + d_2 = 5 + 200 = 205$ feet.
    *   Let the height of the tree be $h_T$ feet.

3.  **Set up the problem using trigonometry relative to Homer's eye level:** It's helpful to consider the heights above Homer's eye level.
    *   The height of the top of the fence above Homer's eye level is $h_{F, \text{relative}} = h_F - h_H = 8 - \frac{67}{12}$.
    *   Calculate this value: $8 - \frac{67}{12} = \frac{8 \times 12}{12} - \frac{67}{12} = \frac{96}{12} - \frac{67}{12} = \frac{96 - 67}{12} = \frac{29}{12}$ feet.

    *   The height of the top of the tree above Homer's eye level is $h_{T, \text{relative}} = h_T - h_H = h_T - \frac{67}{12}$ feet.

4.  **Use the hint (TAN A) to relate the heights and distances:** Let A be the angle of elevation from Homer's eye level to the line of sight passing over the fence top to the tree top. We can consider two right-angled triangles formed by this line of sight, the horizontal line at Homer's eye level, and vertical lines from the fence top and the tree top.

    *   For the smaller triangle (involving the fence):
        The opposite side is the vertical height of the fence top above Homer's eye level ($h_{F, \text{relative}} = \frac{29}{12}$ feet).
        The adjacent side is the horizontal distance from Homer to the fence ($d_1 = 5$ feet).
        According to the hint, $\tan(A) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{h_{F, \text{relative}}}{d_1} = \frac{29/12}{5} = \frac{29}{12 \times 5} = \frac{29}{60}$.

    *   For the larger triangle (involving the tree):
        The opposite side is the vertical height of the tree top above Homer's eye level ($h_{T, \text{relative}} = h_T - \frac{67}{12}$ feet).
        The adjacent side is the horizontal distance from Homer to the tree ($d_{total} = 205$ feet).
        According to the hint, $\tan(A) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{h_{T, \text{relative}}}{d_{total}} = \frac{h_T - 67/12}{205}$.

5.  **Equate the expressions for TAN A and solve for the tree height ($h_T$):** Since the angle A is the same for both triangles, we can set the expressions for $\tan(A)$ equal to each other.
    $\frac{h_T - 67/12}{205} = \frac{29}{60}$.

    Now, solve for $h_T$:
    Multiply both sides by 205:
    $h_T - \frac{67}{12} = 205 \times \frac{29}{60}$

    Calculate the right side:
    $205 \times \frac{29}{60} = \frac{205 \times 29}{60}$.
    We can simplify the fraction $\frac{205}{60}$ by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5: $\frac{205 \div 5}{60 \div 5} = \frac{41}{12}$.
    So, $205 \times \frac{29}{60} = \frac{41}{12} \times 29 = \frac{41 \times 29}{12}$.
    Calculate $41 \times 29$: $41 \times 29 = 41 \times (30 - 1) = 41 \times 30 - 41 \times 1 = 1230 - 41 = 1189$.
    So, $h_T - \frac{67}{12} = \frac{1189}{12}$.

    Add $\frac{67}{12}$ to both sides to find $h_T$:
    $h_T = \frac{1189}{12} + \frac{67}{12}$
    $h_T = \frac{1189 + 67}{12}$
    $h_T = \frac{1256}{12}$.

6.  **Simplify the result and provide an estimate:** The exact height of the tree is $\frac{1256}{12}$ feet.
    Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
    $1256 \div 4 = 314$.
    $12 \div 4 = 3$.
    So, $h_T = \frac{314}{3}$ feet.

    To estimate the height, convert the fraction to a decimal:
    $\frac{314}{3} = 104.666...$ feet.

D. The chess marathon ran for a total of 16 hours.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Okay, let's follow the hint and assign a number to each clue by extracting a significant numerical value from each time-related quote.

Here is the reasoning for each clue:

*   **A. 'My shortest business-related call today was from 5:55pm-5:55:29pm.'**
    *   This quote specifies a start time (5:55:00 pm) and an end time (5:55:29 pm).
    *   The time difference is 29 seconds.
    *   We can assign the number **29** to this clue.

*   **B. 'With the exception of one, five-day work week, I worked every day in September.'**
    *   This quote is about the number of days worked in September.
    *   September has 30 days.
    *   Working ""every day in September"" would be 30 days.
    *   ""With the exception of one, five-day work week"" means 5 days were *not* worked.
    *   The number of days worked is 30 - 5 = 25 days.
    *   We can assign the number **25** to this clue.

*   **C. 'Sum of 3 Right angles and one 19 degree angle.'**
    *   This quote describes angles. While not a direct measure of time duration in seconds, minutes, or hours, angles are fundamentally related to timekeeping through analog clocks (a full circle is 360 degrees, representing 12 hours or 60 minutes). The prompt states these are ""time-related quotes"". Calculating the sum of the angles gives us a numerical value.
    *   A right angle is 90 degrees.
    *   3 right angles = 3 * 90 degrees = 270 degrees.
    *   One 19 degree angle = 19 degrees.
    *   The sum is 270 + 19 = 289 degrees.
    *   We can assign the number **289** to this clue.

*   **D. 'The chess marathon lasted from 12noon-4am.'**
    *   This quote specifies a start time (12:00 pm) and an end time (4:00 am).
    *   From 12:00 pm (noon) to 12:00 am (midnight) is 12 hours.
    *   From 12:00 am to 4:00 am is 4 hours.
    *   The total duration is 12 + 4 = 16 hours.
    *   We can assign the number **16** to this clue.

*   **E. 'The show comes on at 4:30. It goes off at 5:30'**
    *   This quote specifies a start time (4:30) and an end time (5:30).
    *   The time difference is 1 hour.
    *   1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.
    *   We can assign the number **60** to this clue.

So, the numbers assigned to the clues are:
*   A: 29
*   B: 25
*   C: 289
*   D: 16
*   E: 60

Now, let's look at these numbers: 29, 25, 289, 16, 60.

We need to find a pattern that applies to three of the numbers, leaving two that do not belong. Let's examine the mathematical properties of these numbers:

*   29: A prime number.
*   25: A perfect square (5 * 5 = 5²).
*   289: A perfect square (17 * 17 = 17²).
*   16: A perfect square (4 * 4 = 4²).
*   60: Not a perfect square, not prime.

We can see that three of the numbers (25, 289, and 16) are perfect squares. The other two numbers (29 and 60) are not perfect squares.

Therefore, the two quotes that do not belong, based on the numerical values extracted and the property of being a perfect square, are the ones corresponding to the numbers 29 and 60. These are quotes A and E.

The given conditions are:
1. A, B, C are positive integers.
2. A is a factor of B (A | B).
3. A is a factor of C (A | C).
4. A + B + C = 30.

From condition 2, since A and B are positive integers, there exists a positive integer k such that B = kA.
Since B is positive, k must be positive. Thus k >= 1.
From condition 3, since A and C are positive integers, there exists a positive integer m such that C = mA.
Since C is positive, m must be positive. Thus m >= 1.

Substitute B = kA and C = mA into condition 4:
A + kA + mA = 30
Factor out A from the left side:
A(1 + k + m) = 30

Since A is a positive integer, A must be a positive divisor of 30.
The positive divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.

Also, k and m are positive integers (k >= 1, m >= 1).
So, 1 + k + m must be an integer.
Let S = 1 + k + m. Since k >= 1 and m >= 1, the smallest possible value for k is 1 and the smallest possible value for m is 1.
Thus, 1 + k + m >= 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
So S must be an integer greater than or equal to 3.

The equation A * S = 30 implies that S is a positive divisor of 30.
Since S must be greater than or equal to 3, S can be any divisor of 30 that is >= 3.
The divisors of 30 are {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30}.
The divisors of 30 that are >= 3 are {3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30}.
So, S can take values from {3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30}.

For each possible value of S, we can find the value of A = 30 / S.
Since A is a positive integer, and S is a positive divisor of 30, A = 30/S will always be a positive divisor of 30.
The value of A determines the equation for k and m: k + m = S - 1.
We need to find the number of positive integer solutions (k, m) for each value of S.
The number of positive integer solutions to k + m = N is N - 1, provided N >= 2. If N < 2, there are no positive integer solutions.
In our case, N = S - 1. We need to check if S - 1 >= 2, which means S >= 3.
Since we already established that S >= 3, the number of solutions for (k, m) is always (S - 1) - 1 = S - 2.

Let's go through the possible values of S:
1. If S = 3: A = 30 / 3 = 10.
   k + m = S - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2.
   We need positive integer solutions for k + m = 2.
   The only solution is k=1, m=1. Number of solutions = 1.
   This corresponds to the triple (A, B, C) = (10, 10*1, 10*1) = (10, 10, 10).

2. If S = 5: A = 30 / 5 = 6.
   k + m = S - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4.
   We need positive integer solutions for k + m = 4.
   The solutions are (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1). Number of solutions = 3.
   These correspond to triples (6, 6, 18), (6, 12, 12), (6, 18, 6).

3. If S = 6: A = 30 / 6 = 5.
   k + m = S - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5.
   We need positive integer solutions for k + m = 5.
   The solutions are (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1). Number of solutions = 4.
   These correspond to triples (5, 5, 20), (5, 10, 15), (5, 15, 10), (5, 20, 5).

4. If S = 10: A = 30 / 10 = 3.
   k + m = S - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9.
   We need positive integer solutions for k + m = 9.

The equation is: ABCD x 4 = DCBA

Here, ABCD and DCBA are four-digit numbers, meaning A and D cannot be 0. Each letter represents a unique digit from 0 to 9.

1.  **Use the Hint:** The hint states that since ABCD is multiplied by 4, the result DCBA must be an even number. The last digit of DCBA is A. Therefore, A must be an even digit.
    *   Possible values for A are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.
    *   Since ABCD is a four-digit number, A cannot be 0.
    *   So, the possible values for A are 2, 4, 6, or 8.

2.  **Consider the magnitude of the numbers:**
    *   ABCD is a four-digit number. The smallest possible is 1000. 1000 * 4 = 4000.
    *   The result DCBA is also a four-digit number. This means DCBA must be less than 10000.
    *   ABCD * 4 < 10000
    *   ABCD < 10000 / 4
    *   ABCD < 2500
    *   Since ABCD starts with the digit A, A must be less than 2.5.
    *   Possible values for A are 1 or 2.

3.  **Combine the information about A:**
    *   From the hint, A can be 2, 4, 6, or 8.
    *   From the magnitude analysis, A can be 1 or 2.
    *   The only digit that satisfies both conditions is A = 2.

4.  **Substitute A = 2 into the equation:**
    *   The equation becomes: 2BCD x 4 = DCB2.

5.  **Look at the units digit multiplication:**
    *   The units digit of ABCD is D. When D is multiplied by 4, the units digit of the result (DCBA) must be A, which is 2.
    *   Let's check which digits D result in a units digit of 2 when multiplied by 4:
        *   4 * 0 = 0
        *   4 * 1 = 4
        *   4 * 2 = 8
        *   4 * 3 = 12 (units digit is 2) -> D could be 3.
        *   4 * 4 = 16
        *   4 * 5 = 20
        *   4 * 6 = 24
        *   4 * 7 = 28
        *   4 * 8 = 32 (units digit is 2) -> D could be 8.
        *   4 * 9 = 36
    *   So, D can be 3 or 8.

6.  **Consider the thousands digit:**
    *   We have 2BCD x 4 = DCB2.
    *   The number 2BCD is around 2000.
    *   Multiplying a number around 2000 by 4 gives a result around 8000 (2000 * 4 = 8000).
    *   The result DCB2 starts with the digit D.
    *   If D was 3, the result would be around 3000, which is too small (since 2000 * 4 = 8000).
    *   If D was 8, the result would be around 8000, which matches.
    *   Also, remember that multiplying A by 4 (plus any carry-over from B*4) gives the digit D. Here A=2. 2 * 4 = 8. This strongly suggests D is 8, with no carry-over from B*4 into the thousands column, or a carry-over that keeps the result 8. Let's assume the carry-over from 4B is y. Then 4A + y = D, so 4*2 + y = D, meaning 8 + y = D.
    *   If D=3, then 8 + y = 3, impossible as y must be non-negative.
    *   If D=8, then 8 + y = 8, meaning y = 0.

7.  **We have found D = 8 and the carry-over y from the hundreds column (4B) is 0.**
    *   We now know A=2 and D=8. They are distinct.
    *   The equation is 2BC8 x 4 = 8CB2.

8.  **Perform the multiplication step-by-step with the known digits:**
    ```
      2 B C 8
    x       4
    ---------
      8 C B 2
    ```
    *   **Units column:** 8 * 4 = 32. The units digit of the result is 2 (which matches A). We carry over 3 to the tens column.
    *   **Tens column:** C * 4 + (carry-over 3) results in a number whose units digit is B, and we carry over a value (let's call it x) to the hundreds column. So, 4C + 3 ends in B, and 4C + 3 = 10x + B.
    *   **Hundreds column:** B * 4 + (carry-over x from tens) results in a number whose units digit is C, and we carry over a value (let's call it y) to the thousands column. So, 4B + x ends in C, and 4B + x = 10y + C.
    *   **Thousands column:** A * 4 + (carry-over y from hundreds) results in D. We know A=2 and D=8. So, 2 * 4 + y = 8, which means 8 + y = 8. This confirms that the carry-over y from the hundreds column is 0.

9.  **Use the information y = 0:**
    *   From the hundreds column: 4B + x = 10y + C becomes 4B + x = 10(0) + C, so 4B + x = C.
    *   From the tens column: 4C + 3 = 10x + B.

10. **Solve the system of equations for B, C, and x:**
    *   Equation 1: 4B + x = C
    *   Equation 2: 4C + 3 = 10x + B

    *   Substitute C from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
        *   4(4B + x) + 3 = 10x + B
        *   16B + 4x + 3 = 10x + B
        *   15B + 3 = 6x
        *   Divide by 3: 5B + 1 = 2x

11. **Find possible values for B and x:**
    *   We know x is the carry-over from 4C + 3. C is a digit (0-9), so 4C + 3 is between 4(0)+3 = 3 and 4(9)+3 = 39. The carry-over x can therefore be 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    *   Also, B is a digit (0-9) and must be distinct from A=2 and D=8.
    *   Let's test the possible values of x in the equation 5B + 1 = 2x:
        *   If x = 0: 5B + 1 = 0 => 5B = -1. No valid digit for B.
        *   If x = 1: 5B + 1 = 2 => 5B = 1. No valid digit for B.
        *   If x = 2: 5B + 1 = 4 => 5B = 3. No valid digit for B.
        *   If x = 3: 5B + 1 = 6 => 5B = 5 => B = 1. This is a valid digit.

12. **We have found x = 3 and B = 1.**
    *   B=1 is distinct from A=2 and D=8.

13. **Find C using B = 1 and x = 3:**
    *   Use the equation 4B + x = C:
        *   4(1) + 3 = C
        *   4 + 3 = C
        *   C = 7.

14. **Check if C=7 is distinct from A=2, B=1, and D=8.** Yes, it is.

15. **We have found the proposed values for the letters:**
    *   A = 2
    *   B = 1
    *   C = 7
    *   D = 8

16. **Verify the solution:**
    *   ABCD = 2178
    *   DCBA = 8712
    *   Let's calculate 2178 * 4:
        ```
          2178
        x    4
        ------
          8712
        ```
    *   8 * 4 = 32 (write 2, carry 3)
    *   7 * 4 = 28 + 3 = 31 (write 1, carry 3)
    *   1 * 4 = 4 + 3 = 7 (write 7, carry 0)
    *   2 * 4 = 8 + 0 = 8 (write 8)
    *   The result is 8712, which is DCBA.
    *   All digits are distinct (2, 1, 7, 8).
    *   A is even and not zero.
    *   D is not zero.

The solution holds true.

The tens digits carry 2 to the hundreds digits, and the hundreds digits must carry 2 to the thousands digits. To avoid zero or duplicate numbers, F can only be 8 and W be 6. A+W+A+Y=2+6+2+5=15.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let the addition sum be represented as:
  F L Y
+ F L Y
+ F L Y
---------
 A W A Y

This can be written as the equation $3 \times (100F + 10L + Y) = 1000A + 100W + 10A + Y$.
The equation is $300F + 30L + 3Y = 1010A + 100W + Y$.
Rearranging the terms gives: $300F + 30L + 2Y = 1010A + 100W$.

The letters F, L, Y, A, W represent distinct non-zero digits. The set of possible digits is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.

Let's analyze the addition column by column, starting from the units column on the right.
Units column: $3Y$ must end in the digit Y.
Let $3Y = 10c_1 + Y$, where $c_1$ is the carry-over to the tens column.
$2Y = 10c_1$.
Since Y is a non-zero digit (from 1 to 9), $2Y$ is an even number between 2 and 18. For $2Y$ to be a multiple of 10, the only possibility is $2Y=10$.
$2Y = 10 \implies Y=5$.
The carry-over $c_1 = 10/10 = 1$.
So, Y must be 5. Since Y is a non-zero digit, this is valid.
The set of available digits for F, L, A, W is now $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$. Y=5 is used.

Tens column: $3L + c_1$ must end in the digit A.
$3L + 1 = 10c_2 + A$, where $c_2$ is the carry-over to the hundreds column.

Hundreds column: $3F + c_2$ must end in the digit W.
$3F + c_2 = 10c_3 + W$, where $c_3$ is the carry-over to the thousands column.

Thousands column: The total sum is AWAY, which is a 4-digit number. The thousands digit A is the carry-over $c_3$.
$c_3 = A$.

Substituting $c_3 = A$ into the hundreds column equation:
$3F + c_2 = 10A + W$.

AWAY is a 4-digit number, so $A \ge 1$. Also, F is a non-zero digit, so $F \ge 1$. The smallest possible value for FLY would be when F, L, Y are smallest distinct non-zero digits. But Y=5. Let's consider the smallest possible F.
If F=1, the minimum FLY is 125 (using L=2, Y=5). $3 \times 125 = 375$, which is a 3-digit number. AWAY must be a 4-digit number.
So $3 \times \text{FLY} \ge 1000$.
$\text{FLY} \ge \lceil 1000/3 \rceil = 334$.
So F must be at least 3.
The maximum possible value for FLY is when F, L are largest distinct non-zero digits other than 5. F=9, L=8 (or F=8, L=9). Let's use F=9, L=8, Y=5. FLY=985.
$3 \times 985 = 2955$.
So AWAY is between 1000 and 2997.
The thousands digit A can only be 1 or 2. A is also a non-zero digit, which is consistent.

Case 1: A = 1.
From $c_3 = A$, we get $c_3 = 1$.
Substitute A=1 into the tens column equation: $3L + 1 = 10c_2 + 1$.
$3L = 10c_2$.
L is a non-zero digit and L cannot be 5 (Y=5) or 1 (A=1). So L belongs to $\{2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
The possible values for $3L$ are $\{6, 9, 12, 18, 21, 24, 27\}$.
For $3L$ to be equal to $10c_2$, which is a multiple of 10, the only possibility from the set is 0, which is not in the set of $3L$. There are no multiples of 10 in the set $\{6, 9, 12, 18, 21, 24, 27\}$.
Therefore, there is no possible value for L when A=1.

Case 2: A = 2.
From $c_3 = A$, we get $c_3 = 2$.
Substitute A=2 into the tens column equation: $3L + 1 = 10c_2 + 2$.
$3L - 1 = 10c_2$.
L is a non-zero digit and cannot be 5 (Y=5) or 2 (A=2). So L belongs to $\{1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
Let's test these values for L to see if $3L-1$ is a multiple of 10:
If L=1, $3(1)-1 = 2$. Not a multiple of 10.
If L=3, $3(3)-1 = 8$. Not a multiple of 10.
If L=4, $3(4)-1 = 11$. Not a multiple of 10.
If L=6, $3(6)-1 = 17$. Not a multiple of 10.
If L=7, $3(7)-1 = 20$. This is a multiple of 10. $10c_2 = 20 \implies c_2 = 2$.
If L=8, $3(8)-1 = 23$. Not a multiple of 10.
If L=9, $3(9)-1 = 26$. Not a multiple of 10.
So, the only possibility is L=7, which gives $c_2=2$.
The digits used so far are Y=5, A=2, L=7. These are distinct and non-zero.

Now substitute $c_2=2$ and $c_3=2$ into the hundreds column equation:
$3F + c_2 = 10c_3 + W$.
$3F + 2 = 10(2) + W$.
$3F + 2 = 20 + W$.
$3F - 18 = W$.

F and W must be distinct non-zero digits, and they must be distinct from the digits already used (Y=5, A=2, L=7). The available digits are $\{1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9\}$. F and W must be chosen from this set and be distinct from each other.

Let's test values for F from the set $\{1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9\}$:
If F=1, $W = 3(1) - 18 = -15$. Not a digit.
If F=3, $W = 3(3) - 18 = 9 - 18 = -9$. Not a digit.
If F=4, $W = 3(4) - 18 = 12 - 18 = -6$. Not a digit.
If F=6, $W = 3(6) - 18 = 18 - 18 = 0$. Not a non-zero digit.
If F=8, $W = 3(8) - 18 = 24 - 18 = 6$. W=6.
Let's check if F=8 and W=6 are valid. F=8 is in $\{1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9\}$. W=6 is in $\{1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9\}$. F=8 and W=6 are distinct from each other. The set of used digits is {Y=5, A=2, L=7, F=8, W=6} = {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}. These are 5 distinct non",True,1,0,0
231,"Question: What is the smallest integer greater than 0 that can be written entirely with zeros and ones and is evenly divisible by 225?
 Hint: nan",,"The prime factorization of 225 is 5*5*3*3. So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.
All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let $N$ be the integer we are looking for. The problem states that $N$ must satisfy three conditions:
1. $N$ is an integer greater than 0.
2. $N$ can be written entirely with zeros and ones (in base 10).
3. $N$ is evenly divisible by 225.

We want to find the smallest such $N$.

First, let's analyze the divisibility condition. $N$ must be divisible by 225. We factorize 225 into its prime factors: $225 = 9 \times 25 = 3^2 \times 5^2$.
For $N$ to be divisible by 225, it must be divisible by both 9 and 25.

Let's use the divisibility rules for 9 and 25.
A number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are 00, 25, 50, or 75.
The digits of $N$ can only be 0 or 1. The possible last two digits for a number composed of zeros and ones are 00, 01, 10, or 11. Comparing these possibilities with the requirement for divisibility by 25, the last two digits of $N$ must be 00.

A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
The digits of $N$ can only be 0 or 1. Let $m$ be the number of ones in the decimal representation of $N$. The sum of the digits of $N$ is $m \times 1 + (\text{number of zeros}) \times 0 = m$.
So, for $N$ to be divisible by 9, the number of ones in its decimal representation must be a multiple of 9.
Since $N > 0$, $N$ must contain at least one digit 1 (the number 0 has sum",True,0,0,0

The hint provided is $50^2 = 125000$. This is a mathematical error, as $50^2 = 2500$. Given that we are multiplying three numbers to get a product around 190000, it is highly probable that the hint meant to give a rough estimate of the cube of a number around the magnitude of the primes. Let's assume the hint intended to show that $50^3 = 50 \times 50 \times 50 = 125000$. This suggests that the prime numbers we are looking for are roughly around 50.

If the three consecutive prime numbers were approximately equal, their common value would be close to the cube root of the product 190747. Let's estimate the cube root of 190747.
We know that $50^3 = 125000$ and $60^3 = 216000$. Since 190747 is between 125000 and 216000, the cube root of 190747 is between 50 and 60.

$58^3 = 58 \times 58 \times 58 = 3364 \times 58 = 195112$.
$57^3 = 57 \times 57 \times 57 = 3249 \times 57 = 185193$.

2. (53, 59, 61)
3. (59, 61, 67)

Let's calculate the product of each set:
1. For the triplet (47, 53, 59):
   $47 \times 53 = 2491$.
   $2491 \times 59 = 146969$.
   This product is 146969, which is not 190747.

2. For the triplet (53, 59, 61):
   $53 \times 59 = 3127$.
   $3127 \times 61 = 3127 \times (60 + 1) = 3127 \times 60 + 3127 = 187620 + 3127 = 190747$.
   This product is 190747, which matches the given product.

Let's verify that 53, 59, and 61 are indeed consecutive prime numbers. The list of prime numbers is 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, ...
Looking at the list, 53 is followed by 59, and 59 is followed by 61. There are no other prime numbers between 53 and 59, or between 59 and 61. Thus, 53, 59, and 61 are consecutive prime numbers.

For completeness, let's check the next triplet as well:
3. For the triplet (59, 61, 67):
   $59 \times 61 = 3599$.
   $3599 \times 67 = 241133$.
   This product is 241133, which is not 190747.

The three consecutive prime numbers whose product is 190747 are 53, 59, and 61.

We can also solve this by finding the prime factorization of 190747. Based on our estimate, the prime factors should be around 57. Let's try dividing 190747 by the prime numbers we suspect are the factors. Let's start with 53.
$190747 \div 53$:
$190 \div 53 = 3$ with remainder $190 - 3 \times 53 = 190 - 159 = 31$.
Bring down 7, making it 317.
$317 \div 53 = 5$ with remainder $317 - 5 \times 53 = 317 - 265 = 52$.
Bring down 4, making it 524.
$524 \div 53 = 9$ with remainder $524 - 9 \times 53 = 524 - 477 = 47$.
Bring down 7, making it 477.
$477 \div 53 = 9$ with remainder $477 - 9 \times 53 = 477 - 477 = 0$.
So, $190747 = 53 \times 3599$.

Now we need to find the prime factors of 3599. We expect the other two factors to be the consecutive primes after 53, which are 59 and 61. Let's multiply 59 and 61.
$59 \times 61 = (60 - 1) \times (60 + 1) = 60^2 - 1^2 = 3600 - 1 = 3599$.
So, $3599 = 59 \times 61$.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 190747 is $53 \times 59 \times 61$.
We have already confirmed that 53, 59, and 61 are consecutive prime numbers.

1.  $p$ is 1 greater than a multiple of 4. This means $p = 4k + 1$ for some integer $k$. In terms of modular arithmetic, this is equivalent to $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$.
2.  $p$ is 1 less than a multiple of 5. This means $p = 5m - 1$ for some integer $m$. In terms of modular arithmetic, this is equivalent to $p \equiv -1 \pmod{5}$, or $p \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$.

We need to find the prime numbers $p$ such that $1 < p < 100$ and simultaneously satisfy $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ and $p \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$.

We can find these prime numbers by first listing the prime numbers between 1 and 100 and then checking each one against the given conditions.
The prime numbers between 1 and 100 are:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Now let's check which of these primes satisfy the conditions $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ and $p \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$.

Condition 1: $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$
Checking the list of primes:
5 $\equiv$ 1 mod 4 (Yes)
13 $\equiv$ 1 mod 4 (Yes)
17 $\equiv$ 1 mod 4 (Yes)
29 $\equiv$ 1 mod 4 (Yes)
37 $\equiv$ 1 mod 4 (Yes)
41 $\equiv$ 1 mod 4 (Yes)
53 $\equiv$ 1 mod 4 (Yes)
61 $\equiv$ 1 mod 4 (Yes)
73 $\equiv$ 1 mod 4 (Yes)
89 $\equiv$ 1 mod 4 (Yes)
97 $\equiv$ 1 mod 4 (Yes)
The primes satisfying $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ are: 5, 13, 17, 29, 37, 41, 53, 61, 73, 89, 97.

Condition 2: $p \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$
Checking the list of primes:
19 $\equiv$ 4 mod 5 (Yes)
29 $\equiv$ 4 mod 5 (Yes)
59 $\equiv$ 4 mod 5 (Yes)
79 $\equiv$ 4 mod 5 (Yes)
89 $\equiv$ 4 mod 5 (Yes)
(Primes ending in 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 cannot satisfy $p \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$ except for 5 itself, which is $5 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$).
The primes satisfying $p \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$ are: 19, 29, 59, 79, 89.

We are looking for prime numbers that satisfy both conditions. We need to find the intersection of the two lists:
Primes satisfying $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$: {5, 13, 17, 29, 37, 41, 53, 61, 73, 89, 97}
Primes satisfying $p \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$: {19, 29, 59, 79, 89}

The numbers that are in both lists are 29 and 89.

Alternatively, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the form of the numbers satisfying both congruences:
$p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$
$p \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$

From the first congruence, $p = 4k + 1$ for some integer $k$.
Substitute this into the second congruence:
$4k + 1 \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$
$4k \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$

To solve for $k$, we multiply both sides by the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 5. The inverse of 4 modulo 5 is 4, since $4 \times 4 = 16 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$.
$4 \times 4k \equiv 4 \times 3 \pmod{5}$
$16k \equiv 12 \pmod{5}$
$k \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$

So, $k = 5j + 2$ for some integer $j$.
Substitute this back into the expression for $p$:
$p = 4k + 1 = 4(5j + 2) + 1 = 20j + 8 + 1 = 20j + 9$.

So, any number satisfying both conditions must be of the form $20j + 9$. We need to find the prime numbers of this form that are between 1 and 100.
Let's list the numbers of the form $20j + 9$ for integer values of $j$:
For $j=0$: $p = 20(0) + 9 = 9$. 9 is not prime ($9 = 3 \times 3$).
For $j=1$: $p = 20(1) + 9 = 29$. 29 is prime. $1 < 29 < 100$.
For $j=2$: $p = 20(2) + 9 = 49$. 49 is not prime ($49 = 7 \times 7$).
For $j=3$: $p = 20(3) + 9 = 69$. 69 is not prime ($69 = 3 \times 23$).
For $j=4$: $p = 20(4) + 9 = 89$. 89 is prime. $1 < 89 < 100$.
For $j=5$: $p = 20(5) + 9 = 109$. 109 is prime, but it is not between 1 and 100 ($109 > 100$).
For $j < 0$, the values of $p$ will be less than 9 or negative, and thus not prime numbers between 1 and 100.

The prime numbers between 1 and 100 that are of the form $20j + 9$ are 29 and 89. These are the same numbers found by checking the lists.

The problem asks for the sum of all such prime numbers. The prime numbers satisfying the conditions are 29 and 89.
Sum = 29 + 89 = 118.

The final answer is $\boxed{118}$.",True,1,1,0

 Hint: Snogs are one more than...",Snogs are one more than...,"The numbers 17, 49, and 57 are snogs.
Snogs are each one more than a multiple of 8.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"The problem provides examples of numbers that are ""snogs"" and numbers that are ""NOT snogs"". We are given a hint: ""Snogs are one more than..."". This suggests that if a number 'n' is a snog, then the number 'n-1' has a specific property.

Let's list the given snogs and calculate 'snog - 1' for each:
- 25 is a snog. 25 - 1 = 24.
- 73 is a snog. 73 - 1 = 72.
- 81 is a snog. 81 - 1 = 80.
- 9 is a snog. 9 - 1 = 8.
- 33 is a snog. 33 - 1 = 32.
- 41 is a snog. 41 - 1 = 40.
- 65 is a snog. 65 - 1 = 64.
The numbers that are one less than a snog are: 24, 72, 80, 8, 32, 40, 64.

Let's examine these numbers to find a common property.
We can check for divisibility by small integers.
Are they divisible by 2? Yes, all are even.
Are they divisible by 3? 24/3=8, 72/3=24, 80/3 is not an integer, 8/3 is not an integer, 32/3 is not an integer, 40/3 is not an integer, 64/3 is not an integer. So, not all are divisible by 3.
Are they divisible by 4? 24/4=6, 72/4=18, 80/4=20, 8/4=2, 32/4=8, 40/4=10, 64/4=16. Yes, all are divisible by 4.
Are they divisible by 8? 24/8=3, 72/8=9, 80/8=10, 8/8=1, 32/8=4, 40/8=5, 64/8=8. Yes, all are divisible by 8.

It appears that the property is that 'snog - 1' is a multiple of 8. Let's test this hypothesis with the numbers that are NOT snogs.

Let's list the given non-snogs and calculate 'non-snog - 1' for each:
- 5 is NOT a snog. 5 - 1 = 4. Is 4 a multiple of 8? No.
- 70 is NOT a snog. 70 - 1 = 69. Is 69 a multiple of 8? No (8 * 8 = 64, 8 * 9 = 72).
- 16 is NOT a snog. 16 - 1 = 15. Is 15 a multiple of 8? No (8 * 1 = 8, 8 * 2 = 16).
- 3 is NOT a snog. 3 - 1 = 2. Is 2 a multiple of 8? No.
- 29 is NOT a snog. 29 - 1 = 28. Is 28 a multiple of 8? No (8 * 3 = 24, 8 * 4 = 32).
- 44 is NOT a snog. 44 - 1 = 43. Is 43 a multiple of 8? No (8 * 5 = 40, 8 * 6 = 48).
- 59 is NOT a snog. 59 - 1 = 58. Is 58 a multiple of 8? No (8 * 7 = 56, 8 * 8 = 64).
- 60 is NOT a snog. 60 - 1 = 59. Is 59 a multiple of 8? No.
- 64 is NOT a snog. 64 - 1 = 63. Is 63 a multiple of 8? No (8 * 7 = 56, 8 * 8 = 64).
None of the numbers that are one less than a non-snog are multiples of 8.

This confirms our hypothesis. The rule for snogs is: A number is a snog if and only if it is one more than a multiple of 8. In other words, a number 'n' is a snog if 'n-1' is divisible by 8, or if n ≡ 1 (mod 8).

Now we apply this rule to the list of numbers we need to classify: 48, 57, 37, 17, 53, 49, 62, 8, 4, 18.
For each number, we subtract 1 and check if the result is a multiple of 8.

- For 48: 48 - 1 = 47. 47 ÷ 8 = 5 with remainder 7. 47 is not a multiple of 8. So, 48 is NOT a snog.
- For 57: 57 - 1 = 56. 56 ÷ 8 = 7. 56 is a multiple of 8. So, 57 IS a snog.
- For 37: 37 - 1 = 36. 36 ÷ 8 = 4 with remainder 4. 36 is not a multiple of 8. So, 37 is NOT a snog.
- For 17: 17 - 1 = 16. 16 ÷ 8 = 2. 16 is a multiple of 8. So, 17 IS a snog.
- For 53: 53 - 1 = 52. 52 ÷ 8 = 6 with remainder 4. 52 is not a multiple of 8. So, 53 is NOT a snog.
- For 49: 49 - 1 = 48. 48 ÷ 8 = 6. 48 is a multiple of 8. So, 49 IS a snog.
- For 62: 62 - 1 = 61. 61 ÷ 8 = 7 with remainder 5. 61 is not a multiple of 8. So, 62 is NOT a snog.
- For 8: 8 - 1 = 7. 7 ÷ 8 = 0 with remainder 7. 7 is not a multiple of 8. So, 8 is NOT a snog.
- For 4: 4 - 1 = 3. 3 ÷ 8 = 0 with remainder 3. 3 is not a multiple of 8. So, 4 is NOT a snog.
- For 18: 18 - 1 = 17. 17 ÷ 8 = 2 with remainder 1. 17 is not a multiple of 8. So, 18 is NOT a snog.

The numbers from the list that are snogs are those for which 'number - 1' is a multiple of 8. These numbers are 57, 17, and 49.

The digits are distinct and belong to the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.

The properties of the digits from 1 to 9 are:
Prime numbers (P): {2, 3, 5, 7}
Square numbers (S): {1, 4, 9}
Neither prime nor square (N): {6, 8}

The problem states that among the five digits of the number, there are exactly two prime numbers, two square numbers, and one number that is neither prime nor square.

We are given the following relations between the digits:
1. $d_3 = 2 \times d_5$
2. $d_4 = d_2 + 6$
3. $d_5 = d_1 - 3$

Let's find the possible pairs of digits for each relation, keeping in mind the digits must be from 1 to 9 and distinct within the final five-digit number.

For $d_3 = 2 \times d_5$:
- If $d_5 = 1$, $d_3 = 2$. Pair (1, 2). $d_5 \in S, d_3 \in P$.
- If $d_5 = 2$, $d_3 = 4$. Pair (2, 4). $d_5 \in P, d_3 \in S$.
- If $d_5 = 3$, $d_3 = 6$. Pair (3, 6). $d_5 \in P, d_3 \in N$.
- If $d_5 = 4$, $d_3 = 8$. Pair (4, 8). $d_5 \in S, d_3 \in N$.
(If $d_5 \ge 5$, $d_3 \ge 10$, which is not a digit).

For $d_4 = d_2 + 6$:
- If $d_2 = 1$, $d_4 = 7$. Pair (1, 7). $d_2 \in S, d_4 \in P$.
- If $d_2 = 2$, $d_4 = 8$. Pair (2, 8). $d_2 \in P, d_4 \in N$.
- If $d_2 = 3$, $d_4 = 9$. Pair (3, 9). $d_2 \in P, d_4 \in S$.
(If $d_2 \ge 4$, $d_4 \ge 10$, which is not a digit).

For $d_5 = d_1 - 3$:
- If $d_5 = 1$, $d_1 = 4$. Pair (4, 1). $d_1 \in S, d_5 \in S$.
- If $d_5 = 2$, $d_1 = 5$. Pair (5, 2). $d_1 \in P, d_5 \in P$.
- If $d_5 = 3$, $d_1 = 6$. Pair (6, 3). $d_1 \in N, d_5 \in P$.
- If $d_5 = 4$, $d_1 = 7$. Pair (7, 4). $d_1 \in P, d_5 \in S$.
- If $d_5 = 5$, $d_1 = 8$. Pair (8, 5). $d_1 \in N, d_5 \in P$.

(If $d_5 \ge 7$, $d_1 \ge 10$, not a digit).

Now let's use the hint: ""Third and fourth digits cannot be prime"".
This means $d_3 \notin \{2, 3, 5, 7\}$ and $d_4 \notin \{2, 3, 5, 7\}$.

Let's filter the possible pairs for $(d_5, d_3)$:
- (1, 2): $d_3=2$ is prime. Ruled out by the hint.
- (2, 4): $d_3=4$ is not prime. Possible.
- (3, 6): $d_3=6$ is not prime. Possible.
- (4, 8): $d_3=8$ is not prime. Possible.
So, possible $(d_5, d_3)$ pairs are (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 8).

Let's filter the possible pairs for $(d_2, d_4)$:
- (1, 7): $d_4=7$ is prime. Ruled out by the hint.
- (2, 8): $d_4=8$ is not prime. Possible.
- (3, 9): $d_4=9$ is not prime. Possible.
So, possible $(d_2, d_4)$ pairs are (2, 8), (3, 9).

Now we combine the filtered possibilities, using the relation $d_5 = d_1 - 3$ (or $d_1 = d_5 + 3$) and the distinctness of all five digits, and the property that the set of five digits must contain 2 primes, 2 squares, and 1 neither.

Let's consider the possible filtered pairs for $(d_5, d_3)$:

Case 1: $(d_5, d_3) = (2, 4)$.
$d_5 = 2$, $d_3 = 4$.
Using $d_1 = d_5 + 3$, we get $d_1 = 2 + 3 = 5$.

The second option was for an immediate 10% raise to 11,000 wonks annually, with an additional 10% raise every year. Manic Martin's salary, based upon his current annual, was paid bi-weekly.
Which deal would benefit Manic Martin the most?
 Hint: Think about the difference between the first and second half of every year",Think about the difference between the first and second half of every year,"The 5% semi-annual raise yields a higher return.
This may have been your first guess, but there is something odd about the answer. At the start of the problem, the 10% raise is earning more-  11,000 annually vs. 10,500. After the first year, the 5% option has earned 10,762 compared to 11,000.
What are the two options earning at the moment the contract closes, after 17.5 years? Surprisingly, the 5% option only realizes a little more than 55,160, compared to the 10% option which is still ahead with just under 56,000.
So where's the advantage in the 5% option? It hides in the second half of every year. Even in the first year, the 5% option makes more in the second six months than the 10% option. For the first few years, this is not enough to offset the difference. But cumulatively, over seventeen and a half years, 5% realizes a grand total of 390.27 more than the 10% option. This in spite of the fact that the 10% option starts with a higher salary- and finishes with a higher salary.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0
241,"Question: If you drop a bouncy ball from a distance of 9 feet from the floor, the ball will continue to bounce. Assume that each time it bounces back two thirds of the distance of the previous bounce. How far will the ball travel before it stops?
 Hint: Geometric series...",Geometric series...,"45 feet.
The distance can be calculated as 9 + (9)*(2/3)*(2) + (9)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(2)+..., with the 2 accounting for the upward and downward travel distance.  Adding 9 to this will result in the formation of an infinite geometric series:  18*(2/3)^0 + 18*(2/3)^1 +...  Factoring out the 18 will result in a series that is equal to (1/(1-(2/3))), which equals 3.  Multiplying by the 18 and then subtracting the nine used to create the series will result in 54 - 9 = 45.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem using the hint about geometric series.

Step 1: Identify the initial distance the ball travels.
The ball is dropped from a distance of 9 feet from the floor. This is the initial distance traveled downwards.
Initial distance = 9 feet.

Step 2: Describe the motion of the ball after the first impact.
After hitting the floor, the ball bounces back up. The height of the bounce is two thirds of the distance of the previous drop.
Height of the first bounce = $\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6$ feet.
After reaching this peak height, the ball falls back down to the floor. The distance traveled downwards after the first bounce is also 6 feet.
Total distance traveled during the first bounce cycle (up and down) = 6 + 6 = 12 feet.

Step 3: Describe the motion of the ball after the second impact.
The height of the second bounce is two thirds of the height of the first bounce.
Height of the second bounce = $\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4$ feet.
The ball then falls back down 4 feet.
Total distance traveled during the second bounce cycle = 4 + 4 = 8 feet.

Step 4: Describe the motion of the ball after the third impact and identify the pattern.
The height of the third bounce is two thirds of the height of the second bounce.
Height of the third bounce = $\frac{2}{3} \times 4 = \frac{8}{3}$ feet.
The ball then falls back down $\frac{8}{3}$ feet.
Total distance traveled during the third bounce cycle = $\frac{8}{3} + \frac{8}{3} = \frac{16}{3}$ feet.

The pattern of the heights of successive bounces is a sequence where each term is $\frac{2}{3}$ times the previous term: 6, 4, $\frac{8}{3}$, $\frac{16}{9}$, ...
The distances traveled in each full bounce cycle (up and down) form the sequence: 12, 8, $\frac{16}{3}$, $\frac{32}{9}$, ...

Step 5: Express the total distance traveled as a sum.
The ball continues to bounce, with the height decreasing each time. It will theoretically stop when the height of the bounce becomes zero, which occurs only in the limit as the number of bounces approaches infinity.
The total distance traveled is the sum of the initial drop and the distances traveled in all subsequent bounce cycles.
Total Distance $D = (\text{Initial drop}) + (\text{Distance in bounce 1}) + (\text{Distance in bounce 2}) + (\text{Distance in bounce 3}) + \dots$
$D = 9 + 12 + 8 + \frac{16}{3} + \frac{32}{9} + \dots$

Step 6: Recognize the series of bounce distances as a geometric series.
The sequence of distances from the bounce cycles (12, 8, $\frac{16}{3}$, ...) is a geometric sequence.
Let the first term be $a = 12$.
The common ratio $r$ is the ratio of any term to the preceding term.
$r = \frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3}$.
$r = \frac{16/3}{8} = \frac{16}{3 \times 8} = \frac{16}{24} = \frac{2}{3}$.
So, the distances from the bounce cycles form an infinite geometric series with first term $a=12$ and common ratio $r=\frac{2}{3}$.

Step 7: Calculate the sum of the infinite geometric series.
The sum of an infinite geometric series $a + ar + ar^2 + \dots$ is given by the formula $S = \frac{a}{1-r}$, provided that the absolute value of the common ratio $|r|$ is less than 1.
In this case, $a = 12$ and $r = \frac{2}{3}$.
Since $|r| = |\frac{2}{3}| = \frac{2}{3} < 1$, the series converges, and its sum is:
$S = \frac{12}{1 - \frac{2}{3}} = \frac{12}{\frac{3}{3} - \frac{2}{3}} = \frac{12}{\frac{1}{3}} = 12 \times 3 = 36$ feet.
This sum $S=36$ represents the total distance traveled by the ball during all the bounce cycles combined (up and down, starting from the first bounce).

Step 8: Calculate the total distance traveled before the ball stops.
The total distance is the sum of the initial drop and the total distance traveled during all the bounce cycles.
Total Distance $D = (\text{Initial drop}) + (\text{Sum of distances from bounce cycles})$
$D = 9 + 36$
$D = 45$ feet.

Alternative calculation using the height series:
The total distance can also be seen as the initial drop plus twice the sum of all upward distances (since each upward distance equals the subsequent downward distance).
Initial drop = 9 feet.
Upward distances: 6, 4, $\frac{8}{3}$, ...
This is a geometric series with first term $a_u = 6$ and common ratio $r = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$.
The sum of upward distances is $S_u = \frac{6}{1 - \frac{2}{3}} = \frac{6}{\frac{1}{3}} = 18$ feet.
The downward distances (after the initial drop) are the same: 6, 4, $\frac{8}{3}$, ...
The sum of downward distances (after initial drop) is $S_d = 18$ feet.
Total distance $D = (\text{Initial drop}) + S_u + S_d = 9 + 18 + 18 = 45$ feet.

Both methods yield the same result, confirming the answer. The use of the geometric series is essential to sum the infinite number of distances traveled in the bounces. The ball ""stops"" when the height of the bounce becomes infinitesimally small, and the total distance converges to a finite value because the common ratio of the geometric series is less than 1.

The final answer is $\boxed{45 \text{ feet}}$.",True,1,0,0

Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.

 Hint: Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74
Lemp 47 94
Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =

It can't be x+y (that would be more than ""1"") so it must be x-y=1. By simple substitution the answer is revealed.",GeminiFlash,hintPrompt,"Let the two whole numbers be $x$ and $y$.
We are given that the square of one whole number minus the square of another whole number equals 73.
We can write this equation as $x^2 - y^2 = 73$.

Since the result is positive, $x^2$ must be greater than $y^2$. As $x$ and $y$ are whole numbers (non-negative integers), this implies $x > y$. If $y=0$, $x^2 = 73$, and $x = \sqrt{73}$, which is not a whole number. Thus, $y$ must be a positive whole number. So, $x$ and $y$ are positive integers with $x > y$.

We can factor the left side of the equation using the difference of squares formula: $x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y)$.
So, the equation becomes: $(x - y)(x + y) = 73$.

Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x - y$ and $x + y$ must also be integers.
Since $x > y \ge 1$ (because $y=0$ does not work), we have:
1. $x - y$ is a positive integer.
2. $x + y$ is a positive integer.
3. Since $y > 0$, we have $x + y > x - y$.

We need to find two positive integer factors of 73 whose product is 73.
Let's consider the number 73. The hint mentions that 73 is similar to 41, 29, 19, etc. These numbers are all prime numbers.
Let's check if 73 is a prime number. We can test for divisibility by prime numbers up to $\sqrt{73}$.
$\sqrt{73}$ is between $\sqrt{64}=8$ and $\sqrt{81}=9$.
The prime numbers less than 9 are 2, 3, 5, 7.
- 73 is not divisible by 2 (it's an odd number).
- The sum of the digits of 73 is $7 + 3 = 10$, which is not divisible by 3, so 73 is not divisible by 3.
- 73 does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.
- $73 \div 7 = 10$ with a remainder of $3$, so 73 is not divisible by 7.
Since 73 is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to its square root, 73 is a prime number.

The only positive integer factors of a prime number like 73 are 1 and the number itself (73).
We have the product of two factors, $(x - y)$ and $(x + y)$, equal to 73.
Since $x - y$ and $x + y$ are positive integers and $x + y > x - y$, we must have:
$x - y = 1$
$x + y = 73$

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables $x$ and $y$.
Equation 1: $x - y = 1$
Equation 2: $x + y = 73$

We can solve this system by adding the two equations:
$(x - y) + (x + y) = 1 + 73$
$2x = 74$
$x = \frac{74}{2}$
$x = 37$

Now substitute the value of $x$ into either equation. Using Equation 1:
$37 - y = 1$
$y = 37 - 1$
$y = 36$

The two numbers are 37 and 36. Both are whole numbers.
Let's verify our solution by substituting these values back into the original equation:
$x^2 - y^2 = 37^2 - 36^2$
$37^2 = 1369$
$36^2 = 1296$
$1369 - 1296 = 73$.
The equation holds true.

The hint about 73 being similar to 41, 29, 19 etc. is useful because these are all prime numbers. If the problem involved a composite number (e.g., $x^2 - y^2 = 12$), the factors of 12 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12) would offer more pairs for $(x-y, x+y)$, such as (1, 12) or (2, 6) or (3, 4). For each pair, we would solve the system of equations. For the solutions $x = (a+b)/2$ and $y = (b-a)/2$ to be integers, the factors $a$ and $b$ must have the same parity (both even or both odd). For a number like 12, pairs like (1, 12) and (3, 4) have factors with different parity, leading to non-integer solutions for $x$ and $y$. The pair (2, 6) has factors with the same parity, leading to integer solutions $x=(2+6)/2=4$ and $y=(6-2)/2=2$. Indeed, $4^2-2^2 = 16-4=12$.
When the number is an odd prime $p$, the only factor pairs are $(1, p)$. Since 1 and $p$ are both odd, $(1+p)/2$ and $(p-1)/2$ are integers. This confirms that for any odd prime $p$, there is exactly one pair of whole numbers $x, y$ satisfying $x^2 - y^2 = p$.

In our case, 73 is an odd prime, so the factor pair is $(1, 73)$. This uniquely determines $x$ and $y$ as calculated above.

The two numbers are 37 and 36.

The final answer is $\boxed{37, 36}$.",True,1,0,0
