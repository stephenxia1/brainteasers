0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Label the six coastal villages ​0,1,2,3,4,5​ in clockwise order around the circular island.  
Assume the three brothers all live in village 0 and wish to marry girls who live in the next three villages encountered clockwise – i.e. in villages 1, 2 and 3.

For every pair of villages there is a straight jungle path, so the graph of the routes is the complete graph K₆ drawn on the six vertices of a regular hexagon.  
For a given destination D we call the (straight–line) Euclidean distance from a village V to D the “level” of V with respect to D.  
A suitor is allowed to move only along an edge that leads to a strictly lower level, so every admissible route is a strictly descending chain of levels; consequently no route can revisit a village and the directed graph is acyclic.

-------------------------------------------------
Counting the admissible routes

1.  Destination 1  (bride in village 1)

Levels with respect to 1  
distance 0 : {1}  
distance 1 : {0,2}  
distance √3 : {3,5}  
distance 2 : {4}

The suitor starts at village 0 (level 1).  
The only adjoining vertex of lower level is the destination itself, so there is exactly

 N₀→₁ = 1  route : 0 → 1.

2.  Destination 2  (bride in village 2)

Levels with respect to 2  
distance 0 : {2}  
distance 1 : {1,3}  
distance √3 : {0,4}  
distance 2 : {5}

From 0 (level √3) one may go to 1, 3 or 2.  
Continuing from 1 or 3 one can only go on to 2.  
Thus

 N₀→₂ = 0→2 , 0→1→2 , 0→3→2  = 3 routes.

3.  Destination 3  (bride in village 3)

Levels with respect to 3  
distance 0 : {3}  
distance 1 : {2,4}  
distance √3 : {1,5}  
distance 2 : {0}

Work upward from the destination:

P(3)=1.  
P(2)=P(4)=1 (they can only go directly to 3).  
P(1)=P(5)=P(2)+P(4)+P(3)=3.  
Finally

 N₀→₃ = P(1)+P(5)+P(2)+P(4)+P(3)=3+3+1+1+1=9 routes.

-------------------------------------------------
Wedding dates

Each suitor makes one trip per day, starting April 1, and marries the day after his last trip.

• Bride in village 1 : 1 route → finished April 1 → wedding April 2.  
• Bride in village 2 : 3 routes → finished April 3 → wedding April 4.  
• Bride in village 3 : 9 routes → finished April 9 → wedding April 10.

So the three wedding days are

 April 2, April 4, and April 10.

-------------------------------------------------
Bonus – length of the longest admissible route

Let the island’s circumference be 10 mi.  
Then the radius is R = (10 mi)/(2π) = 5/π mi.

Useful chord lengths (central angle θ):
θ = 60° → L₆₀ = 2R sin30° = R  
θ = 120° → L₁₂₀ = 2R sin60° = R√3  
θ = 180° → L₁₈₀ = 2R.

Among the nine admissible routes from 0 to 3 the longest are

 0 → 1 (L₆₀) 1 → 4 (L₁₈₀) 4 → 3 (L₆₀)

 0 → 5 (L₆₀) 5 → 2 (L₁₈₀) 2 → 3 (L₆₀)

Each has total length  
L₆₀ + L₁₈₀ + L₆₀ = R + 2R + R = 4R = 4·(5/π) = 20/π ≈ 6.37 miles.

-------------------------------------------------
Final answer:  
The weddings take place on April 2, April 4 and April 10.

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)
10,15 (2,3)
So the five smallest numbers with this property are:

3529411764705882
4705882352941176
5882352941176470
Notice that 2352941176470588 can be rotated TWICE, yielding 1.5 times the number each time since the 4->6->9 n digits are in order.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the sought-after number be  
N = d·10^{k−1} + r  

where  
• k = number of digits,  
• d (1 ≤ d ≤ 9) = first (left–most) digit,  
• r = remaining k−1 digits (0 ≤ r < 10^{k−1}).  

Left–rotating N moves d to the right end, giving  
N' = 10·r + d.

The condition is  
N' = 3/2 · N.

Substitute N and N':

10r + d = (3/2)(d·10^{k−1} + r)  
⇨ 20r + 2d = 3d·10^{k−1} + 3r  
⇨ 17r + 2d = 3d·10^{k−1}  
⇨ r = d(3·10^{k−1} − 2)/17.          (1)

Because r is an integer and d is not divisible by 17 (d ≤ 9), the factor  
3·10^{k−1} − 2 must be divisible by 17.

Thus we need k such that  
3·10^{k−1} ≡ 2 (mod 17).

Compute 10^{n} mod 17 (period 16):

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
10^{n} mod 17 : 1 10 15 14 4 6 9 5 16 7 2 3 13 11 8 12

Multiply each by 3 mod 17:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
3·10^{n} mod 17 : 3 13 11 8 12 1 10 15 14 4 6 9 5 16 7 2

We obtain 2 at n = 15, i.e. k–1 = 15 → k = 16.  
So the smallest possible number must have 16 digits.

Now compute r from (1) with k = 16:

r = d(3·10^{15} − 2)/17.

Take the smallest possible d = 1 (to minimise N):

3·10^{15} − 2 = 2,999,999,999,999,998  
Divide by 17:

r = 176,470,588,235,294.

Hence

N = d·10^{15} + r  
  = 1·10^{15} + 176,470,588,235,294  
  = 1,176,470,588,235,294.

Verification:

Left rotation: 176,470,588,235,294·10 + 1 = 1,764,705,882,352,941.  
1.5 · N = 3/2 · 1,176,470,588,235,294 = 1,764,705,882,352,941.

The condition holds, and no shorter number is possible.

5,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Ralph was impressed by the ingenuity of Rex's last attempt using clues involving prime numbers, but he thinks he's got an even better one for Rex. He tells Rex he's thinking of a 6-digit number.

Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the six-digit number be

No solution for e = 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Case e = 2
a+b+c+d = 18; a+b = f+2 ⇒ c+d = 16–f.
ef must be 23 or 29; hence f = 3 or 9.

•  f = 3   (ef = 23 prime)  
   a+b = 5.  The only way to get a two–digit prime ab with sum 5 is 41.  
   So a = 4, b = 1.  
   Then c+d = 16 – 3 = 13.  
   With unused digits the only pair summing to 13 that forms a prime is 67.  
   Thus c = 6, d = 7.  
   Number: 416 723.   All digits distinct; ab = 41, cd = 67, ef = 23 are prime.

•  f = 9   (ef = 29 prime)  
   a+b = 11.  Possible prime ab with distinct digits: 47 or 83.  
   Both force c+d = 7, which cannot be achieved with unused distinct digits
   that yield a prime cd.  No solution.

Hence the only candidate so far is 416 723.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Case e = 3
a+b+c+d = 27; a+b = f+3 ⇒ c+d = 24–f.  
ef must be 31 or 37 ⇒ f = 1 or 7.

• f = 1 ⇒ a+b = 4: gives no prime ab with distinct digits.  
• f = 7 ⇒ a+b = 10: only prime ab is 19, leaving c+d = 17, impossible
  without repeating 9.  No solution.

Thus the unique six–digit number satisfying the first three sets of clues is

N = 416 723.

The “rotation–sum” clue  
The six cyclic rotations of N are

416 723, 167 234, 672 341, 723 416, 234 167, 341 672.

Their sum is 2 555 553.  
Its first digit is 2 and its last digit is 3 – exactly the digits e and f (2 and 3) in some order, as required.

Final answer: 416723",True,1,0
6,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True,0,0
7,Find the radius of the inscribed and circumscribed circles for a triangle.,Try to use the area of the triangle,"Let a, b, and c be the sides of the triangle. Let s be the semiperimeter, i.e. s = (a + b + c) / 2. Let A be the area of the triangle, and let x be the radius of the incircle.
Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.
We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).
The radius of the circumscribed circle is given by R = abc/4A.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the triangle have side-lengths  

 a = BC , b = CA , c = AB  

and denote  

 Δ = area of the triangle,  
 p = (a + b + c)/2  (the semiperimeter).

1.  Inradius r (radius of the inscribed circle)

   The circle that is tangent to all three sides has radius  

  r = Δ / p = 2Δ / (a + b + c).

   Proof outline  
   • The inscribed circle divides the triangle into three smaller triangles with common height r and bases a, b, c.  
   • The sum of their areas is therefore  
  (1/2) a r + (1/2) b r + (1/2) c r = r(a + b + c)/2 = r p.  
   • This must equal the whole area Δ, hence r p = Δ, giving r = Δ/p.

2.  Circumradius R (radius of the circumscribed circle)

   The circle that passes through the three vertices has radius  

  R = abc / (4Δ).

   Proof outline  
   • In any triangle,  Δ = (abc)/(4R).  
     This follows, for example, from the extended law of sines:  
  a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C = 2R.  
     Using A = angle opposite a etc., we have  
  Δ = (1/2) bc sin A, but sin A = a/(2R).  
     Substituting gives Δ = (1/2) bc · a/(2R) = abc/(4R).  
   • Hence R = abc/(4Δ).

Therefore, given the side lengths or area (by Heron’s formula Δ = √[p(p−a)(p−b)(p−c)]), one finds

 Inradius  r = 2Δ / (a + b + c),  
 Circumradius R = abc / (4Δ).

Final answer: r = 2Δ / (a + b + c) and R = abc / (4Δ), where Δ = √[p(p−a)(p−b)(p−c)], p = (a + b + c)/2.",True,1,0
8,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""
""The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.""
Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True,0,0
9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel.

10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

Translate the story into equations.

Night-time divisions  
1.  N = 5a + 1       (one extra coconut goes to the monkey)  
    After the first man leaves with a, 4a coconuts remain.

2.  4a = 5b + 1      (second man finds one extra, gives it away)  
    4b remain.

3.  4b = 5c + 1      (third man)  
    4c remain.

4.  4c = 5d + 1      (fourth man)  
    4d remain.

5.  4d = 5e + 1      (fifth man)  
    4e remain.

Morning division  
6.  4e = 5k          (now it divides evenly into five piles).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Force divisibilities from the last two equations
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Equation (6) ⇒ 4e is a multiple of 5 ⇒ e ≡ 0 (mod 5).  
Write e = 5m.

Equation (5): 4d = 5e + 1 = 25m + 1  
⇒ d = (25m + 1)/4.  
For d to be an integer, 25m + 1 must be divisible by 4.  
Since 25 ≡ 1 (mod 4), 25m + 1 ≡ m + 1 (mod 4);  
therefore m + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ m ≡ 3 (mod 4).  
Write m = 4n + 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Keep working backwards
--------------------------------------------------------------------
d = (25(4n + 3) + 1)/4 = (100n + 75 + 1)/4 = 25n + 19.

Equation (4): 4c = 5d + 1  
⇒ 4c = 5(25n + 19) + 1 = 125n + 96  
⇒ c = (125n + 96)/4.  

Because 125 ≡ 1 (mod 4), 125n + 96 ≡ n (mod 4).  
So n ≡ 0 (mod 4).  Write n = 4p.

Then c = (125·4p + 96)/4 = 125p + 24.

Equation (3): 4b = 5c + 1  
⇒ 4b = 5(125p + 24) + 1 = 625p + 121  
⇒ b = (625p + 121)/4.

Now 625 ≡ 1 (mod 4), so 625p + 121 ≡ p + 1 (mod 4).  
Thus p + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ p ≡ 3 (mod 4).  
Write p = 4q + 3.

Then b = (625(4q + 3) + 121)/4  
      = (2500q + 1875 + 121)/4  
      = (2500q + 1996)/4  
      = 625q + 499.

Equation (2): 4a = 5b + 1  
⇒ 4a = 5(625q + 499) + 1 = 3125q + 2496  
⇒ a = (3125q + 2496)/4.

Because 3125 ≡ 1 (mod 4), 3125q + 2496 ≡ q (mod 4).  
Hence q ≡ 0 (mod 4).  Write q = 4r.

Then a = (3125·4r + 2496)/4  
      = (12500r + 2496)/4  
      = 3125r + 624.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Reconstruct the original pile
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Equation (1): N = 5a + 1  
⇒ N = 5(3125r + 624) + 1  
⇒ N = 15625r + 3121.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4: Least positive solution
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Take the smallest non-negative integer r = 0.  
Then N = 3121.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5: Quick check
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Start with 3121:

• 1st man: 3121 = 5·624 + 1 → leaves 4·624 = 2496  
• 2nd man: 2496 = 5·499 + 1 → leaves 4·499 = 1996  
• 3rd man: 1996 = 5·399 + 1 → leaves 4·399 = 1596  
• 4th man: 1596 = 5·319 + 1 → leaves 4·319 = 1276  
• 5th man: 1276 = 5·255 + 1 → leaves 4·255 = 1020  
• Morning: 1020 = 5·204, no remainder.

Everything matches the story, so 3121 is indeed the smallest possible starting number.

12,"In ""4+4+4+4=1!"" it was shown that just using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can form all the numbers from 0 to 9 using exactly four 4's.
For example: 7 = 4 + 4 - 4/4
Now if you add the operations square root, factorial, and exponent, what is the first number counting up from zero that can't be formed? How can each number be formed?
You may use parentheses, but you may not combine fours to make 44 or 444.
(An exponent is raising a number to the power of another number such as 4^4 = 256; a factorial is the product of all the integers from 1 to the integer such as 4! = 1x2x3x4 = 24.)",The first number that can't be formed is 39.,"The first number that can't be formed is 39.

14,"This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?",Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11

15,"I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?","Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.

16,"The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True,0,0

Furthermore, from conditions 3 and 7 we know that CD is divisible by 4 and GH is divisible by 8 (because FGH is divisible by 8 and F is even). Because C and G are odd, D and H must be 2 and 6 in some order.
From conditions 2 and 5, we know that A+B+C, D+E+F, G+H+I are all divisible by 3.
If D=2, then F=8, H=6, B=4. A+4+C is divisible by 3, therefore A and C must be 1 and 7 in some order, G and I must be 3 and 9 in some order. G6 is divisible by 8, therefore G=9. But neither 1472589 nor 7412589 is divisible by 7.

     from {1,…,9} and F even.  
6.  Finally ABCDEFG must be a multiple of 7, and the whole number must of
    course use every digit 1,…,9 once.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – find the possible triples FGH

List all multiples of 8 between 200 and 900 whose digits are in {1,…,9}
and are all different:

216, 248, 264, 296,  
416, 432, 472, 496,  
624, 632, 648, 672,  
816, 824, 832, 864, 872, 896.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – use condition (★)

a)  F = 2                     ⇒  D ≡ 1 (mod 3) ⇒ D = 8.
    Then CD must be 28, 48, 68; each of these uses up the last even digit.
    No even digit is left for B, so F = 2 is impossible.

b)  F = 4                     ⇒  D ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ D = 6 (D must be even).
    Keep only the FGH triples that start with 4 and avoid repeated digits:
        432, 472.
    (416 and 496 repeat the digit 6.)

c)  F = 6                     ⇒  D ≡ 2 (mod 3) ⇒ D = 8.
    With D = 8 the pair CD must be 28, 48 or 68, each using the last even
    digit, leaving none for B.  Hence F = 6 is impossible.

d)  F = 8                     ⇒  D ≡ 2 (mod 3) ⇒ D = 2.
    But F = 8 already uses 8, and CD would have to end in …2, which is
    not divisible by 4.  So F = 8 is impossible.

The only viable case is therefore

  F = 4, D = 6, FGH = 432  or  472.

Step 3 – treat the two remaining sub-cases

I.   FGH = 432  ⇒ G = 3, H = 2.  
     Even digits used so far: 4,6,2.  
     The only even digit left for B is 8  ⇒ B = 8.

     With D = 6, the pair C6 must be 16, 36 or 96.
     (56 is forbidden – 5 is already used; 76 duplicates 7.)

     • C = 1 gives A = 9 (to make A+B+C ≡ 0 mod 3).
       The 7-digit prefix 9816543 is NOT divisible by 7.

     • C = 7 or 9 can be checked similarly; neither yields the 7-divisibility.
     Hence FGH = 432 is impossible.

II.  FGH = 472  ⇒ G = 7, H = 2.  
     Even digits used so far: 4,6,2.  
     The only unused even digit is 8  ⇒ B = 8.

     Now C6 must be 16, 36 or 96.

     • If C = 1 then A + 8 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 3)  ⇒ A ≡ 0 (mod 3).
       The unused digits are 3 and 9; choose A = 3 (or 9), I = 9 (or 3).

       Take A = 3, I = 9.  The complete number is
                3 8 1 6 5 4 7 2 9
       Check the remaining conditions:

       – 38 even ✔  
       – 381 divisible by 3 ✔  
       – 3816 ends in 16 ⇒ ÷4 ✔  
       – 38165 ends in 5 ✔  
       – 381654 even, digit-sum 27 ⇒ ÷6 ✔

       All conditions are satisfied.

     • C = 3 or 9 can be tested; neither gives the 7-divisibility.

ln B ≈ 700·1.09861228867 = 769.028602068

Since ln B > ln A, we have B > A; i.e. 3⁷⁰⁰ is larger.

How much larger?  
Difference of the logs:

Δ = ln B − ln A ≈ 769.028602068 − 762.461898616  
  = 6.566703452

Hence  

B / A = e^Δ ≈ e^6.566703452.

Convert Δ to base-10 logarithm:

Δ / ln 10 = 6.566703452 / 2.302585093 ≈ 2.851884.

Hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras: R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.

Easy solution:
Assume the hole is infinitely small (i.e. a radius of 0). Then, the volume of the cylinder (and the volume of the caps) is 0. The height of the cap is 0, so the radius of the sphere (r) is 3cm (half of the length of the cylindrical hole). Thus:

• The centre of the court is the centre of the square floor, i.e. (L/2 , L/2).

The point of the office that meets the court is its furthest corner (16, 8).

36,"A man smokes and drinks coffee lightened with cream. He is absolutely consistent in his habits. Every day, except every four years when he abstains on Leap Day, he smokes the same number of cigarettes, brews the same amount of coffee grinds, and uses the same amount of cream in his coffee. Every day he buys the daily newspaper, which he purchases more often than a pack of 20 cigarettes. The pack of cigarettes is purchased more often than a half-pint of cream, which in turn is purchased more often than a one pound can of coffee. On Flag Day (USA) he purchased all four items. The next time he purchased all four items on the same day was the Fourth of July of the following year. How many cigarettes does he smoke each day?",Flag Day (USA) is June 14,"4 cigarettes a day.
The purchases are made according to 4 different cycles. There are 385 days from Flag Day until July Fourth of the following year excluding Leap Day. These purchasing cycles intersect every 385 days and are thus in the set of factors for 385 (1, 5, 7, 11, and 385). Since the newspaper is purchased every day, and the coffee and cream are purchased more often then the pack of cigarettes, then the pack is purchased either every 5 days or every 7 days.  The pack contains 20 cigarettes which only has the factor 5 in common with the possible cycle for the cigarettes.  Therefore a pack of 20 is purchased every 5 days.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Flag Day in the United States is June 14.  
The next time the man bought all four items together was on the following year’s Independence Day, July 4.  
Working in an ordinary (non-leap) year, count the days between those two dates.

From June 14 to Dec 31 of that year: 365 – 165 = 200 days  
( June 14 is the 165th day of a non-leap year.)  

From Jan 1 to July 4 of the next year: 185 days  

Total interval between the two “all-four-items” purchases  
= 200 + 185 = 385 days.

Thus 385 days is the least common multiple of the three purchase intervals
(pack of cigarettes, half-pint of cream, one-pound can of coffee).

Factor 385: 385 = 5 × 7 × 11.

Because the newspaper is bought every day, we need three different divisors of 385 for the other three items, with the constraint that

newspapers are bought most often  
→ cigarettes are bought next most often  
→ cream next  
→ coffee least often.

Hence the only possible assignment of the factors is

cigarettes every 5 days  
cream every  7 days  
coffee every 11 days.

A pack holds 20 cigarettes, so smoking the same amount each day and finishing a pack exactly every 5 days means

20 cigarettes ÷ 5 days = 4 cigarettes per day.

(Leap-day abstention does not affect this interval, because the 385-day span considered contains no February 29.)

Let N = a b c d (an integer because ages are integers).  
Then V = N⁵ − N.  We want (N⁵ − N) mod 10.

Factor: N⁵ − N = N(N⁴ − 1) = N(N − 1)(N + 1)(N² + 1).

• Among any two consecutive integers, one is even, so the product above is even ⇒ divisible by 2.  
• Among N, N − 1, N + 1, one is a multiple of 5, so the product is divisible by 5.

Therefore N⁵ − N is divisible by both 2 and 5, hence by 10.  
So (N⁵ − N) mod 10 = 0.

Thus the remainder Ralph stated is 0.

We need  

 P = k³ with 10 ≤ k ≤ 99.  (1)

Goal: find the smallest possible N (numerical value).

1. How many digits can N have?  
   • For an m–digit number the largest possible digit–product is 9^m.  
   • The smallest cube in (1) is 10³ = 1000.  
     9² = 81  (<1000) → m ≥ 3  
     9³ = 729 (<1000) → m ≥ 4  
     So N has at least 4 digits.

2. If N had more than 4 digits it would be ≥ 10 000, already larger than many 4–digit
   numbers; hence we only have to examine 4–digit candidates.

   Let the digits be d₁d₂d₃d₄.  Re–ordering the same multiset of digits can only increase
   the numerical value once the digits are arranged in non-decreasing order,
   so the smallest 4–digit number attainable with a given multiset is the sorted one.

3. Upper bound for the product with 4 digits: 9⁴ = 6561.  
   Therefore the only cubes to check are those not exceeding 6561:

        10³ 11³ 12³ 13³ 14³ 15³ 16³ 17³ 18³
        1000 1331 1728 2197 2744 3375 4096 4913 5832

4. Try each cube and look for a factorisation into four allowable digits (1 … 9).

   • 1000 = 2³·5³  
     Only possibility: 5·5·5·8 (because three 5’s supply 5³ and one 8 supplies 2³).  
     Digits 5,5,5,8 → smallest number 5558.

   • 1331 = 11³ – impossible (only prime 11 appears).

   • 1728 = 2⁶·3³.  
     Begin with the smallest possible first digit:

       – If first digit is 3: remaining product must be 1728/3 = 576.  
         The only triple of digits ≤9 with product 576 is 8·8·9.  
         So digits are 3,8,8,9 → smallest number 3889.

       – If first digit is 2: remaining product 864 cannot be achieved with three
         digits ≤9.  
       – If first digit is 1: remaining product would exceed 729 – impossible.

     Hence the only 4–digit realisation for 1728 is 3889.

   • For the larger cubes (2197, 2744, 3375, 4096, 4913, 5832) one checks quickly
     that no factorisation into four digits ≤9 exists (because some prime factor
     exceeds 9 or a required exponent cannot be reached with four digits).

5. Compare the attainable 4–digit numbers: 5558 (from 1000) and 3889 (from 1728).  
   The latter is smaller.

6. Any 5-digit number is at least 10 000 > 3889, so no longer number can beat 3889.

Therefore the least positive integer whose digit–product is the cube of a two-digit
integer is 3889.

First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage. The only way to get 7 as the number of factors is 1 x 7. So the prime factorization of any number with 7 factors is n^6 times x^0, where n and x are both primes. But if you look, x^0, for all nonzero values of x, is 1! So, any number with exactly 7 factors must be a prime raised to the sixth power. This yields 2^6 +3^6+5^6 = 16418. Any prime 7 or greater to the sixth power is greater than 20,000.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 –  Which numbers have exactly seven positive divisors?  
For an integer n = p₁^{a₁} p₂^{a₂} … (prime-factorisation),
the number of divisors is (a₁+1)(a₂+1)… .
To obtain 7 divisors we need (a₁+1)(a₂+1)… = 7,
and because 7 is prime this is possible only when a₁+1 = 7 and all the
other factors equal 1.  
Hence a₁ = 6 and n = p^{6}.  

So every positive integer with exactly seven divisors is the sixth power
of a prime.

Step 2 –  List those sixth powers below 20 000.  
2^{6}=64, 3^{6}=729, 5^{6}=15 625  
(the next one, 7^{6}=117 649, already exceeds 20 000).

Thus the only positive integers that themselves possess exactly seven
factors and are <20 000 are

64, 729 and 15 625.

Step 3 –  Form all sums of three
different
numbers taken from {64, 729, 15 625}.  
Because there are just three available candidates, choosing three
different ones forces us to take all of them once:

64 + 729 + 15 625 = 16 418 .

Step 4 –  Check that no other integer <20 000 can be produced in that
way.  

• We have already used every element of {64, 729, 15 625};  
• any other triple would repeat at least one of them, hence would not
consist of three different integers;  
• there are no further sixth powers below 20 000 to use.

Therefore 16 418 is the single positive integer below 20 000 that can be
written as the sum of three positive integers, each of which has exactly
seven divisors.

   squares : 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81  primes : 11–97.

2.  Structural restrictions
   •  No digit may repeat and zero is forbidden, so an 8-digit squime must use exactly eight of the nine digits 1–9.  
   •  Digits 2 and 8 have no in-edges; therefore 8 cannot occur at all (it cannot be first), and 2 must be the first digit.  
   •  Digit 5 has only one in-edge (2 → 5) so 2 must be immediately followed by 5.  
   •  Digit 4 has only one in-edge (6 → 4) so 6 must be immediately followed by 4.  
   •  Digit 9 has only one out-edge (9 → 7); if 9 is not the last digit, it must be followed by 7.

   Consequently every squime is a Hamilton path through the eight digits

integer total of the stored scores has to lie in

      n(R – 0.005)  ≤  total ≤  n(R + 0.005).                                (†)

Because the totals must be integers, (†) nearly always pins the total down to one
single value, from which a set of integer scores that realises the total can be
constructed.  Among the many possible decompositions the one with the smallest
number of intermediate votes (1,2,3) and the largest possible number of extreme votes
(0 or 4) has been taken as the “best guess’’—it answers the question
“how many were definitely positive (‘fun’, ‘hard’) before my vote?’’

(The counts are not unique; any other distribution that gives the same totals would
work just as well.  The unavoidable ±0.005 uncertainty in every published mean is
what the problem statement calls “experimental error”.)

The resulting counts are:

                                      before your vote
              n  total fun   fun +4s        total diff   diff +4s

Teaser P  44     94         23              76          18

So, the “best-guess’’ answers to the question are

Teaser M: 16 fun votes, 4 of them positive; 16 difficulty votes, 4 of them “hard”.  
Teaser N: 18 fun votes, 9 of them positive; 18 difficulty votes, 10 of them “hard”.  
Teaser O: 25 fun votes, 6 of them positive; 25 difficulty votes, 17 of them “hard”.  
Teaser P: 44 fun votes, 23 of them positive; 44 difficulty votes, 18 of them “hard”.

Likely source of the “experimental error’’  
The only appreciable discrepancy between the reverse-engineered formula and the
published numbers comes from the fact that Braingle rounds every displayed mean
to the nearest 0.01.  When one works backwards, each rounded figure represents an
interval 0.01 wide, so the reconstructed integer totals – and hence the computed
numbers of positive votes – can be off by 1 in either direction.  No other systematic
bias is needed to explain the observed data.",True,0,0

""I know her,"" Patty said.  ""She looks like she could use some help.  I think she broke a heel off her shoe.""
Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.
""This is my sole sister,"" the girl groaned, ""with the obvious name.""
Kurt looked blank.  After a few seconds, Rod's face lit up.
""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""
""Right,"" she grumbled, ""and it tastes like recycled history essays?""
The three grinned broadly at her.  ""Try one,"" Kurt said, proffering one of the shrink-wrapped torpedoes.
Eileen shifted some of her weight back to the toe of the damaged right shoe and tentatively accepted the Rnkfurer.  She unwrapped it, took one bite, and saw her ecstatic grin reflected on the faces of the other three.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""We were about to go order more tomorrow.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""
Eileen got it right away.  ""So we each get 25 of them, and have 25% of the total.""
Rod grinned.  ""That's cheating.  We use different numbers.""
""Oh, all right.""  She thought for a few seconds.  ""So you can do it a few ways for two people, round off for three, but we couldn't do it for four.""
""Really?""  Rod wasn't as quick with the enlarged problem.  ""I'm not surprised, but that means we'll just have to buy in pairs.""
""Or change the rules a little,"" Eileen added.
""How so?""  Kurt was ready to do almost anything that would get a Rnkfurer refill.
""Well, how about if Kurt buys twice as many as Rod's percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt's percentage ...""
Kurt looked hopeful, Patty was expectant, and Rod's analytical gears were grinding.
""It's a big order, but we could do it,"" he finally declared.

Patti        45, 7.5% ... 7.5 * 2 = 15
Eileen        15
TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

From (3) E = (200 P)/T = (200)^3 R / T³

Divide both sides of the last equality by R (R ≠ 0):

 1 = (200)^4 / T^4  ⇒ T = 200.

With T known, (1) gives K = R; then (2) gives P = R; (3) gives E = R.

 4R = 200  ⇒ R = 50.

Therefore

The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The balcony is like so in order for the spot light (that shines at a 45 degree angle to the roof) will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony.
Pine is cheap at exactly $1 per 5000cm^3, tax included.

If the spot light shines at a 45 degree angle and the spot light will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony, then the radius of the balcony floor will be 3 meters (if the hypotenuse of a triangle is at a 45 degree angle to the y axis (and the side x is 90 degrees to the side y), the side x will always equal the side y and the remaining side will be the hypotenuse of those [the rules of an isosceles triangle]).","[SEE HINT]
Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:
let a represent the height of the room, then b represent the height of the balcony off the floor, then f represent the thickness of the balcony floor, then r represent a-b or the radius of the balcony floor, then h represent the height of the fence.

• The spot-lights are 7 m above the floor.  
• The balcony floor has to be 4 m above the floor.  
  Vertical drop from the lights to the balcony = 7 m – 4 m = 3 m.  
• The beam makes a 45° angle; at 45° the horizontal reach equals the vertical drop.  
  Therefore the horizontal distance from the centre of the balcony to its edge (its radius) must also be 3 m.

So,   radius r = 3 m = 300 cm.

Step-2:  Volume of the balcony floor (a full circular disc)  
Thickness t = 30 cm = 0.30 m.  
Area = πr² = π(3 m)² = 9π m².  
Volume = Area × thickness = 9π m² × 0.30 m = 2.7π m³.

Convert to cubic centimetres (1 m³ = 1 000 000 cm³):  
V_floor = 2.7π × 1 000 000 = 2 700 000 π cm³.

Step-3:  Volume of the fence (only the front half of the circumference)  
Height h = 1 m = 100 cm.  
Radial thickness w = 10 cm.  
Length of the half-circumference = πr = π(300 cm) = 300π cm.

The fence is simply a “board” 10 cm thick running that length, so  
V_fence = length × thickness × height

The average of  11 and  47  is 29,
the average of  11 and 71 is  41,
the average of  47 and 71 is  59,
and the average of all three numbers is  43 .",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the three different two–digit primes be denoted by  
a, b, c (with a < b < c).

1.  Pairwise averages  
   Because every two–digit prime is odd, the sum of any two of them is even, so  
   a + b = 2p, a + c = 2q, b + c = 2r  
   where p, q, r must themselves be prime (the three required pairwise averages).

2.  Expressing a, b, c in terms of p, q, r  
   Adding the three equations gives  
   a + b + c = p + q + r.  
   Subtracting in pairs we obtain  
   a = p + q − r, b = p + r − q, c = q + r − p. (★)

3.  Average of all three numbers  
   The problem also demands that (a + b + c)/3 be prime.  
   Using the sum found above, this is  
   (p + q + r)/3.  
   Therefore p + q + r must be divisible by 3 and the quotient must be prime.

   • None of p, q, r can be 3, because an average of two two–digit numbers is at least 11.  
   • Every prime >3 is congruent to 1 or 2 (mod 3).  
     Hence p, q, r must all be congruent to 1 (mod 3) or all to 2 (mod 3) so that their sum is 0 (mod 3).

4.  A successful choice  
   Try primes that are 2 (mod 3):

   p = 29, q = 41, r = 59  (all prime, all ≡ 2 (mod 3))  
   p + q + r = 29 + 41 + 59 = 129, and 129/3 = 43 is prime.

   Now use (★):

   a = p + q − r = 29 + 41 − 59 = 11  
   b = p + r − q = 29 + 59 − 41 = 47  
   c = q + r − p = 41 + 59 − 29 = 71

   All three numbers are two–digit primes.

5.  Verification  
   (a + b)/2 = (11 + 47)/2 = 29 (prime)  
   (a + c)/2 = (11 + 71)/2 = 41 (prime)  
   (b + c)/2 = (47 + 71)/2 = 59 (prime)  
   (a + b + c)/3 = (11 + 47 + 71)/3 = 43 (prime)

   Every required average is indeed prime.

55,"There was a famous mathematician named Karl Friedrich Gauss. When he was young, he entered Gotinga University. One day he met an old professor, and spoke to him. They chatted, and the professor asked Gauss about his age.
Gauss said: ""The cube and the fourth power of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
The professor said: ""Very good. It's good coincidence because the square and the cube of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""

Gauss’s statement  
“The cube and the fourth power of my age contain each digit 0-9 exactly once”  
means that the decimal digits of G³ and G⁴ together are a permutation of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.  
Hence  

1. G³ has d₃ digits, G⁴ has d₄ digits and d₃+d₄ = 10.  
2. No digit repeats in the concatenation of the two numbers.

Because G is certainly below 100, we test 10 ≤ G ≤ 99 and look for d₃+d₄=10.  
For two–digit numbers G³ has at most 6 digits and G⁴ at most 8 digits, so only (4,6) or (5,5) or (6,4) are possible.  
A short check immediately produces:

G = 18  
18³ =  5 832   (digits 5,8,3,2)

“The square and the cube of my age contain each digit 0-9 exactly once”.

Let P² have d₂ digits and P³ have d₃ digits; again d₂+d₃ = 10 and no repetition of digits.

Since P is clearly older than Gauss, try 47 ≤ P ≤ 99 (then P² has 4 digits and P³ has 6 digits, giving 4+6=10).

Testing each number quickly (checking that P² has four distinct digits and P³ has six distinct digits, then that the two digit sets are disjoint) we arrive at one success:

P = 69  
69² = 4 761   (digits 4,7,6,1)  
69³ = 328 509 (digits 3,2,8,5,0,9)

Together these contain each digit 0–9 exactly once with no repetition.

Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656

Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.
""Why should I?""
""I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.""
""Is that the new Sinatra CD?""
""No, it's the world's greatest snack.""
""I'm hungry, too!"" the other voice whined.
""Who's up there with you?""  Patty asked.
""I'll bet I know!"" Eileen called.  ""It's obvious!""
Patty's face lit up in realization.  ""Robin!"" they laughed together.
A pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.
""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""
""We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.""
""What are those?""
""You know what a perfect number is?""
""Sure,"" Patty interjected, ""a number equal to the sum of its divisors.""
""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.  What are the four quantities in the sequence?",You can leave out numbers that are primes (sum of proper divisors is 1) or the product of two primes (sum of divisors will be less than 100).  This will shorten your search somewhat.,"108, 172, 136, and 134.
Method:
This one really requires a brute-force approach.  The sigma function (sum of a number's divisors) does not lend itself to 3rd-order analysis (3 numbers past the first one).  Most of the remaining numbers will leave the 100-200 range on the first or second iteration.  I used a small computer program.  The only sequence that stays in bounds for 4 terms is the one given.

The name ""Desire Creek"" is a nod to ""Desire Under the Elms"" and the ""Elm Creek Quilt"" books.
There are 4-cycles of amicable numbers.  However, the least quadruple is a little large, even for Patty's appetite: 1264460, 1547860, 1727636, 1305184.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

s(n) = σ(n) – n = “sum of the proper divisors of n”.  
An aliquot sequence is … , n₀ , n₁ , n₂ , … with n_{k+1}=s(n_k).

The problem asks for four consecutive terms n₀ , n₁ , n₂ , n₃ such that  

• 100 ≤ n_k ≤ 200 for k = 0,1,2,3, and  
• n₀ + n₁ + n₂ + n₃ is divisible by 25.

Step 1 – list s(n) for 100 ≤ n ≤ 200

(The factorisation is written first, then σ(n), then s(n)=σ(n)–n.)

100 = 2²·5²  σ=217 s=117  
101 prime   s=1  
102 = 2·3·17  σ=216 s=114  
103 prime   s=1  
104 = 2³·13  σ=210 s=106  
…  
(continuing this way for every n from 100 to 200)

From this table one records every n whose image s(n) is still in the 100–200 band, then one checks s(s(n)), and so on.  
Only four starting values keep the first four terms in range:

1. 102 → 114 → 126 → 186 (sum 528)  
2. 108 → 172 → 136 → 134 (sum 550)  
3. 114 → 126 → 186 → 198 (sum 624)  
4. 190 → 170 → 154 → 134 (sum 648)

Step 2 – test the divisibility condition

528 ≡ 3·25+3  not divisible by 25  
624 ≡ 25·24+24 not divisible by 25  
648 ≡ 25·25+23 not divisible by 25  
550 = 25·22     divisible by 25 ✔

Thus the unique sequence satisfying both requirements is obtained from the starting value 108.

Verification of the aliquot steps

n₀ = 108 : proper divisors 1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,27,36,54 sum to 172  
n₁ = 172 : proper divisors 1,2,4,43,86 sum to 136  
n₂ = 136 : proper divisors 1,2,4,8,17,34,68 sum to 134  
n₃ = 134 : proper divisors 1,2,67, … (next term not needed)

All four terms are between 100 and 200 and their total is 550 = 25 × 22.

Therefore the four quantities of Rnkfurers the friends order are

108, 172, 136 and 134.

64,"The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with ""rock"", 2 points with ""scissors"", and 1 point with ""paper"".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one ""throw"", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.
The players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.
Knowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?","(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.
(2) This is a ""zero-sum"" game: what one player wins, the other loses.
(3) The game is ""symmetric"": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.
(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

• R = probability you throw Rock  
• P = probability you throw Paper  
• S = probability you throw Scissors (R+P+S = 1).

Chip payoff to you in every possible encounter (positive if you get chips, negative if you pay) is

               opponent  
         Rock Paper Scissors  
you Rock     0   –1     +3  
you Paper   +1    0     –2  
you Sciss  –3   +2      0

For a given opponent choice your expected gain is  

vs Rock : P – 3 S  
vs Paper: –R + 2 S  
vs Sciss: 3 R – 2 P.

Since you “know nothing” about opponents, you protect yourself against the worst case: choose (R,P,S) that maximises the minimum of these three numbers.  
In a zero-sum game this means making the opponent indifferent, i.e. setting the three expectations equal to the same value V:

1) P – 3 S = –R + 2 S  → R + P = 5 S  
2) P – 3 S = 3 R – 2 P → P = R + S

Solve: from 2) P = R + S.  
Insert in 1): R + (R + S) = 5 S → 2 R = 4 S → R = 2 S.  
Hence P = R + S = 3 S.

Thus R : P : S = 2 : 3 : 1.  
Normalising,

 R = 2/6 = 1/3 ≈ 33 %  
 P = 3/6 = 1/2 = 50 %  
 S = 1/6 ≈ 17 %.

With this mix each of the three expected payoffs equals

 V = P – 3 S = 1/2 – 3·(1/6) = 0,

so no opponent can obtain an edge and your expected chip balance stays level.

65,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
Assume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.  What is the lowest card total at which you can be assured you will not be required to drink a glass of milk through your nose in order to break a tie for the maximum 4 points?",Create the largest tie,"If all four players hold the same number of cards, the lowest card total that would never require a tie-break is 142.
If all four players hold the same number of cards, the highest single hand card total at which a tie-breaker might be needed is 141.  In this case, the two players who would be required to drink milk through their noses would each have had a hand consisting of a joker and two 8s, 9s, 10s, jacks, queens and kings.  Any score above 141 can not be duplicated in a single hand of Snapoker, thus making 142 the lowest total to which a tie-breaker will not need to be applied.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 – work out what cards are in the pack and their values  
For one ordinary 52-card deck we keep

• Spades even ranks 2,4,6,8,10,12 (6 cards)  
• Hearts odd  A(1),3,5,7,9,11,13 (7 cards)  
• Diamonds non–prime 4,6,8,9,10,12 (6 cards)  
• Clubs prime 2,3,5,7,11,13 (6 cards)

25 cards are kept from each deck.  
With two decks we therefore have 50 ordinary cards, and the two added jokers (value 15) make 52 cards in all.

Counting the cards of each value in the double (2-deck) pack gives  

value 1 (ace) 2 cards  
values 2–13  four of each  
value 15 (joker) 2 cards

Step 2 – total value of the whole pack  
Sum = 2(1) + 4(2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13) + 2(15)  
      = 2  + 4·78               + 30  
      = 2  + 312                + 30 = 392.

The 52 cards are dealt (after the piggy-grab) equally, so every player gets 13 cards.  
Average hand value = 392 / 4 = 98.

Step 3 – the largest possible totals two different players can share  
If two different players together hold 26 cards, the greatest total they can possibly share is obtained by taking the 26 highest-valued cards in the whole pack:

2×15  + 4×13 + 4×12 + 4×11 + 4×10 + 4×9 + 4×8  
= 30  + 52   + 48   + 44   + 40   + 36  + 32 = 282.

Therefore, for two players to tie they must each have at most ⌊282/2⌋ = 141 points, because, with 26 cards, the sum 282 cannot be exceeded.

Step 4 – the critical total  
Hence, if YOUR hand is worth 142 or more points, the following are simultaneously true:

• No other player can reach 142 (because two such hands would require 284 points in 26 cards, more than the 26 highest cards can provide).  
• Therefore no other player can beat 142 either.  
• Consequently you win the hand outright and no tie-breaking milk-through-the-nose contest can arise.

Step 5 – is 142 achievable?  
Yes.  For example the 13-card set  
15, 13,13, 12,12, 11,11, 10,10, 9,9,9, 8  
sums to 142, so such a hand can occur.

Conclusion  
The smallest hand-total that guarantees you will not have to face a tie-breaker for the top score is 142.

The sum of the ten numbers is (783+90)/9=97.  The largest number is found by subtracting the lowest sum of nine numbers (which excluded the largest of the ten numbers) from the sum of all ten numbers.  Thus: 97-82=15.  15 is the largest number of the ten.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the 10 natural numbers be

   Hence the multiset  
   { S – a₁ , S – a₂ , … , S – a₁₀ }  
   is the multiset of the given values.

2.  We are told that only nine different sums are obtained:
   82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92.  
   Since there are 10 numbers, one of these nine values must occur twice;  
   that duplication corresponds to the two equal numbers.

3.  The smallest nine-number sum (82) is obtained when the largest single
   number is omitted, so the largest number is S – 82.  
   The largest nine-number sum (92) is obtained when the smallest number is
   omitted, so the smallest number is S – 92.  
   Therefore largest − smallest = (S – 82) – (S – 92) = 10.

4.  Add the ten nine-number sums.  Each of the 10 original numbers appears in
   exactly 9 of those sums, so

        (sum of 10 nine-number sums) = 9 S.

   Let x be the value that is repeated.  Then

        9 S = (82+83+84+85+87+89+90+91+92) + x
            = 783 + x.

   Because 9 S is divisible by 9, 783 + x must be divisible by 9; 783 already
   is, so x itself must be a multiple of 9.  
   The only multiple of 9 in the list is 90, so x = 90 is the repeated sum.

5.  Now 9 S = 783 + 90 = 873, so S = 873 / 9 = 97.

6.  The nine distinct numbers are S minus each distinct sum:

        97−85 = 12
        97−87 = 10
        97−89 =  8
        97−90 =  7   (this one occurs twice)
        97−91 =  6
        97−92 =  5

   Thus the ten numbers are

The race is divided into two stages; the first 8 meters and the last 8 meters.  A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.

Replacing A by the diagonally crossed distance, B by the distance between Jack's feet and C by the vertically climbed distance:
1^2 = 0.6^2+C^2
C = 0.8 m
Jill moves 1 meter vertically in each hop.
According to the circle circumference calculation:

Jack  
• One diagonal step = 1 m.  
• His feet are 0.60 m apart horizontally, therefore the horizontal component of the step is 0.60 m.  
• By Pythagoras the vertical component is  
  √(1² – 0.60²) = √(1 – 0.36) = √0.64 = 0.80 m.

Jill  
• One hop is a half-circular arc 1.57 m long.  
• 1.57 m = π r ⇒ r = 0.50 m, so the arc is a semicircle of radius 0.50 m.  
• The vertical distance between the endpoints of a semicircle is its diameter, 2r = 1.00 m.  
Thus one hop lowers her by 1.00 m.

Step 2 –  Work out the first 8 m (stage 1)  

Jack  
• Needs 8 m / 0.8 m = 10 steps.  
• Time for the 10 steps = 10 × 15 s = 150 s.  
• He now must take his compulsory 1-min (60 s) rest.  
• Finishes stage 1 at t = 150 s and rests from 150 s to 210 s.

Jill  
• Needs 8 m / 1 m = 8 hops.  
• Time for the 8 hops = 8 × 15 s = 120 s.  
• After 6 m (6 hops, 90 s) she must rest 1 min, i.e. 90 s–150 s.  
• After that rest she would start hop 7 at 150 s, but Jack has already finished.  
• Penalty: as soon as Jack finishes (150 s) Jill must wait an extra 30 s (to 180 s).  
• She therefore does hop 7 (180–195 s) and hop 8 (195–210 s).  
• She reaches the 8-m mark at 210 s.

Stage 1 winner: Jack (finished at 150 s).  
The penalty has delayed Jill by exactly 30 s.

Step 3 –  The second 8 m (stage 2)  

Both start stage 2 at the same instant 210 s:

Jack  
• Again needs 10 steps → 150 s.  
• Finishes the descent at 210 s + 150 s = 360 s.

Jill  
• Needs another 8 hops.  
• After 4 more hops (to 12 m total) she must rest a second minute.  
 210–225 s hop 9 (9 m)  
 225–240 s hop 10 (10 m)  
 240–255 s hop 11 (11 m)  
 255–270 s hop 12 (12 m) ––> rest 270–330 s  
• Last 4 hops:  
 330–345 s hop 13 (13 m)  
 345–360 s hop 14 (14 m)  
 360–375 s hop 15 (15 m)  
 375–390 s hop 16 (16 m)  
• She reaches the ground at 390 s.

Step 4 –  Compare finishing times  

Jack: 360 s = 6 min

68,"Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.
""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""
Assuming everything has integer weights, what were the two types of weights that Joseph suggested?",Try it out with small numbers. What is the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of 3s and 4s? The answer is 5. Try it out with other numbers. You'll find a pattern eventually.,"The two weights are 11 and 13.
If you played around with the hint, you'll realize that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of Xs and Ys is equal to (X-1)(Y-1) - 1.
We are told that the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of a combination of the two weights is 119.
Thus,
119 = (x-1)(y-1) - 1
120 = (x-1)(y-1)
From here, we only have to list 120's factors: (1,120), (2,60), (3,40), (4,30), (5,24), (6,20), (8,15), (10,12).  There are 8 possible combinations.
However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.
Try it out. You can't make 119 using only 11s and 13s but you can make 120 and above using only 11s and 13s.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the two (integer) weights be a lb and b lb, with a,b > 10.  
Because every load of 120 lb or more is measurable while 119 lb is not, 119 is the largest non-measurable weight.  

For two weight sizes that are relatively prime, the largest unattainable weight (the Frobenius number) equals
 ab − a − b.

Hence
 ab − a − b = 119  
⇒ ab − a − b + 1 = 120  
⇒ (a − 1)(b − 1) = 120.                                     (1)

Both a − 1 and b − 1 must therefore be positive divisors of 120 and each is at least 10 (because a,b > 10).

The factor pairs of 120 with both factors ≥ 10 are only

 10 × 12 and 12 × 10.

Taking (a − 1, b − 1) = (10,12) gives (a,b) = (11,13).  
The reverse ordering gives the same two sizes.

Check: gcd(11,13)=1, so the formula for the Frobenius number applies, and

 11·13 − 11 − 13 = 143 − 24 = 119.

Thus every weight ≥ 120 lb is a non-negative integer combination of 11 lb and 13 lb, while 119 lb and smaller weights need not be.

Example confirmations  
• 300 lb = 13 lb × 9 + 11 lb × 3  
• 90 lb = 13 lb × 1 + 11 lb × 7  
• 69 lb cannot be expressed (solving 13x+11y=69 gives no non-negative integer solution).

Therefore the only possible pair that fulfills all the stated conditions is

The first mathematicians says, ""I have a positive integer number of children, whose ages are positive integers. The sum of their ages is the number of this bus, while the product is my own age.""
The other person replies, ""How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?""
""No, you could not.""
""Aha! At last, I know how old you are!""
Apparently the second mathematician had been trying to determine the first mathematician's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
The bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.","There are multiple possible age combinations for the mathematician's children that would result in the same age as well as the same bus number otherwise the second mathematician can determine the ages of the children given the first mathematician's age and number of children.
Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't — he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10.

73,"Achmed and Ali were camel-drivers and on one day they decided to quit their job. They wanted to become shepherds. So they went to the market and sold all their camels.

With the money that was left they bought a goat.
On their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, ""I take the last sheep and you can get the goat"".

A sheep is 10 dinars, but what does a goat cost?
The money they received for their camels is a square. And the digit in the tens-place of this square is odd (total money / 10 dinars), because they could not divide the sheep equally.
Now the interesting thing is that all squares with an odd tens-place end with a 6. (16^2 = 256, 24^2 = 576). So a goat must cost 6 dinars.
10 - 6 = 2 dogs
So a dog costs 2 dinars.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

C = total number of camels they owned  
p = price (in dinars) received for each camel  

The problem states p = C, so the money they got from selling the camels was  

M = C · p = C · C = C²  (dinars).

They spent that money on sheep at 10 dinars each and bought one goat with the remainder.

Let  

g = price of the goat (0 < g < 10, because a goat costs less than a sheep),  
S = number of sheep bought.  

Then  
C² = 10 S + g.                        (1)

When they tried to divide the S sheep equally, one sheep was left over, i.e. S is odd.  
Write S = 2k + 1 with k an integer.

Ali keeps the “last” sheep (worth 10 dinars) and gives Achmed the goat plus a dog.  
Value-wise we therefore have

g + d = 10,                           (2)

where d is the (unknown) price of one dog.

Goal: determine d.

-------------------------------------------------
Using modular arithmetic
-------------------------------------------------
From (1) reduce modulo 10:

C² ≡ g (mod 10).                      (3)

Squares modulo 10 can only be 0,1,4,5,6,9, so  
g ∈ {1,4,5,6,9}.                      (4)

Now write (1) as C² = 10(2k+1) + g = 20k + (10 + g).  
Hence

C² ≡ 10 + g (mod 20).                (5)

Compute possible square residues modulo 20:

n² (mod 20) ∈ {0,1,4,5,9,16}.                   

Thus 10 + g must be one of {0,1,4,5,9,16}.  
But 10 + g is between 11 and 19, so the only possible match is 16.  
Therefore

10 + g = 16  ⇒  g = 6.               (6)

-------------------------------------------------
Price of a dog
-------------------------------------------------
Insert g = 6 into (2):

g + d = 10  ⇒  6 + d = 10  ⇒  d = 4.

So each dog is worth 4 dinars.

-------------------------------------------------
Check
-------------------------------------------------
Because g = 6, (1) gives C² ≡ 6 (mod 10); such squares exist (e.g. C = 4,6,14,16,…).  
For those C we have C² ≡ 16 (mod 20), making S = (C² – 6)/10 odd, exactly as required.  
All conditions are consistent, yielding a unique dog price of 4 dinars.

74,"Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?","The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","The minimum number of weights is 5.
weight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0
weight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1
weight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2
weight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3
weight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4
All five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.
The progression from one stone to one mass would be:
1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let every weight be expressed in the smallest unit, the stone.
One mass = 11 lumps = 11·11 stone = 121 stone,  
so we must be able to weigh any whole number of stone from 1 up to 121 inclusive.

Because a balance scale allows us to put weights on the same pan as the object
(to “subtract” their values) as well as on the opposite pan (to “add” their
values), each weight can be used with the coefficients –1, 0 or +1.
Hence every number we must weigh has to be written with digits –1, 0, 1.
The positional-value system that does exactly this is balanced ternary, whose
place-values are the powers of 3 :

…, 81, 27, 9, 3, 1            (3⁴, 3³, 3², 3¹, 3⁰).

If we take the five lowest such powers

1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone, 81 stone,

their total is
1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 stone,

so with them we can weigh anything up to and including 121 stone.
Moreover, this choice is optimal: with k weights the largest total that can be
covered is

1 + 3 + 3² + … + 3^{k–1} = (3^{k} – 1)/2,

and setting (3^{k} – 1)/2 ≥ 121 gives k ≥ 5.  
Thus no set of four or fewer weights can suffice.

Expressed in the native units the five weights are
• 1 stone  
• 3 stone  
• 9 stone  
• 27 stone = 2 lumps + 5 stone  
• 81 stone = 7 lumps + 4 stone.

With these five pieces one can weigh every whole weight from 1 stone to 1 mass
(121 stone) by placing some of the weights on the same pan as the object and
the rest on the opposite pan.

Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.
Considering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?
He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.",divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.,"Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.

Now let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.
Here H can take values from 0 to 23.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 0 to 7 i.e., 8 values, for H = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 0 to 5 i.e., 6 values, for H = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 0 to 4 i.e., 5 values, for H = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 10+10+8+6+5 = 39

Both the equations use each of the digits 1 to 9 once each. These are the only two numbers with this property. Try using some operations on these numbers to see if there are any interesting findings",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let us look for a numerical property that both 567 and 854 share.

1. Start with the obvious possibilities – parity, divisibility by 3, etc.  
   • 567 is odd; 854 is even → no parity match.  
   • 567 : digit-sum 5 + 6 + 7 = 18, divisible by 3; 854 : digit-sum 8 + 5 + 4 = 17, not divisible by 3 → no common factor 3.

2. Test divisibility by 7 (rule: split off the last digit, double it, subtract from the rest, repeat until small):  
   • 567 → 56 − 2·7 = 56 − 14 = 42, and 42 is divisible by 7 → 567 divisible by 7.  
   • 854 → 85 − 2·4 = 85 − 8 = 77, and 77 is divisible by 7 → 854 divisible by 7.

3. Factor each number completely to see whether any larger common factor occurs:  
   567 = 7 × 81 = 7 × 3⁴  
   854 = 7 × 122 = 7 × 2 × 61  
   After the single factor 7 the remaining pieces (3⁴ versus 2 × 61) have no factor in common, so 7 is the greatest common divisor.

4. Confirm with the Euclidean algorithm:  
   gcd(854, 567)  
   → 854 − 567 = 287  
   → gcd(567, 287)  
   → 567 − 2·287 = 567 − 574 = −7 (equivalently 567 mod 287 = 280)  
   → gcd(287, 280)  
   → 287 − 280 = 7  
   → gcd(280, 7) = 7.  
   Thus gcd(854, 567) = 7.

Therefore the unique numerical link between the two is that both lie in the 7-times table and share no larger common divisor.

Final answer: 567 and 854 are both exact multiples of 7; their greatest common divisor is 7.",True,0,0

The string's distance in one rotation would be expressed by the following equation:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2
Therefore, in 4 rotations it would be the above * 4.
The final equation is thus expressed as:
let a represent the total height of the pole, then f represent the height of the flag, then rot represent the number of rotations, then p represent the height of the pulley, then d represent the diameter of the pole
s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½

86,"While rating some Braingle teasers recently, I started taking notes on how my
vote affected the ratings.  Some of my data is presented below.  Can you figure out what is the likely formula that computes the ratings from the votes? Can you determine for each teaser how many votes were cast for each attribute prior to mine, and how many of those were positive (fun/hard)? Remember, not every voter necessarily votes for both attributes.
Notation: The notation for Teaser A below shows that it started with a fun rating of 2 and difficulty 1.33, based on 6 voters, that I voted positively on the first attribute (fun) and negatively on the second (easy), and that it wound up with ratings of 2.29 and 1.14, respectively, after my vote.
Teaser A: (2.00, 1.33)[6] (+, -) -> (2.29, 1.14)
Teaser B: (1.14, 0.67)[7] (-, -) -> (1.00, 0.57)

1.  Let n = number of votes that have been cast for a given attribute, and
    p = number of “positive” votes on that attribute  
    (for fun a “+” vote, for difficulty a “hard” vote).

2.  From the data for Teaser A (fun)
        before : r = 2.00 with n = 6, after our + : r = 2.29 with n = 7  
    we must have  

           rbefore = k·p/n,        rafter = k·(p+1)/(n+1)

    Solving these two equations gives k = 4.  
    Doing the same check with every other line of data gives the same k.

    Hence the site’s rating formula is

                rating  =  4 · ( # positive votes / # votes )

    (4 corresponds to “100 % positive”, 0 corresponds to “0 % positive”, so the
     published numbers run from 0.00 to 4.00.)

3.  With this formula we can work backwards, attribute by attribute, to find
    n and p just before our vote.  
    For example, for Teaser B (fun)

        1.14 = 4·p/ n        ⇒  p/n = 0.285
        1.00 = 4·p/(n+1)     ⇒  p/(n+1) = 0.250

        ⇒ p = 2 ,  n = 7.

    Doing the same algebra for every attribute gives:

Results (before our vote)

Teaser A
    Fun :  3 positive out of 6 votes
    Diff : 2 positive out of 6 votes

Teaser B
    Fun :  2 positive out of 7 votes
    Diff : 1 positive out of 6 votes

Teaser C
    Fun :  6 positive out of 8 votes
    Diff : 1 positive out of 6 votes

    Diff : 2 positive out of 9 votes

Teaser E

    Diff : 8 positive out of 13 votes

(Notice that the bracketed number [ ] in the teaser line is the number of

We are told D(N) is a multiple of N, i.e.  
4N − 1107 ≡ 0 (mod N) ⇒ −1107 ≡ 0 (mod N) ⇒ N | 1107.

Since N must be > 1000 but < 10 000, the only divisor of 1107 in that range is 1107 itself (1107 = 3³ × 41, and all other divisors are smaller).

Check:  
D(1107) = 4·1107 − 1107 = 3·1107 = 3321, which indeed is 3 × 1107.

1.  Let the common two–digit sum be  &$ = 10a + b$  with digits  
    & = a,  $ = b.

2.  From the multiplication (# denotes a digit)  

        # × $ = &$ = 10a + b

    gives      b(# – 1) = 10a.  
    Put k = # – 1 (k = 1,…,8).  Then  

        bk = 10a.

3.  Looking at 1–9 digits we get the possible (a,b,#) triples

        (1,2,6)   → &$ = 12
        (2,4,6)   → &$ = 24         (two-digit sums of two digits can’t reach 24 ⇒ impossible)
        (1,5,3)   → &$ = 15
        (3,5,7)   → &$ = 35         (too large for any two-digit sum of two digits)
        (4,5,9)   → &$ = 45         (too large)
        (4,8,6)   → &$ = 48         (too large)

    So only &$ = 12 or 15 remain.

4.  If &$ = 12 (a = 1, b = 2, # = 6)

        \ + ^ = 11,      ? + ^ = 6.

    These force ^ to be 4 or less, but the remaining digits ≥3; contradiction.  
    Therefore &$ ≠ 12.

5.  Take &$ = 15 (a = 1, b = 5, # = 3).  
    Remaining digits: {2,4,6,7,8,9}.

        \  +  >  = 15                     …(1)

    From (4)  \ = 14 – ^.  
    From (5)  ? = 12 – ^.  
    From (1)  > = 15 – \ = 1 + ^.

    Insert these in (3):

        (12 – ^) + (1 + ^) + @ = 15  ⇒  @ = 2.

    Digit 2 is now fixed, and still unused.  
    The remaining pool {4,6,7,8,9} must supply ^, \, >, ?, %.

    Try values for ^:

        ^ = 4   ⇒  \ = 10 (invalid)
        ^ = 6   ⇒  ? = 6 (duplicate)
        ^ = 7   ⇒  \ = 7 (duplicate)
        ^ = 8   ⇒  \ = 6,   ? = 4,   > = 9   (all valid)

    With ^ = 8 equation (2) gives  % = 15 – 8 = 7.

    All nine symbols are now distinct and cover 1–9 exactly:

        & = 1,  $ = 5,  # = 3,  @ = 2,  ^ = 8,  % = 7,
        \ = 6,  ? = 4,  > = 9.

    Check every equation:

        6 + 9  = 15 ✔

The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.
The 36th root of a googol is
(10^100)^(1/36) = 10^(100/36) = 10^(2.77777...) ~ 599.48

1.  “Square of a square”  ⇔  n = a^4 for some integer a,

2.  “Cube of a cube”      ⇔  n = b^9 for some integer b,  
    because (b^3)^3 = b^9.

Hence n is simultaneously a fourth power and a ninth power.  
Write the prime-factorisation of n:

 n = ∏ p_i^{e_i}.

•  Being a fourth power means each exponent e_i is divisible by 4.  
•  Being a ninth power means each exponent e_i is divisible by 9.  

Therefore every e_i is divisible by lcm(4, 9) = 36, so

 n = c^36 for some integer c.  

Conversely, every 36-th power is automatically both a 4-th power and a 9-th power.  
Thus the problem reduces to counting the 36-th powers below a googol.

We need all integers c such that

 c^36 < 10^100

Squares are congruent to 0 or 1 (mod 4).

7^C (mod 4) = 3 if C is odd, 1 if C is even.

Hence  

3^A + 5^B + 7^C ≡ (3 or 1) + 1 + (3 or 1) (mod 4).

To get 0 or 1 (mod 4) we must have exactly one of the two terms 3^A , 7^C congruent to 3.

Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.

94,"Dear Jim:
Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.
Jerry","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

A = Albert’s present age  
B = Bill’s present age  
C = Charles’ present age  
S(n) = sum of the decimal digits of n  

The three statements in the letter translate into

(1)  A   = S(B) + S(C)                               (now)  
(2)  B–1 = S(A–1) + S(C–1)                           (a year ago)  
(3)  C+6 = S(A+6) + S(B+6)                           (six years hence)

Step 1.  Work modulo 9.  
Because S(n) ≡ n (mod 9),

(1)  A ≡ B + C (mod 9)  
(2)  B ≡ A + C – 1 (mod 9)

Subtracting gives –2C ≡ 1 (mod 9), so C ≡ 5 (mod 9).

Step 2.  Bound the ages.  
Since S(B) ≤ 9 and S(C) ≤ 9, equation (1) gives A ≤ 18.  
Equation (3) gives C + 6 ≤ S(A+6)+S(B+6) ≤ 22, hence C ≤ 16.

Combining with C ≡ 5 (mod 9) leaves only two possibilities: C = 5 or C = 14.

Step 3.  Try C = 5.

Equation (1):          A = S(B) + 5.            (4)  
Equation (2):          B = S(A–1) + 5.          (5)  
Equation (3):          11 = S(A+6)+S(B+6).      (6)

Because S(B) ≤ 9, (4) forces 6 ≤ A ≤ 14.  Check each value:

A=6→B=10 gives S(12)+S(16)=10≠11  
A=7→B=11 gives S(13)+S(17)=12≠11  
A=8→B=12 gives S(14)+S(18)=14≠11  
A=9→B=13 gives S(15)+S(19)=16≠11  
A=10→B=14 gives S(16)+S(20)=9≠11  
A=11→B=6  gives S(17)+S(12)=8+3=11 ✔  
A=12→B=7  gives S(18)+S(13)=13≠11  
A=13→B=8  gives S(19)+S(14)=15≠11  
A=14→B=9  gives S(20)+S(15)=8≠11  

Only A = 11, B = 6, C = 5 satisfies all three equations.

Step 4.  Try C = 14.

Then C+6 = 20, so S(A+6)+S(B+6)=20.  Re-doing the same check (with A still 6–14) shows no solution at all.

Conclusion.  The unique set of ages is

95,"What three-digit number when doubled is, by value, one more than the value of the same three digits when reversed?

397.
397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.

103?  Is 206 = 301 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds even.]

N = 100a + 10b + c,  

where a (the hundreds digit) is 1–9 and b, c are 0–9.

When the digits are reversed we get  

R = 100c + 10b + a.

The condition in the problem is  
2 N = R + 1.

Substitute the expressions:

2(100a + 10b + c) = 100c + 10b + a + 1  
200a + 20b + 2c = 100c + 10b + a + 1.

Collect like terms:

199a + 10b − 98c = 1.        (★)

Now enforce the digit restrictions.

1. Parity:  
10b and 98c are even, 1 is odd, so 199a must be odd → a is odd.  
Thus a ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.

2. Solve (★) for 10b:  
10b = 98c − 199a + 1.

The left–hand side is a multiple of 10 lying between 0 and 90 (because b is a single digit).  
So the right–hand side must be one of the values {0, 10, 20, …, 90}.

Check each allowed a:

a = 1: 10b = 98c − 198 → values −198, −100, −2, 96, …  (none 0–90)  
a = 3: 10b = 98c − 596.

 Try c = 7 → 10b = 98·7 − 596 = 686 − 596 = 90 → b = 9 (valid).  
 All other c give values outside 0–90.

a = 5, 7, 9: The expression 98c − 199a + 1 is always ≤ −112, so no solutions.

Hence the only digit triple satisfying (★) is (a, b, c) = (3, 9, 7).

Check:

N = 397  
2 N = 794  
reverse(397) = 793  
794 = 793 + 1 ✓

Therefore the unique three-digit number with the stated property is 397.

96,"An iterative equation is one where an initial value is put into the equation to obtain a result, which is in turn put back into the equation as an input and the process is repeated for either a fixed number of times or until a final value is achieved (where you get the same number out as you put in).
For example, if you start with the iterative equation,

Write √2 in a slightly disguised way:

Let x = √2  
⇔ x² = 2  
⇔ x² – 1 = 1  
⇔ (x – 1)(x + 1) = 1  
⇔ x – 1 = 1 ⁄ (x + 1)  

Now isolate x on the left so that the right–hand side can be evaluated from the previous iterate:

x = 1 + 1 ⁄ (x + 1)

Thus, if we define the iteration

A₀  =  any real number except –1  
A_{n+1} = 1 + 1 ⁄ ( A_n + 1)          (∗)

then any starting value A₀ ≥ 0 (and all negative values except –1) is legitimate, because the denominator A_n + 1 never vanishes thereafter.

Convergence speed  
Take a few representative initial values:

A₀ = 0   → 2 → 1.333 … → 1.428 … → 1.411 … → 1.4140  
A₀ = 1   → 1.5 → 1.4 → 1.416 … → 1.413 … → 1.4140  
A₀ = 10  → 1.0909 → 1.478 … → 1.403 … → 1.4159 → 1.4137  

In every case, after at most five iterations the value is 1.414 ± 0.0003, i.e. correct to three decimal places (better than 0.1 %).

Why it works  
If L is a fixed point of (∗) then

L = 1 + 1⁄(L + 1)  ⇒  (L – 1)(L + 1) = 1  ⇒  L² = 2,

so the only positive fixed point is L = √2.

The digit-sum is S = 3 n₃ + 7 n₇.

Step 2.  Make the digit-sum divisible by 21  
S must be divisible by both 3 and 7, hence by 21.

•  Mod 3: 3 n₃ ≡ 0, 7 n₇ ≡ n₇ (mod 3)  
 So S ≡ n₇ (mod 3). To have S ≡ 0, we need n₇ ≡ 0 (mod 3).

1.  Re-write a “93–flip’’ as a “7–flip’’  
   Flipping the 93 coins in the set S is the same as
   (i) flipping every coin, and then  
   (ii) flipping the 7 coins in the complementary set S̄.

   Each wi has weight 7, so the left side of (1) has weight 7k.
   If k is odd the right side is 0, forcing every coordinate of the sum to be
   even.  Then 7k is even, impossible because 7 is odd.  Therefore k must be
   even.

   Hence 7k ≥ 100 ⇒ k ≥ 15; but k must be even, so k ≥ 16.        (3)

   Thus at least 16 moves are necessary.

5.  Construction with 16 moves  
   Take the six “special’’ coins 95,96,97,98,99,100; each will be flipped
   3 times, every other coin exactly once.

   Build 16 complements (7-sets) as follows (each set has 7 coins):

    S1  = {  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6, 95 }
    S2  = {  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 95 }
    S3  = { 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 96 }
    S4  = { 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 96 }
    S5  = { 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 97 }
    S6  = { 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 97 }
    S7  = { 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 98 }
    S8  = { 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 98 }
    S9  = { 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 99 }
    S10 = { 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 99 }
    S11 = { 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66,100 }
    S12 = { 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72,100 }
    S13 = { 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79 }
    S14 = { 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86 }
    S15 = { 87, 88, 89, 90, 95, 96, 97 }
    S16 = { 91, 92, 93, 94, 98, 99,100 }

   Each of the first 94 coins appears exactly once; each of 95–100 appears
   three times.  Therefore every coin is flipped an odd number of times,
   satisfying (1) with k = 16.

   Perform the 16 moves whose complements are S1,…,S16
   (i.e. flip the other 93 coins each time).  All coins end tails-up.

Because 14 moves are impossible and 16 moves are attainable, the least
number of required moves is 16.

So N + 1 is simultaneously divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.  
Hence N + 1 must be a multiple of the least common multiple of these numbers.

Compute L = lcm(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9).

Prime‐factorisation method:
2^3 (from 8), 3^2 (from 9), 5, 7 ⇒ L = 2^3·3^2·5·7 = 8·9·5·7 = 2520.

Thus N + 1 = 2520 k for some positive integer k, so

N = 2520 k − 1.

We need N < 3000 ⇒ 2520 k − 1 < 3000 ⇒ k ≤ 1.

The resulting births and deaths are truncated to a whole number.  These rates are constant.  For example, consider a population of 99 people at the start of a year.  A 4% birth rate would be 3.96, truncated to 3 births during the year.  A 3% death rate would be 2.97, truncated to 2 deaths during the year.

""Patty O'Furniture!  Good to see you!  Want a Rnkfurter?""
""A what?""
Kurt handed her the last he had.  She bit in, and her face lit up like a newly-coined metaphor.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""Rod and I were about to go order some more.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""  Patty's blank look bade him explain.  ""In our first batch, we got a total of 25 -- 20 for me, and 5 for Rod.  I had 20, and he had 20% of the total.""
""And you think you can do that for three people?  You get my percentage, and I get Rod's?  I don't think we can do it.""
Rod had been thinking about it, and rattled off three numbers to her.
""Those aren't right.  The last one isn't the right percentage; there's an added fraction.""
""So?  My mom says they're the same on her old phonograph speeds.""
Patty looked at Kurt, each waiting for the other to give an opinion.  Finally, she gestured at the empty wrapper in his hand.
""I'll round off a little for a week's supply of these.  Let's go!""
Since Rnkfurters come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, they had to leave 10 with the storekeeper to make the numbers work, but they got their munchies.
How many did each student get this time?","The old phonograph speeds were typically 16, 33-1/3, 45, and 78 RPM.","27 for Kurt, 30 for Patty, and 33 for Rod.
That's 30% for Kurt and 33-1/3% for Patty.
Method:
Let K, P, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, K+P+R.
Now, since Kurt's percentage equals Patty's quantity, we get
100*K/T = P.
Similarly,
100*P/T = R plus a fraction.  Now, look at the common factor, 100/T.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
K*F = P and P*F = R (plus a fraction),
and K*F^2 = R (plus a fraction).
The clue about the phonograph leaves us looking for a triple with 33 Rnkfurters for Rod, with Patty getting 33-1/3% (one-third) of the total.

 K = number Kurt gets  
 R = number Rod gets  
 P = number Patty gets  
 T = K + R + P = total number they take with them  

Desired “percentage” conditions  
(what Patty was objecting to) were

 (1) Patty’s number must equal Rod’s percentage of the total  
   P = 100·R / T  
 (2) Kurt’s number must equal Patty’s percentage of the total  
   K = 100·P / T  

Rod tried to satisfy these exactly, but Patty noticed that
the second percentage would have to be “33⅓”, containing an
extra fraction.  Rod answered that his mother’s phonograph
doesn’t care about the “⅓”, so they finally agreed to
drop the fraction and use the integer part of every
percentage (i.e. take the percentage, then truncate any
fractional part).

So we want integers K, P, R, T with

  P = ⎣100·R / T⎦             (percentage of Rod, truncated)  
  K = ⎣100·P / T⎦             (percentage of Patty, truncated)  

and of course K + P + R = T.

Trying totals they could actually carry home, i.e. a number
that is 10 less than a whole case (cases are 25, 50, 100):

 T = 25 − 10 = 15      too small  
 T = 50 − 10 = 40      no solution  
 T = 75 − 10 = 65      no solution  
 T = 100 − 10 = 90   ← works!  

With T = 90 the truncation factor is 100/90 = 10/9 ≃ 1.111…

Start with Rod’s amount R.  
Because P = ⎣(10/9) R⎦, chose R so that P itself
is a multiple of 3 (to give a whole number after the next
step).  The smallest such R that keeps T = 90 turns out to be
R = 27 :

 P = ⎣(10/9) · 27⎦ = ⎣30⎦ = 30  
 K = ⎣(10/9) · 30⎦ = ⎣33. 3…⎦ = 33  

Check the total: 27 + 30 + 33 = 90 ✅

Now Patty’s percentage of the total is exactly
30/90 = 33⅓ %, and Rod’s percentage is 27/90 = 30 %.
Their truncated values (33 and 30) are precisely Kurt’s
and Patty’s counts, satisfying the agreed-on rule once the
fraction is ignored.

They therefore ordered a 100-frank case, left 10 with the
storekeeper, and went away with 90 franks divided:

 Kurt  33  
 Patty 30  
 Rod   27

The tiger is hungry and always attempts to keep the distance between the two of you at a minimum. How can you safely swim to shore?
Assume that as long as you can get to the shore before the tiger gets to you (even if it is only a split-second before), you will be safe.",Use the factor of 4 to your advantage,"Until you are more than 1/4 of the radius away from the rock you can swim fast enough so that you can keep the tiger the furthest distance possible from you. Regardless of which direction the tiger moves around the circle, you swim the other way, always keeping the rock between you and the tiger.  While you are doing this you will be able to move outward, since you will have some energy to spare.
Before long you will be 1/4 of the radius away from the center and the tiger will be 180 degrees away. At this point swim straight to the point on the shore furthest from the tiger. You will be able to get there in 3/4 units of time, while it will take the tiger pi/4 =~ 0.7854 units of time.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let v be your swimming speed.  
The tiger’s running speed is 4 v.

1. Get inside the “fast circle”.  
   While you are at a distance r from the centre, your angular speed around the centre is  
        ω₁ = v / r.  
   The tiger, running on the shore (radius = 1), has angular speed  
        ω₂ = 4 v / 1 = 4 v.  
   If ω₁ > ω₂ you can turn round the centre faster than the tiger can turn on the bank, so you can make the tiger lag in angle.  
   ω₁ > ω₂  ⇔  v / r > 4 v  ⇔  r < ¼.  

   Therefore, as long as you stay inside the circle of radius ¼ you can always increase or decrease the angular gap at will.

2. Establish the diametrically-opposite position.  
   Swim on a small circle of some radius r with r < ¼ (say r = 0.23).  
   Because you turn faster than the tiger, keep swimming round until the tiger is exactly opposite you— i.e. the line through you and the centre points to a spot on the shore that is 180° away from the tiger.

3. Dash for shore.  
   The distance you must still swim is 1 – r.  
   The tiger, starting exactly opposite your target point, has to run half the circumference of the lake, a distance π.

   Times needed:  
        Your time T₁ = (1 – r)/v  
        Tiger’s time T₂ = π/(4v)

   You reach shore first provided  
        (1 – r)/v < π/(4v)  ⇔  1 – r < π/4.

   π/4 ≈ 0.7854, so 1 – r must be less than 0.7854, i.e. r > 1 – π/4 ≈ 0.2146.  
   Pick any radius between 0.2146 and 0.25 (for instance r = 0.23 used above); then

        T₁ = 0.77/v < T₂ = 0.785/v.

   You reach the shore a split-second before the tiger arrives and are safe.

4. Why the tiger cannot do better.  
   While you are inside the ¼-radius circle you can always increase the angular gap faster than the tiger can close it, so the tiger cannot leave the diametrically opposite point without giving you a still larger head start. Hence the above dash really is the tiger’s best-case race, and you win it.

Thus, by staying inside radius ¼ until the tiger is opposite and then swimming straight out from any radius r with  
 1 – π/4 < r < ¼,  
you are guaranteed to reach shore before the tiger.

Final answer: Swim in a small circle of radius less than ¼ until the tiger is diametrically opposite, then from any radius slightly above 0.2146 (e.g. 0.23) head straight for the shore; you arrive first and escape.",True,1,0

107,"Arrogant Arnold and Witty Will are brothers. One day, they were going from New Jersey to Florida. Bored, they decided to ask each other brain teasers. After a while, they got bored with this, so Arnold decided to place a bet. He would ask Will one teaser, which he thought was very hard. If Will got it right, Arnold would clean his room for the rest of the year. However, if Will got it WRONG, he would have to clean Arnold's room for a year and do his dishes for a month. After thinking for a while, Will agreed to this. This was Arnold's teaser:
Use each digit 1-9 only once each, so that one number multiplied by another equals the third. One example is 12*483=5796. Name at least one more!!!

A (with a₁ digits) and B (with b₁ digits)  
and let their product be C (with c₁ digits).  
Because the nine different digits 1-9 must be used once altogether, we need  

a₁ + b₁ + c₁ = 9.

Since the product of two positive integers below 10 000 is at most 4 digits, the only feasible partitions are  
1 × 4 = 4 or 2 × 3 = 4 (or the symmetric 3 × 2 = 4, 4 × 1 = 4).

I will look at the 2-digit × 3-digit = 4-digit pattern (the same pattern as the example 12 × 483 = 5796).

1.  A digital-sum (mod 9) condition  
   The nine digits 1+2+…+9 sum to 45, which is 0 (mod 9).  
   If x ≡ A (mod 9) and y ≡ B (mod 9), then the product satisfies

        A·B ≡ x y (mod 9) and  
        A + B + A·B ≡ 0 (mod 9).

   Hence x y + x + y ≡ 0 (mod 9), i.e.  
        (x+1)(y+1) ≡ 1 (mod 9).

   Working in ℤ₉ the units and their inverses are

        1↔1, 2↔5, 4↔7, 5↔2, 7↔4, 8↔8.

   So the possible residue pairs (x, y) are  
        (0,0), (1,4), (3,6), (4,1), (6,3), (7,7).

2.  Pick one feasible pair and search.

   Take the pair (x, y) = (3, 6); that means  
        the 2-digit factor must be ≡ 3 (mod 9) and  
        the 3-digit factor must be ≡ 6 (mod 9).

   The smallest 2-digit numbers with distinct digits and residue 3 are 12, 21, 39, 48, 57, 66 (66 repeats a digit, so discard it), etc.  
   Try 39.

   Multiplying 39 by the smallest 3-digit multiples of 9 that are ≡ 6 (mod 9) and have distinct digits:

        39 × 186 = 7254.

   Check the digits:

        39 → 3, 9  
        186 → 1, 8, 6  
        7254 → 7, 2, 5, 4  

   Combined we get exactly the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with no repetition.

Therefore 39 × 186 = 7254 is a valid “once-each-digit” multiplication.

108,"In the equation FORTY+TEN+TEN=SIXTY, each letter represents a different digit. Can you figure out which letter is which digit?",Start from the last digits.,"First, there are ten different letters in this equation: E, F, I, N, O, R, S, T, X, Y. Therefore, every digit from 0 to 9 is used.
Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.
If T=8, then R=X+3, we can have R=6, X=3, or R=7, X=4.
If R=6, X=3, the remaining digits are 2, 4, 7, and again we can't choose S=F+1.
If R=7, X=4, the remaining digits are 2, 3, 6, where 3=2+1. Hence S=3, F=2.

1. Units: Y + N + N = Y  ⇒  2N must be a multiple of 10.  
   Distinct digits give N = 0 (carry c₁ = 0).

2. Tens: T + E + E + c₁ = T.  
   With c₁ = 0 we need 2E = 10, so E = 5 and the carry to the next column is c₂ = 1.

3. Hundreds: R + T + T + c₂ = X (mod 10) with carry c₃.

4. Thousands: O + c₃ = I (mod 10) with carry c₄.

5. Ten-thousands: F + c₄ = S (no further carry).

Because S ≠ F, c₄ must be 1.  
Then c₃ must be 2 (otherwise c₄ would be 0).  
Thus O + 2 ≥ 10, giving O = 9 and I = 1.

With c₃ = 2:  R + 2T + 1 = X + 20  ⇒  X = R + 2T – 19.

Trying digits (all distinct, 0 and 5 already used, O = 9, I = 1):

T = 8 gives 2T = 16.

111,"Mad Ade was visiting his friend, computer tycoon and Olympic Kebab hurling champion, Mike Rohsopht.
He was there on Sunday and when the radio gave the time at the hour, Mad Ade noticed that the Madadian antique clock, designed by Madadian clock maker Arthur Minit (teaser #4891) was exactly 3 minutes slow.
""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Mike assured Mad Ade that his treasured Arthur Minit clock had not been adjusted nor fixed since his last visit.
What day of the week was Mad Ade's second visit?",It must lose some multiple of 12 hours in total,"The answer is 17 days and 3 hours later, which would have been a Wednesday.
This is the only other time in the same month when the two would agree at all.
In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.
Since the clock was not adjusted since the last visit, it's also possible that the radio time shifted by one hour due to a change to or from summer daylight saving time.  However, it turns out that the only additional possibilities that need to be considered are those of 4 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 12 hours 57 minutes, and 29 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 3 days 10 hours 57 minutes.  Without even considering the rules for when in the month the
clock is changed, these possible solutions are ruled out because we know that both visits were in the evening (""Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht"") and they involve times in a different part of the day.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

D(t) = (clock-time) − (true time)  (measured in minutes; negative means the clock is slow).  

1.  First visit

   It loses 7 minutes every true hour ⇒  
   after h true hours D = −3 − 7h.

3.  When will the clock read exactly the same hour and minute as the radio?  
   For an ordinary 12-hour dial the clock is “dead right’’ whenever D is a multiple of 12 hours = 720 minutes.  
   Hence we want  
      −3 − 7h ≡ 0  (mod 720).  
   ⇔ 7h ≡ 717   (mod 720).

   Because gcd(7,720)=1 an inverse of 7 (mod 720) is 103, since 7·103 = 721 ≡ 1.  
   Multiplying by 103 gives  

      h ≡ 103·717 ≡ 411  (mod 720).

      h = 411 hours.

4.  How long is 411 hours?  
      411 ÷ 24 = 17 remainder 3,   
   so it is 17 days and 3 hours.

5.  Day of the second visit

Th = 105 °F  (temperature of the hot supply)  
Tc = 45 °F   (temperature of the cold supply)

Let the volumetric flow rates be  

H = flow of hot water (faucet is wide-open, so H is fixed)  
C(θ) = flow of cold water when the cold handle is opened through an angle θ, 0 ° ≤ θ ≤ 360 °.

Assumptions (standard for this type of problem)  
1. Turning a handle changes the flow rate linearly with the angle turned.  
2. The two faucets, when fully opened, deliver the same maximum flow rate.  

Hence
• H can be taken as 1 unit (any constant would cancel out).  
• C(θ) = (θ / 360°)·1 = θ/360 (because 0° gives no cold flow and 360° gives the same full flow as the hot side).

The mixed temperature T is the flow-rate-weighted average:

T(θ) = (H·Th + C(θ)·Tc) / (H + C(θ))
      = (105·1 + (θ/360)·45) / (1 + θ/360).

We want T(θ) = 98.6 °F.  Solve for θ.

(105 + 45·θ/360) / (1 + θ/360) = 98.6

Multiply numerator and denominator by 360 to clear fractions:

(105·360 + 45θ) / (360 + θ) = 98.6

105·360 + 45θ = 98.6(360 + θ)

θ = 2 304 / 53.6 ≈ 42.98°.

1. it is abundant – the sum σ(n) of all its proper divisors exceeds n;  
2. it is not semiperfect – no sub-collection of those proper divisors has sum exactly n.

Step 1 – list the abundant numbers below 70  
For every integer m < 70 compute the sum of its proper divisors.  (Only those whose sum already exceeds the number itself can even be candidates.)

The abundant numbers below 70 are  
12, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 66.

Step 2 – show each of those is semiperfect  
For every one of the numbers in the list we can explicitly exhibit a subset of its proper divisors whose total equals the number:

12 : 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12  
18 : 9 + 6 + 3 = 18  
20 : 10 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20  
24 : 12 + 8 + 4 = 24  
30 : 15 + 10 + 5 = 30

60 : 30 + 20 + 10 = 60  
66 : 33 + 22 + 11 = 66

Hence every abundant number below 70 is semiperfect, so none of them is weird.

Step 3 – examine 70 itself  
Proper divisors of 70: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35  
Sum = 1 + 2 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 14 + 35 = 74 > 70, so 70 is abundant.

Now check every way of adding those divisors: no subset sums to 70.  (A quick systematic search or a computer check shows the largest subset sum not exceeding 70 is 69 = 35 + 14 + 10 + 7 + 2 + 1.)

Therefore 70 is abundant and not semiperfect – it is weird.

Since every abundant number below 70 is semiperfect, none is weird, so 70 is the first example.

    • Inner square area = (s – 4)²  
    • Area Junior cuts (border) = s² – (s – 4)² = 8s – 16

2.  The children agreed each would cut exactly half the total area, so

117,"What is the largest number of pieces you can form with n straight cuts of a pizza?
The pieces do not need to be of equal size.","After j cuts, how many additional pieces can you cut with the (j+1)-th cut?","The answer is n*(n+1)/2 + 1.
With every cut you should cut through every previous cut. As long as you keep doing this you will always be able to do so again with your next cut. The number of additional pieces formed on cut x will always be x. The sum of all integers from 1 to n is n*(n+1)/2. So the sum of additional pieces cut will be n*(n+1)/2.
Finally add 1 because we start with 1 piece: n*(n+1)/2 + 1.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Think about making the cuts one after another and try to maximise how many new pieces the next cut can create.

1. Start with no cuts.  
   • Pieces = 1.

2. When you draw the 1st cut, it obviously splits the pizza into 2 pieces.  
   • Added pieces = 1.

3. Draw the 2nd cut so that it crosses the 1st cut inside the pizza (not at the rim).  
   • Intersections with earlier cuts = 1.  
   • A straight line whose segment inside the circle is hit by k interior intersection points divides k + 1 existing pieces along its length, so it adds k + 1 new pieces.  
   • Added pieces = 1 + 1 = 2.  
   • Total pieces so far = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

4. Draw the 3rd cut so that it crosses both previous cuts in two different interior points and is not concurrent with their intersection.  
   • Intersections with earlier cuts = 2.  
   • Added pieces = 2 + 1 = 3.  
   • Total pieces so far = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7.

Observe the pattern: if every new cut meets all earlier cuts in different interior points and no three lines meet at one interior point, then

   • the k-th cut (k ≥ 1) meets k − 1 earlier cuts,  
   • so it adds (k − 1) + 1 = k new pieces.

Hence, with n cuts,

Pieces(n) = 1 + (1 + 2 + 3 + … + n)
           = 1 + n(n + 1)/2
           = (n² + n + 2)/2.

This upper bound can always be achieved by choosing each cut so that

• it is not parallel to any previous cut,  
• it does not pass through any previous interior intersection point,  
• it intersects the circle, not just touching the rim.

Therefore the largest possible number of pieces obtained with n straight cuts is

One less complex method is to imagine the axis of the cone form a right triangle. This triangle shares the dimensions of the cone, so it is 12 by 5. We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.
Next we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x. If we add 10x on both sides, we get 22x=60, and dividing 22 from both sides yields x=60/22=30/11.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the cone’s axis be the y–axis, with

1. Let the 9-digit number be ABCDEFGHI (each letter is one of the digits 1–9, no repetition).

2. From DE divisible by 5 we get E = 5 (0 is unavailable).

3. The four even digits 2, 4, 6, 8 must occupy the four even-required positions B, D, F, H because:
   • AB divisible by 2 → B even  
   • CD divisible by 4 → D even  
   • EF divisible by 6 → F even  
   • GH divisible by 8 → H even

4. EF divisible by 6 means 50+F is divisible by 3.  
   50 ≡ 2 (mod 3), so F must satisfy F ≡ 1 (mod 3).  
   Among the even digits only 4 satisfies this, hence F = 4.

5. Now B, D, H are the remaining evens {2,6,8}.

6. FG divisible by 7.  F=4, so FG = 40+G.  
   40+G is a multiple of 7 only when G=9 (gives 49).  
   Thus G = 9.

7. GH divisible by 8.  G=9 ⇒ GH = 90+H.  
   90 ≡ 2 (mod 8); we need 2+H ≡ 0 (mod 8) ⇒ H ≡ 6 (mod 8).  
   Hence H = 6.

8. HI divisible by 9.  H=6 ⇒ 60+I multiple of 9.  
   60 ≡ 6 (mod 9); so 6+I ≡ 0 (mod 9) ⇒ I = 3.

9. Unused digits are {1,2,7,8}.  Remember B, D are even {2,8}; A, C are the two odds {1,7}.

10. BC must be divisible by 3, i.e. (B+C) divisible by 3 (because 10B+C ≡ B+C mod 3).

11. Try B=2: then C must give 2+C ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ C≡1 (mod 3).  
    Both 1 and 7 qualify, but CD must be divisible by 4:

        • C=1 ⇒ D=8 ⇒ CD=18 (not ÷4)  
        • C=7 ⇒ D=8 ⇒ CD=78 (not ÷4)

    So B cannot be 2.

12. Therefore B = 8, D = 2.

13. With B=8: need 8+C ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ C≡1 (mod 3).  Both 1 and 7 work:

        • C=1, D=2 → CD=12 (÷4) → A is then 7.
        • C=7, D=2 → CD=72 (÷4) → A is then 1.

        1 8 7 2 5 4 9 6 3  → 187254963

15. Final check (both numbers):

The fastest way to get everyone across is for B and C to start out on foot and A to start out with the bicycle. At a point y, A will get off the bicycle and walk the rest of the way. Eventually C will get to the bicycle abandoned by A, then ride back to a point x, leaving the bicycle there, then turning around and walk until he reaches the end.

126,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
In a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).  How many different ways can a 13-card alternating-colour straight be formed from a Snapoker deck?  Note that jokers can not be used in forming a straight.",Simply find the number of cards of each type of card in the alternating-colors straight,"There are 32,768 possible ways a 13-card alternating-colour straight can be formed in a Snapoker deck.
To form a 13-card alternating-colour straight in Snapoker the following cards can be used:
2 x red aces
4 x black twos
2 x red threes
2 x black fours
2 x red fives
2 x black sixes
2 x red sevens
2 x black eights

Spades (black): only the even ranks survive → 2,4,6,8,10,12  
Hearts (red): only the odd ranks survive → 1(A),3,5,7,9,11(J),13(K)  
Diamonds (red): only the non-prime ranks survive → 4,6,8,9,10,12  
Clubs (black): only the prime ranks survive → 2,3,5,7,11(J),13(K)  

Every surviving card occurs twice (there are two decks).  
Jokers exist but are not allowed in a straight.

Step 2 – What an “alternating-colours straight” must look like  

The straight must contain every rank from Ace (1) to King (13) exactly once and  
colours must alternate red–black–red–black … .  
This forces the odd ranks to be red and the even ranks to be black.

Step 3 – Count the available choices for each rank

Odd (red) ranks  
1 (A): only ♥A  → 2 copies  
3: only ♥3      → 2 copies  
5: only ♥5      → 2 copies  
7: only ♥7      → 2 copies  
9: ♥9 or ♦9     → 4 copies  
11 (J): only ♥J → 2 copies  
13 (K): only ♥K → 2 copies  

Even (black) ranks  
2: ♠2 or ♣2     → 4 copies  
4: only ♠4      → 2 copies  
6: only ♠6      → 2 copies  
8: only ♠8      → 2 copies  
10: only ♠10    → 2 copies  
12 (Q): only ♠Q → 2 copies  

Step 4 – Multiply

Odd ranks: 2·2·2·2·4·2·2 = 256  
Even ranks: 4·2·2·2·2·2   = 128  

Total number of different 13-card alternating-colour straights

1.  D contains a 9 but the original multiset has no 8.  
    Therefore 9 cannot be in N, for doubling 9 produces an 8 (“18”), which is impossible.  
    Hence 9 is in D and must have been produced by doubling a 4 with a carry-in of 1

R = 10 km   (radius of the planet)  
d₁ = 17.345 km  
d₂ = 47.124 km  

On a sphere a “straight” walk follows a great-circle, so every surface distance d corresponds to a central angle θ = d / R (in radians).

1. First leg  
   θ₁ = d₁ / R = 17.345 / 10 = 1.7345 rad ≈ 99.435°.  
   Start at the North Pole; walking south along a meridian through this angle puts you at  
   latitude ϕ₁ = 90° – 99.435° = –9.435° (9.435° south of the equator), longitude λ₁ = 0°.

2. Second leg  
   At that point you are heading due south; a 90° “left” turn means you now head due east.  
   A due-east initial heading from any point is perpendicular to the meridian and is again a great circle.  

   The second distance gives the central angle  
   θ₂ = d₂ / R = 47.124 / 10 = 4.7124 rad.  
   Note 4.712389… rad = 3π/2, so θ₂ differs from 3π/2 by only 1.1 × 10⁻⁵ rad.

   Spherical navigation formulas (start latitude ϕ₁, start longitude λ₁, distance θ₂, initial azimuth 90°) give

   sin ϕ₂ = sin ϕ₁ cos θ₂           (because cos 90° = 0)  
           = (–0.163857)·(1.101 × 10⁻⁵)  
           = –1.804 × 10⁻⁶,

   so ϕ₂ ≈ –1.804 × 10⁻⁶ rad ≈ –0.000103° (essentially on the equator).

   The longitude change is

   Δλ = atan2( sin θ₂ cos ϕ₁ , cos θ₂ )  
       ≈ atan2( –0.9999999999·0.986466 , 1.101 × 10⁻⁵ )  
       ≈ –π/2 + 1.084 × 10⁻⁵ rad.

   Hence λ₂ ≈ –90.00062° (≈ 90° W).

   The end point is therefore almost exactly on the equator 90° west of the prime meridian.

3. Distance from the start (the North Pole) to the end point  
   With start latitude 90° and end latitude ≈ 0°, longitude difference ≈ 90°, the central angle δ satisfies  
   cos δ = sin 90°·sin ϕ₂ + 0·… = sin ϕ₂ ≈ –1.804 × 10⁻⁶,  

   so   δ = arccos(–1.804 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ π/2 + 1.804 × 10⁻⁶ rad.

4 : 00  
   hour = 30·4 = 120°  
   minute = 0°  
   Δ = |120 – 0| = 120°

How fast does the spider advance with respect to the rod?  

While the spider is walking, the band is also being stretched.  
At an instant t the fraction of the band already covered is x/L.  
Because the stretching is uniform, every point of the band (including the spider’s position) is moving away from the rod at the relative rate (x/L)·(dL/dt).  

Hence  

 dx/dt = 1            (walking)

This is a linear first-order ODE.

   R(+8) = λ(|4| + |12|) = λ(4 + 12) = 16λ.  
   This is twice Bill’s and twice Bob’s rate ⇒ Frank’s claim is correct.

4. Jim: v = −12 (driving west at 12 km/h)  
   R(−12) = λ(|−16| + |−8|) = λ(16 + 8) = 24λ.  
   Frank’s rate is 16λ, so Jim’s rate is only 1.5 × Frank’s, not 2 ×.  
   Moreover, Frank was right, so Jim’s statement that “they were all wrong” is itself wrong.

Summary  
• Frank’s claim is correct.  
• Bob’s and Jim’s claims are wrong.  
• Bill made no quantitative claim to check.

Final answer: Only Frank’s statement is correct; Bob’s and Jim’s statements are wrong.",True,1,0

617 is the mystery number.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We translate every sentence of the riddle into exact arithmetic conditions and then sift through them systematically.

1.  ABC is a 3-digit prime.  
   ⇒ A ≠ 0 and C ∈ {1,3,7} (only possible terminal digits for an odd 3-digit prime that is not 5 or 9).

2.  AB and BC are both 2-digit primes.  
   ⇒ B must be 1, 3 or 7 (units digit of a 2-digit prime other than 9).  
   ⇒ C must again be 1, 3 or 7, and C ≠ B.

3.  A, B, C are distinct and none is 9 (given directly).

4.  “Greatest-to-least” and “least-to-greatest’’ permutations are primes.  
   ⇒ The three distinct digits must still yield primes when read in ascending and descending order.

So we now list the few possibilities forced by AB and BC being prime.

Case B = 1  
   AB can be 31, 41, 61, 71.  
   BC can be 13 or 17 (C = 3 or 7).  
   Testing the four A–C pairs that keep all digits distinct:

   •  A=3, C=7  →  ABC = 317, but 731 (descending) = 17·43, not prime.  
   •  A=4, C=3  →  ABC = 413 = 7·59, not prime.  
   •  A=4, C=7  →  ABC = 417 divisible by 3.  
   •  A=6, C=3  →  ABC = 613; ascending 136 is even → not prime.  
   •  A=6, C=7  →  ABC = 617; ascending 167 prime, descending 761 prime.  ✔

Case B = 3  
   BC prime forces C = 1 or 7 (31 or 37).  
   Parallel checking of all allowed A (so that AB is prime) kills every possibility: one of ABC,  the ascending, or descending permutation always fails to be prime.

Case B = 7  
   BC prime forces C = 1 or 3 (71 or 73).  
   Running through A = 1,3,4,6 (giving AB = 17,37,47,67) again knocks out every candidate except none passes all prime tests.

The only survivor of all six clues is therefore

136,"Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?
Comments to triflers:
The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!",There are hints in the comments to triflers and in the title.,"80
To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion. This takes 9 trips of 2 5/18 miles (5 advancing trips interspersed with 4 return trips) for a total of 20.5 miles traveled (9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5) and 20.5 bottles of soda used. Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases. With one less case to move, Bu will now make 2 fewer trips. The 3.5 bottles set aside are used to move the four cases the next 1/2 mile toward the Wirth Pavilion.   After this, the Wirth Pavilion is just 2 2/9 miles away ( 5 - 2 5/18 - 9/18 = 2 4/18 ). Next, he travels 15 5/9 miles (7 * 2 2/9) using 15 5/9 bottles of soda to complete his trip. The ranger cadet delivers 80 bottles to the pavilion and has 4/9 of a Park Pop to spare. (96 - 15 5/9 = 80 4/9)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-1  ‑  useful figures  
• one case  = 24 bottles, total supply = 5·24 = 120 bottles  
• the MoJoPed can have at most 25 bottles aboard at one time:  
  24 (in the rack) + 1 (in the tank, which is drunk during that mile).  
• every mile travelled empties exactly one bottle.

Step-2  –  what one round-trip across a single mile costs  
Load 24 unopened bottles + 1 bottle for fuel, drive one mile forward.
At the new point the 24 unopened bottles are unloaded.  
Pick one of them, pour it into the tank and drive back.  

Result of that round-trip  
 unopened bottles transferred forward : 24 – 1 = 23  
 bottles drunk / lost        : 2  

So each complete “there-and-back” costs 2 bottles and nets 23
unopened bottles one mile forward.  
After all necessary round-trips are finished a last one-way run is made;
it moves the remaining bottles (≤24) forward and consumes just 1 bottle.

Step-3  –  notation for one mile
Let S be the number of unopened bottles that stand at the beginning of a
mile.  
g = ⌊S/25⌋ is the number of complete round-trips that have to be made  
(the MoJoPed can remove at most 25 bottles from the pile each time).  

Consumption for that mile
C(S) = 2g + 1   (because each round-trip costs 2, the final one-way costs 1)

The stock that reaches the next milepost is
S′ = S – C(S).

Step-4  –  run the five miles

mile 0→1 : S₀ = 120,   g=⌊120/25⌋=4,   C=2·4+1=9  ⇒ S₁ = 111  
mile 1→2 : S₁ = 111,   g=4,               C=9     ⇒ S₂ = 102  
mile 2→3 : S₂ = 102,   g=4,               C=9     ⇒ S₃ = 93  
mile 3→4 : S₃ = 93,    g=3,               C=7     ⇒ S₄ = 86  
mile 4→5 : S₄ = 86,    g=3,               C=7     ⇒ S₅ = 79  

After the fifth mile 79 unopened bottles are at the Wirth Pavilion.

Step-5  –  why this is best
• In every “there-and-back” the ratio 23 unopened : 2 lost is the
best possible; carrying fewer than 24 bottles would only worsen that
ratio.  
• Therefore the described strategy (always load the rack completely
until fewer than 25 bottles remain, then make the final one-way run)
minimises the number of bottles consumed on each mile.  
• Any other scheme would either use at least the same number of
round-trips or move fewer bottles, and so could not deliver more than 79
unopened bottles.

137,"Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.  Henry's plan calls for the tracks (each of which is one mile in length) to be laid end-to-end with no gap between them, pinned to the ground at every other juncture, as shown below:
v_______ _______vv_______ _______v
Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""
Henry replies, ""The expansion will only be an inch over the whole mile length.  If the tracks buckle, it will only be by an inch or two at most.  The trains will certainly have no trouble bumping over these buckles.""
Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?",Would Pythagoras have the same plan?,"The rise in the middle of the tracks would have been much greater than Henry surmised.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse). SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Call the distance between two consecutive pins L and let the rise of the buckle at the middle be h (the “sagitta”).  
After the temperature rise each mile-long rail becomes 1 in = 1⁄12 ft longer, so the two rails that lie between two pins together become

δ = 2 in = 2⁄12 ft = 1⁄6 ft   (≈ 0.1667 ft)

longer than the straight distance between the pins.  
Because the ends are fixed to the ground, the extra 1⁄6 ft can be taken up only by bowing upward.  
The bowed rails will form, to very good approximation, a circular arc.

For a circular arc

chord length = 2R sin θ = L  
arc length   = 2R θ = L + δ  
sagitta      = R(1 – cos θ) = h.

For small θ   (the case here)   
sin θ ≈ θ – θ³⁄6, cos θ ≈ 1 – θ²⁄2,

so

δ = 2R(θ – sin θ) ≈ 2R·θ³⁄6 = R θ³⁄3,               (1)  
h = R(1 – cos θ) ≈ R·θ²⁄2.                          (2)

From the chord relation L = 2R sin θ ≈ 2Rθ we have R ≈ L /(2θ).  
Insert this in (1):

δ ≈ R θ³⁄3 ≈ (L /(2θ))·θ³⁄3 = L θ²⁄6   ⇒   θ² ≈ 6δ /L.               (3)

Put (3) into (2) and again R ≈ L /(2θ):

h ≈ R θ² ⁄2 ≈ (L /(2θ))·θ² ⁄2 = L θ ⁄4  
    ≈ L ⁄4 · √(6δ /L) = √( (3/8) · L · δ ).                          (4)

Now substitute the actual numbers.

The pins occur at every other rail joint, i.e. 2 miles apart:

L = 2 mi = 2·5280 ft = 10 560 ft,  δ = 1⁄6 ft.

h ≈ √( (3/8) · 10 560 · 1⁄6 )  
   = √( 0.375 · 10 560 · 0.1667 )  
   = √( 660 ) ≈ 25.7 ft.

So the rails would have to rise about twenty-six feet in the middle to absorb the extra inch per mile of length.  Even if Henry had pinned every joint (so L = 1 mile), the buckle height would still be

h ≈ √( (3/8) · 5280 · 1⁄12 ) ≈ 12.8 ft.

A locomotive cannot “bump over” a hump a dozen (let alone two-dozen) feet high.  
Henry forgot that a tiny fractional change in length, when the ends are fixed, produces a very large deflection.

Final answer:  Because the rails are anchored, the extra inch per mile must be taken up by bowing; the geometry shows the buckle would be on the order of 25 ft high (even 13 ft with pins every mile), far too large for a train to negotiate.",True,0,0

1.  Every package contains 225 gums, so N must be a positive multiple of 225:
      N = 225 k   for some integer k ≥ 1.

2.  The decimal expansion of N may use only the digits 0 and 1.

3.  Factor 225:
      225 = 9 × 25.

   Hence N must be divisible by both 9 and 25.

–––– Divisibility by 25 ––––
A decimal number is divisible by 25 iff its last two digits are 00, 25, 50, 75.  
Because only 0’s and 1’s are allowed, the only possible ending is 00.  
So N ends in 00.

–––– Divisibility by 9 ––––
A decimal number is divisible by 9 iff the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  
Since the digits can only be 0 or 1, the sum of the digits equals the count of 1’s in N.  
Therefore:
      (# of 1’s in N) ≡ 0  (mod 9).

–––– Minimum length ––––
Let k be the count of digits before the obligatory final “00”.  
Then N has k + 2 total digits, with k ≥ 1 and its first digit equal to 1.

• If k ≤ 8, the maximum possible number of 1’s is k ≤ 8 < 9; the digit-sum can’t reach a multiple of 9.  
  Therefore k must be at least 9.

• Take k = 9 (the smallest admissible).  
  To make the digit-sum a multiple of 9 we need exactly 9 ones (because we cannot exceed 9 ones when k = 9, and we need a non-zero multiple of 9).  
  Hence all nine of those digits must be 1.

Thus the only possible 11-digit candidate is

The only way to get a trailing zero is by multiplying a factor of 1000! which is 2 by a factor of 1000! which is 5. The modified problem is thus: How many such pairs of factors are there?
There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5.

Finally there is 1 = [1000/625] number which is a multiple of 625, this gives one further factor of 5. Thus there are exactly  200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249 factors of 5 in 1000! and since there are more than sufficient factors of 2, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"To find the number of trailing zeros at the end of 1000!, we must determine how many times 10 divides 1000!.

When a number of riders reach the finish in one bunch they are all given the same time; only if a gap appears is a slower time recorded for the riders that are dropped.  
So a man can cross the line 1st or 93rd inside the same group and still be given exactly the same time.

Picture the following perfectly possible development of the 14 stages.

•  In every stage a leading bunch of 93 riders reaches the finish together.  
   The champion always heads this bunch, “Crazy” Charles is always the last man of it, hence he is 93rd every day.  
   All 93 riders therefore receive the same stage time.  

•  Behind that bunch seven riders are dropped and arrive several minutes later.  
   Because they arrive in a second group they are all credited with the extra minutes that separated them from the first bunch.

•  Each day the seven dropped riders are different ones, and during the 14 stages every one of the 98 riders that are neither the champion nor Charles is, once and only once, among those seven.  

Counting:  
14 stages × 7 riders dropped each day = 98 riders – exactly the whole field except the champion and Charles.

Consequences for the general classification

– The champion never loses contact with the first bunch; he keeps exactly the basic time of the bunch and also gains small time bonuses for winning the stages, so he finishes first overall.

– Charles also never loses contact with the first bunch; he therefore has exactly the same basic time as the champion, only lacking the few bonus seconds.  
  Hence he is a few seconds slower than the champion.

– Every other competitor is, on one single stage, in the group that came in minutes late; each of them therefore has at least several minutes more than Charles in the accumulated time.

Thus at the end of the 14 stages the only rider whose total time is shorter than Charles’s is the champion, and “Crazy” Charles, although he was never better than 93rd in any individual stage, is runner-up in the final general classification.

Final answer: Because Charles always reached the finish in the main bunch he never lost time, while every other rider except the eventual champion got dropped at least once and lost several minutes; accumulated time, not daily placings, decides the race, so Charles ended second overall even though he was 93rd in every stage.",True,1,0

What was the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet ?",Everything can be expressed and solvd in terms of the original price of the bouquet and the inflation rate,"The original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.
Let the original price of the Red Rose bouquet  be 'B' Roka.
It is given that during a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%.
Hence after a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 162 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)
(since B(1+Y) is the price during inflation and  B(1-Y)(1+Y) the price during the slowdown)
Therefore the decrease in price after one year
= B - B(1-Y^2)
= B - B + B*Y^2
= B*Y^2 = 162      ... Equation 1
Hence after another year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 147.42 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)(1-Y^2)
= B(1-Y^2)^2
(since B(1-Y^2) is the price at the end of the previous year and           B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y) the price during the slowdown this year)
Therefore the decrease in price this year
= B(1-Y^2) - B(1-Y^2)^2
= B(1-Y^2)[1 - (1-Y^2)]
= B(1-Y^2)( Y^2) = 147.42    ... Equation 2
Dividing Equation 2 by Equation 1, we get
(1-Y^2) = 0.91 => Y^2 = 0.09
Substituting the above value of Y^2 in equation 1, we get
B*0.09 = 162
Hence B = 162/0.09 = 1800 Roka.
Therefore the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

P₀ = original price of the bouquet (in Roka)  
Y % = rate used in both the inflation and the slowdown  
r = Y/100 (so r is the decimal form, e.g. 30 % ⇒ r = 0.30)

Each year the shopkeeper  
1. raises the price by Y %  ⇒  multiply by (1 + r)  
2. then lowers that new price by Y % ⇒ multiply by (1 − r)

Hence one complete “inflation–slowdown” cycle multiplies the price by  
(1 + r)(1 − r) = 1 − r².  
Thus the price after one year is P₀(1 − r²).

FIRST YEAR  
Price drop = P₀ − P₀(1 − r²) = P₀r² = 162  (1)

SECOND YEAR  
Starting price for year 2 is P₀(1 − r²).  
After the same two-step change the drop is  
P₀(1 − r²)·r² = P₀r²(1 − r²) = 147.42  (2)

Divide (2) by (1):

P₀r²(1 − r²) / (P₀r²) = 147.42 / 162  
⇒ 1 − r² = 147.42 / 162 = 0.91  
⇒ r² = 1 − 0.91 = 0.09  
⇒ r = 0.30  (30 %)

Now find P₀ from (1):

P₀r² = 162  
⇒ P₀ = 162 / 0.09 = 1800.

So the bouquet originally cost 1800 Roka.

151,"In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.
On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.
About this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, ""Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.""
Knowing Junior, we asked, ""How big a headache is your math gonna give us?""
She answered, ""I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.""
Name the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.",Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.,"Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.
After labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, ""Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof. First, I mark a line from A to D.  This creates a trapezoid (trapezium in Britain) ABCD.  Next, I mark the lines EH, BG, and CF.  These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.""
The partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  What size can the rep-digit be?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Because the smallest possible product of two such 2-digit numbers is  
13 × 57 = 741, the result after subtracting C is at least 741–9 = 732,
so the rep-digit must contain at least three digits and at most four
digits (the largest possible product 97 × 53 = 5141 is still < 9999).

2.  Searching systematically

Write the rep-digit as d·(111…1k) with digit d∈{1,…,9} and
k∈{3,4}.  The required equation is

        (10A+B)(10D+E) = d·(111…1k) + C,        1 ≤ C ≤ 9.

Hence the product of the first and last two–digit numbers must exceed a
rep-digit by at most 9.

Rather than test all 5! = 120 arrangements individually we can list,
for each choice of the four outer digits, every possible product of two
distinct 2-digit numbers, and check whether it lies 1–9 above a
rep-digit.

Carrying this out (there are only 18 distinct products to examine for
each middle digit) gives just one successful product:

        39 × 57 = 2223   (which is 1 greater than 2222).

Here the four digits used are 3,9,5,7, so the only digit left for the
centre is 1.  Therefore the five-digit numbers that satisfy the
condition are produced by placing 1 in the middle and choosing either
order for the two 2-digit factors:

When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.

The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:

At this point, each member of the core group knows everything. Now, each person outside the core group calls anybody who knows everything; this again requires n-4 calls, for a total of 2n-4.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let g(n) be the minimum number of telephone calls that guarantee that n people each finish knowing every one of the n different pieces of gossip.

   Label the people P₁,P₂,…,Pₙ (n ≥ 4).

   Stage 1  (n − 2 calls – “collect” the news)  
   P₁ is the collector.  
   P₂,P₃,…,Pₙ₋₁ successively ring P₁.  
   After these n−2 calls P₁ knows every secret except Pₙ’s;  
   the last caller, Pₙ₋₁, knows every secret except Pₙ’s as well, because
   when Pₙ₋₁ rang P₁ the latter already possessed the information coming
   from everybody up to Pₙ₋₂.

   Stage 2  (n − 2 calls – “broadcast” the news)  
   Now use Pₙ₋₁, who already knows almost everything, to spread the
   information outward:

   Pₙ rings Pₙ₋₁, then Pₙ₋₂ rings Pₙ₋₁, then Pₙ₋₃ rings Pₙ₋₁, … , finally P₂ rings Pₙ₋₁.

   In every one of these n−2 calls Pₙ₋₁ passes on the whole stock of
   gossip, therefore after the last of them everybody knows everything.

   Total number of calls = (n − 2)+(n − 2)=2n − 4.

2.  A lower bound of 2n − 4 calls when n ≥ 4  

   Look at the two people, say A and B, who speak in the very first
   telephone call.  Their two secrets, s_A and s_B, are initially known to
   one person each.  In the final situation every secret is known to all n
   people, so each of s_A and s_B has to be communicated to the remaining
   n−1 people.

   A single telephone call can convey a given secret to at most one new
   person (only the two participants are involved).  Hence, taken
   separately, each of s_A and s_B needs at least n−1 transmissions.  The
   very first call and the very last call can each carry both secrets
   simultaneously, so up to two of these transmissions can be “shared”.
   Consequently the total number of calls is at least

          (n−1) + (n−1) − 2 = 2n − 4.

   Therefore no scheme can use fewer than 2n−4 calls.

3.  Small n  

   g(1)=0   (nothing to exchange)  
   g(2)=1   (the two people ring once)  
   g(3)=3   (e.g. 1–2, 1–3, 2–3)

Putting the pieces together,

          g(n)=  0,   n=1

So the smallest possible number of telephone calls among n people who
initially hold n different pieces of gossip is

   Hence ABC lies between 124 (the smallest 3–digit number with distinct, non-zero, non-3 digits) and 256.

3.  Eliminate D = 1  
   If D = 1 the units digit of the product would equal C (because ABC × 31 ends in C), repeating a digit — impossible.  
   So D ∈ {2,4,5,6,7,8,9}.

4.  Try the largest multiplier first: D = 9 (multiplier 39)  
   • ABC must not contain 3 or 9.  
   • ABC ≤ 256.  
   Candidate ABC’s are therefore numbers such as 124,125,126,…,256 with distinct digits drawn from {1,2,4,5,6,7,8}.  

   Compute ABC × 39 (= ABC × 40 – ABC) for each candidate, rejecting any product that  
        – is not four-digit,  
        – contains 3 or 9,  
        – repeats a digit already used in the factors.

   The first candidate that works is

            186 × 39 = 7254

   Check digit usage:  
         factors use 1,8,6,3,9 ;  
         product uses 7,2,5,4.  
   Together they give exactly the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with no repetition.

5.  Uniqueness  
   Repeating the same test for all remaining candidates and for the smaller multipliers 38, 37, …, 32 shows no other combination satisfies all the requirements; hence the solution found is unique.

Therefore the only way to complete the equation is

186 × 39 = 7254

 1 ≤ k_i ≤ n for every i.

Step 2.  Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that all those numbers k_1,…,k_n are different.

N = 10a + d  

where  
  d (1 ≤ d ≤ 9) is the right-most digit and  
  a is the rest of the number (so N has k digits ⇒ a has k–1 digits).

After moving d to the front we get  

M = d·10^{k-1} + a .

The condition “the new number is 50 % larger” means  

d·10^{k-1} + a = 3/2 · (10a + d).

Multiply by 2 and rearrange:

2d·10^{k-1} – 3d = 28a

⇒ a = d(2·10^{k-1} – 3) / 28.  (1)

Thus d(2·10^{k-1} – 3) must be divisible by 28 = 4·7.

Step 1: Find 2·10^{k-1} – 3 (mod 28).  
Because 10^{n} (mod 28) has period 6,

10^{n} (mod 28) for n = 0…5: 1, 10, 16, 20, 4, 12  
2·10^{n} – 3 (mod 28) = 27, 17, 1, 9, 5, 21.

Hence 2·10^{k-1} – 3 ≡ 21 (mod 28) exactly when k–1 ≡ 5 (mod 6), i.e. k ≡ 0 (mod 6).

No other residue is divisible by 7, so k must be a multiple of 6; the smallest such k is 6.

Step 2: k = 6.  
Then 2·10^{5} – 3 = 200 000 – 3 = 199 997.

Write 199 997 = 28·7142 + 21.

To make d(199 997) divisible by 28 we already have the factor 7 in 21, so d must supply the factor 4.  
The only digits with a factor 4 are d = 4 or 8.

Compute a from (1):

d = 4: a = 4·199 997 / 28 = 4·7142 + 3 = 28 571  
d = 8: a = 8·199 997 / 28 = 8·7142 + 6 = 57 142.

Both a’s have 5 digits, so both are admissible, but we need the smaller resulting N.

For d = 4: N = 10a + d = 285 714  
For d = 8: N = 571 428

Hence the smallest number is 285 714.

This is an arithmetic–series sum, so

k(2a + k – 1) = 2N  (1)

Hence k must be a divisor of 2N.  Distinguish the two parities of k.

1.  k odd  
   Then k divides the left side of (1), so k must also divide 2N; but because k is odd it must actually divide N.  
   Write N = k·m with k odd (k ≥ 3).  
   The average of the k consecutive terms is m, so the sequence is

   m – (k–1)/2, m – (k–1)/2 + 1, … , m + (k–1)/2.

   Such a sequence exists exactly when k > 1 is an odd divisor of N.  
   Consequently, if N possesses any odd divisor larger than 1, N is representable.

2.  k even

   2r(2a + 2r – 1) = 2N  ⇒  r(2a + 2r – 1) = N. (2)

   The parenthesis is odd, so r must divide N and N/r must be odd.  
   Thus an even–length representation exists whenever N/r is odd, i.e. whenever N has a divisor r for which N/r is odd.

Putting the two cases together one finds the classical result:

A positive integer N can be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive (non-negative) integers iff N is not a power of 2.

(If N is a power of 2, it has no odd divisor larger than 1, and in (2) the requirement that N/r be odd forces r = N, which makes the first term a negative.)

Now look at the interval 1000 ≤ N ≤ 2000.  
The only power of 2 in this range is 2¹⁰ = 1024.  
Every other integer in the interval possesses an odd divisor > 1, hence each of them can be written as a sum of consecutive non-negative integers, while 1024 cannot.

169,"Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.
We were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?",Find numbers who do not have a duplicate that will be deleted,"It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.
Hence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.
Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90. These 90 id's will not have a corresponding number when written in reverse order.
Secondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order. For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.
Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.
Therefore total number of valid employee id's possible = 90 + 90 + 360 = 540.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Think of every valid employee–ID as a 3-digit string abc

• a ∈ {1,…,9}   (first digit cannot be 0)  
• b ∈ {0,…,9}  
• c ∈ {0,…,9}

Total possible IDs = 9·10·10 = 900.

We must choose a subset so that no two chosen IDs are reverses of each other.

1. IDs whose last digit is 0 (c = 0)  
   Reverse = cba = 0ba → begins with 0, hence is NOT a valid ID.  
   Therefore these 9·10 = 90 IDs are conflict–free; we can keep them all.

2. IDs whose last digit is non-zero (c ≠ 0)

   a) Palindromes: abc = cba ⇒ a = c (and a ≠ 0).  
      Count: 9 (choices for a = c) · 10 (choices for b) = 90 IDs.  
      Each conflicts only with itself, so all 90 can be kept.

   b) Non-palindromes with c ≠ 0 and a ≠ c.  
      Count: 9·10·9 − 90 = 810 − 90 = 720 IDs.  
      These occur in disjoint reversal pairs {abc, cba}.  
      From each pair we may keep at most one, so we can keep exactly 720/2 = 360 of them.

Maximum number of employees =

Evaluate both sides:

If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.

If N=2 and A=4, then E=6. R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.
If N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.
If N=2, then since R cannot be 5, R=8, L=5, and I=7.
If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.
Since 1+S+T equals 5 or 15, S+T equals 4 or 14. If S+T=14, then S and T must be 5 and 9, or 6 and 8, in some order. But each of our three scenarios has a letter for at least one of 5 and 9, as well as one for 8. So S+T=4, S and T are 1 and 3 in some order, and O+S=12.

Of that list, 33 is the only number that contains a 3 as the second digit and so for criterion 3 to be satisfied, 3 can only appear at the start of the 5-digit numbers.  From there it is simply a matter of choosing the next digits using the list above so that criterion 2 is satisfied, making sure that criterion 3 is also satisfied.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning

1.  The only prime digits are 2, 3, 5 and 7.  
2.  For every adjacent pair of digits XY the 2-digit number 10·X+Y must be composite.  
    From the table of two–digit numbers built with the prime digits  

            22 23* 25 27
            32 33 35 37*
            52 53* 55 57
            72 73* 75 77  

    the starred ones (23, 37, 53, 73) are the only primes.  
    Hence the illegal consecutive pairs are exactly 23, 37, 53, 73.

3.  Consequence for the digit 3  
    •  A 3 that is not in the first position would have to be preceded by 3  
      (because 23, 53, 73 are forbidden).  
    •  But then that preceding 3 would again need a 3 before it, etc.  
      Therefore the only way to use the digit 3 is to put all 3’s
      in one solid block starting in the very first position.  
      Hence every admissible 5-digit number must begin with 3 and may
      contain no other 3’s after the initial block.

4.  Digits which can follow a leading block of 3’s  
    After the last 3 we may write 2 or 5 (not 7, because 37 is forbidden).  
    Among the remaining digits {2, 5, 7} no pair is forbidden, so once we
    have left the initial 3-block the rest of the number may be any string
    of 2’s, 5’s and 7’s (provided each of 2, 5, 7 occurs at least once).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Smallest admissible 5-digit number
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Take only one leading 3 (a longer 3-block would already make the number
larger), then choose the smallest possible digits thereafter while
honouring the conditions and making sure 2, 5 and 7 all appear:

    3 2 2 5 7

All four adjacent pairs are 32, 22, 25, 57 – all composite – and every
prime digit appears.  Hence the minimum is 32257.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Largest admissible 5-digit number
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Start with 3 and make every next digit as large as allowed.

• Second digit: 5 is the largest that may follow 3 (35 is composite).  
• Third digit: 7 is larger than 2 and is allowed after 5 (57 composite).  
• Fourth digit: another 7 is larger than 2 or 5 and is allowed after 7.  
• Fifth digit must be 2 (to ensure the digit 2 appears at least once and
  putting it last keeps the number largest).

Thus we get 3 5 7 7 2.

Pairs: 35, 57, 77, 72 – all composite – and all four prime digits appear.
No other arrangement can be larger, because any change would either

177,"Once an old man died, and in his Will he stated that all the pearls he kept in a little bag were to be distributed among his daughters. To make things fair, the distribution must be done in the following way:
The older girl should receive one pearl, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""
And so it was.
How many pearls were there in the bag?
How many daughters did the old man have?
How many pearls did each girl get?","If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","There were 36 pearls.
There were 6 daughters.
Each daughter got 6 pearls.
The girl number x will have x pearls and a seventh of the rest. Since the last girl leaves no pearls in the bag, then when she takes her pearls the rest in the bag is zero (a seventh of nothing is nothing).
Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).
That is, k+1 = 7 and then k = 6.

  (i = 0,1,2,…,k ; so Nₖ = 0).

Step performed by the i-th girl (i = 1,2,…,k)  
 1. She first takes i pearls.  
 2. From what then remains (N_{i-1} – i) she takes one seventh of it.  
Thus  

 p = i + 1/7 (N_{i-1} – i)                             (1)

After her turn the bag contains

1.  Eliminate the fractional term  
From (1) get N_{i-1} – i = 7(p – i).

2.  Apply the last step (i = k)  
The bag is empty afterwards, so Nₖ = 0.

 N₁ = 6(k – 1).                                       (6)

------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Go to the second girl (i = 2)  
Her turn starts with N₁ pearls in the bag, so (1) gives

 k = 2 + 1/7(N₁ – 2).

Insert N₁ from (6):

 k = 2 + 1/7(6(k – 1) – 2)  
 k = 2 + 1/7(6k – 8)  
 7k = 14 + 6k – 8

6.  Verify the whole distribution  

Start: 36 pearls.  

Girl 1: takes 1 + (1/7 of 35) = 1 + 5 = 6 ⇒ 30 left.  
Girl 2: takes 2 + (1/7 of 28) = 2 + 4 = 6 ⇒ 24 left.  
Girl 3: takes 3 + (1/7 of 21) = 3 + 3 = 6 ⇒ 18 left.  
Girl 4: takes 4 + (1/7 of 14) = 4 + 2 = 6 ⇒ 12 left.  
Girl 5: takes 5 + (1/7 of 7)  = 5 + 1 = 6 ⇒  6 left.

Step 1 – place the unique 6  
The only primes containing a 6 are 61 and 67.  
If we chose 67 we would also exhaust the single 7, leaving no way to use the two 4’s (only 41, 43, 47 contain a 4, and 47 needs the 7 already spent).

As stated in the problem, the larger arc must be the next largest integer size, which is 181 degrees.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the two given lines be rays OA and OB that meet at the point O with ∠AOB = 90°.

Because each ray meets the circle in exactly one point (A on OA and B on OB) the rays must be tangent to the circle at those points.  Thus OA and OB are two tangents to the same circle, intersecting at O.

A standard theorem for two tangents to a circle states:

Angle between two tangents = ½ (major arc − minor arc).

If we denote the minor arc AB by x°, then the major arc AB measures 360° − x°.  
Substituting into the theorem:

∠AOB = ½ [(360° − x) − x]  
90° = ½ (360° − 2x)  
90° = 180° − x  
x = 90°.

Hence the minor arc AB is 90°, so the larger (major) arc AB is

360° − 90° = 270°.

The condition in both parts of the story is

We look for the smallest positive integer R (< 100) for which (1) is integral.

Checking R = 1, 2, 3, …, 19 gives non-integers.  
R = 20 gives

 K = 20² /(100 – 20) = 400/80 = 5

Rod’s 20 pieces equal Kurt’s 20 % of 25, and 25 is the smallest total possible.

    F × A = C  
   All letters are distinct digits 1-8, so the product must itself be one of 1-8.  
   The only distinct pairs (F,A) with F × A ≤ 8 are  
    (2,3,6), (3,2,6), (2,4,8), (4,2,8)  → giving (F,A,C) respectively.

2.  Check each pair in the first equation  
    (10F + A) × A = 10C + F  

   (2,3,6): 23 × 3 = 69  ≠ 62  
   (3,2,6): 32 × 2 = 64  ≠ 63  
   (2,4,8): 24 × 4 = 96  ≠ 82  
   (4,2,8): 42 × 2 = 84  = 84 ✔  

   Thus F=4, A=2, C=8.

3.  Second equation with A = 2  
    (10D + G) × 2 = 10B + 2  
   Dividing by 2 → 10D + G = 5B + 1.

   Possible B (still unused digits) {1,3,5,6,7} give  
    B=1→6, B=3→16, B=5→26, B=6→31, B=7→36.  
   The two-digit results that match 10D+G form:  
    16 → D=1,G=6, B=3  (Option A)  
    31 → D=3,G=1, B=6  (Option B)  
    36 → D=3,G=6, B=7  (Option C)

4.  Third equation H × E = D H

   • Option A (D=1): remaining digits {5,7}.  
     H × E would have to be 1H (11–18) – impossible → discard.

   • Option B (D=3, G=1, B=6): remaining digits {5,7}.  
     Need H × E = 3H.  
     H=5, E=7 → 5 × 7 = 35 = 3 5 ✔  
     H=7, E=5 → 35 ≠ 37.  
     So choose H=5, E=7.  All digits now unique.

   • Option C fails similarly (no product 3H with digits {1,5}).

   Therefore Option B is the only consistent set.

5.  Collect the assignments  
   A = 2 B = 6 C = 8 D = 3 E = 7 F = 4 G = 1 H = 5

6.  Final check of all four equations  
   F × A = 4×2 = 8 = C ✔  
   (FA) × A = 42×2 = 84 → CF = 84 ✔  
   (DG) × A = 31×2 = 62 → BA = 62 ✔  
   H × E = 5×7 = 35 → DH = 35 ✔

All conditions are satisfied with each digit 1-8 used exactly once.

Three is the smallest number whose product is greater than its sum.  Therefore you want to include as many 3's in the answer as possible.  Then make 2's (or 4's) out of the remainder.
20 / 3 = 6, remainder 2 so 3^6 x 2",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We want to split 20 into positive integers n₁+n₂+…+n_k = 20 so that the product P = n₁ n₂ … n_k is as large as possible.

Key facts (well-known, but can be proved quickly):

1. Any part greater than 4 should be broken up, because  
   m ≥ 5  ⇒ m = 3+(m−3) or m = 2+(m−2) gives the same sum but a larger product:  
   3(m−3) = 3m−9 > m for m ≥ 5.

2. Therefore an optimal decomposition uses only 2’s and 3’s.

Let x = number of 3’s, y = number of 2’s.

Equation of the sum: 3x + 2y = 20.

Possible integer pairs (x, y):

x = 0 → y = 10  → P = 2¹⁰      = 1024  
x = 2 → y = 7   → P = 3²·2⁷   = 9·128  = 1152  
x = 4 → y = 4   → P = 3⁴·2⁴   = 81·16 = 1296  
x = 6 → y = 1   → P = 3⁶·2¹   = 729·2 = 1458

(Other x give non-integer y or negative y.)

The largest product attained is 1458 when we take six 3’s and one 2, i.e. the partition

20 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2.

1. 5 N must end in 5 (because 5 × odd digit gives a units digit 5, and 0 is forbidden).  
   Therefore the last digit of N is an odd digit d with 5d ≡ 5 (mod 10) and d ≠ 5.  
   Hence d ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}.

2. Take N to be 4-digits long; then 5 N will be 5-digits long (4 + 5 = 9 digits total).

189,"A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

1. Running back to A  
   • Distance the man must run: 3/8 L  
   • Time for him to reach A: t₁ = (3/8 L)/v

2. Running forward to B

Rewrite each statement in “if … then …” form and also its contrapositive (which is logically equivalent and often more useful).

1. If N is NOT a multiple of 4  →  60 ≤ N ≤ 69.  
   Contrapositive: If N < 60 or N > 69  →  N IS a multiple of 4.

2. If N IS a multiple of 3  →  50 ≤ N ≤ 59.  
   Contrapositive: If N < 50 or N > 59  →  N is NOT a multiple of 3.

3. If N is NOT a multiple of 6  →  70 ≤ N ≤ 79.  
   Contrapositive: If N < 70 or N > 79  →  N IS a multiple of 6.

Step 1.  Show N cannot lie below 50 or above 79.  
Below 50 (or above 79) we have all three contrapositives active:

• must be a multiple of 4 (from 1)  
• must NOT be a multiple of 3 (from 2)  
• must be a multiple of 6 (from 3, which forces a multiple of 3)

The last two requirements are incompatible, so N cannot be <50 or >79.

Step 2.  Show N cannot be in 50–59.  
50–59 is outside 60–69 and 70–79, so again N has to be a multiple of 4 and of 6 (from contrapositives 1 and 3), hence a multiple of 12; but there is no multiple of 12 between 50 and 59.  Impossible.

Step 3.  Show N cannot be in 60–69.  
60–69 is outside 70–79, so N must be a multiple of 6 (contrapositive 3).  
But 60–69 is also outside 50–59, so N is NOT a multiple of 3 (contrapositive 2).  
These two demands clash (a multiple of 6 is automatically a multiple of 3).  Impossible.

Step 4.  Therefore N must lie in 70–79.  
In this range:

• Because it is outside 60–69, N must be a multiple of 4 (contrapositive 1).  
• Because it is outside 50–59, N must NOT be a multiple of 3 (contrapositive 2).

List the numbers 70–79 that are multiples of 4: 72 and 76.  
Among them, 72 is divisible by 3, 76 is not.

Thus the only candidate is N = 76.

Verification:

1. 76 is a multiple of 4, so the hypothesis of statement 1 is false; the implication is true.  
2. 76 is not a multiple of 3, so the hypothesis of statement 2 is false; the implication is true.  
3. 76 is not a multiple of 6 and indeed lies between 70 and 79; statement 3 is satisfied.

194,"Difficult Danny has acquired his nickname (and some other, less polite nicknames) due to the fact that, whenever he buys anything, he insists upon paying the exact amount, with precisely 100 pieces of currency. Danny wanted an xCube365 (it lasts 365 days before programmatically disabling itself, so that a new one must be purchased), the highly coveted gaming system that had just been released. It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?","First, see if there is a denomination that is not used. If so, figure out which denomination that is","Can at least one of each denomination be used? That totals $186 with only 6 bills, plus at least $94 with the rest of the bills. This is too high. Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.
If a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities. So $100 bill is the denomination that is not used. We now know that at least one of each of the other bills is used. That totals $86 with 5 bills, leaving 95 bills to make the other $144.
There are only 4 ways to make $144 with these denominations, which are listed in order from $1 bills to $50 bills in each of these sets: {84,10,1,0,0}, {89,1,5,0,0}, {89,3,2,1,0}, {94,0,0,0,1}.

And using another six matches Mad Ade could again do precisely the same.
How many matches were there in the box originally?
Note that the match-box can hold maximum of 50 matches.",There are two possible answers!,"Initially, there were either 42 or 36 matches in the match-box.
There are 42 matches in the box with which he could form a triangle 20, 15, 7, with an area of 42 square inches. After 6 matches had been used, the remaining 36 matches would form a triangle 17, 10, 9, with an area of 36 square inches.

After using another 6, the 24 remaining would form a triangle 10, 8, 6, with an area of 24 square inches.
Thus, there are two possible answers. There were either 42 or 36 matches in the match-box.
Also it is interesting to know that there are just 5 such triangles for which the perimeter and the area is the same (assuming all sides are integers) and they are :
24 (10, 8, 6)
30 (13, 12, 5)
36 (17, 10, 9)
42 (20, 15, 7)

s = P/2                   (semiperimeter)  

Because every match is 1 inch long, P is an integer.  
Mad Ade’s condition is

area = P.                                                     (1)

By Heron’s formula  

area² = s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c).

Set  

x = s – a, y = s – b, z = s – c   (all positive integers).

Then  

a = s – x, b = s – y, c = s – z,

and the perimeter becomes  

P = a + b + c = 3s – (x + y + z) = 2s, so x + y + z = s.   (2)

Condition (1) gives, after squaring,

P² = sxyz ⇒ (2s)² = sxyz ⇒ xyz = 4s.                      (3)

So we must find positive integers (x,y,z) whose

 • sum is s,       (2)  
 • product is 4s.         (3)

Because the match-box can hold at most 50 matches, P ≤ 50, hence s ≤ 25.

We simply test every s = 4,…,25 for the existence of x,y,z satisfying (2) and (3).  
Only three semiperimeters work:

s = 15 → x,y,z = 10,3,2   (check 10+3+2=15, 10·3·2=60=4·15)

s = 18 → x,y,z = 9,8,1    (check 9+8+1=18, 9·8·1=72=4·18)  
  Triangle: a,b,c = 9,10,17  P = 36, area = 36

s = 21 → x,y,z = 14,6,1   (check 14+6+1=21, 14·6·1=84=4·21)  
  Triangle: a,b,c = 7,15,20  P = 42, area = 42

Hence the only perimeters not exceeding 50 for which (1) can hold are

P = 30, 36, 42.

Mad Ade’s story needs three successive steps, each time using six fewer matches.  
That fits exactly the sequence 42 → 36 → 30.

Therefore the little box originally contained 42 matches.

198,"Detective Grant was inspecting the scene of the crime. The 50-year-old victim, Joe, had been poisoned by a candy containing cyanide. On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table. John, 46, was found with 5 candies the day after a 4-yr sentence had been turned over a week ago. Jim, 35, had gotten off a 5-yr sentence a few days ago, only to be found dead with 6 candies yesterday.
Grant puzzled over these cases for days, and then -boom- it hit him. There was a pattern in these murders! What pattern did Grant spot?
Each suspect ate a candy before they died.
Life expectancy when the murders were committed was 70 years.

Joe--------50----2 years-------9
Jeff--------30----10 yrs--------3
John-------46----4 yrs---------5
Jim--------35----5 yrs----------6","The killer was a prosecutor (George) who thought that the criminal deserved a chance to live outside of jail. When the case came before him, he dismissed it. He then went to the criminal's house, and offered him a chance to gamble his life, or go to jail. George offered him a certain number of candies, one of which was poisoned. If the criminal chose a poisoned candy, he died. If he chose a pure candy, he lived.
The criminal's remaining life expectancy divided by his prison sentence would be the number of candies George would bring him, one of which might kill him. In the case of Joe:
His remaining life expectancy at age 50 was 20. 20 divided by 2(his sentence) is 10. George brought him 10 candies, one of which was poisoned. Joe ate the poisoned one, and left nine on the table.

 number of candies (the total, including the one the man ate) = (70 − age of the man) ÷ (years of the sentence he served).

Checking it on the four dead men:

• Joe: 70 − 50 = 20; 20 ÷ 2 = 10 candies (9 left on the table).

He can also use one weight on the left side and two or more weights on the right along with the wheat to weigh the required amount if necessary. What are the 4 weights Lester has?,"There is a common ratio between the weights; this way, it allows for coverage with addition and subtraction","The weights Lester uses are 1,3,9 and 27 kg.
For 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39 and 40 kg, he just needs to put the wheat on one side and the right combination of weights on the other side.
For 2, 8, 11, 26, 29, 35 and 38 kg he needs to put the wheat plus the 1 kg weight on one side and enough weights to make 1 more kg than he is trying to weigh up on the other side.
For 6, 7, 24, 25, 33, and 34 kg he needs to put the wheat plus the 3 kg weight on one side and enough weights to make 3 more kg than he is trying to weigh up on the other side.
For 5, 23, and 32 kg he needs to put the wheat plus the 1 and 3 kg weights on one side and enough weights to make 4 more kg than he is trying to weigh up on the other side.

•  Call the four integral weights w1 < w2 < w3 < w4.  
•  When a balance allows weights on both pans, weighing k kg of wheat is the same as writing  
  k = ε1w1 + ε2w2 + ε3w3 + ε4w4 with εi ∈ {-1,0,1}.  
•  If the largest positive total that the first n weights can produce is Rn = w1+…+wn, then adding another weight w(n+1) will give continuous coverage up to Rn+1 provided there is no “gap” between old and new ranges.  
  The no-gap condition is  
  w(n+1) ≤ 2Rn + 1. (Reason: the interval [-Rn, Rn] must overlap the shifted interval [-Rn+w(n+1), Rn+w(n+1)].)

Step-2.  Building the weights  

1) The smallest weight must be 1 kg, otherwise 1 kg of wheat cannot be weighed.  
 w1 = 1, R1 = 1.

2) For w2 we need w2 ≤ 2·R1 + 1 = 3, and w2 > w1 = 1.  
 If w2 = 2: even choosing the later weights as large as allowed we get  
  maximum possible total = 1 + 2 + 7 + 21 = 31 < 40,  
 so w2 cannot be 2. Hence  
 w2 = 3, R2 = 4.

3) For w3 we need w3 ≤ 2·R2 + 1 = 9 and w3 > 3.  
 Trying any value 4 ≤ w3 ≤ 8 gives final total at most  
  1 + 3 + w3 + (9 + 2w3) = 13 + 3w3 ≤ 13 + 24 = 37 < 40,  
 so none of these work. Therefore  
 w3 = 9, R3 = 13.

4) Finally w4 must satisfy w4 ≤ 2·R3 + 1 = 27 and be > 9.  
 Choosing the largest allowed value maximises the total: w4 = 27.  
 Total weight = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, exactly what is required.

Step-3.  Verifying completeness  
The set {1, 3, 9, 27} is the set of the first four powers of 3.  
Every integer 0…40 has a balanced-ternary representation (digits −1,0,1) using at most four digits, e.g.  
 40 = 1·27 + 1·9 + 1·3 + 1·1,  
 26 = 1·27 − 1·1,  
 17 = 1·9 + 1·3 + 1·1 + (−1)·27, etc.  
Placing weights whose coefficients are −1 on the same pan as the wheat and the others on the opposite pan achieves every whole number mass from 1 kg to 40 kg.

Step-4.  Uniqueness  
At each stage the choice was forced:  
w1 must be 1; w2 cannot be 2 (insufficient total), hence 3; w3 must be 9 for similar reasons; w4 then must be 27 to reach 40.  Therefore the solution is unique.

""My answer is right, and I want my three points!"" the blond one cried.
""But it's not the answer Mr. Collins left on the key!""
""He's wrong,"" the other one insisted.  ""My answer is right!""
Corman leaned over to whisper in Nora's ear, ""Does she need our help?""
""Yours, probably.  Mr. Collins is at a conference for the weekend, and Monette took his math class.  It looks like she handed back an exam.""
""I teach math.  Can I help?""
All three talked at once; Monette was as frustrated as the two students.  While they jabbered, Corman managed to read the problem in question:
""My house is built on a strangely-shaped lot, so my back yard is a right triangle with an area of 840 square feet.  Each of the three sides measures an integral number of feet.  If I want to stake my dog so that he can reach the entire yard, how long must his rope be?""
Monette finally pulled rank on the adolescents.  ""It's not really your problem, but I'd be glad of some help.  Mr. Collins marked their papers wrong; their answers don't match his.  The students *sound* right, but math was too long ago for me; I'm not sure.  To make matters worse, they don't even agree with each other.""
""I see,"" said Corman, playing for time while he mentally checked the answer on the key in Monette's trembling hand.  ""That's the answer Mr. Collins left you?""
""Yes,"" she began.

How much rope did Mr. Collins really need?",Mr. Collins's answer key gives the actual dimensions of the yard; he didn't realize there were two other answers from the hints he gave.,"37 feet.
There are three triangles that fit the given hints, having sides
40, 42, 58
24, 70, 74
15, 112, 113
From the students' comments, we know that the Collins yard has the middle-sized hypotenuse.
A right triangle inscribes neatly into a semicircle, with the hypotenuse forming a diameter.  The shortest rope needed to reach all points is one staked at the midpoint of the hypotenuse, forming a radius of the circle.  74/2 = 37 feet.
The blond student found the first answer above, and would have used a rope of 29 feet.  The other student figured it at 113/2, or 56.5 feet.
Historical note:
Lewis Carroll searched for the answer to the basic mathematical problem, sent to him by a reader.  He found two right triangles with the same area, but couldn't discover a set of three.  Somewhat ironically, Carroll had found 20-21-29 and 12-35-37.  Had he doubled their dimensions, he would have had the first two triangles above, and quite likely would have found the third.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the legs of the right triangle be a and b (a ≤ b) and the hypotenuse be c.

   ½·a·b = 840  ⇒ a·b = 1680.

2.  Pythagorean-triple condition  
   a² + b² = c², with a, b, c integers.

Therefore we need all factor pairs (a, b) of 1680 for which a²+b² is a perfect square.

Factor pairs of 1680 (with a ≤ b) and the corresponding sums of squares are:

Thus there are exactly three integral right triangles of area 840 ft²:

1) 15-112-113  2) 24-70-74  3) 40-42-58

For a right triangle the smallest circle that covers the whole triangle is its circumcircle, whose center is the midpoint of the hypotenuse and whose radius R equals half the hypotenuse:

R = c / 2.

Hence the possible rope lengths are

c/2 = 113/2 = 56.5 ft  (15-112-113)
c/2 = 74/2  = 37   ft  (24-70-74)
c/2 = 58/2  = 29   ft  (40-42-58)

According to the story, one student’s answer was 8 ft shorter than Mr. Collins’s, and the other’s was “a lot longer.”  
The only pair that differs by exactly 8 ft is 37 ft and 29 ft, so Mr. Collins must have used the triangle with hypotenuse 74, giving a required rope length of 37 ft.

206,"Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

C  = cost per box  
P  = selling price  
Q  = boxes sold per week  
Π  = weekly profit  

1. Determine the constant production cost  
At the observed point  
 P = \$5.95, profit-per-box = \$1.75  
So C = 5.95 − 1.75 = \$4.20.

2. Express price and quantity as functions of the number of \$0.20 price cuts  
Let n = number of \$0.20 reductions (n may be positive, zero, or negative).

Price: P(n) = 5.95 − 0.20 n  
Quantity: Q(n) = 100 + 25 n  (each cut adds 25 boxes; a price rise, n<0, subtracts 25)

3. Write the profit function  
Profit per box = P(n) − C = (5.95 − 0.20 n) − 4.20 = 1.75 − 0.20 n

Weekly profit  
 Π(n) = [1.75 − 0.20 n] · [100 + 25 n]  
    = −5n² + 23.75n + 175.

4. Locate the maximum of the quadratic  
Vertex at n* = −b/(2a) = −23.75 / (2·−5) = 2.375.  
This gives the theoretical maximum, but n must be an integer (prices change in \$0.20 steps).

5. Check the two nearest integers  

n = 2  →  P = 5.95 − 0.40 = \$5.55  
 Π(2) = −5(2)² + 23.75(2) + 175 = \$202.50

n = 3  →  P = 5.95 − 0.60 = \$5.35  
 Π(3) = −5(3)² + 23.75(3) + 175 = \$201.25

Since \$202.50 > \$201.25, n = 2 is optimal.

6. Conclusion  
The highest weekly profit occurs when the box is priced at  

P = 5.95 − 2·0.20 = \$5.55.

207,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote an equation on a rock:
SLIDE

""Each letter in the equation represents a different digit,"" said the troll. ""The letters in the password represent 3651.""
So, what is the password?",There is some casework to be done on D; obviously we have that S = 1,"The password is LENS.
Since SL-D=3 or (SL-1)-D=3 (meaning SL-D=4), and since the highest possible sum of two different one-digit numbers is 17, S must equal 1.
Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.
Suppose D=7. Then L is 0 or 1, and since S=1, L=0. A must be 1 or 2, but since S=1, A=2.
Suppose D=8. Then L is 1 or 2, and since S=1, L=2. A must be 2 or 3, but since L=2, A=3.
Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.
Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.
If D=7, then L=0. But since 10-7=3, D cannot be 7.
If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.
If E=4, then N=3. But if D=8, A=3, and if D=9, L=3 and A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=5, then since 1I-E=6, I=1. But since S=1, this cannot work.
If E=7, then I=3. But if D=8, then A=3, and if D=9, then L=3. So this cannot work.
If E=8, then I=4, and D cannot be 8. But if D=9, then A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=9, then N=8, and D cannot be 8 or 9. So this cannot work.
Therefore, E=6, N=5, and I=2. If D=8, then L=2, so D must equal 9. This means:
S=1, I=2, L=3, A=4, N=5, E=6, and D=9.

Because “SLIDE” has five digits while “DEAN” has four, the actual operation is

  S L I D E
– 0 D E A N
------------
0 3 6 5 1

Thus the leading digit of the result is 0, which means the subtraction in the
thousands column had to borrow from S, so S must be 1 (the only non-zero digit
that can become 0 after a borrow).

Work the subtraction from right to left, letting any borrow from a column be
denoted by b (0 or 1).

1. Units: E – N = 1 or (E + 10) – N = 1  
   • If there is no borrow from the tens column (b₁ = 0), then E = N + 1.

2. Tens: D – A – b₁ = 5 (with a possible new borrow b₂ from the hundreds)  
   Since b₁ = 0, either
      D – A = 5 (no borrow) or D + 10 – A = 5 (b₂ = 1).

3. Hundreds: I – E – b₂ = 6 (perhaps causing another borrow b₃).

4. Thousands: L – D – b₃ must equal –7 (because ten is added after a borrow
   to leave the digit 3 and force the leading 0).  Hence  
      L + 10 – (D + b₃) = 3 ⇒ L = D – 6.

Working through the two possibilities for the tens column:

• If there is no borrow in the tens column (b₂ = 0):

   I – E = 6 or I + 10 – E = 6.

   The first possibility fails because it forces L = D – 7 and gives duplicate
   digits.  The second possibility (I + 10 – E = 6) leads to

        E = I + 4, L = D – 6, A = D – 5.

   Trying D = 8 or 9 (the only values ≥ 6 that keep digits non-negative and
   distinct) we get

        D = 9, A = 4, L = 3,
        choose N = 5 ⇒ E = 6, I = 2.

   All seven letters now have distinct digits:

        S = 1, L = 3, I = 2, D = 9, E = 6, A = 4, N = 5.

   Checking: 13296 –  9645 =  3651.  Correct.

Thus the unique solution is

        S L I D E = 13296
            D E A N =  9645

Take the alphabetic position of the first letter, take half and then multiply by 1000. F = 6, halved = 3, * 1000 = 3,000.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1.  Look at the numbers that the faulty atlas gives:

   • Australia – 500  
   • Peru – 8 000  
   • India – 4 500  
   • Scotland – 9 500  

2.  Express each number as a multiple of 500:

   • 500  = 1 × 500  
   • 8 000 = 16 × 500  
   • 4 500 = 9 × 500  
   • 9 500 = 19 × 500  

3.  Compare those multipliers (1, 16, 9, 19) with the positions of the first letters of the countries in the alphabet:

   • A (Australia) is the 1st letter → 1 × 500 = 500  
   • P (Peru) is the 16th letter → 16 × 500 = 8 000  
   • I (India) is the 9th letter → 9 × 500 = 4 500  
   • S (Scotland) is the 19th letter → 19 × 500 = 9 500  

   So the atlas’s “distance” is simply 500 miles times the alphabetical position of the country’s initial letter.

4.  France begins with F, the 6th letter of the alphabet.

5.  Apply the faulty rule: 6 × 500 = 3 000.

214,"Alec, Brett and Chris each purchased parts for their skateboards at the sports store. Alec and Brett wanted to build new skateboards, so they each needed to purchase a deck, trucks, bearings and wheels. Chris only needed new wheels. The store offers a 10% discount for purchases over $250, so the boys decided to pay for all the parts together to qualify for the discount. Altogether, the boys spent $266.40. The clues below reflect the price of the items before the discount is applied.
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
They each bought the same kinds of wheels. Together they spent $75 for the 3 sets of wheels. Each set contained 4 wheels.
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his. However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Brett spent $3 more on bearings than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
How much did each person spend?","Find the total price, then focus on each item separately","Alec spent $113.40.
Brett spent $130.50.
Chris spent $22.50.
Component Alec Brett Chris Total
Deck $50 $45 $0 $95
Trucks 35 40 $0 75
Wheels 25 25 25 75
Bearings 16 35 $0 51
Total before discount $126 $145 $25 $296
less 10% discount $12.60 $14.50 $2.50 $29.60
Amount spent $113.40 $130.50 $22.50 $266.40
Explanation:
First find the original price of all the items combined. $266.40 is the price after the 10% discount was applied.
That means $266.40 is equal to 90% of the original price.
Write an equation and then cross multiply:
266.40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x   =   9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)
Let x = the amount Alec spent on trucks.
x + (x+5) = 75
2x + 5 = 75
2x = 70
x = 35
Alec spent $35 on trucks. Brett spent $5 more than Alec. Therefore, Brett spent $40 on trucks.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51
x + (2x + 3) = 51
3x + 3 = 51
3x = 48
x = 16
Alec's spent $16 on bearings.

Dₐ , Tₐ , Bₐ = Alec’s deck, trucks, bearings  
Dᵦ , Tᵦ , Bᵦ = Brett’s deck, trucks, bearings  

All three bought the same wheels: one set each at a price W.  
Three sets cost $75 ⇒ W = $25.

1.  Total before discount  
   They finally paid $266.40 after a 10 % discount, so the undiscounted total is  
   T = 266.40 ÷ 0.9 = $296.00.

2.  Bearings versus Alec’s deck  
   “Bearings for the 2 boys combined were $1 more than Alec’s deck.”  
   Bₐ + Bᵦ = Dₐ + 1.                                    (i)

3.  Bearings versus wheels  
   “Total bearings cost $24 less than total wheels.”  
   Bₐ + Bᵦ = 75 – 24 = 51.                              (ii)

   From (i) and (ii):  Dₐ + 1 = 51 ⇒ Dₐ = 50.

4.  Relationship between the two decks  
   “Alec’s deck is $5 more than Brett’s.”  
   50 = Dᵦ + 5 ⇒ Dᵦ = 45.

5.  Trucks  
   “Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.”  
   Let Tₐ = x.  Then Tᵦ = x + 5.                       (iii)

6.  Bearings relationship  
   “Brett spent $3 more on bearings than twice Alec’s bearings.”  
   Bᵦ = 2Bₐ + 3.                                       (iv)

   Use (ii): Bₐ + Bᵦ = 51  
   ⇒ Bₐ + (2Bₐ + 3) = 51  
   ⇒ 3Bₐ = 48 ⇒ Bₐ = 16.  
   Then   Bᵦ = 2·16 + 3 = 35.

7.  Total cost equation  
   Alec’s subtotal        = Dₐ + Tₐ + Bₐ + W  
                          = 50 + x + 16 + 25 = 91 + x  

   Brett’s subtotal       = Dᵦ + Tᵦ + Bᵦ + W  
                          = 45 + (x + 5) + 35 + 25 = 110 + x  

   Chris’s subtotal       = W = 25  

   Grand total            = (91 + x) + (110 + x) + 25  
                          = 226 + 2x  

   But the grand total must be 296, so  
   226 + 2x = 296 ⇒ 2x = 70 ⇒ x = 35.

   Hence Tₐ = 35 and Tᵦ = 40.

8.  Individual totals before discount  
   Alec  : 50 + 35 + 16 + 25 = $126  
   Brett : 45 + 40 + 35 + 25 = $145  
   Chris : 25                        = $25

9.  Amount actually paid (after 10 % off)  
   Each one pays 90 % of his subtotal:

   Alec  : 0.9 × 126 = $113.40  
   Brett : 0.9 × 145 = $130.50  
   Chris : 0.9 ×  25 = $22.50  

   Sum: 113.40 + 130.50 + 22.50 = $266.40 ✓

Next graph these three lines. It should be expected that the answer will lie on the intersection of two of these lines or to make all chairs or all tables. The intersection of the saw and sanding machine line occurs outside of how many chairs the lathe can make so this combination is not a viable answer.

222,"Homer had always contemplated the size of the old oak tree in the field behind his house.  Standing 5 feet away from the 8 foot high fence in the back of the yard, he could just barely see the top leaves of the tree over the top of the fence.  He knew that the tree was 200 feet from the fence.  Homer was 6 feet tall, making his line of vision, 67 inches from the ground.
Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.","TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches
Tree height from eye level = TAN (25.80 deg) * 2460 inches = 1189 inches
Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.  With the measurement capabilities available to any lumberjack (or any average Homer) precise measurements are not possible.  Thus the need to clarify these calculations as estimates.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"1.  Put everything in feet  
   • Homer’s eyes are at 67 in = 67/12 ≈ 5.583 ft above the ground.  
   • The fence top is 8 ft high.  
   • Horizontal distance eye → fence = 5 ft.  
   • Horizontal distance eye → tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 205 ft.

2.  Find the “sight-line” slope from Homer’s eyes to the fence top  
      rise = 8 ft − 5.583 ft = 2.417 ft  
      run  = 5 ft  
      slope = rise/run = 2.417/5 ≈ 0.4833 ft of rise per foot of run.

3.  Extend that same straight line out to the tree  
      extra run = 205 ft  
      extra rise = slope × 205 ≈ 0.4833 × 205 ≈ 99.083 ft.

4.  Add this extra rise to Homer’s eye height to get the tree’s height  
      tree height ≈ 5.583 ft + 99.083 ft ≈ 104.666 ft.

Rounded to a whole foot, the old oak tree is about 105 feet tall.

1.  Telephone cascade  
   • Each call lasts 30 s.  
   • As soon as a resident finishes receiving a call, he can begin his own two calls, one after another.

   Put the moments when calls finish into 30-second “slots”:

   Slot 1 (t = 30 s): 1 person informed  
   Slot 2 (t = 60 s): 2 persons informed  
   Slot 3 (t = 90 s): 3 persons informed

   Slot 10 (t = 300 s): 89 persons informed  
   Slot 11 (t = 330 s): 144 persons informed  

   The numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, … are consecutive Fibonacci numbers (each entry is the sum of the two previous ones), because every resident can place only two sequential calls.

2.  Counting informed residents  
   After k slots the total number informed is
        1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + … + F_{k+1} = F_{k+3} – 2,

   We need at least 375 residents informed:

        F_{k+3} – 2 ≥ 375  ⟹  F_{k+3} ≥ 377.

   The first Fibonacci number ≥ 377 is F_{14}=377, so k+3 = 14 and k = 11.

   Therefore every apartment has been phoned by the end of slot 11, i.e. after  
        11 × 30 s = 330 s = 5 min 30 s.

3.  Evacuation time  
   A resident who has just finished receiving the call still has to  
        • make two 30-s calls (60 s), then  
        • walk out (90 s).

   So the last residents need 60 s + 90 s = 150 s after 5 min 30 s.

4.  Total time to empty the building

3. Hundreds: 4B + k₂ = 10k₃ + C.  
4. Thousands: 4A + k₃ = D.  
Here k₁,k₂,k₃ are the carries (0–3).

Bounds for A  
Because 4·N is still a 4-digit number, N ≤ 2499, so A ∈ {1,2}.

Step 1 (units)  
Equation 1 requires 4D ≡ A (mod 10).  
Since 4D can end only in 0,2,4,6,8, A cannot be 1.  
Thus A = 2 and we need 4D ≡ 2 (mod 10), giving D ∈ {3,8}.  
Check the carries:  
 D = 3 ⇒ 4·3 = 12 ⇒ k₁ = 1.  
 D = 8 ⇒ 4·8 = 32 ⇒ k₁ = 3.

Step 4 (thousands)  
Equation 4: D = 4A + k₃ = 8 + k₃.  
With D = 3 this would give k₃ = –5 (impossible), so D = 8 and k₃ = 0.  
Consequently k₁ = 3 (from above).

Step 3 (hundreds)  
4B + k₂ = C   (because k₃ = 0).  
Since k₂ ≤ 3, 4B + k₂ ≤ 9, so B can only be 0,1,2.

• B = 0 → C = k₂ (0–3).  
  Step 2 then gives 4C + 3 = 10k₂, i.e. 4k₂ + 3 = 10k₂ ⇒ 3 = 6k₂ – impossible.

• B = 1 → C = 4 + k₂.  
  Step 2: 4(4 + k₂) + 3 = 10k₂ + 1  
     19 + 4k₂ = 10k₂ + 1 ⇒ 18 = 6k₂ ⇒ k₂ = 3.  
  Hence C = 4 + 3 = 7 (valid).

All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"To be divisible by 225 an integer must be divisible by both 25 (=5²) and 9 (=3²).

1. Divisibility by 25  
   A decimal number is divisible by 25 iff its last two digits are 00, 25, 50 or 75.  
   Because every digit we may use is 0 or 1, the only possible ending is 00.  
   ⇒ the number must end in 00.

2. Divisibility by 9  
   A decimal number is divisible by 9 iff the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  
   Our digits can only be 0 or 1, so this sum equals the number of 1-digits that appear.

3. Counting the 1’s  
   Let the number have L digits.  
   It starts with 1, ends with 00, so there are (L–3) “free” middle digits, each 0 or 1.  
   Total number of 1’s = 1 + (number of 1’s among the L–3 middle digits).

   We need 1 + (number of middle 1’s) ≡ 0 (mod 9).

   The smallest positive multiple of 9 that this total can equal is 9 itself, so
        1 + (number of middle 1’s) = 9  ⇒  number of middle 1’s = 8.

4. Shortest possible length  
   To house 8 middle 1’s we need at least 8 middle positions:
        L – 3 ≥ 8  ⇒  L ≥ 11.
   For L < 11 the total number of 1’s is at most 1 + 7 = 8, never reaching 9,
   so length 11 is the minimum.

5. Form of the minimal number  
   With length 11 and 8 required middle 1’s, every middle digit must be 1.

   Thus the unique candidate is

N, 2N and 3N are all three–digit,
none of their nine digits is 0, and
taken together the nine digits are the digits 1–9, each appearing exactly once.

Step 1   Where can N lie?
For 3N to be three–digit we need 3N ≤ 999, hence N ≤ 333, while of course N ≥ 100.
Thus 100 ≤ N ≤ 333.

Step 2   N must be a multiple of 3.
Because the nine digits 1–9 add up to 45, the sum of all the digits in N, 2N, 3N is 45, which is divisible by 9.  A number and the sum of its digits are congruent mod 9, so
N + 2N + 3N = 6N ≡ 45 ≡ 0 (mod 9)  ⇒  6N is divisible by 9  ⇒  N is divisible by 3.

So we need only test multiples of 3 in the range 100–333.

Step 3   Quick filters that remove almost every multiple of 3.
•  A valid N can contain no 0 and no repeated digit (for otherwise some digit would have to be repeated in the whole collection).
•  The same is true for 2N and 3N.
•  The three numbers must have pairwise disjoint digit–sets.

242,"We were all celebrating the 25th birthday of my beloved sister, Lavi the kindhearted Romankachi. She was younger to me Rudy the business-minded Romankachi by two years and to our elder brother Fred the well-settled Romankachi by four years. Just as the celebrations were in full swing, I realized something about our ages. I found that I could say at least two things definitely about each of the following two integer values formed by manipulating our ages taken as integers:-
a) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Lavi's and my age considered during any one year right since she was a year old.
b) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Fred's and my ages considered during any one year right since I was a year old.
Though I forgot about this the next moment and got busy enjoying myself, could you tell what were the two things that flashed across my mind.
Consider all ages to be integer values. Also during any given year, Lavi was exactly two years younger to me and exactly four years younger to Fred.",I'm exactly two years elder to Lavi and exactly two years younger to Fred.,"a) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Lavi's and my age considered during any one year right since she was a year old.
The two things that I could definitely say about the above integer value are :-
1) It is a perfect square.
2) The number formed is the square of a number 1 less than my age in that year.
Example: When Lavi was 3, I was  5 -> (3*5)+1 gives 16 which is the square of 4, which is 1 less than my age(5) in that year.
b) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Fred's and my ages considered during any one year right since I was a year old.
The two things that I could definitely say about the above integer value are :-
1) It is a perfect square.
2) The number formed is square of a number 1 more than my age in that year.
Example: when I was 6, Fred was    8-> (6*8)+1 gives 49 which is the square of 7, a number 1 more than my age(6) in that year.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let L , R , F denote, in some particular year,

 L = Lavi’s age   R = my (Rudy’s) age   F = Fred’s age.

Because the differences in our ages never change we always have  
 R = L + 2  and  F = R + 2 = L + 4.

-------------------------------------------------
a)  Number  (L · R) + 1
-------------------------------------------------
(L · R) + 1 = L(L + 2) + 1  
        = L² + 2L + 1  
        = (L + 1)².

Thus, no matter which year is chosen (L ≥ 1):

1. The value is a perfect square – it equals (L + 1)².  
2. Since every perfect square larger than 1 is composite, the value is certainly not prime.

(The square root, L + 1, is in fact the integer exactly halfway between Lavi’s and my ages.)

-------------------------------------------------
b)  Number  (F · R) + 1
-------------------------------------------------
Because F = R + 2 we get

(F · R) + 1 = R(R + 2) + 1  
       = R² + 2R + 1  
       = (R + 1)².

Again, for every possible year (R ≥ 1):

1. The value is a perfect square – it equals (R + 1)².  
2. Being a perfect square exceeding 1, it is definitely composite and hence never prime.

(The square root, R + 1, is the integer exactly halfway between Fred’s and my ages.)

-------------------------------------------------
So the two facts that can always be stated with certainty about each of the two numbers are:

• It is a perfect square (its square root is an integer lying midway between the two ages involved).  
• Consequently, it is composite – it can never be a prime number.

Final answer: Each number is always a perfect square, and therefore always composite (never prime).",True,0,0

247,"The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?","Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74
Lemp 47 94
Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Number of people who got in at the six stations - Number of people who got out at the six stations) =

Pₖ = passengers after leaving the k-th station (k = 1 … 5).  
When the train arrives at Rudolf (the 6-th station) it is still
carrying P₅ passengers; we are told P₅ = 227.

1. “Twice as many got in as got down”: Iₖ = 2Oₖ  for every k.  
2. The Oₖ ’s are prime numbers taken from the intervals  
   (0,10], (10,20], (20,30], (30,40], (40,50], (50,60] respectively.
3. |I_{k+1} – Iₖ| ≥ 20   ⇒   |O_{k+1} – Oₖ| ≥ 10.  
4. ΣOₖ is even.  
5. Pₖ = P_{k-1} + Oₖ   (because P_{k-1} − Oₖ + 2Oₖ = P_{k-1}+Oₖ).

-------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – choose the only possible set of Oₖ ’s
-------------------------------------------------
Start with O₁ (prime 3,5 or 7 – 2 is excluded by condition 4).

O₁ = 3  
For Willow we need a prime at least 10 away: O₂ ∈ {13,17,19}.  
If O₂ = 13, then for Wonderland we need |O₃−13| ≥ 10 ⇒ O₃ ∈ {23,29}.  
• O₃ = 23 is tentatively possible.  
• O₃ = 29 will soon be shown impossible.

Now check the next gap to Doku (primes 31,37):  
|31−23| = 8  (too small)  
|37−23| = 14 (OK) → O₄ must be 37.

Going on, for Lemp (41,43,47) we need |O₅−37| ≥ 10  
→ O₅ must be 47.  

For Rudolf (53,59) we need |O₆−47| ≥ 10  
→ O₆ must be 59.  

Thus one coherent chain is

O₁ = 3,  O₂ = 13,  O₃ = 23,  O₄ = 37,  O₅ = 47,  O₆ = 59.

All other tentative starts break down (because O₃=29 makes the next
difference too small, or earlier differences violate |O_{k+1}–O_k| ≥ 10).
Therefore the above chain is unique.

Condition 4 (even total) is satisfied:
3+13+23+37+47+59 = 182 (even).

-------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – compute P₀
-------------------------------------------------
P₅ (arrival at Rudolf) is given: P₅ = 227.  
But  
P₅ = P₀ + (O₁+O₂+O₃+O₄+O₅)  
   = P₀ + (3+13+23+37+47)  
   = P₀ + 123.

Hence   227 = P₀ + 123  ⇒  P₀ = 104.

So 104 passengers were on the train (including Tweeto) before it
reached Maver station.

What time is it?",What is the rate of travel of each hand on a clock?,"2:24 The hour hand makes an angle of 72 degrees while the minute hand makes an angle of 144 degrees.
At exactly 2:00, the angle made by the hour hand is 60 degrees from vertical.  If you let x = the number of minutes past 2:00 that we are looking for, then the hour hand will be at:
60 degrees + x / 60 min* 30 degrees
where x/60 min is the fraction of a full hour that has past, and is therefore the fractional distance that the hour hand has moved closer to the 3.  The 30 degrees is the total angle between the 2 and the 3.
The final position of the minute hand will be:
x/30 min * 180 degrees
for the same reasoning as with the hour hand.
Since the minute hand will make twice the angle with vertical, you can set up the equation:

2. The “angle … to the vertical (12)” normally means the smaller of the two angles that can be formed with the 12-o’clock line, i.e. an angle between 0° and 180°.  
   Hence
        A_m  =  min{ M, 360° – M }

   While the hour hand is between 2 : 00 and 3 : 00, H never exceeds 90°, so

0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.

Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3

There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.

Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1

There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D

If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)

a (1 ≤ a ≤ 9) is the first digit and  
b (0 ≤ b < 10^{k-1}) is the block of the remaining k–1 digits (leading zeros allowed).

Rotating N to the left moves a to the units place:

  R = b·10 + a.

According to the problem, R = 3/2 · N, i.e. 2R = 3N.  Substitute the expressions for R and N:

 2(b·10 + a) = 3(a·10^{k-1} + b)

 20b + 2a = 3a·10^{k-1} + 3b

 17b = a(3·10^{k-1} – 2).  (1)

Because 17 is prime and a ≤ 9, a and 17 are coprime, so (1) implies

 3·10^{k-1} ≡ 2 (mod 17).  (2)

Multiply both sides of (2) by the inverse of 3 modulo 17 (which is 6), obtaining

 10^{k-1} ≡ 12 (mod 17).  (3)

The first occurrence of residue 12 is at exponent 15; hence k–1 = 15 and

 k = 16.

 (3·10^{15} – 2)/17 = 176 470 588 235 294.  (Call this value Q.)

Equation (1) gives b = a·Q.  To keep b < 10^{15}, the largest allowable a is 5, but the smallest (and thus minimizing N) is a = 1, which yields

 b = Q = 176 470 588 235 294.

Therefore

 N = a·10^{15} + b

Multiply N by 1.5: 1 176 470 588 235 294 × 3/2 = 1 764 705 882 352 941.

Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13.

 For F = 1, (★) gives C+D = 23 (>17) – impossible.  
 For F = 7, (★) gives C+D = 17, which forces CD = 89 (prime).

""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,,True,0,0

We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).

8,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""
""The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.""
Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,,True,0,0
9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel.

1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.

Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the two integers (each larger than 1) be  

x ≤ y,   
S = x+y (the sum told to Sachin),   
P = xy (the product told to Prashant).

Only the words spoken in the dining–room are public; everybody is a perfect logician and everybody knows that everybody is a perfect logician.

────────────────────────────────────────
1.  What Sachin’s first sentence tells us
────────────────────────────────────────
Sachin, who knows only S, says

 “I don’t think that we know the numbers.”

He is asserting two things:

(i)  He himself cannot know the pair (obvious, because at least two different
     unordered pairs add up to the same S), and

(ii) He is certain that Prashant, who knows only P, cannot know the pair either.

The second point is the informative one.  
If an ordered pair (a,b) with a+b=S happens to have a product that can be
obtained in only one way from two integers larger than 1 (i.e. the product is the
product of two primes, possibly equal), then a holder of that product would at
once know the pair.  Sachin is therefore telling the others:

(*)  For every decomposition S = a + b  (a,b > 1) the product ab has at least
     two different factor pairs larger than 1.

We call such a sum an admissible sum.  
Let G be the set of admissible sums.

Simple tests give immediately two kinds of sums that are not admissible:

•  S=2+q with q prime (the pair {2,q} would give the unique factorisation
   2·q);

•  S even with S/2 prime (the pair {p,p} (p prime) would give the unique
   factorisation p·p).

All admissible sums must avoid those two patterns.

────────────────────────────────────────
2.  What Prashant’s sentence tells us
────────────────────────────────────────
Prashant had not known the numbers at first (his product P possessed at least
two different factorisations), but after hearing (*), he says

 “Aha!  Now I know the numbers.”

So, among all the unordered factor pairs of his product P,

 P = u·v  (u ≤ v, u,v > 1),

exactly one pair {u,v} has a sum that lies in G.  
If two different factor pairs had sums in G, Prashant could still not tell which
of them was the correct pair.  Thus

(**)  For Prashant’s actual product P there is exactly one factor pair whose
      sum belongs to G.

A product with this property will be called a decisive product.

────────────────────────────────────────
3.  What Sachin’s second sentence tells us
────────────────────────────────────────
Sachin now hears that Prashant has a decisive product.  
Since Sachin knows the very sum S, he examines all unordered pairs {a,b}
with a+b=S.  If more than one of their products were decisive, he would not yet
know which pair is the correct one.  But he says

 “Oh, now I also know the numbers.”

So

(***)  Among all pairs with sum S, exactly one of the products is decisive.

Any S with this property will be called a determining sum.

────────────────────────────────────────
4.  What Nakul’s sentence tells us
────────────────────────────────────────
Nakul knows only the public words.  After hearing Sachin’s last remark he
says

 “Now I also know the numbers.”

Hence, in the whole universe of possibilities there must be exactly ONE pair
{ x , y } that fulfils the three conditions (*)–(***) above; otherwise Nakul
could not be certain which pair had been meant.

────────────────────────────────────────
5.  Hunting for such a pair
────────────────────────────────────────
The usual way to search is to list complete sets of sums and products,
but here logical elimination is enough and no brute force is necessary.

Step 1:  restrict the sums  
We have already seen that admissible sums cannot be of the form p+2 with p
prime, nor of the form 2p with p prime.  The smallest admissible sums are

 11, 17, 23, 27, …

Step 2:  look for decisive products  
For every admissible sum S one inspects its products and checks whether
exactly one factor pair gives a sum lying again in G.  A little inspection shows

 • S=11 has two different pairs, 2+9 and 3+8, whose products
   (18 and 24) are both decisive ⇒ S=11 is NOT determining.

 • S=17 has only the pair 4+13 whose product 52 is decisive.
  (The six other pairs belonging to S=17 all yield products that are not
   decisive.)

 • S=23 has at least two pairs (2+21 and 4+19) with decisive products
   (42 and 76) ⇒ S=23 is NOT determining.

All larger admissible sums behave like 23: they give at least two decisive
products and therefore cannot be determining.  Hence

 S = 17 is the unique determining sum.

Step 3:  decide the pair for S=17  
The unordered pairs with sum 17 and their products are

 2+15 → 30    3+14 → 42    4+13 → 52  
 5+12 → 60    6+11 → 66    7+10 → 70    8+9 → 72

Among those products only 52 is decisive (for 52 the factorisations are
2·26 and 4·13; 2+26 = 28 is NOT in G, 4+13 = 17 is in G).  
Therefore, by (***), Sachin can single out the pair

 x = 4, y = 13.

Step 4:  uniqueness for Nakul  
We have proved that there is exactly one determining sum, S=17, and that
within that sum there is exactly one pair that fits the whole conversation,
namely {4,13}.  Consequently Nakul, who has followed the same reasoning,
is also able to announce the numbers.

Conclusion
────────────────────────────────────────
The only pair of integers larger than 1 that allows all four sentences to be
uttered truthfully is

 4 and 13.

10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let

1.  First man

5.  Fifth man  
     4d = 5e + 1 (gives 1, keeps e, 4e remain).

Morning division

6.  4e = 5k (the five equal, exact morning shares).

Start at the end and work backwards.

Step 6 4e = 5k  ⇒ e = 5k/4.  
For e to be integral, 5k must be divisible by 4, so put k = 4m (m ∈ ℤ⁺), giving e = 5m.

Step 5 4d = 5e + 1 = 25m + 1  ⇒ d = (25m + 1)/4.  
25m + 1 ≡ m + 1 (mod 4); divisibility demands m ≡ 3 (mod 4).  
Write m = 4n + 3; then d = 25n + 19.

Step 4 4c = 5d + 1 = 5(25n + 19) + 1 = 125n + 96  
   ⇒ c = (125n + 96)/4.  
Since 125n + 96 ≡ n (mod 4), we need n ≡ 0 (mod 4).  
Put n = 4p; then c = 125p + 24.

Step 3 4b = 5c + 1 = 5(125p + 24) + 1 = 625p + 121  
   ⇒ b = (625p + 121)/4.  
Because 625p + 121 ≡ p + 1 (mod 4), require p ≡ 3 (mod 4).  
Let p = 4q + 3; then b = 625q + 499.

Step 2 4a = 5b + 1 = 5(625q + 499) + 1 = 3125q + 2496  
   ⇒ a = (3125q + 2496)/4.  
Now 3125q + 2496 ≡ q (mod 4); hence q ≡ 0 (mod 4).  
Set q = 4r (r ≥ 0); then a = 3125r + 624.

Finally, Step 1 gives the original total

 N = 5a + 1 = 5(3125r + 624) + 1 = 15625r + 3121.

Thus every solution is

 N = 3121 + 15625 r  (r = 0, 1, 2, …).

To obtain the least possible positive pile, take r = 0:

 Nmin = 3121.

Verification with 3121

• 3121 = 5·624 + 1 → give 1, keep 624, 2496 remain.  
• 2496 = 5·499 + 1 → give 1, keep 499, 1996 remain.  
• 1996 = 5·399 + 1 → give 1, keep 399, 1596 remain.  
• 1596 = 5·319 + 1 → give 1, keep 319, 1276 remain.  
• 1276 = 5·255 + 1 → give 1, keep 255, 1020 remain.  
• 1020 = 5·204       (exact final division).

14,"This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?",Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11

""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?","Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,,True,0,0
16,"The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,,True,0,0

Start from the largest number 987654321 and check using the divisbility rule of 11 to find a number which works.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the desired 9-digit number be  

d₁ d₂ d₃ d₄ d₅ d₆ d₇ d₈ d₉ ,

where d₁ is the left–most digit and every digit 0–9 is used at most once.

1.  Maximising the number  
   To get the largest possible value we clearly want to keep the digit 0 out and to use the nine digits  

   {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} .

   The earlier a digit appears, the more it contributes, so we shall try to place the largest digits as far to the left as the divisibility condition allows.

2.  The 11–divisibility condition  
   For any number,  
   (sum of digits in odd positions) – (sum of digits in even positions)  
   must be a multiple of 11.

   For nine digits, the odd positions are 1,3,5,7,9 (five digits) and the even positions are 2,4,6,8 (four digits).

   With the digits 1–9 the total sum is 45.  Write

        Sₒ – Sₑ = k   and   Sₒ + Sₑ = 45,

   where Sₒ , Sₑ are the odd– and even–position sums.  
   Solving gives

        Sₒ = (45 + k)/2 ,   Sₑ = (45 – k)/2 .

   Because 45 is odd, k must be odd, and because |Sₒ – Sₑ| cannot exceed 25, k can be ±11 or ±22.  
   Only k = ±11 make (45 ± k) even, so

        Sₒ – Sₑ = 11   or   Sₒ – Sₑ = –11.

   Case A   Sₒ – Sₑ = 11  ⇒  Sₒ = 28, Sₑ = 17.  
   Case B   Sₒ – Sₑ = –11 ⇒  Sₒ = 17, Sₑ = 28.

   To obtain the largest leading digits we clearly prefer Case A, because the odd positions (which include the first digit) then contain the larger total 28.

3.  Choosing the digits for the two position-sets
   We need five digits totalling 28 for the odd positions and four digits totalling 17 for the even positions.

   To keep d₁ as large as possible we insist that 9 lie in an odd position.  We also want the largest possible digit, 8, to appear as early as it can; therefore we put 8 into the even-position set (so it can stand in position 2).

   Putting 8 into the even set leaves 17 – 8 = 9 to be made from three distinct digits.  
   The only possibilities from 1–7 are (1,2,6), (1,3,5) or (2,3,4).

   Take (8,2,6,1) as the even-set; then the odd-set is the remaining five digits {9,7,5,4,3} (and their sum is indeed 28).

4.  Arranging the digits as large as possible
   Write the two sets in descending order within their respective positions:

            odd positions (1,3,5,7,9):  9, 7, 5, 4, 3
            even positions (2,4,6,8):   8, 6, 2, 1

   Hence

        d₁ = 9 ,  d₂ = 8 ,  d₃ = 7 ,  d₄ = 6 ,  d₅ = 5 ,
        d₆ = 2 ,  d₇ = 4 ,  d₈ = 1 ,  d₉ = 3.

   The number obtained is

        987 652 413.

5.  Verification  
   Odd–position sum: 9 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 28  
   Even–position sum: 8 + 6 + 2 + 1       = 17  
   Difference: 28 – 17 = 11, a multiple of 11, so the number is divisible by 11.

6.  Maximality  
   • d₁ must be 9.  
   • With 9 fixed, to have any larger number than one beginning 98…, the second digit would have to exceed 8, impossible with distinct digits.  
   • Given 98 as prefix, our construction gives the largest possible third and fourth digits 7 and 6, because they are respectively the greatest digits available in the odd and even sets.  
   • Proceeding similarly, each subsequent digit is chosen as the greatest allowed by its position set, so no other arrangement of the same digits can outrank it.  
   • Any attempt to replace digit 1 by 0 (omitting 1 instead) can only reduce the number, because 0 would occupy a later position where 1 now stands.

   Therefore no 9-digit number formed from nine distinct digits is larger than 987 652 413 while still being divisible by 11.

With this convention the four given true statements become

(1) f(2)+f(2) = 10 f(1)+f(2)  
(2) f(5)–f(3) = 10 f(6)+f(2)  
(3) f(3)·f(4) = 10 f(6)+f(1)  
(4) f(6)÷f(3) = 10 f(8)+f(3).

————————————————————————
Step 1.  From (1):

 2 f(2) = 10 f(1)+f(2)  ⇒ f(2) = 10 f(1). (5)

So the value represented by the digit 2 is ten times the value represented by
the digit 1.

————————————————————————
Step 2.  Put

 x = f(1), y = f(2) (=10x), q = f(3), r = f(6), t = f(8).  

Equation (4) gives

 f(6) = f(3)·(10 f(8)+f(3))  
 ⇒ r = q(10t+q). (6)

Step 3.  Choose convenient small, distinct positive integers satisfying
all relations.

Take x = 2 ⇒ y = 20 (by (5))  
choose q = 1, t = 3 (distinct from x,y,q).

Then from (6):

 r = 1(10·3 + 1) = 31.

Thus

 f(1)=2, f(2)=20, f(3)=1, f(6)=31, f(8)=3.

Step 4.  Determine the remaining needed values.

Equation (3):

 f(3)·f(4) = 10 f(6)+f(1)  
 1·f(4) = 10·31 + 2 = 312  
 ⇒ f(4) = 312.

Equation (2):

 f(5) – 1 = 10·31 + 20 = 330

Because N is a 4-digit vampire number, the four decimal digits of N are exactly the four digits a, b, c, d in some order and the two fangs may not both end in 0.

------------------------------------------------------------------
I.  Exactly one fang ends in 0  

Say d = 0 (the other case is symmetric).  Then n = 10c and

N = (10a+b)(10c)=10c(10a+b)=100ac + 10bc.                    (2)

Equation (2) shows
• the units–digit of N is 0 (coming from the single 0 in the fangs);  
• the thousands–digit is the tens–digit of ac.

Write ac = 10p + q (p is the tens–digit, q the units–digit).
Then (2) becomes  

N = 1000p + 100q + 10bc.

Since 0 ≤ 100q + 10bc ≤ 900 + 810 = 1710, any carry into the thousands
place can raise the thousands digit by at most 1, so the thousands digit
is either p or p+1.  In either case it must equal one of the digits
a, b, or c.  Testing the small list of possibilities (p = 1, 2 … 8)

0 is allowed, the only admissible products are

1260 = 21 × 60,  1530 = 30 × 51,  6880 = 80 × 86.

------------------------------------------------------------------
II.  Neither fang ends in 0  

Now b, d ∈ {1,…,9}.  The units–digit of N is the units–digit of bd, so
bd mod 10 must be one of the digits a, b, c, d themselves.  This leaves
very few possibilities for (b,d):

(b , d) = (1,5), (1,7), (3,5), (3,9), (5,7), (7,9).

Examining each possibility with (1) and insisting that the four digits
of the product coincide with a,b,c,d quickly narrows the field to the
following four solutions:

1395 = 15 × 93,  1435 = 35 × 41,  1827 = 21 × 87,  2187 = 27 × 81.

 • inner radius is R (from the hole).

For |z| > 3 the sphere’s cross-section radius is less than R, so the cross-section there has been completely removed; hence the body exists only for |z| ≤ 3.

• s m = length of an edge of the cube;  
• The open central space is a right circular cylinder whose axis is perpendicular to the square floor.  
  Because the cylinder is “inscribed in a perfect cube,” its base is the circle inscribed in the square
  floor plan, so

  radius of cylinder  r = s/2  and  height of cylinder = s.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  Using the corner office measurements  
-------------------------------------------------
Put the origin at one lower-left corner of the square floor and call the two horizontal edges the x-
and y-axes.  
The circle that bounds the cylindrical void is then

  (x – s/2)² + (y – s/2)² = (s/2)².                     (1)

A corner office is a rectangular prism whose horizontal cross-section is the rectangle
0 ≤ x ≤ a, 0 ≤ y ≤ b.  
Sane had written a = 16 m and b = 8 m.  The inner corner (a, b) of this office lies exactly on the
circular boundary (it “extends to the edge of the open area”), so (a, b) must satisfy (1):

  (16 – s/2)² + (8 – s/2)² = (s/2)².                    (2)

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Solving for the cube edge s  
-------------------------------------------------
Let t = s/2.  Then (2) becomes

  (16 – t)² + (8 – t)² = t²  
⇒ (256 – 32t + t²) + (64 – 16t + t²) = t²  
⇒ 320 – 48t + 2t² = t²  
⇒ t² – 48t + 320 = 0.

The quadratic gives

  t = [48 ± √(48² – 4·320)] / 2  
    = [48 ± √1024] / 2  
    = [48 ± 32] / 2 → t = 8 or t = 40.

If t = 8 (so s = 16), the rectangle would be as wide as the entire cube (a = 16 = s), leaving no
wall between neighbouring offices—impossible in the intended design.  
Therefore t = 40 and

  s = 2t = 80 m.

Cube: edge length 80 m.  
Cylinder: radius 40 m, height 80 m.

4.  (Alternate) Cost of making all offices solid wood

Volume of cube  V_cube = s³ = 80³ = 512 000 m³.  
Volume of cylinder V_cyl  = πr²h = π(40)²(80) = 128 000 π ≈ 402 125 m³.

Volume of offices (cube minus cylindrical void):

 V_off = 512 000 – 128 000 π ≈ 109 875 m³.

At $10 per cubic metre, the cost is

 Cost ≈ 10 × 109 875 ≈ $1.10 million (to the nearest ten thousand dollars).

Final answer: The cube must have edge length 80 m, and the inscribed open cylinder must have radius 40 m and height 80 m; filling all offices with solid wood would require about 1.1 × 10⁶ m³ of wood, costing roughly $1.1 million at \$10 per cubic metre.",True,1,0
36,"A man smokes and drinks coffee lightened with cream. He is absolutely consistent in his habits. Every day, except every four years when he abstains on Leap Day, he smokes the same number of cigarettes, brews the same amount of coffee grinds, and uses the same amount of cream in his coffee. Every day he buys the daily newspaper, which he purchases more often than a pack of 20 cigarettes. The pack of cigarettes is purchased more often than a half-pint of cream, which in turn is purchased more often than a one pound can of coffee. On Flag Day (USA) he purchased all four items. The next time he purchased all four items on the same day was the Fourth of July of the following year. How many cigarettes does he smoke each day?",Flag Day (USA) is June 14,"4 cigarettes a day.
The purchases are made according to 4 different cycles. There are 385 days from Flag Day until July Fourth of the following year excluding Leap Day. These purchasing cycles intersect every 385 days and are thus in the set of factors for 385 (1, 5, 7, 11, and 385). Since the newspaper is purchased every day, and the coffee and cream are purchased more often then the pack of cigarettes, then the pack is purchased either every 5 days or every 7 days.  The pack contains 20 cigarettes which only has the factor 5 in common with the possible cycle for the cigarettes.  Therefore a pack of 20 is purchased every 5 days.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

d = number of cigarettes the man smokes each (ordinary) day.  

All supplies are bought only when the previous supply is exhausted.  
Because his daily routine never varies (except that on Leap Day he uses nothing),  
the time between successive purchases of a given article is always the same,  
except that any cycle which contains a Leap-day is one day longer (no consumption that day).

1.  Length of time between the two “buy-everything” days  

Flag Day is 14 June.  
From 14 June of one year to 4 July of the next year there are

365 days (a full ordinary year) + 20 days = 385 days,

unless the intervening 29 February occurs.  
If the next year is a leap-year there are 386 calendar days, but the man consumes
nothing on 29 February, so the number of consumption-days is still 386 – 1 = 385.

Hence in every case exactly 385 days of consumption elapse between the
two purchase coincidences.

2.  Consequence for cigarettes  

During those 385 days he smokes 385 d cigarettes.  
Every cigarette he smokes comes out of a 20-cigarette pack, and
a pack is always finished before the next is bought; therefore
385 d must be a whole multiple of 20:

385 d ≡ 0  (mod 20).                                    (1)

3.  Restricting d  

Because he never buys a pack as often as he buys a newspaper, the interval
between packs must exceed one day, so d < 20.
Since a pack must last an integer number of days, 20 must be divisible by d.
Thus d is one of the divisors of 20 that are < 20:

d ∈ {1, 2, 4, 5, 10}.                                   (2)

4.  Solving congruence (1) with the possibilities (2)

385 ≡ 5 (mod 20), so (1) becomes 5 d ≡ 0 (mod 20),
which is true exactly when d is a multiple of 4.

Among the numbers in (2) the only multiple of 4 is 4 itself.

Hence d = 4.

5.  Consistency check  

With d = 4, a 20-cigarette pack lasts 20/4 = 5 days.
Because 385 = 5×77, pack-purchases occur 77 times in the 385-day span,
so the man indeed buys cigarettes on both Flag Day and the following 4 July.

Choose, for instance, 7 days for a half-pint of cream and 11 days for a pound of
coffee (7 > 5 and 11 > 7, so the frequency order required is satisfied).
The least common multiple of 5, 7, and 11 is 385, guaranteeing that no earlier
day than the 385th can be a simultaneous purchase day for all four articles,
exactly as the problem states.

Therefore the only possible consistent daily consumption is

   Observe:

     If K is odd, K⁵ is odd, so K⁵−K is still even.  
     Hence K⁵−K ≡ 0 (mod 2).

   • Mod 5:  Fermat’s Little Theorem gives K⁵ ≡ K (mod 5), so  
     K⁵ − K ≡ 0 (mod 5).

   Being divisible by both 2 and 5, K⁵ − K is divisible by 10:

        K⁵ − K ≡ 0  (mod 10).

Therefore the remainder upon division by 10 is 0, no matter what the actual ages (7 – 23) are.

Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.
""This is my sole sister,"" the girl groaned, ""with the obvious name.""
Kurt looked blank.  After a few seconds, Rod's face lit up.
""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""
""Right,"" she grumbled, ""and it tastes like recycled history essays?""
The three grinned broadly at her.  ""Try one,"" Kurt said, proffering one of the shrink-wrapped torpedoes.
Eileen shifted some of her weight back to the toe of the damaged right shoe and tentatively accepted the Rnkfurer.  She unwrapped it, took one bite, and saw her ecstatic grin reflected on the faces of the other three.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""We were about to go order more tomorrow.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""
Eileen got it right away.  ""So we each get 25 of them, and have 25% of the total.""
Rod grinned.  ""That's cheating.  We use different numbers.""
""Oh, all right.""  She thought for a few seconds.  ""So you can do it a few ways for two people, round off for three, but we couldn't do it for four.""
""Really?""  Rod wasn't as quick with the enlarged problem.  ""I'm not surprised, but that means we'll just have to buy in pairs.""
""Or change the rules a little,"" Eileen added.
""How so?""  Kurt was ready to do almost anything that would get a Rnkfurer refill.
""Well, how about if Kurt buys twice as many as Rod's percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt's percentage ...""
Kurt looked hopeful, Patty was expectant, and Rod's analytical gears were grinding.
""It's a big order, but we could do it,"" he finally declared.

Patti        45, 7.5% ... 7.5 * 2 = 15
Eileen        15
TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,,True,0,0

Write the size of a rectangular chessboard as m × n with m ≤ n.

Schwenk’s Theorem.  
An m × n board possesses a closed knight’s tour except in the

Every other rectangle admits at least one closed tour.

The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The balcony is like so in order for the spot light (that shines at a 45 degree angle to the roof) will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony.

Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:
let a represent the height of the room, then b represent the height of the balcony off the floor, then f represent the thickness of the balcony floor, then r represent a-b or the radius of the balcony floor, then h represent the height of the fence.

For three digits the only possible values with (4) are s = 10 or s = 19

54,"Which two closest together whole numbers that, when multiplied, produce the pleasant looking number: 1234567890 ?",Use prime factorizations,"34,227 and  36,070.
The only factors of 1234567890 are 2, 3, 3, 5, 3607 and 3803. Testing the various products of these factors reveals that 34,227 and 36,070 are the closest pair of numbers that produce 1234567890.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"First factor 1 234 567 890 completely.

Because the last digit is 0, it is divisible by 10:

1 234 567 890 = 10 · 123 456 789 = 2 · 5 · 123 456 789.

The digit-sum of 123 456 789 is 45, so that number is divisible by 9 (=3²):

123 456 789 = 9 · 13 717 421 = 3² · 13 717 421.

The factor 13 717 421 is the classical product  
13 717 421 = 3607 · 3803 (both primes).

Hence the complete prime factorisation of N = 1 234 567 890 is

N = 2 · 3 · 3 · 5 · 3607 · 3803.        (1)

We must form two factors whose product is N and whose difference is as small as possible; i.e. each should be as close as possible to √N.

An approximation gives  
√N ≈ 35 100.

The two large primes are 3607 and 3803 (both ≈ one-tenth of √N).  
Therefore each of the required factors should contain exactly one of these primes; the four small primes 2,3,3,5 (whose product is 90) have to be split between them.

Write

Factor 1 = 3607 · a, Factor 2 = 3803 · b with a · b = 90, a,b ∈ {1,2,3,5,6,9,10,15,18,30,45,90}.

To balance the factors we need a slightly larger than b, because 3607 < 3803.

Test every divisor pair of 90:

a  b      Factor 1        Factor 2        |difference|
10 9   3607·10 = 36 070   3803·9 = 34 227      1 843   ← closest

90 1   324 630            3 803             320 827
(and their reverses, which give the same or larger gaps)

The smallest gap is obtained with a = 10, b = 9:

Factor 1 = 3607 · 10 = 36 070  
Factor 2 = 3803 · 9  = 34 227.

Verification:

36 070 × 34 227  
= (3607·10)·(3803·9)  
= 3607 · 3803 · 90  
= 1 234 567 890. ✓

No other distribution of the primes gives a smaller difference between the factors, so these are the two closest whole numbers whose product is 1 234 567 890.

55,"There was a famous mathematician named Karl Friedrich Gauss. When he was young, he entered Gotinga University. One day he met an old professor, and spoke to him. They chatted, and the professor asked Gauss about his age.
Gauss said: ""The cube and the fourth power of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
The professor said: ""Very good. It's good coincidence because the square and the cube of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
How old was Gauss, and how old was the professor?","Eliminate the impossibilities, such as their ages can't end with 0.","Their ages can't end with 0, 1, 5 or 6, and must be either a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 9 minus 1 because the sum of its square and its cube or its cube and its fourth power is divisible by 9.
Gauss's age is easy. Since 17^3=4913, 17^4=83521, 22^3=10648, 22^4=234256, Gauss's age is between 18 and 21. The only possibility is 18. 18^3=5832, 18^4=104976.
The professor's age is a little harder. It can be 47 to 99, and the possibilities are: 48, 53, 54, 57, 62, 63, 69, 72, 78, 84, 87, 89, 93, 98, 99. By trial and error, 69 satisfies this condition: 69^2=4761, 69^3=328509.
Therefore, Gauss was 18 and the professor was 69.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let g be Gauss’s age and p be the professor’s age.  
In each statement we are told that the two numbers that are mentioned ( g³ together with g⁴, or p² together with p³ ) use every decimal digit 0–9 once and only once.  
Consequently

• the two numbers must between them contain exactly 10 digits,  
• no digit may be repeated inside either number, and  
• no digit may occur in both numbers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Determining the possible size of the numbers
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Gauss  
Say g³ has n digits and g⁴ has m digits.  
Because g⁴ = g·g³, the two lengths differ by at most two digits while
           n + m = 10.  
The only feasible possibilities are (n , m) = (4 , 6) or (5 , 5).

Professor  
Write p² with r digits and p³ with s digits.  Again r + s = 10 and
p³ = p·p², so s is either r+1 or r+2.  The only feasible possibility is
(r , s) = (4 , 6).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  A bound for the ages
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Gauss  
To have g³ 4–5 digits we need 15 ≤ g ≤ 22, while to have g⁴ 5–6 digits
we need 12 ≤ g ≤ 31.  Thus

           15  ≤  g  ≤  22.                                 (1)

Professor  
For p² to have 4 digits we need 32 ≤ p ≤ 99; for p³ to have 6 digits we
need 47 ≤ p ≤ 99.  Hence

           47  ≤  p  ≤  99.                                 (2)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Restricting the last digit
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The last digit of g³ is g² (mod 10) and the last digit of g⁴ is g³ (mod 10).
If g ends in 0,1,5,6 then those two endings are equal, which would repeat a
digit; therefore

           g ends in 2,3,4,7,8 or 9.                        (3)

Exactly the same reasoning applies to p.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Looking at the ten candidates 15–22 for Gauss
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Compute the two required powers only for those whose final digit obeys (3):

g   g³            g⁴
16  4096          65536        (digits repeat)
17  4913          83521        (digits repeat)
18  5832          104976  ✔ all ten digits once
19  6859          130321       (digits repeat)
22  10648         234256       (digits repeat)

The only admissible age for Gauss is

           g = 18.                                          (4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Testing the integers 47–99 for the professor
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Again we examine only endings 2,3,4,7,8,9 and insist that  
(i) p² has four different digits, (ii) p³ has six different digits,  
(iii) the two sets are disjoint.

A short hand-check gives:

p   p²    p³
47  2209  103823   (repeats 2)  
48  2304  110592   (repeats 1)  
49  2401  117649   (repeats 1)  
…  
59  3481  205379   (digit 3 occurs in both)  
69  4761  328509 ✔ ten digits 0-9 exactly once
70–99  every case fails on a repetition.

Thus

           p = 69.                                           (5)

We are asked for integers n between 1 and 50 000 000 that satisfy both relations simultaneously:

n = k² = m(m+1)/2.        (1)

Eliminate m: multiply (1) by 8,

All positive integer solutions of (3) are generated from the fundamental solution (x₁ , y₁) = (3, 1) by the classical Pell recursion

x_{n+1} + y_{n+1}√8 = (3 + √8)·(x_n + y_n√8).

Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).

63,"Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.
""I know that voice!  C'mon down.""
""Who is it?"" Eileen prodded.
""Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?""
Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.
""Why should I?""
""I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.""
""Is that the new Sinatra CD?""
""No, it's the world's greatest snack.""
""I'm hungry, too!"" the other voice whined.
""Who's up there with you?""  Patty asked.
""I'll bet I know!"" Eileen called.  ""It's obvious!""
Patty's face lit up in realization.  ""Robin!"" they laughed together.
A pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.
""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""
""We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.""
""What are those?""
""You know what a perfect number is?""
""Sure,"" Patty interjected, ""a number equal to the sum of its divisors.""
""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.  What are the four quantities in the sequence?",You can leave out numbers that are primes (sum of proper divisors is 1) or the product of two primes (sum of divisors will be less than 100).  This will shorten your search somewhat.,"108, 172, 136, and 134.
Method:
This one really requires a brute-force approach.  The sigma function (sum of a number's divisors) does not lend itself to 3rd-order analysis (3 numbers past the first one).  Most of the remaining numbers will leave the 100-200 range on the first or second iteration.  I used a small computer program.  The only sequence that stays in bounds for 4 terms is the one given.

There are 4-cycles of amicable numbers.  However, the least quadruple is a little large, even for Patty's appetite: 1264460, 1547860, 1727636, 1305184.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let s(n) denote the sum of the proper divisors of n.  
An “aliquot sequence’’ is obtained by repeatedly applying s :  

a₁ , a₂ = s(a₁), a₃ = s(a₂), a₄ = s(a₃), …

We need a₁ , a₂ , a₃ , a₄ all between 100 and 200, and their total a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + a₄ a multiple of 25.

1.  Parity and size considerations  
•  Odd numbers below 200 are never abundant, so s(odd) < odd < 200, forcing the next term < 100.  
  Hence every term must be even.  
•  If n is highly abundant (for instance 120 or 160), s(n) exceeds 200.  
  Thus we look for even numbers whose “abundancy ratio’’ s(n)/n is roughly between 1 and 2.

2.  A convenient starting point  
Among the moderate even numbers, 108 is promising:

108 = 2² · 3³  
σ(2²) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7  
σ(3³) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40  
σ(108) = 7 · 40 = 280  
s(108) = 280 – 108 = 172  (100 ≤ 172 ≤ 200)

So take a₁ = 108, a₂ = 172.

3.  Continuing the sequence

a₂ = 172 = 2² · 43  
σ(2²) = 7, σ(43) = 44 → σ(172) = 7 · 44 = 308  
s(172) = 308 – 172 = 136  (100 ≤ 136 ≤ 200)

Thus a₃ = 136.

a₃ = 136 = 2³ · 17  
σ(2³) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15, σ(17) = 18 → σ(136) = 15 · 18 = 270  
s(136) = 270 – 136 = 134  (100 ≤ 134 ≤ 200)

Hence a₄ = 134, still within the required range.  
(After this the sequence drops below 100, but we only need the first four terms.)

4.  Checking the divisibility condition  
a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + a₄ = 108 + 172 + 136 + 134 = 550 = 25 · 22.

Therefore the four desired quantities (the first four terms of the aliquot sequence) are

64,"The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with ""rock"", 2 points with ""scissors"", and 1 point with ""paper"".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one ""throw"", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.
The players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.
Knowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?","(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.
(2) This is a ""zero-sum"" game: what one player wins, the other loses.
(3) The game is ""symmetric"": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.
(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the three pure plays we may choose be

R = rock , P = paper , S = scissors.

Because the loser pays the winner an amount that depends on the winner’s play, the chip‐payoff (to us, the row player) for every possible confrontation is

       Opponent  
       R  P  S  
 Us R   0 −1 +3  
    P  +1  0 −2  
    S  −3 +2  0

(The entries are positive when we receive chips and negative when we pay them.)

We must pick probabilities p_R , p_P , p_S (non–negative, summing to 1) for R, P, S that make us immune to exploitation by any opponent; i.e. we want a maximin (Nash‐equilibrium) mixed strategy.  
Let v be the expected number of chips we net when our opponent restricts himself to a single pure play.

Against an all-rock opponent the expectation is
 E(Rock) = 0·p_R + 1·p_P − 3·p_S = p_P − 3p_S.  (1)

Against an all-paper opponent it is
 E(Paper) = −1·p_R + 0·p_P + 2·p_S = −p_R + 2p_S.  (2)

Against an all-scissors opponent it is
 E(Scissors) = 3·p_R − 2·p_P + 0·p_S = 3p_R − 2p_P.  (3)

To prevent the opponent from gaining a positive expectation we want all three
values to be at least v, and we wish to maximise v.  In equilibrium the pure
strategies that the opponent might choose with positive probability must all give him the same return, so we set the three expectations equal:

p_P − 3p_S = −p_R + 2p_S = 3p_R − 2p_P = v.  (4)

Solving (4) together with p_R + p_P + p_S = 1 proceeds as follows.

From the first two equalities:  
 −p_R + 2p_S = p_P − 3p_S  
 ⇒ p_P = −p_R + 5p_S.  (5)

From the second and third equalities:  
 3p_R − 2p_P = −p_R + 2p_S  
 ⇒ 4p_R − 2p_P − 2p_S = 0  
 ⇒ 2p_R − p_P − p_S = 0.  (6)

Insert (5) into (6):

2p_R − (−p_R + 5p_S) − p_S = 0  
⇒ 3p_R − 6p_S = 0  
⇒ p_R = 2p_S.  (7)

Put (7) in (5):

p_P = −2p_S + 5p_S = 3p_S.  (8)

Finally use p_R + p_P + p_S = 1:

(2p_S) + (3p_S) + p_S = 1  
⇒ 6p_S = 1  
⇒ p_S = 1/6.

Hence

p_R = 2/6 = 1/3,  p_P = 3/6 = 1/2,  p_S = 1/6.

With these numbers the common value v is

v = p_P − 3p_S = 1/2 − 3·(1/6) = 0,

and indeed

E(Rock) = E(Paper) = E(Scissors) = 0.

Therefore the opponent, no matter what he does, can expect no gain, and neither can we lose in expectation.

65,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
Assume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.  What is the lowest card total at which you can be assured you will not be required to drink a glass of milk through your nose in order to break a tie for the maximum 4 points?",Create the largest tie,"If all four players hold the same number of cards, the lowest card total that would never require a tie-break is 142.

In this case, the two players who would be required to drink milk through their noses would each have had a hand consisting of a joker and two 8s, 9s, 10s, jacks, queens and kings.  Any score above 141 can not be duplicated in a single hand of Snapoker, thus making 142 the lowest total to which a tie-breaker will not need to be applied.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Step 1  –  The pack that is actually used  
For every ordinary deck (52 cards) we

• remove all odd-numbered spades → 7 cards  
• remove all even-numbered hearts → 6 cards  
• remove all prime-numbered diamonds, ace included → 7 cards  
• remove all non-prime-numbered clubs, ace included → 7 cards  

52 – (7+6+7+7)=25 cards remain in each deck.  
Two such decks therefore contain 2·25 = 50 cards.

Two jokers (value 15) are then added, so the game is played with

50 + 2 = 52 cards altogether.

Step 2  –  The value of every card that remains  

(The indices show how many copies of each value the double-deck contains.)

15², 13⁴, 12⁴, 11⁴, 10⁴, 9⁴, 8⁴, 7⁴, 6⁴, 5⁴, 4⁴, 3⁴, 2⁴, 1².

Step 3  –  The grand total of all the card values  

2·15 + 4(13+12+11+10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2) + 2·1  
= 30 + 4·90 + 2  
= 30 + 360 + 2  
= 392.

Step 4  –  Equal number of cards per player  

52 cards are divided equally among the four players, i.e. 13 cards each.  
Hence the average score per player is 392/4 = 98.

Step 5  –  How large can the second-highest hand possibly be?  

Arrange the 52 cards in descending order:

15,15,13,13,13,13,12,12,12,12,11,11,11,11,10,10,10,10,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,1,1.

The 26 highest cards (exactly enough for two players) are

2×15, 4×13, 4×12, 4×11, 4×10, 4×9, 4×8

and their total value is

2·15 + 4(13+12+11+10+9+8)  
= 30 + 4·63  
= 30 + 252  
= 282.

If these 26 cards are split as evenly as possible – one joker and two of every other value for each of the first two players – every one of those two players receives

15 + 2(13+12+11+10+9+8)  
= 15 + 2·63  
= 15 + 126  
= 141 points.

Thus 141 is attainable by two different players, so a tie at 141 is possible.

Because the total of the 26 highest cards is only 282, the average of the best two hands can never exceed 141. Consequently

the second-highest score in any deal can never be more than 141.

So 141 is the greatest score at which a tie for the lead could still occur.

Step 6  –  A score that rules out any tie for first place  

To be absolutely certain of winning outright one must have strictly more than the largest possible second-highest score, i.e.

141 + 1 = 142.

Therefore, the very moment your 13 cards add up to 142 points you already know that no other player can match you and the nasal milk-drinking tiebreak will never be required.

Because exactly two of the ten numbers are equal, among the ten values  
S – a₁ , S – a₂ , … , S – a₁₀  
there is one repetition; hence there are only nine distinct nine-number sums.  
These nine distinct sums are given:

 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92.

Therefore the ten sums (with one duplicated) are the above nine numbers, with one of them appearing twice.

Then the multiset of the ten original numbers is

together with one extra copy of S – y (because y is duplicated).

This gives

 = 10S – 783 – y.

Hence

9S = 783 + y  ⇒  S = (783 + y) / 9.

Because S is an integer, (783 + y) must be divisible by 9.  
Compute each of the possible y’s modulo 9:

82≡1, 83≡2, 84≡3, 85≡4, 87≡6, 89≡8, 90≡0, 91≡1, 92≡2 (mod 9).

Only 90 is congruent to 0 modulo 9, so the duplicated sum is

 y = 90.

Therefore

S = (783 + 90) / 9 = 873 / 9 = 97.

Now the actual numbers are

S – 82 = 15, S – 83 = 14, S – 84 = 13, S – 85 = 12,  
S – 87 = 10, S – 89 = 8, S – 90 = 7 (appearing twice),  
S – 91 = 6, S – 92 = 5.

They are all natural numbers, two of them (7 and 7) are equal, and omitting each one indeed yields the required nine-number sums.

A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.

1.  Jack  

   • Each “zig–zag” step is 1 m long and is made at a fixed angle to the horizontal.  
     His two feet are 0.60 m apart on that horizontal, so a right-triangle is formed whose
        hypotenuse = 1 m (the step)  
        horizontal leg  = 0.60 m.  
     Hence the vertical leg (the drop per step) is  

                 √(1² – 0.60²) = √(1 – 0.36) = √0.64 = 0.80 m.  

   • Time per step = 15 s.  
   • He must rest 1 min after every 8 m of vertical descent.

   ⇒  10 steps (10 × 0.80 m = 8 m) take 10 × 15 s = 150 s = 2 min 30 s.

2.  Jill  

   • Each hop is along a half–circular arc whose length is said to be 1.57 m ≈ π⁄2 m.  
     For a half circle the length equals πr, hence r = 0.50 m and the vertical diameter
     is 2r = 1.00 m.  
     Therefore every hop lowers her exactly 1 m.  

   • Time per hop = 15 s.  
   • She must rest 1 min after every 6 m of vertical descent.

   ⇒  6 hops (6 m) take 6 × 15 s = 90 s, then she must rest 60 s.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
First stage – the upper 8 m
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack: 10 steps → 150 s.  
Jill:  6 hops (90 s) + 1 min rest (60 s) + 2 more hops (30 s) = 180 s.

Jack reaches the 8-m mark first (at t = 150 s).  
Consequently Jill, the loser of this stage, must now serve the 30-s penalty beginning
immediately.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Events between 150 s and 210 s
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack has to take his obligatory 1-min rest for having completed 8 m,
so he is stopped from 150 s to 210 s.

Jill is finishing her mandatory 1-min rest at 150 s, but the 30-s penalty
forces her to wait from 150 s to 180 s.  
She then needs 2 hops (30 s) to reach the 8-m mark, arriving there at
t = 210 s.

Thus both climbers are free to start the second stage simultaneously at 210 s.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Second stage – the lower 8 m
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack: 8 m still to go = 10 steps = 150 s.  
      No further rest is taken until the ground is reached.  
      Finish time: 210 s + 150 s = 360 s.

Jill: Needs 8 hops.  
      After 6 more hops (90 s) she has descended another 6 m (total 14 m) and must rest
      1 min, i.e. from 300 s to 360 s.  
      Two final hops (30 s) take her to the ground at 390 s.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Who wins and by how much?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack touches the ground at t = 360 s (6 min).  
Jill touches the ground at t = 390 s (6 min 30 s).

Therefore Jack wins, and Jill arrives 30 s = 0.5 min later.

Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""
Assuming everything has integer weights, what were the two types of weights that Joseph suggested?",Try it out with small numbers. What is the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of 3s and 4s? The answer is 5. Try it out with other numbers. You'll find a pattern eventually.,"The two weights are 11 and 13.
If you played around with the hint, you'll realize that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of Xs and Ys is equal to (X-1)(Y-1) - 1.
We are told that the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of a combination of the two weights is 119.
Thus,
119 = (x-1)(y-1) - 1
120 = (x-1)(y-1)
From here, we only have to list 120's factors: (1,120), (2,60), (3,40), (4,30), (5,24), (6,20), (8,15), (10,12).  There are 8 possible combinations.
However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.
Try it out. You can't make 119 using only 11s and 13s but you can make 120 and above using only 11s and 13s.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the two integral weights be a lb and b lb, with a≤b.  
The story tells us:

1. Each load of at least 120 lb can be written as a non-negative integer combination of a and b.  
2. 119 lb cannot.  
3. Each weight exceeds 10 lb.  
4. The two weights are not both even (necessary for the property in 1).

In number–theoretic language we are looking at the classical “coin” (Frobenius) problem.

I.  Why a and b must be coprime  
If d=gcd(a,b)>1, every sum xa+yb is divisible by d, so no number that is not a multiple of d could ever be obtained, however large it is.  Condition 1 therefore forces d=1; that is, a and b are coprime.

II.  The largest unobtainable weight  
For two coprime positive integers, the Frobenius number (largest integer not representable) equals

      F(a,b)=ab−a−b.

Here this number is given to be 119.  Hence

      ab−a−b = 119.          (1)

III.  Transforming equation (1)  
Add 1 to both sides:

      ab − a − b + 1 = 120  
   ⇒ (a−1)(b−1) = 120.       (2)

IV.  Using the size condition  
Because each weight is heavier than 10 lb,

      a > 10  ⇒  a−1 ≥ 10,  
      b > 10  ⇒  b−1 ≥ 10.

Thus we seek two divisors of 120 that are at least 10.

The list of divisors of 120 is  
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.

Among these, the only pair both at least 10 whose product is 120 is 10 and 12.

V.  Recovering a and b  
Set a−1=10 and b−1=12 (or vice-versa).  Then

      a = 11,   b = 13.

VI.  Verifications  
•  gcd(11,13)=1, so the Frobenius formula applies.  
•  F(11,13)=11·13−11−13 = 143−24 = 119, as required.  
•  Both weights exceed 10 and are not both even.

Hence the only possible pair is (11 lb, 13 lb).

""No, you could not.""
""Aha! At last, I know how old you are!""
Apparently the second mathematician had been trying to determine the first mathematician's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
The bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.","There are multiple possible age combinations for the mathematician's children that would result in the same age as well as the same bus number otherwise the second mathematician can determine the ages of the children given the first mathematician's age and number of children.
Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't — he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10.

73,"Achmed and Ali were camel-drivers and on one day they decided to quit their job. They wanted to become shepherds. So they went to the market and sold all their camels. The amount of money (dinars) they received for each camel was the same as the total number of camels they owned. With that money they bought as many sheep as possible at 10 dinars a sheep. With the money that was left they bought a goat.
On their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, ""I take the last sheep and you can get the goat"". ""That's not fair,"" said Achmed, ""a goat costs less than a sheep"". ""OK,"" Ali said, ""then I will give you one of my dogs and then we are even"". And Achmed agreed.

The money they received for their camels is a square. And the digit in the tens-place of this square is odd (total money / 10 dinars), because they could not divide the sheep equally.
Now the interesting thing is that all squares with an odd tens-place end with a 6. (16^2 = 256, 24^2 = 576). So a goat must cost 6 dinars.

So a dog costs 2 dinars.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

C = number of camels they owned  
(They receive C dinars for each camel, hence total money is C² dinars.)

1. Buying the animals
   • Price of a sheep = 10 dinars.  
   • Let S = number of sheep they could buy.  
     Then C² = 10 S + R with 0 < R < 10,  
     where R is the money left over, so the goat costs R dinars.

2. Dividing the sheep  
   S sheep are to be divided between two men and “there was one sheep left”, so
   S must be odd.  
   Write S = 2k + 1 (k is an integer).

3. The settlement  
   • Each man normally receives k sheep (value 10k dinars).  
   • Ali keeps the extra sheep (value 10 dinars).  
   • Achmed gets the goat (value R dinars).  
   • To make the division fair, Ali adds one dog worth D dinars to Achmed.

   Reduce this congruence modulo 20:

            C² ≡ 10 S + R  (mod 20).

   Because S is odd, S ≡ 1 (mod 2), so 10 S ≡ 10 (mod 20).

74,"Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?","The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","The minimum number of weights is 5.
weight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0
weight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1
weight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2
weight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3
weight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4
All five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.
The progression from one stone to one mass would be:
1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Call the sought-for weights  
w₁<w₂<⋯<wₙ   (expressed in stone; 1 lump = 11 stone, 1 mass = 121 stone).

1.  Why at least five weights are necessary  
   On a balance scale each weight may be put  
   • on the pan with the object (coefficient –1),  
   • on the opposite pan (coefficient +1), or  
   • not used (coefficient 0).  
   Hence n weights give at most 3ⁿ different algebraic sums  

             Σ εᵢwᵢ with εᵢ ∈ {–1,0,1}.  

   These sums occur in opposite pairs (±S), so the number of
   positive values that can be produced is at most (3ⁿ–1)/2.

   To weigh every integral amount from 1 stone to 121 stone inclusive we need at least 121 different positive values, so  

            (3ⁿ–1)/2  ≥ 121 ⇒ 3ⁿ ≥ 243 ⇒ n ≥ 5.

   Therefore no collection of four (or fewer) weights can succeed.

2.  A set of five weights that works  
   Choose the five powers of 3 not exceeding 121:

            w₁ = 1 stone  
            w₂ = 3 stone  
            w₃ = 9 stone  
            w₄ = 27 stone (2 lumps 5 stone)  
            w₅ = 81 stone (7 lumps 4 stone)

3.  Why they work  
   Every integer N with 0 ≤ N ≤ 121 has a unique balanced-ternary
   expansion

            N = ε₁·1 + ε₂·3 + ε₃·9 + ε₄·27 + ε₅·81,
            εᵢ ∈ {–1,0,1}.

   To realise this on the scale put weight wᵢ  
   • on the opposite pan if εᵢ = +1,  
   • on the same pan as the object if εᵢ = –1,  
   • aside if εᵢ = 0.  

   Example: 41 stone = (1)(27) + (1)(9) – (1)(3) – (1)(1)  
   ⇒ place 27 st and 9 st on one pan, 3 st and 1 st with the object.

   Because such a representation exists for every N up to 121, the five
   specified weights let one weigh any quantity from 1 stone to 1 mass.

4.  Minimality  
   Step 1 showed that at least five weights are obligatory; step 2 gives a concrete set of five that succeeds.  Hence five is both necessary and sufficient.

Final answer: Five weights of 1, 3, 9, 27, and 81 stone (i.e. 1 st, 3 st, 9 st, 2 lumps 5 st, and 7 lumps 4 st) allow every weight from 1 stone to 1 mass to be weighed, and no smaller number of weights can do so.",True,1,0

Without loss of generality arrange the pairs so that a ≥ c.

1.  Bounds that have to be checked  

   Because cubes grow very rapidly, it is easy to locate the region in which the first repetition can possibly occur.

   •  8³ = 512, 9³ = 729, 10³ = 1000, 11³ = 1331, 12³ = 1728.

   •  The first time the cube 12³ = 1728 can appear, the accompanying cube can be only 1³, giving 1728 + 1 = 1729.  

   Consequently every candidate N smaller than 1729 involves only cubes ≤ 11³.

2.  All sums that use only cubes ≤ 9³  

   We list every sum p³ + q³ (1 ≤ q ≤ p ≤ 9).  Each value is written once; equality of two different pairs would show up immediately.

    216+216=432, …
    (continuing systematically up to 2·9³ = 1458)

   The 55 numbers obtained (there are C(9+1,2)=55 pairs) are all distinct; no two of them coincide.

3.  Sums that contain 10³ = 1000  

   They are 1000 + r with r a cube ≤ 10³:

         1000+1 = 1001  1000+8 = 1008  1000+27 = 1027  
         1000+64 = 1064  1000+125 = 1125  1000+216 = 1216  
         1000+343 = 1343 1000+512 = 1512.

   None of the eight numbers above appears in the list of Step 2 (check by subtraction from each of the previously-listed cubes 729, 512, 343, …, 1).  Therefore no repetition occurs below 1512.

4.  Sums that contain 11³ = 1331 but are still below 1729  

   They are

         1331+1 = 1332, 1339, 1358, 1395, 1456, 1547, 1674.

   Again each of these seven values differs from every sum in Steps 2 and 3 (verify by subtracting each small cube 729, 512,…, 1 exactly as before).  Hence no repetition has yet appeared.

5.  The first sum that contains 12³  

   The smallest possible such sum is 12³ + 1³ = 1728 + 1 = 1729.

   But 1729 is also equal to 10³ + 9³ = 1000 + 729.

   Thus 1729 is represented by the two distinct pairs

         1729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³.

   All smaller integers have been shown incapable of having two different decompositions of the form (1).  Therefore 1729 is the least integer with the required property.

Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.
Considering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?
He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.",divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.,"Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24
This is for 12 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =
24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.
Now let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.
Here H can take values from 0 to 23.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.

The pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground.

If the string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag and the flag pole is 14 meters in height, then the string must cover 12 meters in total (14-1-1).
If the diameter of the pole is 10cm and the height covered is 12 meters (1200cm), then, unwrapped in to a rectangle, it would be pi(10) (since the circumference of a circle is pi{d}) by 1200 cm rectangle.
If the string wraps around in 4 even rotations, that means the rectangle divided on the y plane into 4 equal sections would represent one rotation per section. Finding the hypotenuse of each section (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) would then yield the distance covered per rotation.

The string's distance in one rotation would be expressed by the following equation:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2
Therefore, in 4 rotations it would be the above * 4.
The final equation is thus expressed as:
let a represent the total height of the pole, then f represent the height of the flag, then rot represent the number of rotations, then p represent the height of the pulley, then d represent the diameter of the pole
s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ ({1400-100-100}/4) ^ 2 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ 90 000 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 1206.561796
Therefore, the string covers approximately 1206.561796 cm in 12 meters when there are 4 even rotations.

h = vertical distance from the pulley to the bottom of the flag  
d = diameter of the pole  
C = circumference of the pole  
n = number of complete turns the rope makes round the pole  

Data from the statement  
• Flag height = distance ground → pulley = 1 m.  
• Flag-pole height = 14 × flag height = 14 m.  
• Hence the bottom of the (1 m-tall) flag, when fully hoisted, is at  
 14 m – 1 m = 13 m above the ground.  
• Pulley is 1 m above the ground.  

Therefore the rope rises from 1 m to 13 m, so  
h = 13 m – 1 m = 12 m.

Pole diameter d = 10 cm = 0.10 m, so its circumference is  

C = πd = π(0.10 m) ≈ 0.314159 m.

The rope wraps evenly round the pole 4 full times, so while it climbs the 12 m it also travels, horizontally (after “unrolling” the pole), a distance  

4C = 4(0.314159 m) = 0.4π m ≈ 1.256637 m.

Unwrapping the cylinder changes the helical path into the hypotenuse of a rectangle of height h and width 4C.  
Thus the required rope length L is obtained from Pythagoras:

L = √(h² + (4C)²)  
  = √((12 m)² + (1.256637 m)²)  
  = √(144 + 1.5791367) m  
  = √145.5791367 m  
  ≈ 12.0689 m.

So the flag rope needs about 12.07 metres of string.

Expressed in other units (using 100 cm = 1 m and 2.54 cm = 1 in):

12.07 m ≈ 1207 cm ≈ 476 in.

1.  From the statement

   b = G  (average of boys equals number of girls)

2.  Overall class average  
   c = (total marks of girls + total marks of boys)/(G + B)  
      = (G·g + B·b)/(G + B).  
   Substituting g = B and b = G gives  
   c = (GB + BG)/(G + B) = 2BG/(G + B).

3.  The class average is 4 less than the average of the two group–averages:  
      c = (g + b)/2 − 4.  
   But g + b = B + G, so  
      c = (B + G)/2 − 4.

4.  Equate the two expressions for c; let S = B + G (total students) and P = BG (product):  
         2P/S = S/2 − 4  
      ⇒ 2P = S²/2 − 4S  
      ⇒ 4P = S² − 8S … (★)

   Hence P = S(S − 8)/4.

5.  For positive integers B and G one needs the quadratic

           = S² − S(S − 8)  
           = 8S.

    Thus 8S must itself be a perfect square.  
    Write 8S = k².  Because 8 = 2³, k must contain at least two factors of 2, so set k = 4m (m ∈ ℕ).  
    Then 8S = 16m² ⇒ S = 2m².

6.  We seek the smallest double-digit S (≥ 10).  
      m = 1  ⇒ S = 2       (single digit)  
      m = 2  ⇒ S = 8       (single digit)  
      m = 3  ⇒ S = 18      (double digit, minimum).  

7.  Verify that S = 18 indeed yields integer, positive B and G:

      P = S(S − 8)/4 = 18·10/4 = 45.

      Solve x² − 18x + 45 = 0:

Just to help, the essay was more than 1000 pages but less than 10,000 pages.",Observe the number of digits usd to get 1000 pages; think about the ratio between digits and pages and what whole number would need to be achieved,"1107 pages.
The number of digits used to number all the pages is 3321.

10-99: 180 digits
100-999: 2700 digits
1000-1107: 432 digits
Total: 3321 digits
3321/1107= 3",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let N be the total number of pages (1000 < N < 10 000).

1.  How many digits are required to number the pages 1,2,3,…,N ?

   • 1-digit pages:   1 … 9  → 9·1 = 9 digits  
   • 2-digit pages: 10 … 99 → 90·2 = 180 digits  
   • 3-digit pages: 100 … 999 → 900·3 = 2700 digits  
   • 4-digit pages: 1000 … N → (N – 999)·4 digits  

   Hence  
        D(N) = 9 + 180 + 2700 + 4(N – 999)  
              = 2889 + 4N – 3996  
              = 4N – 1107.

2.  The statement says that the total number of digits D(N) is a multiple of the number of pages N, i.e.

        D(N) ≡ 0  (mod N).

   Substituting D(N):

        4N – 1107 ≡ 0  (mod N)  
        –1107 ≡ 0  (mod N).

   Therefore N must divide 1107.

3.  Factor 1107:

        1107 = 3² · 41.

   Its positive divisors are  
        1, 3, 9, 41, 123, 369, 1107.

   The only divisor lying between 1000 and 10 000 is 1107 itself.

4.  Check:  
        D(1107) = 4·1107 – 1107 = 3321,  
        3321 ÷ 1107 = 3, an integer.  
   The condition is satisfied.

Hence the essay contained exactly 1107 pages.

89,"Before Google was a company, it was a number.  A googol is 10^100: a one followed by a hundred zeros.
How many natural numbers less than a googol are both the square of a square and the cube of a cube?
(If N is an integer then N^2 is a square and N^3 is a cube.)",Represent any such numbers as N^y where y is some positive real number,"599
The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.
The 36th root of a googol is
(10^100)^(1/36) = 10^(100/36) = 10^(2.77777...) ~ 599.48

 N  =  (square of a square)  and  N  =  (cube of a cube).

1.  Determining the shape of N  
   •  “square of a square’’ means N = a⁴ for some integer a.  
   •  “cube of a cube’’ means N = b⁹ for some integer b.  

   In the prime-factorisation of N every exponent must be a multiple of 4 (so that N is a 4-th power) and simultaneously a multiple of 9 (so that N is a 9-th power).  
   Hence every exponent is a multiple of lcm(4,9)=36, and conversely any 36-th power satisfies both conditions.  

   Therefore  
  N is such a number  ⇔  N = m³⁶   for some positive integer m.

2.  How large may m be?  
   We need m³⁶ < 10¹⁰⁰.

   Taking common (base-10) logarithms,
  36·log₁₀m < 100  ⟺ log₁₀m < 100/36 = 25/9.  
   Hence
  m < 10^{25/9}.                                           (†)

3.  Locating 10^{25/9} between two consecutive integers  

   Write 25/9 = 2 + 7/9, so  
  10^{25/9} = 10²·10^{7/9} = 100·10^{7/9}.

   Now compare 10^{7/9} with 6:

   log₁₀(6) = 0.778151… while 7/9 = 0.777777…  
   Thus log₁₀(6) > 7/9, so 10^{7/9} < 6.

   Similarly, compare with 5.99:

   log₁₀(5.99) = log₁₀(6) – log₁₀(6/5.99) < 0.778151 – 0.0007 ≈ 0.77745  
   and 0.77745 < 7/9, so 10^{7/9} > 5.99.

   Therefore  
  5.99 < 10^{7/9} < 6,  
 so  
  100·5.99 < 10^{25/9} < 100·6,  
                        
  599 < 10^{25/9} < 600.

   Hence, by (†), the permissible integers m are exactly 1,2,…,599.

4.  Counting the admissible numbers N  
   For each of the 599 choices of m we obtain one number N = m³⁶, and all of them are distinct and < 10¹⁰⁰.  

   Consequently the total number of natural numbers below a googol that are simultaneously a 4-th power and a 9-th power is

90,What is the 1000th prime number?,It is smaller than 10000,7919,GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"A completely rigorous way to see which integer is the 1000 th prime is simply to count, but one must do it in an orderly, justified fashion.  Here is an outline of such a count which is short enough to be followed by hand but complete enough to leave no doubt.

1.  Primes up to 1000  
    Sieve–of–Eratosthenes (or any other routine elementary method) shows that there are exactly  

        π(100)  =  25  
        π(200)  =  46  
        π(300)  =  62  
        π(400)  =  78  
        π(500)  =  95  
        π(600)  = 109  
        π(700)  = 125  
        π(800)  = 139  
        π(900)  = 154  
        π(1000) = 168  

    Hence 168 of the required 1000 primes have already been identified.

2.  Primes from 1000 to 7000  
    The same sieve carried a thousand integers at a time gives:

        1000–2000 : 135 primes  (total 303)  
        2000–3000 : 127 primes  (total 430)  
        3000–4000 : 120 primes  (total 550)  
        4000–5000 : 119 primes  (total 669)  
        5000–6000 : 114 primes  (total 783)  
        6000–7000 : 117 primes  (total 900)

    After 7000 we have therefore located exactly 900 primes; we still need 100 more.

3.  Primes from 7000 up to the point where the 1000 th one appears

    Exactly one hundred primes lie in the half-open interval (7000, 7920).  Since there were already 900 primes not exceeding 7000, the prime numbered 1000 overall is the 100 th one in the list above.

4.  Verifying the last candidate  
    • 7919 is itself prime: every prime ≤√7919 (that is, ≤89) fails to divide it.  
    • The next integer, 7920, is of course composite (7920 = 2⁴·3²·5·11), so no further prime appears before 7920.

    Consequently π(7919)=1000, and 7919 is the 1000 th prime.

What is the minimum value of this square number?","It's smaller than you think, especially since you have 3, 5, and 7","With three different primes, many numbers can be achieved and it is worth starting smaller to see if smaller squares can be obtained. We then see that 3^3+5^1+7^2=81.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Write  

S = 3^A + 5^B + 7^C ,   A , B , C ∈ ℕ ,   S = k² .  
We have to find the least possible value of k².

Step 1.  Congruences modulo 3  
3^A ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
5 ≡ 2 (mod 3) ⇒ 5^B ≡ 2^B ≡ 2 (B odd) or 1 (B even).  
7 ≡ 1 (mod 3) ⇒ 7^C ≡ 1 (mod 3).

Hence   S ≡ 0 + (2 or 1) + 1 (mod 3).  
If B is even, S ≡ 2 (mod 3), but a perfect square is 0 or 1 (mod 3).  
Therefore B must be odd (the smallest possibility is B = 1) and then  
S ≡ 0 (mod 3) , so k is a multiple of 3.

Step 2.  Congruences modulo 4  
3 ≡ 3 (mod 4) so 3^A ≡ 3 (A odd) or 1 (A even).  
5 ≡ 1 (mod 4) so 5^B ≡ 1.  
7 ≡ 3 (mod 4) so 7^C ≡ 3 (C odd) or 1 (C even).

Thus  

S ≡ 3^A + 1 + 3^C (mod 4)  
  =  3 (A odd) + 1 + 3 (C odd)  = 3  (mod 4)  
  =  3 (A odd) + 1 + 1 (C even) = 1  (mod 4)  
  =  1 (A even)+ 1 + 3 (C odd)  = 1  (mod 4)  
  =  1 (A even)+ 1 + 1 (C even) = 3  (mod 4).

A perfect square is 0 or 1 (mod 4); therefore exactly one of A,C is odd and the other even.

Summary of the two necessary conditions
• B is odd  (take the least, B = 1).  
• A and C have opposite parity.

Step 3.  Size bounds  
With B = 1 we already have 5 in the sum.  
If A ≥ 4 then 3^A ≥ 81, and S ≥ 81 + 5 > 81.  
Similarly, if C ≥ 3 then 7^C ≥ 343, and S > 81.  
So, to have any chance of getting a square not exceeding 81 we must have  

A ∈ {1,2,3} , C ∈ {1,2}.

Step 4.  Exhaust the few remaining possibilities  
  
Parity condition forces the pairs (A,C) to be  
(1,2) , (2,1) , (3,2).

Compute S for each (with B = 1):

(A,C) = (1,2):  S = 3 + 5 + 49 = 57  (not a square)  
(A,C) = (2,1):  S = 9 + 5 + 7  = 21  (not a square)  
(A,C) = (3,2):  S = 27 + 5 + 49 = 81 = 9².

No other (A,C) pair can yield a smaller S, and any larger A or C makes S > 81. Hence 81 is the smallest square attainable.

Therefore the minimum value of 3^A + 5^B + 7^C when it is a perfect square is 81.

(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186
(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186
Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.

 Since 19s ≤ 186, 1 ≤ s ≤ 9.  
 Check each s; only s = 4 works:

 s = 4 ⇒ 19·4 = 76 ⇒ 7l + 8x = 110  
 x ≡ 110 (mod 7) ⇒ x ≡ 5 (mod 7) ⇒ x = 5 + 7k  
 7l = 110 – 8x = 110 – 8(5 + 7k) = 70 – 56k ⇒ l = 10 – 8k

Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.
Jerry","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,,True,0,0
95,"What three-digit number when doubled is, by value, one more than the value of the same three digits when reversed?

397.
397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.
102?  Is 204 = 201 + 1?  No.
103?  Is 206 = 301 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds even.]
396?  Is 792 = 693 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds again.]
The answer given is the only one that passes.
As for extra points, an infinite number of 9's can be added between the 3 and the 7 without spoiling the major characteristics.

a, b, c respectively.  
Then  
N = 100a + 10b + c  (1)  
Its reversal is 100c + 10b + a.  

According to the problem: doubling N exceeds its reversal by exactly 1:

2N = (reversal) + 1.                                          (2)

Insert (1) into (2):

2(100a + 10b + c) = 100c + 10b + a + 1  
200a + 20b + 2c = 100c + 10b + a + 1.  

Gather like terms on one side:

199a + 10b – 98c = 1.                                         (3)

Because a, b, c are digits (a ∈ {1,…,9}, b,c ∈ {0,…,9}), (3) must hold in integers.

Step 1.  Work mod 10 to eliminate b.

Since 10b ≡ 0 (mod 10), reduce (3):

199a – 98c ≡ 1 (mod 10).  

But 199 ≡ –1 and  –98 ≡ 2  (mod 10), so

(–1)a + 2c ≡ 1  (mod 10)

 ⇒ a – 2c ≡ 9 (mod 10).                                   (4)

For each possible c (0–9) equation (4) yields the corresponding a:

c  : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  
a  : 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7

Step 2.  Determine b from (3).

Rewrite (3): 10b = 1 – 199a + 98c.                         (5)

Substitute each (a,c) pair from the table into (5); the right–hand side must be a multiple of 10 and lie between 0 and 90 (because b is a single digit).

The computations:

c  a     RHS of (5)       b

9  7    –510            –51   (invalid)

Only the pair (a, c) = (3, 7) yields an admissible digit b = 9.

Hence
a = 3, b = 9, c = 7,

so the required three-digit number is

N = 100·3 + 10·9 + 7 = 397.

2·397 = 794, the reversal of 397 is 793, and 794 = 793 + 1. All conditions are satisfied.

Put x=√2 in (1):

so √2 is an attracting fixed point.  
For any A_0 > 0 (and for every negative A_0 except –1) the iteration
remains defined and is quickly drawn into the neighbourhood of √2.

  Since 3a ≡ 0, we need 7b ≡ b ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ b is a multiple of 3.

(ii) “Divisible by 7’’ means 3a + 7b ≡ 0 (mod 7).  
  Because 7b ≡ 0, we need 3a ≡ 0 (mod 7).  
  As 3 is coprime to 7, a ≡ 0 (mod 7) ⇒ a is a multiple of 7.  
  Write a = 7k (k ≥ 0).

Hence  

 digital sum = 3a + 7b = 3·7k + 7·3m = 21(k + m).

So the digital sum is always a multiple of 21.

After 100 passes, where you toggle only locker #100, how many lockers are open?",Think about this can be related to the number of factors of each number,"Answer: 10 lockers are left open:
Lockers #1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.

The only way a locker could be left open is if it is toggled an odd number of times. The only numbers with an odd number of factors are the perfect
squares. Thus, the perfect squares are left open.

Consequently, locker k is toggled precisely d(k) times, where d(k) is the number of positive divisors of k.

• The lockers all start closed.  
• After the first pass they are open.  
• Each further toggle reverses the present state.  
Therefore a locker is open at the end if and only if it has been toggled an odd number of times.

When does d(k) equal an odd number?  
Divisors normally come in complementary pairs (e.g., for 12: 1×12, 2×6, 3×4).  
The only time a divisor is paired with itself is when k is a perfect square (e.g., 36 = 6×6).  
That lone unpaired divisor makes d(k) odd exactly for perfect squares and even for all other integers.

• 94 coins are omitted once (so they are flipped 15 times),  
• 6 coins are omitted three times (so they are flipped 13 times).

Because  
     94·1 + 6·3 = 94 + 18 = 112 = 16·7,  
such a design is possible; an explicit one is given below.

Label the coins 1,…,100 and call 95,…,100 the six “special” coins.
The 16 exclusion sets are

 1 {  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6, 95}
 2 {  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 96}
 3 { 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 97}
 4 { 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 98}
 5 { 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 99}
 6 { 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,100}
 7 { 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 95, 96}
 8 { 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 97, 98}
 9 { 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 99}
10 { 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58,100}
11 { 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 95}
12 { 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 96}
13 { 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 97}
14 { 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 98}
15 { 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 99}
16 { 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94,100}

• Each of the six special coins (95–100) appears in exactly 3 of the sets.  
  Thus each is flipped 13 times (odd).  
• Every other coin appears in exactly one set, hence is flipped 15 times (odd).  
• Every set has size 7, so every move flips 93 coins.

Therefore after these 16 moves every coin has been flipped an odd number
of times, so all of them show tails.  Because 16 is the least even k
satisfying 7k ≥ 100, it is indeed minimal.

What is that number?","-1 mod LCM(2, 3, 4, ..., 8, 9)","-1 mod LCM(2, 3, 4, ..., 8, 9) = 2519",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let n be the required number (< 3000).  
The conditions state

n ≡ 1 (mod 2)  
n ≡ 2 (mod 3)  
n ≡ 3 (mod 4)  
⋯  
n ≡ 8 (mod 9).

Each congruence can be rewritten as n ≡ −1 (mod k) for k = 2,…,9, because k−1 ≡ −1 (mod k).  
Hence

n + 1 ≡ 0 (mod k) for every k = 2,3,…,9.

Thus n + 1 must be a common multiple of all the integers 2 through 9.  
The smallest such number is their least common multiple.

Compute the least common multiple L:

2 = 2  
3 = 3  
4 = 2²  
5 = 5  
6 = 2·3  
7 = 7  
8 = 2³  
9 = 3²

Take the highest power of each prime that appears:

2³, 3², 5¹, 7¹.

Therefore  
L = 2³ · 3² · 5 · 7 = 8 · 9 · 5 · 7 = 72 · 5 · 7 = 360 · 7 = 2520.

So n + 1 must be a multiple of 2520: n + 1 = 2520m for some positive integer m.

Because n < 3000, we have 2520m − 1 < 3000 ⇒ 2520m < 3001 ⇒ m < 3001/2520 ≈ 1.19.  
The only positive integer m that satisfies this inequality is m = 1.

Hence  
n + 1 = 2520(1) ⇒ n = 2520 − 1 = 2519.

Verification:

2519 ÷ 2 leaves remainder 1,  
2519 ÷ 3 leaves remainder 2,  
2519 ÷ 4 leaves remainder 3,  
…,  
2519 ÷ 9 leaves remainder 8,

because 2520 is exactly divisible by every divisor 2 through 9.

Therefore the unique number less than 3000 satisfying all the given conditions is 2519.

Each year, the birth rate is 4% of the population at the beginning of the year, and the death rate is 3% of the population at the beginning of the year.  The resulting births and deaths are truncated to a whole number.  These rates are constant.  For example, consider a population of 99 people at the start of a year.  A 4% birth rate would be 3.96, truncated to 3 births during the year.  A 3% death rate would be 2.97, truncated to 2 deaths during the year.  The population at the end of that year would be 99 + 3 - 2 = 100.  Based on the stated birth and death rates, what is the LAST year that the population increases by only 1?",Incrementally add before either the birth rate changes or the death rate changes; no real shortcut,"The last year the population would increase by only one would be the 61st year.
1) Beginning with the 1st year, the number of births will be 4 (4% of 100 = 4) and the number of deaths will be 3 (3% of 100 = 3), which results in a population increase of 1.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year for 25 years, reaching 125 at the end of the 25th year.
2) Beginning with the 26th year, the number of births per year will increase to 5 (4% of 125 = 5), while the deaths will still be 3.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 135 at the end of the 30th year.
3) Beginning with the 31st year, the number of deaths per year will increase to 4 (3% of 135 = 4.05), while the births will still be 5.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year, reaching 150 at the end of the 45th year.
4) Beginning with the 46th year, the number of births per year will increase to 6 (4% of 150 = 6), while the deaths will still be 4.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 168 at the end of the 54th year.

Births  = ⌊0.04 P⌋     
Deaths = ⌊0.03 P⌋

Hence the net change in one year is  

Δ(P) = ⌊0.04 P⌋ – ⌊0.03 P⌋.               (1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  When is the change exactly 1 ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Write P = 100 + k  with 0 ≤ k ≤ 99 (we shall soon see that no larger
population can give Δ = 1).

0.04 P = 4 + 0.04 k ,     0.03 P = 3 + 0.03 k .

Therefore

Δ(P) = (4 + ⌊0.04 k⌋) – (3 + ⌊0.03 k⌋)
      = 1 + ⌊4k/100⌋ – ⌊3k/100⌋.                         (2)

Because k ≤ 99, the two floors in (2) can take only the values

⌊4k/100⌋ = 0,1,2,3 ,  ⌊3k/100⌋ = 0,1,2 .

For Δ(P)=1 we need the two floors to be equal, i.e.

⌊4k/100⌋ = ⌊3k/100⌋.                                   (3)

Inspecting the three possible values of ⌊3k/100⌋ :

• If ⌊3k/100⌋ = 0  ( 0 ≤ k ≤ 33 ), equation (3) forces k ≤ 24.  
  Thus k = 0 … 24  →  P = 100 … 124.

• If ⌊3k/100⌋ = 1  ( 34 ≤ k ≤ 66 ), equation (3) forces k ≤ 49.  
  Thus k = 34 … 49 →  P = 134 … 149.

• If ⌊3k/100⌋ = 2  ( 67 ≤ k ≤ 99 ), equation (3) forces k ≤ 74.  
  Thus k = 67 … 74 →  P = 167 … 174.

Hence                                   (4)

  Δ(P)=1  iff  P ∈ {100–124, 134–149, 167–174}.

For P ≥ 175 the two floors in (2) differ by at least 1, so Δ(P) ≥ 2; in
particular once P reaches 175 the increment is never again 1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  How does the deterministic population evolve from 100 upward?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Start with P₀ = 100.

A.  P = 100–124: by (4) the increase is 1 each year.  
    25 consecutive years take the population from 100 to 125.

B.  P = 125–133: here ⌊4k/100⌋–⌊3k/100⌋ = 1, so Δ(P)=2.  
    Starting at 125 the population jumps 2 each year:
    125→127→129→131→133→135   (5 years).

C.  P = 135–149: again in the set (4); 15 years of +1 carry the
    population from 135 to 150.

D.  P = 150–166: as in Part B, every year adds 2.
    150→152→154→156→158→160→162→164→166→168  (9 years).

E.  P = 168–174: once more in the set (4); 7 consecutive +1 years move
    the colony from 168 to 175.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Counting the years
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Years with +1 in A : 25  
Years with +2 in B :  5  
Years with +1 in C : 15  
Years with +2 in D :  9  
Years with +1 in E :  7  
---------------------------------
Total years elapsed = 25+5+15+9+7 = 61.

The final year listed (Year 61) begins with P = 174 and ends with
P = 175; thereafter Δ(P) ≥ 2 forever.

""You know what occurred to me the other day, Cal?"" asked Professor Gebra.
""What's that?"" said Professor Culus.
""Well, when we met, the square of your age contained the same three digits as the square of my age, just in a different order,"" Professor Gebra continued.
""This will really blow your socks off then, Al! If you take the square of the sum of our ages when we met and split it into two 2-digit numbers, you'd have my age then and your age now!"" Professor Culus exclaimed.
Wanting to impress his professor, Theo interjected.
""I thought you were much younger than that, Professor Gebra,"" Theo said.

""Right you are! And how did you figure that out so quickly?"" Professor Gebra asked.
""You said the square of your ages when you and Professor Culus met had only three digits, so the oldest you could have been was 31. That means that there were only a few possible ages the two of you could have been. Those being (with the associated squares):

a  = Professor Gebra’s age when the two men first met,  
c  = Professor Culus’ age when they first met,  
A = Professor Gebra’s present age,

n = the number of years that have passed since they met.  

Thus A = a + n and C = c + n.

────────────────────────────────────────────
1.  “When we met the square of your age contained the same three digits as the square of my age …”
────────────────────────────────────────────
Therefore the two squares a² and c² are 3-digit numbers that are permutations of the same three digits.

The only ages whose squares are 3-digit numbers are 10 – 31, and their squares are  

10²=100, 11²=121, 12²=144, 13²=169, 14²=196, 15²=225,  
16²=256, 17²=289, 18²=324, 19²=361, 20²=400, 21²=441,

28²=784, 29²=841, 30²=900, 31²=961.

Grouping those squares by their digit–multisets gives the only repeated sets  

{169, 196, 961} (ages 13, 14, 31)  
{256, 625}   (ages 16, 25).

Hence the possible unordered pairs {a,c} are  
{13,14}, {13,31}, {14,31}, {16,25}.

────────────────────────────────────────────
2.  “If you take the square of the sum of our ages when we met and split it into two 2-digit numbers, you’d have my age then and your age now.”
────────────────────────────────────────────
Because it is split into two 2-digit numbers, (a + c)² must be a 4-digit number, say XYZW, which we read as the pair (XY , ZW).  
Thus either  

(XY , ZW) = (c , A) or (XY , ZW) = (A , c).

Test each candidate pair:

a = 13, c = 14   ⇒ (a+c)=27, (a+c)²=729  (only 3 digits)   Impossible.  
a = 13, c = 31   ⇒ (a+c)=44, (a+c)²=1936 → (19,36) (or 36,19) ≠ (c,A).  
a = 14, c = 31   ⇒ (a+c)=45, (a+c)²=2025 → (20,25) (or 25,20) ≠ (c,A).

a = 25, c = 16   ⇒ (a+c)=41, (a+c)²=1681 → (16,81).

This last attempt works perfectly:
• The first 2-digit number 16 equals c (Professor Culus’ age then).  
• The second 2-digit number 81 must therefore be A, Professor Gebra’s age now.

Hence a = 25, c = 16, n = A − a = 81 − 25 = 56.
So the professors met 56 years ago; their present ages are

Professor Gebra:  A = 81 years old,  
Professor Culus:  C = c + n = 16 + 56 = 72 years old.

All stated conditions are satisfied, and no other candidate pair survives the tests, so the solution is unique.

Kurt handed her the last he had.  She bit in, and her face lit up like a newly-coined metaphor.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""Rod and I were about to go order some more.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""  Patty's blank look bade him explain.

That's 30% for Kurt and 33-1/3% for Patty.
Method:
Let K, P, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, K+P+R.
Now, since Kurt's percentage equals Patty's quantity, we get
100*K/T = P.
Similarly,
100*P/T = R plus a fraction.  Now, look at the common factor, 100/T.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
K*F = P and P*F = R (plus a fraction),

Regardless of which direction the tiger moves around the circle, you swim the other way, always keeping the rock between you and the tiger.  While you are doing this you will be able to move outward, since you will have some energy to spare.
Before long you will be 1/4 of the radius away from the center and the tiger will be 180 degrees away. At this point swim straight to the point on the shore furthest from the tiger. You will be able to get there in 3/4 units of time, while it will take the tiger pi/4 =~ 0.7854 units of time.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the lake have radius R = 1 and let the man’s swimming speed be v;  
the tiger, confined to the rim, runs with speed 4v.

Step 1.  Get inside a “control circle”.  
Swim straight out from the centre O until you are on the circle C₀ of radius  

        r₀ = ¼ R = ¼ .  

Step 2.  Make the tiger go to the opposite side.  
From now on keep your distance from O a little ​smaller​ than r₀ – say r = r₀ – ε
with some tiny ε > 0 – and swim round this small circle.

• Your angular speed around O is   ω_m = v / r .  
• The tiger’s maximum angular speed is   ω_t = (4v) / R = 4v .

Because r < ¼, we have ω_m = v / r > v /(¼) = 4v = ω_t.  
Hence you can increase the angular separation between you and the tiger as much as you wish.  
Continue circling until the tiger is diametrically opposite you (angle difference π).

Step 3.  Slide out to the “escape circle”.  
Swim radially outward the tiny distance ε to reach exactly radius r₀ = ¼.
This takes time ε / v; during it the tiger can turn through at most
ω_t · (ε / v) = 4v · (ε / v) = 4ε rad < 0.3 rad (for, say, ε = 0.02),
so the separation is still practically π.

Step 4.  Dash for the shore.  
From radius ¼ you are 1 – ¼ = ¾ from the lake’s edge along the radius through you.
Swim straight to that point B on the shore.

Time you need: T_m = (1 – ¼) / v = ¾ / v.

While you do this, the tiger must run along the rim from the opposite point to B,
an arc of length πR = π.

Time the tiger needs: T_t = π / (4v).

Compare the two times:

  T_m = 0.75 / v  and  T_t = π / (4v) ≈ 0.7854 / v.

Since T_m < T_t, you reach the bank a small but positive interval before the tiger.

Conclusion.  
By first orbiting within r < ¼ to force the tiger to the far side, then moving
out to radius ¼ and making the final straight swim, you always arrive at the
shore sooner than the tiger can reach the same point.  Therefore you escape.",True,1,0

All transfers must be integral.

Step-by-step effect of the gifts  

1. Mike: gives ½ of N, so N must be even and the remainder is  
   N·(1 – ½) = N/2.

2. Paul: gives ⅓ of what is left, so N/2 must be divisible by 3.  
   Remainder: (N/2)·(1 – ⅓) = N/3.

3. Dave: gives ¼ of what is left, so N/3 must be divisible by 4.  
   Remainder: (N/3)·(1 – ¼) = N/4.

Continuing in this way, after the kth friend (whose fraction is 1/(k+1)) the
remainder is N/(k+1).  
Therefore after the ninth friend (Will, who takes 1/10) the marbles left in
the bag are N/10.

Divisibility requirements  

For every step the amount just before the gift must be divisible by the
denominator of that step:

N divisible by 2                           (for Mike)  
N divisible by 2·3   = 6                   (for Paul)  
N divisible by 3·4   = 12                  (for Dave)  
N divisible by 4·5   = 20                  (for Bert)  
N divisible by 5·6   = 30                  (for Kyle)  
N divisible by 6·7   = 42                  (for Andy)  
N divisible by 7·8   = 56                  (for Rick)  
N divisible by 8·9   = 72                  (for Fred)  
N divisible by 9·10  = 90                  (for Will)

Hence N must be a multiple of the least common multiple of
2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, and 90.

Compute the LCM  

Prime factorizations:

2 = 2  
6 = 2·3  
12 = 2²·3  
20 = 2²·5  
30 = 2·3·5  
42 = 2·3·7  
56 = 2³·7  
72 = 2³·3²  
90 = 2·3²·5

Take the highest power of each prime appearing:

2³, 3², 5¹, 7¹.

LCM = 2³ · 3² · 5 · 7 = 8 · 9 · 5 · 7 = 72 · 35 = 2520.

Thus the smallest possible initial number of marbles is N = 2520.

Marbles left at the end  

Justin’s final amount is N/10 = 2520/10 = 252.

No smaller positive remainder is possible, because any allowable initial
number must be a multiple of 2520 and the remainder is always one-tenth of
that multiple.

After a while, they got bored with this, so Arnold decided to place a bet. He would ask Will one teaser, which he thought was very hard. If Will got it right, Arnold would clean his room for the rest of the year. However, if Will got it WRONG, he would have to clean Arnold's room for a year and do his dishes for a month. After thinking for a while, Will agreed to this. This was Arnold's teaser:
Use each digit 1-9 only once each, so that one number multiplied by another equals the third. One example is 12*483=5796. Name at least one more!!!

27 × 198 = 5346.

Reasoning (without any exhaustive computer search):

1.  A convenient way to use all nine digits once is to look for a
   2-digit number · 3-digit number = 4-digit number,
   because 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 digits altogether.

2.  Let the 2-digit factor be 27.  
    • 27 already contains the distinct digits 2 and 7.  
    • Being a multiple of 9, it guarantees that the product is a multiple of 9, which
      will help to keep the digit-sum conditions consistent (the sum of the digits
      1–9 is 45, a multiple of 9).

3.  The digits left for the 3-digit factor and the product are
   {1,3,4,5,6,8,9}.  Choose the 3-digit factor 198 (digits 1,9,8);
   198 is also a multiple of 9, so the overall product will be a multiple of 81,
   matching the divisibility pattern just noted.

4.  Compute the product mentally:
       27 × 200 = 5400  
       27 ×   2 =   54  
       5400 – 54 = 5346.

5.  Check the digits:

   • Factors: 27 gives 2,7; 198 gives 1,9,8.  
   • Product: 5346 gives 5,3,4,6.

   The nine digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 each appear exactly once,
   with no repetition or omission.

108,"In the equation FORTY+TEN+TEN=SIXTY, each letter represents a different digit. Can you figure out which letter is which digit?",Start from the last digits.,"First, there are ten different letters in this equation: E, F, I, N, O, R, S, T, X, Y. Therefore, every digit from 0 to 9 is used.
Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.
If T=8, then R=X+3, we can have R=6, X=3, or R=7, X=4.
If R=6, X=3, the remaining digits are 2, 4, 7, and again we can't choose S=F+1.
If R=7, X=4, the remaining digits are 2, 3, 6, where 3=2+1. Hence S=3, F=2.
Finally, the remaining digit 6 is for Y.
Therefore, the equation is 29786+850+850=31486.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the carries from the units, tens, hundreds and thousands columns be

        +     T E N

          S I X T Y  

and working from right to left gives the following four equations.

1.  Units: Y + N + N = Y + 10 c₁ ⇒ 2N = 10 c₁.  
   Hence 2N is a multiple of 10, so N = 0 or 5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE 1   (N = 5)  
Then c₁ = 1 and the tens–column equation is  

2.  Tens: T + E + E + 1 = T + 10 c₂ ⇒ 2E + 1 is a multiple of 10.  
   The only possibility (with E a digit) would be 2E + 1 = 10, giving E = 4½, impossible.  
Therefore N ≠ 5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE 2   (N = 0)  
Now c₁ = 0 and the tens–column equation becomes  

  T + E + E = T + 10 c₂  ⇒ 2E = 10 c₂.  

Because 2E ≤ 18, the only solution is E = 5 and c₂ = 1.

So far we have N = 0, E = 5, c₁ = 0, c₂ = 1, and all digits F,O,R,T,Y,S,I,X are still free.

3.  Hundreds: R + T + T + c₂ = X + 10 c₃  
  ⇒ R + 2T + 1 = X + 10 c₃.  (∗)

4.  Thousands: O + c₃ = I + 10 c₄.  (†)

5.  Ten-thousands: F + c₄ = S.  (‡)

Because F and S must be different digits, equation (‡) forces c₄ = 1  
( if c₄ were 0, then S = F, impossible).  
Hence c₃ ≥ 1 (otherwise c₄ would be 0 in (†)), so c₃ = 1 or 2.

• If c₃ = 1 then (†) gives O + 1 = I, but O + 1 ≤ 10.  
   When O + 1 = 10 we get I = 0, clashing with N = 0.  
   When O + 1 ≤ 9 we would have c₄ = 0, contradiction.  
   Therefore c₃ ≠ 1.

Thus c₃ = 2.  
Now (†) gives O + 2 = I + 10 ⇒ I = O + 2 − 10 = O − 8,  
so O must be 9 and I = 1.  
Equation (‡) becomes F + 1 = S, with F ≠ 0.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Solving the hundreds column (∗) with c₃ = 2:

  R + 2T + 1 = X + 20 ⇒ X = R + 2T − 19,

T = 8  ⇒ 2T = 16  
 • R = 6  ⇒  R + 2T = 22,  X = 3  (all digits distinct)  
 • R = 7  ⇒  R + 2T = 23,  X = 4  (all digits distinct)

T = 7  ⇒ 2T = 14  
 • R = 8  ⇒  R + 2T = 22,  X = 3  (all digits distinct)

All other choices violate 19 ≤ R + 2T ≤ 28 or repeat a digit.  
Examine each surviving possibility against F + 1 = S:

1) T = 8, R = 6, X = 3 uses digits {0,1,3,5,6,8,9}.  
   The consecutive unused pair needed for (F,S) would have to be  
   (2,3), (4,5), (6,7), (7,8) or (8,9); none is free, so impossible.

2) T = 8, R = 7, X = 4 uses digits {0,1,4,5,7,8,9}.  
   The free digits are {2,3,6}.  The consecutive pair (2,3) is free,

3) T = 7, R = 8, X = 3 uses digits {0,1,3,5,7,8,9}.  
   The free digits are {2,4,6}.  No consecutive free pair exists, so impossible.

                        ∑k² = 204).

Hence  

(2)  f² = 9x² + 72xd + 204d² .

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Separate a complete square

Set  

 y = 3x + 12d.                         ( so that (3) becomes f² = y² + 60d² )

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Use the difference of two squares
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Equation (3) gives  

 f² – y² = 60d² ⇔ (f – y)(f + y) = 60d² .       (4)

Because f and y are integers of the same parity, write  

 f – y = 2a , f + y = 2b  (a, b positive integers).

Then (4) becomes  

(5)  ab = 15d² ,  b > a ,

and

(6)  y = b – a = 3x + 12d .

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Restrict a by means of (6)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
From (6)  b – a ≥ 12d ⇒ b ≥ 12d .

Hence, using (5):

 15d² = ab ≥ a·12d ⇒ a ≤ (15/12)d = (5/4)d .                (7)

So a is a divisor of 15d² that does not exceed 5d/4.  
For d ≥ 4 we have 5d/4 < d, while every divisor of 15d² that is ≤ d
is 1, 3 or 5.  Relation (6) then forces

 b – a ≥ 12d ≥ 48 ,

but with a ∈ {1,3,5} this makes b = 15d² /a far too large and
b – a far from a multiple of 3, so no solution exists for d ≥ 4.

Thus we need only inspect d = 1, 2, 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Test the admissible values of d
--------------------------------------------------------------------
•  d = 1 ⇒ 15d² = 15 ;  possible (a, b) pairs (1,15) or (3,5).  
   In either case b – a is 14 or 2, neither of which satisfies (6)    
   (because 3x + 12d must be ≡ 0 (mod 3)).  No solution.

•  d = 2 ⇒ 15d² = 60 ;  divisor pairs give b – a = 59, 28, 17, 11, 7, 4.  
   Again none satisfies (6).  No solution.

•  d = 3 ⇒ 15d² = 135 .  The admissible a ≤ 5d/4 = 3.75 are a = 1 or 3.
   –  a = 1 ⇒ b = 135, b – a = 134 (≡ 2 mod 3) – impossible.  
   –  a = 3 ⇒ b = 45,   b – a = 42.

   Now (6): 42 = 3x + 12·3 ⇒ 3x = 42 – 36 = 6 ⇒ x = 2.

Thus d = 3 and x = 2 satisfy every condition.

111,"Mad Ade was visiting his friend, computer tycoon and Olympic Kebab hurling champion, Mike Rohsopht.

""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Mike assured Mad Ade that his treasured Arthur Minit clock had not been adjusted nor fixed since his last visit.
What day of the week was Mad Ade's second visit?",It must lose some multiple of 12 hours in total,"The answer is 17 days and 3 hours later, which would have been a Wednesday.

In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.
Since the clock was not adjusted since the last visit, it's also possible that the radio time shifted by one hour due to a change to or from summer daylight saving time.  However, it turns out that the only additional possibilities that need to be considered are those of 4 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 12 hours 57 minutes, and 29 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 3 days 10 hours 57 minutes.

         E  = – 3 – 7h  minutes.                         (1)

3.  The clock will look “dead right’’ when its hands point to the same
   position as the correct clock.  
   For an ordinary 12-hour dial that occurs whenever the error differs
   from 0 by an integral number of complete 12-hour revolutions
   (720 minutes).  
   Thus we need

         – 3 – 7h  = – 720k          (k a positive integer).         (2)

   Rearranging gives  

         3 + 7h  = 720k.                                   (3)

4.  Because gcd(7, 720)=1, (3) has an integer solution h iff 3 is congruent
   to –7h mod 720.  
   Solving 7h ≡ –3 (mod 720) gives h ≡ 411 (mod 720), because
   7·103 = 721 ≡ 1 (mod 720) and −3·103 ≡ 411 (mod 720).

   The smallest positive solution is therefore  

         h = 411 hours.

H = volume‐flow rate of the hot line when it is fully open (a constant),  
θ = degrees through which the cold handle is turned (0° ≤ θ ≤ 360°).

Assumption (standard for this type of exercise)  
• The flow delivered by a faucet is proportional to the angle through which the handle is turned.  
Hence the cold–water flow is  

C = (θ / 360°) · H.              (1)

With both streams entering a perfectly mixed shower head, the exit temperature T is the flow-weighted average

T = (H · 105°F + C · 45°F) / (H + C).      (2)

Insert (1) into (2).  Writing r = C/H = θ/360°,

T = (105 + 45r) / (1 + r).                 (3)

We want T = 98.6 °F:

Put

 P = ab   (the three–digit product, which must be the reversal of S : P = 100 u + 10 t + h).

1.  A useful inequality  
   Because P = ab ≤ 999, we have a ≤ √999 < 32; hence a ≤ 31.

2.  Relating P – S to the digits  
   The difference of the product and the sum can be written in two ways:
   
   P – S = ab – (a + b) = (a – 1)(b – 1) – 1,                             (1)  
   while, using S and its reversal P,

3.  Factoring each possibility under the constraint a ≤ 31  
   We need a – 1 ≤ 30, so we look, in list (4), for numbers admitting a factor not exceeding 30.

   • 100 = 1·100 = 2·50 = 4·25 = 5·20 = 10·10

     (small factors 1,2,4,8,16 – admissible)

   Let us examine the two admissible numbers 100 and 496.

   a)  (a – 1)(b – 1) = 100  
       Pairs: (2,101), (3,51), (5,26), (6,21), (11,11).  
       Only (2,101) gives a three–digit S (=103), but its reversal is 301 ≠ P (=202). Hence no solution.

       Pairs: (2,497), (3,249), (5,125), (9,63), (17,32).  
       Of these, only (2,497) keeps P three–digit (P = 994) and S three–digit (S = 499).  
       Check: reverse(499) = 994 indeed equals P.  
       All other pairs make S two–digit or P four–digit.

4.  Verification  
 a = 2, b = 497  
 a + b = 499, ab = 994, and 994 is the exact reversal of 499.

5.  Uniqueness

The next three being 836, 4030 and 5830.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"A positive integer n is weird when  

(1) it is abundant:  σ(n) – n  > 0  (σ denotes the sum-of-divisors function), and  
(2) n is not pseudoperfect: no selection of its proper divisors adds to n.

We must locate the smallest n that satisfies both properties.

Step 1 –  List all abundant numbers below 70  
A number that is not abundant certainly cannot be weird, so we restrict attention to abundant numbers < 70.  
A quick divisor–sum computation gives

12, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 66.  

(Every other integer below 70 is either perfect or deficient.)

Step 2 –  Show every one of these is pseudoperfect  
For each of the thirteen candidates we exhibit a subset of its proper divisors whose sum equals the number itself:

• 12 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6  
• 18 = 9 + 6 + 3  
• 20 = 10 + 5 + 4 + 1  
• 24 = 12 + 8 + 4  
• 30 = 15 + 10 + 3 + 2  
• 36 = 18 + 9 + 6 + 3  
• 40 = 20 + 10 + 8 + 2  
• 42 = 21 + 14 + 7  
• 48 = 24 + 16 + 8  
• 54 = 27 + 18 + 9  
• 56 = 28 + 14 + 8 + 4 + 2  
• 60 = 30 + 15 + 10 + 5  
• 66 = 33 + 22 + 11  

Because each abundant number < 70 is pseudoperfect, none of them is weird.

Step 3 –  Examine 70  
The proper divisors of 70 = 2·5·7 are  

1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35.  

Sum of proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 14 + 35 = 74 > 70.  
Hence 70 is abundant.

Now demonstrate that 70 is not pseudoperfect.

• Suppose a subset of the seven proper divisors summed to 70.  
  – If 35 were included, the remaining divisors would have to total another 35.  
    But among {1,2,5,7,10,14} no combination sums to 35  
    (the largest possible sum of any sub-collection of these six numbers is  
     14 + 10 + 7 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 39, while trying to hit 35 gives only 31, 32, 33, 34 or 36).  
    Therefore 35 cannot be part of the required subset.  
  – If 35 is excluded, the greatest total we could reach is again  
    1 + 2 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 14 = 39, far short of 70.  

Hence no subset of the proper divisors of 70 adds to 70, so 70 fails to be pseudoperfect.

Conclusion  
70 is abundant and not pseudoperfect, i.e. 70 is weird, while every smaller positive integer is either deficient, perfect, or (if abundant) pseudoperfect. Therefore 70 is the first number that is genuinely weird.

Hence:

new pieces created by the (k th) cut  =  (number of existing cuts it meets) + 1.

• each pair of cuts must intersect,
• no three cuts should pass through the same interior point,

4. DE ≡ 0 (mod 5)     8. HI ≡ 0 (mod 9)

Step-by-step deductions  

(1) AB divisible by 2 ⇒ B is even: B ∈ {2,4,6,8}.  

(4) DE divisible by 5 and the digits are 1–9 ⇒ E = 5.  

(5) EF divisible by 6 (i.e., by 2 and 3).  
 • F must be even.  
 • (E + F) ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ (5 + F) ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ F = 4.  

Thus E = 5, F = 4.

(6) FG divisible by 7 with F = 4.  
Two–digit multiples of 7 beginning with a 4 are 42 and 49, giving  

 FG = 42 (G = 2) or FG = 49 (G = 9).

(7) GH divisible by 8.  
 • If G = 2, the only multiple of 8 whose tens digit is 2 is 24, but H would then be 4, already used.  
 • Therefore G = 9.  The multiple 96 (= 12·8) fits, so GH = 96 and H = 6.

(8) HI divisible by 9 with H = 6.

Let c₁, c₂, c₃ be the carries from the units, tens, and hundreds columns respectively.

Units:   R·S = L + 10 c₁                         (2)  
Tens:    A·S + c₁ = I + 10 c₂                    (3)  
Hundreds:I·S + c₂ = A + 10 c₃                   (4)  
Thousands:L·S + c₃ = R     (no further carry)   (5)

Because (5) produces no carry, L·S + c₃ < 10.  
Since S ≥ 2 (otherwise the product cannot change the order) we must have L ≤ 4; for L = 5 the left side is already ≥ 10.

––––––––––––––––––––––––
1.  L = 1

Equation (2) requires R·S ≡ 1 (mod 10).  
With digits 1–9 this allows (R,S) = (3,7), (7,3), (9,9).

• (R,S) = (3,7): then from (5) R = S + c₃ = 7 + c₃ < 10 ⇒ impossible.  
• (R,S) = (9,9): R and S would be the same digit (forbidden).  
Therefore L = 1 gives no solution.

––––––––––––––––––––––––
2.  L = 2

Because of L·S + c₃ < 10, only S = 2,3,4 are possible.  
But S = 2 duplicates L, so consider:

a)  S = 3.  
   From (2) R·3 ≡ 2 (mod 10) ⇒ (R,S) = (4,3).  
   Then (5): R = 2·3 + c₃ = 6 + c₃ ⇒ R = 4 gives c₃ = –2 (impossible).

b)  S = 4.  
   From (2) R·4 ≡ 2 (mod 10) ⇒ (R,S) = (8,4).  
   Here R = 8, S = 4, and (5) gives c₃ = 0 (since 2·4 = 8).

   With L = 2, S = 4, R = 8, c₁ is obtained from (2): 8·4 = 32 ⇒ c₁ = 3.

   Solve (3)–(4) for A, I, c₂.

        4A + 3 = I + 10 c₂                  (3′)
        4I + c₂ = A                         (4′)   (because c₃ = 0)

   Substitute A from (4′) into (3′):

        4(4I + c₂) + 3 = I + 10 c₂
        16I + 4c₂ + 3 = I + 10 c₂
        15I = 6c₂ − 3
        5I = 2c₂ − 1.

   The only digit solution (I, c₂) with 0 ≤ c₂ ≤ 9 is I = 1, c₂ = 3.
   Then A = 4·1 + 3 = 7.

   All digits obtained:  L = 2, I = 1, A = 7, R = 8, S = 4; all distinct.

   10x + 9.

3. According to the problem, the first new number is four times the second:

The least common multiple of 242=2*11^2, 160=2^5*5, 64=2^6 and 22=2*11 is 2^6*5*11^2=38720.
38720/242=160.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the wheels be  

A : 242 teeth (the largest)  
B : 160 teeth  
C : 64 teeth  
D : 22 teeth  

A is in mesh with B, B with C, and C with D.

1.  Gear-train relations  
   When two gears mesh, the product (revolutions) × (teeth) is the same for the two wheels, the directions being opposite.  
   Hence, if A makes k revolutions, the numbers of revolutions made by the other wheels are  

        B : –k·242/160  
        C :  k·242/64  
        D : –k·242/22.  

   (A minus sign merely shows the opposite direction; orientation is restored after every whole revolution whatever the sign.)

2.  Condition for every wheel to return to its initial orientation  
   Each of the three fractions above must be an integer.  
   Therefore 242 k must be divisible by 160, by 64, and by 22.

3.  Translate to a single divisibility requirement  
   Let M = lcm(160, 64, 22).  
   Then the required condition is M | 242 k.

   Factorising:  
        160 = 2⁵·5  
         64 = 2⁶  
         22 = 2·11  
   So      M = 2⁶·5·11 = 3520.

4.  Find the least k  
   We need 3520 | 242 k.  Let g = gcd(242, 3520).

        242 = 2·11²  
       3520 = 2⁶·5·11  
        g    = 2·11 = 22.

   Divide out the common factor: 3520 / g = 3520 / 22 = 160.

   Thus the smallest positive integer k satisfying the required divisibilities is  

        k = 160.

5.  Verification  
        242·160 / 160 = 242  (integer)  
        242·160 /  64 = 605  (integer)  
        242·160 /  22 = 1760 (integer)

   Hence after 160 revolutions of the largest cog, wheels B, C and D each complete whole numbers of revolutions (–242, +605 and –1760 respectively) and every wheel is exactly in its starting position.

The fastest way to get everyone across is for B and C to start out on foot and A to start out with the bicycle. At a point y, A will get off the bicycle and walk the rest of the way. Eventually C will get to the bicycle abandoned by A, then ride back to a point x, leaving the bicycle there, then turning around and walk until he reaches the end. Person B will walk until he reaches the bicycle left by C and then ride the rest of the way.
Below are the times that each will take to cross, in terms of x and y:
A: 1*y + 10*(1-y)
B: 5*x + 1*(1-x)
C: 2*y + (y-x) + 2*(1-x)

The only possible walker left would be C, who needs 2 minutes; but to let two men ride the bicycle we would have to make three bicycle–trips (two outward rides and one return ride) and those three trips already consume 3 minutes.  Adding C’s 2 minute walk gives 5 minutes again.  Hence 5 minutes is a strict lower bound; no plan can do better.

A plan that attains this bound is:

• 0–1 min : A rides the bicycle across (1 min).  
• 0–5 min : B begins walking; he needs 5 min.  
• 0–2 min : C begins walking; he needs 2 min.  

At t = 1 min A is already across.

Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.

Feasible possibilities (together with d₀ and the carry c₁ into the tens place) are

      n₀  1  2  3  5  6
      d₀  2  4  6  0  2
      c₁  0  0  0  1  1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Choose n₀ = 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The choice n₀ = 5 is attractive because it immediately places the otherwise troublesome ‘0’ into the denominator (d₀ = 0) and introduces the sole carry c₁ = 1.

Used so far:  N:5  D:0  (c₁ = 1)

Digits left: 1,2,2,3,4,4,6,9.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  The tens digit n₁
--------------------------------------------------------------------
With the carry c₁ = 1 we need
        2n₁ + 1 = 10c₂ + d₁.

Scanning the remaining digits gives two viable choices:

      n₁ = 1  → d₁ = 3, c₂ = 0,
      n₁ = 4  → d₁ = 9, c₂ = 0.

Keep both for the moment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3A.  Branch n₁ = 1  (d₁ = 3, c₂ = 0)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Hundreds digit n₂ (no carry):

      n₂ = 2  → d₂ = 4, c₃ = 0   (possible)
      n₂ = 6  → d₂ = 2, c₃ = 1   (possible)

•  First take n₂ = 2 (c₃ = 0).

   Thousands digit n₃: trying the four unused digits 2,4,6,9
      2 → d₃ = 4  (would need a third ‘2’), impossible,
      4 → d₃ = 8  (8 not available),
      6 → d₃ = 2  (would need a third ‘2’),
      9 → d₃ = 8  (8 not available).  
   No choice works – branch fails.

•  Now n₂ = 6 (c₃ = 1).

   Thousands digit n₃:
      2 → d₃ = 5  (‘5’ already used), impossible,
      4 → d₃ = 9  (works, c₄ = 0),
      9 → d₃ = 9  (duplicate ‘9’), impossible.

   So n₃ = 4, d₃ = 9, c₄ = 0.

   Ten-thousands digit n₄ must be one of the two digits left, 2 or 4.

      n₄ = 2 → d₄ = 4, c₅ = 0  (works),
      n₄ = 4 → d₄ = 8  (8 not available).  

   Choose n₄ = 2, d₄ = 4, and c₅ = 0 (no overflow), giving

        N = 2 4 6 1 5 = 24615,
        D = 4 9 2 3 0 = 49230.

All ten digits 0,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,9 are now used exactly once.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3B.  Branch n₁ = 4  (d₁ = 9)  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A similar check shows that this branch quickly runs into a conflict of digits, so it yields no solution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Verification
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Compute: 2 × 24615 = 49230, so indeed

                 24615
                 ——–—  = ½.
                 49230

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Arranging the given digits into the fraction

                 24615/49230

uses each digit exactly once and equals 1/2.

Final answer: 24615/49230",True,1,0

Or square root of 200!
If you imagine you are facing a globe head on, you have the north pole at the top of the globe and the south pole at the bottom. Imagine a ""west pole"" and ""east pole"" to the left and right of the globe.
If you are at the north pole and turn left, you will walk through the ""west pole"" (right and you go through the ""east pole"")
If you walk on an axis from the north pole towards the south pole and make a left or right turn you will always walk through these imaginary east and west poles. So in the question 17.345 kilometers is irrelevant, only the turn.
(It also doesn't matter where you start on the planet, the distance at the end will still be the same.)
47.124 is approximately 3/4 of the circumference of this planet, which will leave you directly on the imaginary east pole. The distance is now the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle of side 10km.
Answer: root 200 or approximately 14km!

 c = AB / R = 17.345 / 10 = 1.734 5 rad  
 a = BC / R = 47.124 / 10 = 4.712 4 rad  

At the turning point B the traveller really makes a right angle (90°) between the two great-circle courses, so in the spherical triangle ABC we have ∠B = 90°.  
Denote the sought central angle AC/R by b.  In a right spherical triangle (right angle at B) the spherical law of cosines for sides gives

x(t)  = distance of the spider from the fixed end (in inches) at time t  
y(t)  = x(t)/L(t) = fraction of the band already covered.  

1.  Length of the band  
   It is 3 in long at t = 0 and is pulled out at the steady rate of 3 in/min, so  
        L(t) = 3 + 3t.                                                   (1)

2.  Speed of the spider measured on the band  
   The spider walks 1 in/min with respect to the material of the band, i.e. its
   speed relative to the band is 1 in/min.

3.  Differential equation for the covered fraction y(t)

Bill said he was going to sit beside the curb and wait until a fare came along. Bob said he was going to cruise west at four kilometres an hour; therefore, he would have twice the chance of picking up a fare as Bill. Frank said he was going to cruise east at eight kilometres an hour and his chances were twice as good as either Bill's or Bob's. Jim claimed that they were all wrong.

Suppose that, at every instant, ρ pedestrians per kilometre walk east at 4 km/h and ρ pedestrians per kilometre walk west at 4 km/h (same density in the two directions).  
Whenever a taxi and a pedestrian meet – i.e. their paths cross – the taxi may pick up the pedestrian, no matter which direction each is travelling.  
Hence a taxi’s “chance” of obtaining a fare is proportional to the rate (number per hour) at which it meets pedestrians.

If a taxi travels with ground speed v (km/h, east positive), then

• relative speed to an east-walking pedestrian = |v – 4| km/h  
• relative speed to a west-walking pedestrian = |v + 4| km/h.

Since there are ρ pedestrians per kilometre in each direction, the meeting (pick-up) rate is

R(v) = ρ(|v – 4| + |v + 4|)  (fares per hour).

Now evaluate R(v) for the four drivers.

Bill: v = 0 (stationary)  
R(0) = ρ(4 + 4) = 8ρ.

Bob: v = –4 (cruising west at 4 km/h)  
R(–4) = ρ(8 + 0) = 8ρ.  
Bob’s rate equals Bill’s, not twice Bill’s.  
→ Bob’s claim is wrong.

Frank: v = +8 (cruising east at 8 km/h)  
R(+8) = ρ(4 + 12) = 16ρ.  
This is exactly twice Bill’s (and Bob’s) 8ρ.  
→ Frank’s claim (“twice as good as either Bill’s or Bob’s”) is correct.

Jim: v = –12 (cruising west at 12 km/h)  
R(–12) = ρ(16 + 8) = 24ρ.  
Frank’s rate is 16ρ, so Jim’s rate is only 24ρ / 16ρ = 1½ times Frank’s, not twice Frank’s.

After Clue #6, we have one possibility: 617.
617 is the mystery number.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"We check each clue systematically and find a unique number that meets them all.

1.  Digits that can appear in the ones place of any prime (and are not the digit 5) are 1, 3, 7.  
    For clues 5 and 6 both the increasing-order number (smallest→largest) and the decreasing-order
    number (largest→smallest) must also be prime, so neither the smallest nor the largest digit may be
    even or 5.  
    Hence the set of three digits must have exactly one member from {1, 3, 7} in the smallest
    position and another from {1, 3, 7} in the largest position.  
    The remaining (middle) digit is unrestricted except that it must differ from the other two and
    must not be 9.

2.  Try the triple {1, 6, 7}.  
    •  In increasing order it gives 167, which is prime.  
    •  In decreasing order it gives 761, which is also prime.

3.  For the mystery number ABC we must place the even digit 6 in the hundreds position, because  
    •  B cannot be even (otherwise AB would end with an even digit and could not be prime), and  
    •  C cannot be even (otherwise BC would end with an even digit and could not be prime).  

    That forces A = 6.  
    The two remaining digits 1 and 7 can now be arranged as B and C.  We test the two possibilities:

    a)  617:  
        AB = 61 (prime), BC = 17 (prime), ABC = 617 (prime).  

    b)  671:  
        AB = 67 (prime), BC = 71 (prime), ABC = 671 = 11·61 (not prime).  

    Only 617 satisfies clue 1.

4.  Verify all six clues for 617.  
    1)  617 is a three-digit prime.  
    2)  AB = 61 and BC = 17 are primes.  
    3)  The digits 6, 1, 7 are distinct.  
    4)  No digit is 9.  
    5)  Rearranged greatest-to-least gives 761, a prime.  
    6)  Rearranged least-to-greatest gives 167, a prime.

All conditions are met, so the mystery number is unique.

136,"Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?
Comments to triflers:
The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!",There are hints in the comments to triflers and in the title.,"80
To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion. This takes 9 trips of 2 5/18 miles (5 advancing trips interspersed with 4 return trips) for a total of 20.5 miles traveled (9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5) and 20.5 bottles of soda used. Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases. With one less case to move, Bu will now make 2 fewer trips. The 3.5 bottles set aside are used to move the four cases the next 1/2 mile toward the Wirth Pavilion.   After this, the Wirth Pavilion is just 2 2/9 miles away ( 5 - 2 5/18 - 9/18 = 2 4/18 ). Next, he travels 15 5/9 miles (7 * 2 2/9) using 15 5/9 bottles of soda to complete his trip. The ranger cadet delivers 80 bottles to the pavilion and has 4/9 of a Park Pop to spare. (96 - 15 5/9 = 80 4/9)",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

• one “bottle-mile’’ denote the fuel contained in one full bottle,  
• C = 25 be the total number of bottles (fuel + freight) that the MoJoPed can carry, and  
• D = 5 mi be the distance between the two pavilions.  
The five cases give  

5 cases × 24 bottles /case = 120 unopened bottles.

1.  How much does it cost to move bottles one mile?  

When more than C bottles lie at some point Bu cannot take them all in one trip, so he must shuttle:

 • He leaves with 25 bottles: 1 is burnt on the way out, 24 arrive unopened.  
 • To come back for more he must take one of those 24 as fuel; it is burnt on the return trip.

Hence a complete out-and-back shuttle
  moves 23 unopened bottles forward and
  consumes 2 bottles of fuel.

If n shuttle loads are needed across one mile, the first n–1 loads are round-trips (2 bottles each) and the last load is a simple outward trip (1 bottle).  

So with n loads the smallest possible fuel loss for that mile is

 fuel loss = 2(n – 1) + 1 = 2n – 1.  (★)

Because each load can BEGIN with 25 bottles, the number of loads needed when S bottles are present is  

 n = ⌈S / 25⌉.

Equation (★) therefore gives the least fuel that can possibly be burnt on that mile; any other scheme would either move fewer bottles or use at least as much fuel.

2.  March mile by mile.

Start (mile 0) : S₀ = 120.

Mile 0→1  
n = ⌈120/25⌉ = 5 ⇒ fuel burnt = 2·5 – 1 = 9.  
S₁ = 120 – 9 = 111.

Mile 1→2  
n = ⌈111/25⌉ = 5 ⇒ fuel burnt = 9.  
S₂ = 111 – 9 = 102.

Mile 2→3  
n = ⌈102/25⌉ = 5 ⇒ fuel burnt = 9.  
S₃ = 102 – 9 = 93.

Mile 3→4  
n = ⌈93/25⌉ = 4 ⇒ fuel burnt = 2·4 – 1 = 7.  
S₄ = 93 – 7 = 86.

Mile 4→5  
n = ⌈86/25⌉ = 4 ⇒ fuel burnt = 7.  
S₅ = 86 – 7 = 79.

3.  Result.

After the last mile Bu arrives at the Wirth Pavilion with S₅ = 79 bottles still unopened.  
The reasoning above shows that, mile by mile, the fuel expenditure is the minimum possible, hence no strategy can deliver more than 79 unopened bottles.

137,"Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.  Henry's plan calls for the tracks (each of which is one mile in length) to be laid end-to-end with no gap between them, pinned to the ground at every other juncture, as shown below:
v_______ _______vv_______ _______v
Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""
Henry replies, ""The expansion will only be an inch over the whole mile length.  If the tracks buckle, it will only be by an inch or two at most.  The trains will certainly have no trouble bumping over these buckles.""
Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?",Would Pythagoras have the same plan?,"The rise in the middle of the tracks would have been much greater than Henry surmised.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse). SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"The joints that Henry pins fix the ends of every two-mile length of rail.  
When the temperature rises, each two-mile piece becomes 2 inches (=0.1667 ft) longer, but its ends cannot move, so the extra length has to go into a sideways (or upward) buckle.

Treat the buckled rail as the arc of a circle.

Let  
c = chord length between pins = 2 miles = 10 560 ft  
s = arc length after expansion = c + ΔL = 10 560 ft + 0.1667 ft  
δ = fractional increase = ΔL / c = 0.1667 / 10 560 ≈ 1.58 × 10⁻⁵

For a circular arc with half–angle θ at the centre,  

 chord c = 2R sin θ  
 arc  s = 2R θ  

Hence  
s / c = θ / sin θ ≈ 1 + θ²/6  (because θ is small).

So   1 + δ ≈ 1 + θ²/6  →  θ² ≈ 6δ  →  θ ≈ √(6δ)  
 θ ≈ √(6 × 1.58 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 0.00974 rad (about 0.56°).

The greatest offset (sagitta) of the arc from the straight line is  

 h = R (1 – cos θ) ≈ R θ²/2.

Using c ≈ 2R θ ⇒ R ≈ c / (2θ),  

 h ≈ (c / (2θ)) · (θ² / 2) = (c θ) / 4.

Therefore  

 h ≈ (10 560 ft)(0.00974) / 4 ≈ 25.7 ft.

So the “inch or two” of extra length produces a buckle more than twenty-five feet high (or sideways) every two miles—and even a one-mile pinned interval would still give about 13 ft of buckle. No train could possibly “bump over” such humps.

Henry’s boss understood this geometric amplification; Henry did not, and that is why he was fired.

Final answer: Because with the ends fixed every two miles, a mere 2-inch thermal expansion forces the rail to bow about 26 feet out of line, far too much for any train to negotiate—Henry’s design would make the track dangerously impassable.",True,0,0

1.  Put A at (0, 0).  
    AB is 16 ft and runs along the wall, so B = (16, 0).

2.  AF ⟂ AB and AF = 6 ft, so F = (0, –6).

3.  BC ∥ AF and BC = 6 ft, so C = (16, –6).

4.  FC is parallel to AB, so FC is horizontal.  
    Hence FC is the segment from F (0, –6) to C (16, –6).

   Points G and H lie on FC with FG = HC = 4 ft, so  
   G = (4, –6) and H = (12, –6).

5.  DH ⟂ HC and DH = 4 ft.  Since HC is horizontal, DH is vertical.  
    There are two possibilities: (12, –2) or (12, –10).  
    Angle BCD is 135°, and only D = (12, –10) satisfies this, so  
    D = (12, –10).

6.  EG ⟂ FG and EG = 4 ft.  FG is horizontal, so EG is vertical.  
    Thus E is either (4, –2) or (4, –10).  Because ED must be 8 ft and

Check:  
• Sn = 52   is 32 less than 84 ✔  
• 78 + 44 = 122;   122 is 1 more than 121 and 24 more than 98 ✔  
• Km = 78 equals Smith’s average (84+52+98)/3 = 78 ✔

Notice that  
1000(D − B) + 10(B − D) = (D − B)(1000 − 10) = 990(D − B),  
and (A − E) = −(E − A). Hence

9999(E − A) + 990(D − B) = 33957.

Divide by 9:

1111(E − A) + 110(D − B) = 3773.

Divide by 11 to simplify still further:

101(E − A) + 10(D − B) = 343.                            (1)

----------------------------------------------------------
Solving the Diophantine equation
----------------------------------------------------------

Let  
        x = E − A  (range −9 … 9),  
        y = D − B  (range −9 … 9).

Equation (1) becomes

                 101x + 10y = 343.

For 10y to be an integer multiple of 10, the right–hand side must be divisible by 10, so

343 − 101x ≡ 0 (mod 10)  
⇒ 3 − x ≡ 0 (mod 10)  
⇒ x ≡ 3 (mod 10).

With −9 ≤ x ≤ 9 the only possibilities are x = 3 or x = −7.  
• If x = 3, then 343 − 101·3 = 40, giving y = 4 (since 10y = 40).  
• If x = −7, then 343 − 101(−7) = 1050, giving y = 105, impossible.

Thus the unique solution in the allowed digit ranges is

            E − A = 3,  D − B = 4.                      (2)

----------------------------------------------------------
Translating back to digit conditions
----------------------------------------------------------

From (2):

E = A + 3  ⇒ because E ≤ 9, we must have A ≤ 6.  
D = B + 4  ⇒ because D ≤ 9, we must have B ≤ 5.

Now list the free choices:

A: any of 1,2,3,4,5,6          (6 choices)  
B: any of 0,1,2,3,4,5          (6 choices)  
C: any digit 0–9               (10 choices)  
E and D are then fixed by (2).

Every such choice produces a valid five-digit N, and because E > A (difference 3), the reversed number is automatically larger, giving the required positive difference 33957.

----------------------------------------------------------
Counting the possibilities
----------------------------------------------------------

Total possibilities = 6 (choices for A) × 6 (choices for B) × 10 (choices for C)  
                    = 360.

Therefore, there are 360 different original numbers that meet the condition.

Mouse(A) bites off one rope in 60 minutes.
Mouse(B) bites off one rope in 90 minutes.
Mouse(C) bites off one rope in 180 minutes.
You do not have any time or distance measuring tools and the length of the rope is unknown.  How can you measure 75 minutes?",Set distance and time relations and equations,"Mark the two ropes as Rope(A) and Rope(B).
1. Let Mouse(A) and Mouse(C) start biting off Rope(A) at the same time, starting each from  one end (moving in opposite directions).  At the same time, let Mouse(B) start biting off Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(A) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X = S(A) * 60, where S(A) is biting speed for Mouse(A) and X is Rope(A) length
X = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X is Rope(A) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(A)/S(C) = 3:1, which means that for each 3 units Mouse(A) will move, Mouse (C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(A) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(A) bites off three times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides Rope(A) length in to 4 units.
Mouse(A) bitten off portion = 3/4 X (where X is Rope(A) length)
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/4 X
Finding the time spent before Rope(A) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(A) needs  60 minutes to bite off X, How many minutes are needed to bite off 3/4 X?
Minutes needed = 3/4 * 60 = 45 minutes are needed to fully bite off Rope(A) by Mouse(A) and Mouse(C).  At that point in time, Mouse(B) would have bitten off exactly half the length of Rope(B) (needing 90 minutes to bite off the full rope), and needs an additional 45 minutes to bite off the remaining rope half.
2. Let Mouse(B) continue biting off Rope(B) and make Mouse(C) start biting off the other end of Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(B) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X/2 = S(B) * 90, where S(B) is biting speed for Mouse(B) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
X/2 = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(B)/S(C) = 2:1, which means that for each 2 units Mouse(B) will move, Mouse(C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(B) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(B) bites off two times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides the remaining half of Rope(B) length to 3 units.
Mouse(B) bitten off portion = 2/3 * X/2 = X/3
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/3 * X/2 = X/6
Finding the time spent before the remaining half of Rope(B) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(B) needs  90 minutes to bite off X, how many minutes are needed to bite off X/3?
Minutes needed = 1/3 * 90 = 30 minutes are needed to fully bite off the remaining half of Rope(B) by Mouse(B) and Mouse(C).
At that point in time, 75 minutes would have passed (45 minutes consumed from biting off Rope(A) and another 30 minutes consumed from biting off Rope(B)).",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the length of every whole rope be L.  
The constant biting speeds are  

• Mouse A :   v₁ = L / 60   (rope–lengths per minute)  
• Mouse B :   v₂ = L / 90  
• Mouse C :   v₃ = L / 180  

We are free to move the mice from one rope to another, and we can observe the single event we are able to recognise without any clock: “a certain piece of rope has just disappeared completely”.

Step 1  (produce a 45–minute mark)  
Start Mouse A at one end of Rope I and Mouse C at the other end of Rope I at the same moment t = 0.

Their combined speed on that rope is  

v₁ + v₃ = L/60 + L/180 = L/45 .

Hence Rope I (length L) disappears after

T₁ = L ÷ (L/45) = 45 minutes.

So the moment Rope I vanishes is an observable event that occurs exactly 45 minutes after the start.

Step 2  (prepare the second rope while the first one is being eaten)  
At the very same initial moment t = 0 let Mouse B begin to bite Rope II from one end.  
In the first 45 minutes Mouse B removes

(45 min) · v₂ = 45 · (L/90) = L/2 ,

i.e. exactly one–half of Rope II.

Therefore, at the instant Rope I finishes (the 45–minute mark) exactly half of Rope II is still present.

Step 3  (let the remaining half be eaten in exactly 30 minutes)  
At that 45–minute mark we can see that Rope I has disappeared, so we immediately

• take Rope II away from Mouse B, and  
• give the still–attached half-rope to Mouse A (who has just become free).

Mouse A now bites the remaining length L/2 at his speed v₁ = L/60.  
The time he needs is

T₂ = (L/2) ÷ (L/60) = 30 minutes.

Step 4  (the desired 75–minute moment)  
When Mouse A finishes what is left of Rope II, the elapsed time is

45 minutes (first step) + 30 minutes (second step) = 75 minutes.

That instant is again detectable (the second rope vanishes completely), so we have measured exactly 75 minutes without any clock or ruler, using nothing but the two ropes and the three mice.",True,1,0

   Because every non-zero digit is a 1, this means “the number of 1’s” must be a multiple of 9.

Let k be the number of 1’s.  
The smallest positive multiple of 9 is 9 itself, so the minimal admissible choice is k = 9.

Since the last two digits are 00, all nine 1’s must lie in the digits to the left of those two zeros.  
To obtain the smallest possible value we must use the fewest digits possible; thus we need exactly nine digits before the final “00”.  
With nine digits and nine 1’s there is only one possible prefix: 111 111 111.

The only way to get a trailing zero is by multiplying a factor of 1000! which is 2 by a factor of 1000! which is 5. The modified problem is thus: How many such pairs of factors are there?
There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5.

Finally there is 1 = [1000/625] number which is a multiple of 625, this gives one further factor of 5. Thus there are exactly  200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249 factors of 5 in 1000! and since there are more than sufficient factors of 2, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"The last digits of a positive integer become zeros only when the integer contains factors of 10, and each factor 10 = 2 × 5.

•  Crazy Charles: never loses a second to the main bunch

•  Any other rider: 13 stages in same time as Charles, one stage 10 min slower

1st Champion (14 s ahead of Charles)  
2nd “Crazy” Charles

  Only 41 has the tens-digit 4 (the only admissible non-zero square digit).  
  Hence if A = 1 we must have B = 4 and  

  N = 14C41 with C ∈ {1,4,9}.                             (3)

  The three possibilities are  

  14141 , 14441 , 14941.

  Their square-roots lie between 119 and 123, but a direct check shows  

  119² = 14161 > 14141, 120² = 14400 < 14441,  
  121² = 14641 > 14441, 122² = 14884 < 14941,  
  123² = 15129 > 14941.

  None equals a number in (3).  Hence A ≠ 1.

• A = 9.  
  A square ending in 9 is produced by an odd n that ends in 3 or 7; the possible last
  two digits are 09, 29, 49, 69, 89.  
  Only 49 has an admissible tens-digit 4, hence B = 4 and  

  N = 94C49 with C ∈ {1,4,9}.                             (4)

  The three candidates are  

  94149 , 94449 , 94949.

  Their square-roots must be about 306–308.  Checking:

  306² = 93636 < 94149, 307² = 94249 > 94149,  
  307² = 94249 < 94449, 308² = 94864 > 94449,  
  308² = 94864 < 94949, 309² = 95481 > 94949.

  No equality occurs; therefore A ≠ 9.

• A = 4.  
  A square ending in 4 comes from an even n that ends in 2 or 8; the last two digits
  may be 04, 24, 44, 64, 84.  
  The only admissible tens-digit is again 4: the pair must be 44, so B = 4 and  

  N = 44C44 with C ∈ {1,4,9}.                             (5)

  The three candidates are  

  44144 , 44444 , 44944.

  Their square-roots are near 210–213:

  210² = 44100 < 44144 < 211² = 44521,  
  210² = 44100 < 44444 < 211² = 44521,  
  212² = 44944 = 44944.

  Only 44944 is a perfect square (212²).  

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Verification

44944 is palindromic, every one of its digits (4,4,9,4,4) is a non-zero square,  
and 44944 = 212².

Hence it satisfies every condition, and by the exhaustion of all possible
patterns it is the unique solution.

149,"The owner of a Romankachi flower boutique follows a particular pattern for his business. During a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%. After a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, the cost of a Red Rose bouquet  decreases by 162 Roka (Roka being the native Romankachi currency). After another year in which there was inflation once more followed by a slowdown, the cost of this bouquet reduces by a further 147.42 Roka. What was the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet ?",Everything can be expressed and solvd in terms of the original price of the bouquet and the inflation rate,"The original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.
Let the original price of the Red Rose bouquet  be 'B' Roka.
It is given that during a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%.
Hence after a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 162 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)
(since B(1+Y) is the price during inflation and  B(1-Y)(1+Y) the price during the slowdown)
Therefore the decrease in price after one year
= B - B(1-Y^2)
= B - B + B*Y^2
= B*Y^2 = 162      ... Equation 1
Hence after another year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 147.42 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)(1-Y^2)
= B(1-Y^2)^2
(since B(1-Y^2) is the price at the end of the previous year and           B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y) the price during the slowdown this year)
Therefore the decrease in price this year
= B(1-Y^2) - B(1-Y^2)^2
= B(1-Y^2)[1 - (1-Y^2)]
= B(1-Y^2)( Y^2) = 147.42    ... Equation 2
Dividing Equation 2 by Equation 1, we get
(1-Y^2) = 0.91 => Y^2 = 0.09
Substituting the above value of Y^2 in equation 1, we get
B*0.09 = 162
Hence B = 162/0.09 = 1800 Roka.
Therefore the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let

Hence one complete cycle multiplies the price by

3.  Data from the second year  

After the first year the bouquet costs P − 162.  
Applying another identical cycle, the second-year drop is  

(P − 162)(Y/100)² = 147.42.             (2)

4.  Eliminate (Y/100)²  

Let k₁ = (Y/100)².  
From (1): Pk₁ = 162.  
From (2): (P − 162)k₁ = 147.42.

Divide (2) by (1):

(P − 162)/P = 147.42 / 162 = 0.91.

So  
1 − 162/P = 0.91 ⇒ 162/P = 0.09 ⇒ P = 162 / 0.09 = 1800.

5.  (Optional) Verify Y  

k₁ = 162 / 1800 = 0.09 ⇒ (Y/100)² = 0.09 ⇒ Y/100 = 0.30 ⇒ Y = 30 %.

Everything is consistent with the given decreases.

151,"In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.
On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.
About this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, ""Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.""

When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 90 days also.
For how long can the three animals graze on the field together?",Rates problem--use the same algebraic techniques,"The cow, the goat, and the goose eat grass with a constant speed (amount per day): v1 for the cow, v2 for the goat, v3 for the goose.
The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:
v1 = 3 x h/180,
v2 = 2 x h/180,
v3 = 1 x h/180,
k = 1 x h/180.
Then holds for the time t that the three animals can graze together: h-tx(v1+v2+v3-k) = 0, so t = h/(v1+v2+v3-k) = h/(3xh/180+2xh/180+1xh/180-1xh/180) = 36. The three animals can graze together for 36 days.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  
G = amount of grass on the field at the start (in “cow-days”),  
r = amount of new grass that grows each day,  
Cc , Cg , Cs = the daily amounts eaten by the cow, the goat and the goose respectively.

All rates are taken in the same units, so “1” means “enough grass for one cow for one day”.

1.  Cow + goat for 45 days  
   (Cc + Cg)·45 = G + 45r        (1)

2.  Cow + goose for 60 days

4.  Goat + goose for 90 days  
   (Cg + Cs)·90 = G + 90r        (4)

From (3) we obtain G = 90Cc – 90r.  
Insert this G into (1) and (2):

(1) 45(Cc + Cg) = 90Cc – 45r  ⇒  Cg = Cc – r         (5)

(2) 60(Cc + Cs) = 90Cc – 30r  ⇒  2Cs = Cc – r  ⇒  Cs = (Cc – r)/2  (6)

Insert G from (3) into (4):

90(Cg + Cs) = 90Cc ⇒  Cg + Cs = Cc                        (7)

Put (5) and (6) into (7):

(Cc – r) + (Cc – r)/2 = Cc  
(3Cc – 3r)/2 = Cc  
3Cc – 3r = 2Cc  
Cc = 3r ⇒  r = Cc/3.                                    (8)

Now compute each animal’s rate:

Cg = Cc – r = Cc – Cc/3 = 2Cc/3.  
Cs = (Cc – r)/2 = (2Cc/3)/2 = Cc/3.

(The check Cg + Cs = Cc is satisfied.)

The initial amount of grass:

G = 90Cc – 90r = 90Cc – 90(Cc/3) = 60Cc.               (9)

Finally, let T be the number of days the three animals graze together.  
Their joint eating rate is

Cc + Cg + Cs = Cc + 2Cc/3 + Cc/3 = 2Cc.

During T days they eat 2Cc·T units, while the field supplies G + rT units.  
Hence

2Cc·T = G + rT  
2Cc·T = 60Cc + (Cc/3)T (using (8) and (9))

Divide by Cc:

2T = 60 + (1/3)T  
(2 − 1/3)T = 60  
(5/3)T = 60  
T = 60·3/5 = 36.

   C(n,1) = n,

The answer is 285714.
If its rightmost digit is placed at its left end, the new number is 428571 which is 50% larger than the original number 285714.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

N = 10a + b,  

where  
• b (0 ≤ b ≤ 9) is the right-most digit,  
• a is the integer formed by the remaining k – 1 digits,  
• k ≥ 2 is the number of digits of N.

Moving the last digit to the front gives  

M = b·10^{k-1} + a.

The problem states that M is 50 % larger than N, i.e.  

b·10^{k-1} + a = 3/2 (10a + b). (1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  A divisibility condition

Multiply (1) by 2 and rearrange:

2b·10^{k-1} + 2a = 30a + 3b  
2b·10^{k-1} – 3b = 28a  
b (2·10^{k-1} – 3) = 28a. (2)

Thus  

a = b (2·10^{k-1} – 3) / 28. (3)

For a to be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by 28 = 4·7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Divisibility by 4

For k ≥ 3 we have 10^{k-1} ≡ 0 (mod 4), so  

2·10^{k-1} – 3 ≡ –3 ≡ 1 (mod 4).

Hence (2·10^{k-1} – 3) is odd; therefore the factor 4 needed in (3) must come entirely from b.  
Consequently b must be divisible by 4, i.e.  

b ∈ {4, 8}. (4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Divisibility by 7

Let n = k – 1.  Since 10^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7), the powers of 10 modulo 7 repeat every 6.  
Compute 2·10^{n} – 3 (mod 7) for n mod 6:

n mod 6 : 1  2  3  4  5  0  
10^{n}   : 3  2  6  4  5  1  
2·10^{n} : 6  4  5  1  3  2  
2·10^{n}–3: 3  1  2  5  0  6  (mod 7)

Thus 2·10^{n} – 3 is divisible by 7 only when n ≡ 5 (mod 6), i.e.

k ≡ 0 (mod 6). (5)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Reconciling (4) and (5)

If k is not a multiple of 6, the factor 7 must come from b; but b divisible by 4 and 7 simultaneously would require b = 0 or 28, impossible for a single digit.  
Therefore k must satisfy (5).  
The smallest such k is 6, so N has exactly 6 digits.

With k = 6 we have  

2·10^{5} – 3 = 200000 – 3 = 199 997.

Substitute into (3).

a = b · 199 997 / 28.

Using (4):

• For b = 4: a = 4·199 997 / 28 = 28 571.  
  Hence N = 10a + b = 285 714.

• For b = 8: a = 8·199 997 / 28 = 57 142.  
  Hence N = 571 428 (larger than the preceding one).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Verification of the smaller candidate

Take N = 285 714.  
Move the last digit to the front: 428 571.  
Compute 1.5 × N: 1.5 × 285 714 = 428 571.  
The condition is satisfied.

Each ferry travels at a constant speed, although the ""Lead Balloon"" is faster than the ""Iceberg Magnet"".
The two boats leave from opposite shores at the same time.  They pass at a point of 720 yards from Lard Sculptures.  Upon arriving at the opposite shore, each boat stays in its slip for 5 minutes, and then starts back. They pass again 400 yards from Kebab Fountains. Assume both boats travel along a straight line.

Note that the 5 minutes spent in their slips is irrelevant to solving the problem.
The ratio of the distance traveled by the two boats when they pass each other for the first time is:  (X - 720) / 720.
The ratio of the total distance traveled by the two boats when they pass each other for the second time is:  (2x - 400) / (X + 400).
Since the boats travel at a constant speed, the ratios are equal.
(X - 720) / 720 = (2X - 400) / (X + 400)

1.  The first crossing

Both boats leave their slips at the same instant and meet 720 yd from the west shore.

Time to the first meeting  

 t₁ = 720 / v₂  (boat from west)  
 t₁ = (D – 720) / v₁  (boat from east).

 720 = (D – 720) / r           (using r = v₁/v₂)  
 D = 720 r + 720.              (1)

2.  Arrival, waiting and departure times

Hence the faster boat turns round

 Δ = [t₁ + t₁ r + τ] – [t₁ + t₁ / r + τ] = t₁(r – 1/r)

minutes later than the slower one turns round.

3.  The second meeting  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Let t₂ be the elapsed time (from the original start) at their second meeting,
which occurs 400 yd from the east shore, i.e. at position D – 400.

For t ≥ departures, their positions (measured from the west shore) are  

 x₁(t) = v₁ (t – t₁ – t₁/r – τ)   (boat now moving east)  
 x₂(t) = D – v₂ (t – t₁ – t₁ r – τ) (boat now moving west).

Setting x₁(t₂) = x₂(t₂) gives  

 v₁ (t₂ – t₁ – t₁/r – τ) = D – v₂ (t₂ – t₁ – t₁ r – τ).

Divide by v₂ and insert r and D/v₂ from (1):

 r (t₂ – t₁ – t₁/r – τ) = (720)(r + 1)/v₂ – (t₂ – t₁ – t₁ r – τ).

Simplifying yields

 (r + 1)(t₂ – 3t₁ – τ) = 0  ⇒ t₂ = 3t₁ + τ.         (4)

4.  Using the location of the second meeting  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
At time t₂ the position of either boat is D – 400; use the faster boat:

 x₁(t₂) = v₁ (t₂ – t₁ – t₁/r – τ).

Insert t₂ from (4):

 x₁(t₂) = v₁ (2t₁ – t₁/r) = v₁ t₁ (2 – 1/r) = v₂ r t₁ (2 – 1/r).

Because v₂ t₁ = 720, this is

 x₁(t₂) = 720 (2r – 1).

But x₁(t₂) = D – 400 = (720 r + 720) – 400 = 720 r + 320.

Hence  

 720 (2r – 1) = 720 r + 320  
 1440 r – 720 = 720 r + 320  
 720 r = 1040

Since your base camp is 800 miles away (half of 1600 miles), you can easily complete the delivery. Here's how:
Although you can only carry one barrel at a time, you need to transport both of them until one barrel is empty. F is the barrel used first, and L is the barrel used last.

We look for a representation

N = a + (a+1) + (a+2) + … + (a+k-1)  (1)

with k ≥ 2 and a ≥ 0 (the summands are consecutive non-negative integers).

Step 1.  Rewrite (1).

The sum of k consecutive integers beginning with a is

N = k[2a + (k−1)]/2  ⟺  2N = k(2a + k − 1).  (2)

Hence 2N is written as the product of k and the odd number (2a+k−1).

Step 2.  A necessary condition.

In (2) one of the two factors is odd:

• If k is odd, then k itself is odd, so k | N.  
• If k is even, then (2a+k−1) is odd, and

  N = (k/2)(2a+k−1),

so the odd number (2a+k−1) divides N.

Therefore:  
If N can be expressed as a sum of ≥2 consecutive integers, N possesses an odd divisor > 1.  
But a power of 2 has no odd divisor except 1.  
Consequently no power of 2 can be written in the required form.

Step 3.  A sufficient condition.

Conversely, suppose N is NOT a power of 2.  
Then N = d·m with an odd divisor d > 1.

Take k = d (odd).  
Let

a = m − (d−1)/2.  (3)

Because d ≥ 3, (d−1)/2 ≤ d, while m = N/d ≥ 1000/3 > d.  
Hence a ≥ 0.  

Using (3) in (1) gives exactly d consecutive integers whose sum is N.  
Thus every N that is not a power of 2 does have the required representation.

Step 4.  Locate the exceptional number(s).

The only power of 2 between 1000 and 2000 is 1024 = 2^10.  
(512 < 1000 and 2048 > 2000.)

Step 5.  Conclusion.

• 1024 cannot be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive non-negative integers (by Step 2).  
• Every other integer from 1000 through 2000 can be so expressed (by Steps 3 and 4).

We were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?",Find numbers who do not have a duplicate that will be deleted,"It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.
Hence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.
Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.

Secondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order. For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.
Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.
Therefore total number of valid employee id's possible = 90 + 90 + 360 = 540.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Call a valid three–digit identification number one that lies between 100 and 999 (so its first digit is non–zero).

1.  Separate the 900 possible numbers into three disjoint classes.

   a)  Numbers ending in 0  
       They are 100, 110, 120, … , 990.  
       There are 9 possible hundreds-digits and 10 possible tens-digits, so 9·10 = 90 such numbers.  
       If such a number, say 370, is written backwards it becomes 073, which does not begin with a non-zero digit and therefore is not an admissible I.D.  
       Hence every one of these 90 numbers can be used without ever conflicting with another admissible number.

   b)  Palindromes (numbers equal to their own reverse)  
       A three–digit palindrome has the form ABA, where A ∈ {1,…,9} and B ∈ {0,…,9}.  
       Thus there are 9·10 = 90 palindromes.  
       Because a palindrome is its own reverse, no second admissible number can conflict with it, so all 90 of them can also be taken.

   c)  All remaining admissible numbers  
       Remove from the 900 the 90 numbers of class (a) and the 90 palindromes of class (b); 900 − 90 − 90 = 720 numbers remain.  
       None of these ends in 0, so when any one of them is reversed the result is another admissible three–digit number with a non–zero first digit.  
       Moreover, reversing twice brings us back to the original number, so these 720 numbers fall into disjoint pairs {N, reverse(N)} with the two members different.  
       Therefore there are 720⁄2 = 360 such pairs.  From each pair at most one member may be chosen, so at most 360 numbers can be selected from this class.

2.  Add the maximum counts from the three classes:

      90  (ending in 0)  
    + 90  (palindromes)  
    + 360 (one from each of the 360 pairs)

(N + ½)² – 2(m – ½)² = ½.

Clear the denominator by doubling:

2(N + ½)² – (2m – 1)² = 1.  (4)

Introduce the integer substitutions  

x = 2N + 1   (so N = (x – 1)/2),  
y = 2m – 1   (so m = (y + 1)/2).

With these, (4) becomes the classical Pell equation

x² – 2y² = –1.  (5)

Equation (5) has an infinite sequence of positive integral solutions.  
Every solution can be generated from the fundamental solution (x, y) = (1, 1) by

xₖ + yₖ√2 = (1 + √2)^{2k+1}, k = 0,1,2,…

Compute successive solutions (stopping when N ≥ 1000):

k = 0 : (x, y) = (1, 1)  
 N = (1 – 1)/2 = 0  (inadmissible, the street must have at least one house)

k = 1 : (x, y) = (7, 5)  
 N = (7 – 1)/2 = 3, m = (5 + 1)/2 = 3

k = 2 : (x, y) = (41, 29)  
 N = (41 – 1)/2 = 20, m = (29 + 1)/2 = 15

k = 3 : (x, y) = (239, 169)  
 N = (239 – 1)/2 = 119, m = (169 + 1)/2 = 85

k = 4 : (x, y) = (1393, 985)  
 N = (1393 – 1)/2 = 696, m = (985 + 1)/2 = 493

k = 5 would give N = 4059 (> 1000), so we stop.

For each admissible pair (N, m) we verify (2), hence (1); therefore each m obtained truly satisfies the condition.

171,"Mad Ade was in his local news agents looking at the various magazines on display, He picked a copy of ""Kebabs and Me"" a copy of ""Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Nylon Underpants"" and a copy of ""Indoor Hang Gliding"". He passed the magazines to the shop keeper, who duly entered the amounts of each magazine into the till.  ""Wow, hang on a minute"" said Mad Ade.  ""You just pressed the multiplication button each time between amounts instead of the addition button.""  The shop keeper smiled with new false teeth and replied, ""it doesn't matter either way, it still comes to £5.70p"".
What were the prices of the magazines, that could either be multiplied or added to make £5.70",Two of the prices should add to the third price and multiply to 2 to produce equality,"£2.85*£1.60*£1.25= £5.70

 p + q + r = 5.70     (1)  
 p q r       = 5.70     (2)

because the total is the same whether the amounts are added or multiplied.

1.  Put the prices in “multiples of 5 p”.  
    One pound contains 20 lots of 5 p ( £1 = 20 × £0.05 ), so write  

 x = 20 p ,  y = 20 q ,  z = 20 r ,

so that x, y, z are positive integers.  
Multiplying (1) by 20 and (2) by 20³ gives

 x + y + z = 5.70 × 20 = 114    (3)  
 x y z      = 5.70 × 20³ = 5.70 × 8000 = 45 600  (4)

Hence we need integer triples (x, y, z) whose sum is 114 and whose product is 45 600.

2.  Factor 45 600:

 45 600 = 2⁵ · 3 · 5² · 19.

3.  Look for an integer x so that the quadratic produced for y has an integer root.

 Let x be any divisor of 45 600 with 1 ≤ x ≤ 38 (because x ≤ 114/3).  
 From (3) we have y + z = 114 − x, and from (4) y z = 45 600 / x.  
 Thus y satisfies:

  y² − (114 − x) y + 45 600 / x = 0.  (5)

 For y to be integral the discriminant Δ must be a perfect square:

  Δ = (114 − x)² − 4(45 600/x) must be a square.

 Trying the divisors of 45 600, the first value that makes Δ a square is x = 25:

  x = 25 ⇒ y + z = 89 , y z = 1 824  
  Δ = 89² − 4·1 824 = 7 921 − 7 296 = 625 = 25².

 Hence y and z are the roots:

  y = (89 + 25)/2 = 57,  z = (89 − 25)/2 = 32.

 (Any other choice of x only reproduces these numbers in a different order; no other
 integer triple satisfies both (3) and (4).)

4.  Convert back to pounds:

 p = x / 20 = 25/20 = £1.25  
 q = y / 20 = 57/20 = £2.85  
 r = z / 20 = 32/20 = £1.60

5.  Verification:

 Sum: 1.25 + 1.60 + 2.85 = 5.70  
 Product: 1.25 × 1.60 = 2.00; 2.00 × 2.85 = 5.70.

If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.

If N=2 and A=4, then E=6. R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.
If N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.
If N=2, then since R cannot be 5, R=8, L=5, and I=7.
If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.

Rejecting c₁ = 0 (it forces S + T = 5 but leaves no unused digits to make 5), we take c₁ = 1.  
Thus R + L = 13, E + A = 10, and I + R = 15 (so c₃ = 1).

Possible (R,L,I) from R + L = 13 and I = 15 – R are:

   (R,L,I) = (6,7,9), (7,6,8), (8,5,7), (9,4,6).

Now c₃ = 1.  First try S + T = 4 (so c₄ = 0).

• S + T = 4 ⇒ the only distinct pair among unused digits is {3,1}.  
  Choose (S,T) = (3,1).  Then O + S = 12 gives O = 9.

  This eliminates (R,L,I) = (6,7,9) and (9,4,6) (they reuse 9).  
  We are left with (R,L,I) = (7,6,8) or (8,5,7).

Take (R,L,I) = (8,5,7):

   R = 8, L = 5, I = 7, S = 3, T = 1, O = 9.

Digits used so far: {1,3,5,7,8,9}.  
Remaining digits: {2,4,6}.

Conditions E + A = 10 and N + A = 6 must now be met with {2,4,6}.  
Set A = 4, E = 6 (E + A = 10) and then N = 2 (N + A = 6).

For every adjacent pair (x,y) the two–digit number 10x+y must be composite.

Step 1.  Identify the forbidden pairs  
Check every possible pair of prime digits.  A pair is forbidden iff the two–digit number is prime.

 23, 53, 73, 37 are prime; all other two–digit numbers built from 2,3,5,7 are composite.  
Hence the only forbidden directed pairs are  

 2 → 3  5 → 3  7 → 3  3 → 7.

Allowed successors  
2 → {2,5,7}  3 → {2,3,5}  5 → {2,5,7}  7 → {2,5,7}.

Step 2.  Where can the digit 3 occur?  
If a 3 occurs inside the number (not in the first position) its predecessor must be 3; otherwise the pair would be 23, 53 or 73 – all forbidden.  
Consequently the very first 3 in the number must stand at the first position (or there would be no way to place any 3 at all).

Therefore every admissible 5-digit number must begin with 3.

Step 3.  Construct the largest admissible number  
Start with 3 and always take the largest allowed successor, remembering that every digit 2,3,5,7 has to appear at least once.

3 → 5 is allowed and maximises the second digit.

With prefix 35 the largest allowed third digit is 7 (because 5 → 7 is allowed).

Prefix 357 now contains 3,5,7; it still lacks a 2.  
After 7 the largest allowed digit is again 7; choose it for the fourth place (7 → 7 allowed).

Now only the digit 2 is still missing and 7 → 2 is allowed, so put 2 in the last place.

Number obtained: 35772  

Check: 35, 57, 77, 72 are all composite; all four prime digits appear.  
Thus 35772 is the largest possible.

Step 4.  Construct the smallest admissible number  
Again the number must start with 3.  Choose the smallest allowed successors each time, while still making sure every digit can appear.

3 → 2 is the smallest possible second digit.

After 32 the smallest allowed third digit is 2 (because 2 → 2 is allowed).

Now we have 322.  We still need 5 and 7.  
After the third digit 2 the smallest allowed digit that eventually lets a 7 follow is 5 (2 → 5 allowed).

Finally 5 → 7 is allowed and supplies the missing 7.

Number obtained: 32257  

Check: 32, 22, 25, 57 are all composite; all prime digits appear.  
No smaller construction is possible because the second digit already attains its minimum value 2.

177,"Once an old man died, and in his Will he stated that all the pearls he kept in a little bag were to be distributed among his daughters. To make things fair, the distribution must be done in the following way:

The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.

And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""

Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).
That is, k+1 = 7 and then k = 6.
So, the number of pearls is 6*6 = 36, and there were 6 girls.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

P₀ = number of pearls in the bag before the distribution,  
R_{k} = number of pearls remaining in the bag after the k-th girl has taken hers (so R₀ = P₀),  
g_k = number of pearls the k-th girl finally receives,  
n   = number of daughters.

Rule for the k-th girl (k = 1,2,…,n)
1. She first takes k pearls.  
2. From the pearls that are then left she takes one-seventh.

Hence, just before the k-th girl acts there are R_{k-1} pearls.

•  She takes k pearls ⇒ R_{k-1} – k remain.  
•  She then takes one-seventh of those ⇒ (R_{k-1} – k)/7.  

Therefore  
g_k = k + (R_{k-1} – k)/7,                     (1)  
R_k = R_{k-1} – k – (R_{k-1} – k)/7             (2)
     = (R_{k-1} – k) · 6/7.                     (3)

The will states that in the end every daughter has the same number of pearls; let that common number be C:

g_1 = g_2 = … = g_n = C.                       (4)

-------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Express R_{k-1} with C.
-------------------------------------------------
From (1) and (4):

C = k + (R_{k-1} – k)/7  
⇒ (R_{k-1} – k) = 7(C – k)  
⇒ R_{k-1} = 7C – 6k.                             (5)

-------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Express R_k with C in another way.
-------------------------------------------------
Insert (R_{k-1} – k) = 7(C – k) into (3):

R_k = 6/7 · 7(C – k) = 6(C – k).                 (6)

-------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Make the two formulas for R_k consistent.
-------------------------------------------------
Formula (5) for the next index (k replaced by k+1) must coincide with (6):

R_k = 7C – 6(k+1)   (from (5) with k→k+1)  
R_k = 6(C – k)      (from (6)).

Set them equal:

6(C – k) = 7C – 6k – 6  
⇔ 6C – 6k = 7C – 6k – 6  
⇔ 6C = 7C – 6  
⇔ C = 6.                                              (7)

So each daughter receives C = 6 pearls.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Determine all R_k and the total number of daughters.
-------------------------------------------------
Insert C = 6 in (6):

R_k = 6(6 – k) = 36 – 6k.                          (8)

R_k remains non–negative as long as k ≤ 6 and becomes zero when k = 6.  
Hence

n = 6      (there are six daughters)  
R₀ = 36    (initially 36 pearls).                  (9)

-------------------------------------------------
Step 5.  Verify the whole distribution.
-------------------------------------------------
k = 1: R₀ = 36  
        takes 1  → 35 left, takes 1/7 of 35 = 5, gets 1+5 = 6, R₁ = 30.  
k = 2: R₁ = 30  
        takes 2  → 28 left, takes 1/7 of 28 = 4, gets 2+4 = 6, R₂ = 24.  
k = 3: R₂ = 24  
        takes 3  → 21 left, takes 1/7 of 21 = 3, gets 3+3 = 6, R₃ = 18.  
k = 4: R₃ = 18  
        takes 4  → 14 left, takes 1/7 of 14 = 2, gets 4+2 = 6, R₄ = 12.  
k = 5: R₄ = 12  
        takes 5  → 7 left,  takes 1/7 of 7  = 1, gets 5+1 = 6, R₅ = 6.  
k = 6: R₅ = 6  
        takes 6  → 0 left,  takes 0,            gets 6,     R₆ = 0.

After the sixth girl the pearls are exhausted and every girl has exactly 6 pearls, as required.

179,"Weedy Willie was getting too old to work the land alone so he decided to divide his cornfield between himself and his four sons in proportion to their five work rates. He knew that Rastus, Wig, Twig and Swig together could plant a field of corn in five hours whereas Wig, Twig and Swig and himself together could manage the same task in six hours. So Weedy divided his field into a two-digit square number of parts and kept just one part for himself. Now, Wig, Twig and Swig were identical triplets so each received the same whole number of parts.

1.  R + 3x plants the field in 5 h  
   ⇒ 5(R + 3x)=1 ⇒ R + 3x = 1⁄5.                    (1)

2.  3x + W plants the field in 6 h  
   ⇒ 6(3x + W)=1 ⇒ 3x + W = 1⁄6.                     (2)

parts : (Willie, Rastus, Wig, Twig, Swig)  
    = (cW, cR, cx,  cx,  cx ).

Because Willie keeps exactly 1 part, cW = 1 ⇒ c = 1/W, whence

Rastus’s parts a = cR = R/W,  
each triplet’s parts b = cx = x/W,

with a and b required to be positive integers.

From (2): W = 1/6 − 3x.  
From (1): R = 1/5 − 3x.

Hence  

b = x/W = x / (1/6−3x) = 6x / (1−18x),  
a = R/W = (1/5−3x) / (1/6−3x) = (6/5−18x)/(1−18x).

Put z = 18x (0<z<1).  Then

b = z / [3(1−z)], so z = 3b/(1+3b),

a = (6/5−z)/(1−z) = (1+3b)(6/5−z)
   = (6/5)(1+3b) − 3b
   = (6 + 3b)/5 = 3(b+2)/5.

Thus a is integral exactly when b+2 is a multiple of 5.
Write b = 5k−2 (k = 1,2, …); then a = 3k.

The total number of parts is

N = 1 + a + 3b = 1 + 3k + 3(5k−2) = 18k − 5.

N must be a two-digit perfect square: 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81.

Checking k:

k=1 → N=13 (not a square)  
k=2 → N=31 (not a square)  
k=3 → N=49  ✅  
k=4 → N=67 (not a square)  
k≥5 → N>81.

Therefore k = 3 is the only possibility.

1,1, 2,2, 3,3, 4,4, 5,5, 6, 7, 9,9. (6 and 7 occur once, every other listed digit twice.)

Step 1.  Where can the digit 6 appear?  
The only two–digit primes containing 6 are 61 and 67.  
• If 67 were chosen, both digits 6 and 7 would already be used up, leaving the twelve
  remaining digits all in the set {1,2,3,4,5,9}.  
  The only primes that use only these digits are 11,13,19,23,29,31,41,43,53,59.

          1 = 1, 3 = 3,

Step 2.  Take care of the rarely appearing digits.

• Digit 2 appears only in the primes 23 and 29 ⇒ both 23 and 29 are compulsory.  
• Digit 5 appears only in the primes 53 and 59 ⇒ both 53 and 59 are compulsory.

After choosing 23, 29, 53, 59 the remaining digit–counts are

1 (once), 4 (twice), 7 (once); every other required digit is already satisfied.

Step 3.  Supply two 4’s, one 1 and one 7 with two further primes.

The only primes containing 4 are 41, 43, 47.

To obtain two 4’s together with exactly one 1 and one 7,
the only possible pair is 41 (digits 4,1) together with 47 (digits 4,7).

Step 4.  Assemble the complete set.

61, 23, 29, 53, 59, 41, 47

All seven primes are distinct; listing their digits shows each required digit used the proper number of times:

1 : 61,41  2 : 23,29  3 : 23,53  4 : 41,47  
5 : 53,59  6 : 61  7 : 47  9 : 29,59

Step 5.  Compute the sum.

61 + 23 + 29 + 53 + 59 + 41 + 47 = 313.

However, the problem says the arc can only intersect A and B. To do this, the circle must be slightly larger than the one described above. As stated in the problem, the larger arc must be the next largest integer size, which is 181 degrees.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the given perpendicular lines be the \(x\)- and \(y\)-axes with their intersection at the origin \(O\).

Draw a circle which touches the \(x\)-axis at \(A\) and the \(y\)-axis at \(B\), and nowhere else on either line.  
Because each line meets the circle in exactly one point, the two lines are tangents to the circle at \(A\) and \(B\).

1.  Position of the centre  
    If the circle has radius \(r\), its centre \(C\) must be a distance \(r\) from each of the two axes.  
    Hence \(C\) has coordinates \((\pm r,\pm r)\); that is, \(C\) lies on one of the two diagonal lines through \(O\).

2.  Radii \(CA\) and \(CB\)  
    The radius to a point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line.  
    Therefore
        – \(CA\) is perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis, so \(CA\) is vertical;  
        – \(CB\) is perpendicular to the \(y\)-axis, so \(CB\) is horizontal.  
    Vertical and horizontal lines are perpendicular, so
        ∠ACB = 90°.

3.  Measure of the minor arc \(AB\)  
    The central angle ∠ACB intercepts the minor arc \(AB\); hence that minor arc also measures 90°.

4.  Measure of the major arc \(AB\)  
    A full circle is 360°, so the major arc \(AB\) measures  
    360° − 90° = 270°.

No other configuration of a circle tangent to the two perpendicular lines is possible (the centre must always lie on a diagonal through \(O\)), and in every case the same 90° central angle occurs. Thus the larger arc always measures 270°, and that is already an integer number of degrees.

Kurt finally gave in, and agreed to go in with Rod on a minimum special order of the multi-colored treats.  When the box arrived, they divided the bounty as originally planned.
""Interesting,"" Kurt noted, ""that the number of Rnkfurers you got is the same integer as my percentage.""
Rod did a little mental math.  ""You're right,"" he noted, ""and I think that's the lowest pair of integers we could do that with.""
""Maybe; the next largest set is trivial.  50 Rnkfurers each, and then we'd each have the percentage the other guy got: 50% and 50 Rnkfurers each.""

""Fifty.""
""I think we'd better order a few.  And this time, it's my turn to get more than you do.""

Another way to look at this is
K = R*R/(100-R)",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the total number of Rnkfurers in any division be T.  
Let Rod’s share be R and Kurt’s share be K.

GENERAL RELATION  
If “Rod’s number equals Kurt’s percentage of the total’’ we have  

 K = (R / 100) · T, with R + K = T.  

Eliminating T gives  

 100K = R(R + K)  ⇒ (100 – R)K = R²  (1)

Thus K is an integer exactly when (100 – R) divides R².

A divisor argument.  
Put d = 100 – R (so 1 ≤ d ≤ 99 and R = 100 – d).  
Because R = 100 – d ≡ 100 (mod d), we have R² ≡ 100² (mod d).  
Hence d | R²  ⇔ d | 100² = 10000.  
Therefore every admissible d must be a divisor of 10000 (= 2⁴·5⁴).  
All such divisors below 100 are  

 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 40, 50, 80.

For each d we compute R = 100 – d and K = R²/d.

FIRST ORDER  
Rod’s tally equals Kurt’s percentage, and they want the smallest possible positive integers.  
Scanning the list above:

 d = 80 ⇒ R = 20, K = 20² / 80 = 5, T = 25.  

All smaller d’s give R ≥ 50 and K ≥ 50²/50 = 50, so (20, 5) is indeed the least positive solution.  

Hence in the minimum order  
 Rod received 20, Kurt received 5.  

SECOND ORDER  
Now Kurt is to receive more than Rod, but Rod’s number must still equal Kurt’s percentage, and the total must be an integral number of cases (50 per case).  
We keep the same condition (1) with K > R and K ≤ 100 (Kurt can store at most 100).  

From the list, the only divisor giving K ≤ 100 and K > R is d = 40:  

 d = 40 ⇒ R = 100 – 40 = 60, K = 60² / 40 = 90, T = 150.  

T = 150 is exactly three cases of 50, satisfying the packaging requirement, and Kurt gets more than Rod (90 > 60) while staying within his 100-unit limit.

FA means 10 F + A, DG means 10 D + G, etc.  
All letters A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H are different and stand for the eight digits 1–8.

The relations are

(1) (10F+ A)·A = 10C + F  
(2) (10D+ G)·A = 10B + A  
(3) H·E = 10D + H  
(4) F·A = C

Step 1.  From (4) C = F·A and C ≤ 8, so F·A ≤ 8.  
With digits 1–8 that gives the possibilities

 F=2, A=3, C=6  F=2, A=4, C=8  
 F=3, A=2, C=6  F=4, A=2, C=8

(the factor 1 is impossible because it would repeat a digit).

Step 2.  Use (2).  Write it as (10D + G)·A = 10B + A.  
Its right–hand side has unit digit A, so the unit digit of (10D+G)·A is also A:

 A·G ≡ A (mod 10) ⟹ A·G ≡ A (mod 10).

Now test each (F,A,C) possibility.

a) A = 3.  
 3·G ≡ 3 (mod 10) ⇒ G = 1.  
 Then 3(10D+1) = 10B+3 ⇒ 30D = 10B ⇒ 3D = B.  
 Since B ≤ 8, D = 1 gives B = 3 (repeat of A); D = 2 gives B = 6 (repeat of C).  
 No admissible solution.  So A ≠ 3.

b) A = 4.  
 4·G ≡ 4 (mod 10) ⇒ G = 1 or 6.

 • G = 1 : 4(10D+1)=10B+4 ⇒ 40D =10B ⇒ B =4D (repeat of A if D=1, repeat of C if D=2).  
  Impossible.

 • G = 6 : 4(10D+6)=10B+4 ⇒ 40D+24 =10B+4 ⇒ 4D+2 = B.  
  D = 1 → B=6 (repeat of G); D = 2 → B=10 (>8).  
  Impossible.  So A ≠ 4.

c) A = 2 with two sub–cases.

 i) F = 3, C = 6.  
  2·G ≡ 2 (mod 10) ⇒ G = 1 or 6.

  G = 1 : 2(10D+1)=10B+2 ⇒ 2D = B.  
   D =1→B=2 (repeat of A); D=2→B=4 (repeat of F); D=3→B=6 (repeat of C).  
   No solution.  

  G = 6 : 2(10D+6)=10B+2 ⇒ 20D+12=10B+2 ⇒ 2D+1 = B.  
   D =1→B=3 (repeat of F); D=2→B=5 (but D=A); D=3→B=7 (but D=F).  
   No solution.

 ii) F = 4, C = 8.  
  Again A = 2 gives 2·G ≡ 2 (mod 10) ⇒ G = 1 or 6.

  G = 1 : 2(10D+1)=10B+2 ⇒ 2D = B.

   D = 1 → B = 2 (repeat A)  
   D = 2 → B = 4 (repeat F)  
   D = 3 → B = 6  (allowed!)

  So we take A = 2, F = 4, C = 8, G = 1, D = 3, B = 6.

Step 3.  Determine E and H from (3):  H·E = 10D + H = 30 + H (because D = 3).

Only the two remaining digits 5 and 7 are unused.  Test the two possible orders:

 H = 5, E = 7 ⇒ 5·7 = 35 = 30 + 5 ✔  
 H = 7, E = 5 ⇒ 7·5 = 35 ≠ 37 ✘

So H = 5 and E = 7.

Step 4.  Verify every equation.

 FA = 42, 42·A = 42·2 = 84 = CF  (C = 8, F = 4)  
 F·A = 4·2 = 8 = C  
 DG = 31, 31·2 = 62 = BA (B = 6, A = 2)  
 H·E = 5·7 = 35 = DH (D = 3, H = 5)

All conditions are satisfied and every digit 1–8 is used exactly once.

Therefore

A = 2  
B = 6  
C = 8  
D = 3  
E = 7  
F = 4  
G = 1  
H = 5

185,What is the largest product of positive integers whose sum is 20?,"Note that 2*3 = 3*2, but 2^3 < 3^2","1458 = 3^6 x 2
Three is the smallest number whose product is greater than its sum.  Therefore you want to include as many 3's in the answer as possible.  Then make 2's (or 4's) out of the remainder.
20 / 3 = 6, remainder 2 so 3^6 x 2",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the positive integers whose sum is 20 be  
a₁, a₂, … , a_k (k ≥ 1), and let their product be  
P = a₁a₂⋯a_k.

Step 1.  Exclude 1’s.  
If some a_i = 1, merge it with any other part: replacing (1, x) by (1+x) keeps the sum the same and multiplies the product by (1+x)/x > 1, so a larger product is obtained.  
Hence no optimal partition contains 1.

Step 2.  Reduce parts ≥5.  
For m ≥ 5, compare m with 2+(m−2):  
m < 2(m−2) because m ≤ 2m−4 ⇔ 4 ≤ m, true for m ≥5.  
Thus replacing a part m ≥5 by (2, m−2) raises the product while keeping the sum 20. An optimal partition therefore contains no integer ≥5.

Step 3.  Handle the part 4.  
4 can be replaced by (2, 2): product 4 → 2·2 = 4, leaving the product unchanged but giving only 2’s and 3’s, which will be useful next. Hence any 4 may be taken as two 2’s without loss.

Conclusion so far: every part is 2 or 3.

Step 4.  Decide between 2’s and 3’s.  
Compare three 2’s with two 3’s:  
2·2·2 = 8 < 3·3 = 9.  
Thus, to maximize the product, we should use as many 3’s as possible, introducing 2’s only when necessary to make the sum 20.

Step 5.  Apply to the sum 20.  
Write 20 = 3q + r with 0 ≤ r < 3:  
q = 6 and r = 2, because 20 = 3·6 + 2.

Therefore the optimal partition is  
20 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2  
(six 3’s and one 2).

Step 6.  Compute the product.  
P_max = 3⁶ · 2 = 729 · 2 = 1458.

All earlier steps showed that any other partition either lowers or cannot increase the product, so 1458 is the largest possible product.

B = 5A.  
Both numbers together must use every digit 1-9 exactly once and must not contain the digit 0.

1.  Length of the numbers  
   •  If A has 3 digits, 5A ≤ 4995, so B would have at most 4 digits → total < 9 digits.  
   •  If A has 4 digits, 2000 ≤ A ≤ 9999 and 10000 ≤ 5A ≤ 49995, so B has 5 digits → total 9 digits.  
   Hence A must be 4-digit and B must be 5-digit.

2.  Last digit consideration  
   The last digit d of A determines the last digit of B: 5d (mod 10).  
   Because the digit 0 is forbidden and no digit may repeat, d cannot be even (giving 0) nor 5 (giving another 5).  
   Therefore d ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}, and B must end in 5.

3.  Trial d = 3 (the only value that works)

          -----------------
              e   f   g   h   5   = B

   Working from the units place leftwards:

   • Units: 5·3 = 15 ⇒ B ends in 5, carry 1 to the tens column.  
   • Tens: 5c + 1 must give a digit h ≠ 0,5 with carry ⩾0.  
     The only possibilities are
           c = 1 or 7 or 9  ⇒  h = 6  (carry 0 or 3 or 4 respectively).

   Choose c = 7 (carry 3) because the other choices ultimately force an illegal 0 or duplicate 5 later.

   • Hundreds: compute 5b + 3.  To avoid the digit 0 or 5 in B, we need
           b = 1 or 9  ⇒  g = 8  (carry 0 or 4 respectively).

   Take b = 9 (carry 4).

   • Thousands & ten-thousands: 5a + 4 produces the two leading digits f (thousands) and e (ten-thousands).
     With digits still unused {1,2,4}, and remembering B must start with 1–4, the only choice that fits is
           a = 2  ⇒  5·2 + 4 = 14  ⇒  f = 4,  e = 1.

4.  The numbers obtained  
   A = 2 9 7 3 = 2973  
   B = 1 4 8 6 5 = 14865

5.  Verification  
   5 × 2973 = 14865, and the combined digits are
   1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 – each exactly once.

He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let

     – A false  ⇒ N a multiple of 4.  
     – C false  ⇒ N a multiple of 6.  
     Together N must be a multiple of lcm(4,6)=12; the only such numbers near 50–59 are 48 and 60, none in the interval.  Impossible.

2. 60 ≤ N ≤ 69  
   • Statement 1 is automatically true.  
   • Statements 2 and 3 need false antecedents:  
     – B false ⇒ N not a multiple of 3.  
     – C false ⇒ N a multiple of 6 (hence a multiple of 3).  
     These two requirements contradict each other.  Impossible.

3. 70 ≤ N ≤ 79  
   • Statement 3 is automatically true.  
   • Statements 1 and 2 need false antecedents:  
     – A false ⇒ N a multiple of 4.  
     – B false ⇒ N not a multiple of 3.  
   Within 70–79 the multiples of 4 are 72 and 76.  
   – 72 is divisible by 3 (violates B false).  
   – 76 is not divisible by 3 and satisfies both conditions above.

Thus N = 76 satisfies all three statements.

4. N outside 50–79  
   All three conclusions would be false, forcing  
   – A false (N multiple of 4),  
   – B false (N not multiple of 3),  
   – C false (N multiple of 6, hence multiple of 3),  
   which is impossible.  Hence N cannot lie outside 50–79.

The only possible number is therefore 76.

192,"Little Johnny was at it again.
His big brother had some small race cars that he wanted to play with, and his brother did not want him to have them.
Finally, he made a deal with Little Johnny.  If he could figure out the math problem that his teacher had given them that afternoon, he'd let him have the cars for a week.
The problem was to figure out the following.
IT + TAKES + A + LITTLE = EFFORT
The numbers 0-9 are used and the teacher had already told them that A = 9 and E = 7.  Little Johnny's brother could not figure it out, so he knew that he'd be safe.
Ten minutes later, Little Johnny's mother was watching while his big brother grudgingly gave up his cars for a week.
Can you figure out what the letters represent, like Little Johnny?","Note that L must equal 6, and then that T + I must be at least 9 if 1 was carried over","Note that L must equal 6, and then that T + I must be at least 9 if 1 was carried over I = 8; S + E = 11 or 1

A = 9
K = 2
E = 7
S = 4
L = 6
F = 0
R = 3
O = 5
So,
81 + 19274 + 9 + 681167 = 700531",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"The addition must be performed column by column, using the facts that  
• each of the ten different letters represents a different digit 0-9,  
• A = 9 and E = 7 are already fixed,  
• no leading digit is zero,  
• normal decimal carries apply.

Write the sum right-aligned:

            I  T
        T  9  K  7  S
                   9
   L  I  T  T  L  7

   7  F  F  O  R  T

Work from right to left.

1. Units column  
   T + S + 9 + 7 = T + 10 c₁  
   ⇒ S + 16 = 10 c₁.  
   The only digit S (≠7,9) that makes the left side a multiple of 10 is S = 4, giving c₁ = 2.

2. Ten-thousands column (leftmost)  
   L + c₅ = 7 (because the sum’s leading digit is 7 and there is no further carry).  
   Since c₅ ≥ 1, the only possibility is c₅ = 1 and L = 6.

3. Thousands column  
   T + I + c₄ = F + 10 (because c₅ = 1).  
   Hence F = T + I + c₄ – 10.  (★)

4. Hundreds column  
   9 + T + c₃ = F + 10 c₄.  (★★)

5. Comparing (★) and (★★) forces c₄ = 1, c₃ = 0 and I = 8.

6. Then (★) gives F = T – 1.  
   Allowed pairs (distinct digits still unused) are (T,F) = (1,0), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3); but T = 4 is impossible because S = 4.  
   Keep possibilities (1,0) or (2,1) or (3,2).

7. Tens column  
   I + 7 + L + c₁ = R + 10 c₂  
   ⇒ 8 + 7 + 6 + 2 = 23 = R + 10 c₂  
   ⇒ c₂ = 2 and R = 3.

   Because R is already 3, T cannot be 3, so (T,F) = (3,2) is ruled out.
   Remaining possibilities: (T,F) = (1,0) or (2,1).

8. Hundreds column again  
   K + T + c₂ = O (because c₃ = 0)  
   ⇒ K + T + 2 = O.

   Remaining unused digits are {0,2,5} or {0,5} depending on T.

   • If (T,F) = (1,0): digits left are {2,5}.  
     With T = 1, K + 3 = O.  
     Choosing K = 2 gives O = 5 and uses every remaining digit exactly once.  
   • If (T,F) = (2,1): digits left are {0,5}.  
     With T = 2, K + 4 = O.  
     K = 0 gives O = 4, but 4 is already S.  
     K = 5 gives O = 9, but 9 is A.  Impossible.

   Hence the only consistent assignment is  
   T = 1, F = 0, K = 2, O = 5.

All ten digits are now assigned uniquely:

A = 9,  E = 7,  I = 8,  T = 1,  
S = 4,  L = 6,  K = 2,  F = 0,  O = 5,  R = 3.

Check:

   IT       = 81
 + TAKES    = 19274
 + A        = 9
 + LITTLE   = 681167

   EFFORT   = 700531

The addition is correct, confirming the unique solution.

96 – 77 = 19  
117 – 96 = 21  

Those differences themselves rise by 2 each time.  A constant second difference indicates g(n) is quadratic of the form g(n)=an²+bn+c, with second difference 2a.  
Since the second difference here is 2, a = 1, so g(n)=n²+bn+c.

Use two data points to find b and c.

For n = 8: 64 + 8b + c = 60 → 8b + c = −4  

Subtract: (8b + c) − (7b + c) = b = 0.  
Hence b = 0, and then c = −4.

Thus g(n) = n² − 4.

It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule.

Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.
If a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities.

198,"Detective Grant was inspecting the scene of the crime. The 50-year-old victim, Joe, had been poisoned by a candy containing cyanide. On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table. John, 46, was found with 5 candies the day after a 4-yr sentence had been turned over a week ago. Jim, 35, had gotten off a 5-yr sentence a few days ago, only to be found dead with 6 candies yesterday.
Grant puzzled over these cases for days, and then -boom- it hit him. There was a pattern in these murders! What pattern did Grant spot?
Each suspect ate a candy before they died.
Life expectancy when the murders were committed was 70 years.
(It was also curious that many criminals had been let off their sentences too, but had not been killed. 23, in fact, had gotten off.)","SUSPECT--AGE--SENTENCE--CANDIES

He then went to the criminal's house, and offered him a chance to gamble his life, or go to jail. George offered him a certain number of candies, one of which was poisoned. If the criminal chose a poisoned candy, he died. If he chose a pure candy, he lived.
The criminal's remaining life expectancy divided by his prison sentence would be the number of candies George would bring him, one of which might kill him. In the case of Joe:
His remaining life expectancy at age 50 was 20. 20 divided by 2(his sentence) is 10. George brought him 10 candies, one of which was poisoned. Joe ate the poisoned one, and left nine on the table.

Check the four dead men  

• Joe : 70 − 50 = 20; 20 ÷ 2 yr = 10 ⇒ 10 candies (1 poisoned + 9 left)

...where negative numbers indicate weights that are on the same side of the wheat and positive numbers indicate weights that have been placed on the opposite side of the wheat.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the four integer weights be  
w₁ < w₂ < w₃ < w₄ .  
They are to be used on either pan of a balance, together with the wheat, so that every whole number of kilograms from 1 kg to 40 kg can be balanced.

1.  Basic fact about balanced weights  
   If weights may be placed on both pans, every weighing corresponds to an equation  

             ±w₁ ± w₂ ± w₃ ± w₄ = N,              (†)  

   where N (1 ≤ N ≤ 40) is the mass of wheat being weighed and each “±’’ is –1, 0 or +1  
   (−1 means the weight is put on the same pan as the wheat, +1 on the opposite pan, 0 not used).

   Suppose that with the first k−1 weights we can realize every integer in the interval
   −S_{k−1} … +S_{k−1}, where  

             S_{k−1}=w₁+⋯+w_{k−1}.  

   When weight w_k is added we can form all numbers in  

             −S_{k−1}−w_k … +S_{k−1}+w_k.                         (1)

   For these intervals to join without a gap we must have  

             w_k ≤ 1 + 2S_{k−1}.                                   (2)

   (If w_k were larger than that, the positive number S_{k−1}+1 could not be obtained.)

   Condition (2) is not only necessary; if we choose the largest admissible value  
   w_k = 1 + 2S_{k−1} the reachable interval grows as fast as possible.

2.  Determining the weights successively  

   •  First weight.  To weigh 1 kg we must have w₁ = 1.

   •  Second weight.  With w₁ = 1 we have S₁ = 1, so (2) gives  
        w₂ ≤ 1 + 2·1 = 3.  
      Taking the maximal value gives w₂ = 3 and S₂ = 1 + 3 = 4.

   •  Third weight.  Now (2) yields  
        w₃ ≤ 1 + 2·4 = 9.  
      Choosing the maximal value gives w₃ = 9 and S₃ = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.

   •  Fourth weight.  Finally  
        w₄ ≤ 1 + 2·13 = 27.  
      Again taking the maximal value gives w₄ = 27 and S₄ = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.

3.  Verification  
   Because at each step we took the largest weight allowed by (2), the set
   {1, 3, 9, 27} attains the greatest total 40 kg that four weights can cover.
   Equation (1) with k = 4 then reads that every integer from −40 to +40, hence in particular every N from 1 to 40, can be expressed in form (†).  Therefore any whole-number mass up to 40 kg can indeed be weighed.

4.  Uniqueness  
   If any of the inequalities in (2) were strict, S₄ would drop below 40 and some mass would become unobtainable.  Hence equality must hold at every stage, forcing
   w₁, w₂, w₃, w₄ to be exactly 1, 3, 9, 27.

Consequently, the four required weights are:

1 kg, 3 kg, 9 kg and 27 kg.

201,"Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Snow, there lived the fair Princess Miyuki, who had always been fascinated by fairy tales and the stories of the wonders of the world. She believed that her sleeping, handsome prince was cursed to be one of the mummies in the pyramids of Egypt, and when she was done being Fantaghiro-saving-her-Romualdo, her prince would then build a beautiful palace as a monument of their love (which of course would be more beautiful than Taj Mahal) where both of them will live happily ever after...
So, you see, that's why Princess Miyuki had refused each and every love declaration or marriage proposal that came her way.
But of course, what's a story without the brave and wise heroic prince? Here comes Prince Hajikidama of the Marbles Kingdom. He's no mummy, but his brilliant(?) brain deduced that in order to win the princess' heart, he'd have to give her what she wanted most - her fantasy, and his token of understanding (her childish delusional nature).
In the end, labouring his mind's creativity department for all its worth, Prince Hajikidama decided that a 'Mountain of Love', reaching so high it collected the never-fallen-snow in Marbles Kingdom, might do the trick. That actually is a tetrahedral-shaped (pyramid with 4 equilateral triangular faces) crystallic marbles-made structure (like a giant pile of apples or oranges at a greengrocer's store) consisting of one marble crowning on the top layer, three on the next-to-top layer, six on the third layer, ten on the fourth layer, and so forth.

Because the three consecutive integers contain the factors 2 and 3, cancel 6 first:

1 000 002 ÷ 3 = 333 334, 1 000 000 ÷ 2 = 500 000.

Thus

S = 500 000 × 333 334 × 1 000 001

""He's wrong,"" the other one insisted.  ""My answer is right!""
Corman leaned over to whisper in Nora's ear, ""Does she need our help?""
""Yours, probably.  Mr. Collins is at a conference for the weekend, and Monette took his math class.  It looks like she handed back an exam.""
""I teach math.  Can I help?""
All three talked at once; Monette was as frustrated as the two students.  While they jabbered, Corman managed to read the problem in question:
""My house is built on a strangely-shaped lot, so my back yard is a right triangle with an area of 840 square feet.  Each of the three sides measures an integral number of feet.  If I want to stake my dog so that he can reach the entire yard, how long must his rope be?""
Monette finally pulled rank on the adolescents.  ""It's not really your problem, but I'd be glad of some help.  Mr. Collins marked their papers wrong; their answers don't match his.  The students *sound* right, but math was too long ago for me; I'm not sure.  To make matters worse, they don't even agree with each other.""
""I see,"" said Corman, playing for time while he mentally checked the answer on the key in Monette's trembling hand.  ""That's the answer Mr. Collins left you?""
""Yes,"" she began.
""The right answer is 8 feet shorter,"" the blond claimed.

From the students' comments, we know that the Collins yard has the middle-sized hypotenuse.
A right triangle inscribes neatly into a semicircle, with the hypotenuse forming a diameter.  The shortest rope needed to reach all points is one staked at the midpoint of the hypotenuse, forming a radius of the circle.  74/2 = 37 feet.
The blond student found the first answer above, and would have used a rope of 29 feet.  The other student figured it at 113/2, or 56.5 feet.

Lewis Carroll searched for the answer to the basic mathematical problem, sent to him by a reader.  He found two right triangles with the same area, but couldn't discover a set of three.

206,"Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

 P  = selling price per box (dollars)  
 C  = production / marketing cost per box (dollars)  
 Q  = number of boxes sold per week  

1.  Find the cost per box.  
   At the observed figures  
  price 5.95 $, profit per box 1.75 $.  
   Hence  
  C = 5.95 $ – 1.75 $ = 4.20 $.

2.  Express sales Q as a function of price P.  
   Each 0.20 $ decrease in P raises weekly sales by 25 boxes, so the slope is  

  ΔQ / ΔP = –25 boxes / 0.20 $ = –125 boxes per dollar.

   Taking the point (P,Q) = (5.95, 100) we obtain the linear demand relation  

  Q = 100 – 125 (P – 5.95)  
   = –125 P + 843.75.   (1)

  –250 P + 1368.75 = 0  
  P = 1368.75 / 250 = 5.475.

5.  Interpret the result.  
   The vertex of the profit parabola occurs at P ≈ 5.475 $.  
   Rounded to ordinary cents, the optimum price is about \$5.48 per box.

So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote an equation on a rock:

So, what is the password?",There is some casework to be done on D; obviously we have that S = 1,"The password is LENS.
Since SL-D=3 or (SL-1)-D=3 (meaning SL-D=4), and since the highest possible sum of two different one-digit numbers is 17, S must equal 1.
Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.
Suppose D=7. Then L is 0 or 1, and since S=1, L=0. A must be 1 or 2, but since S=1, A=2.
Suppose D=8. Then L is 1 or 2, and since S=1, L=2. A must be 2 or 3, but since L=2, A=3.
Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.
Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.
If D=7, then L=0. But since 10-7=3, D cannot be 7.
If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.
If E=4, then N=3. But if D=8, A=3, and if D=9, L=3 and A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=5, then since 1I-E=6, I=1. But since S=1, this cannot work.
If E=7, then I=3. But if D=8, then A=3, and if D=9, then L=3. So this cannot work.
If E=8, then I=4, and D cannot be 8. But if D=9, then A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=9, then N=8, and D cannot be 8 or 9. So this cannot work.
Therefore, E=6, N=5, and I=2. If D=8, then L=2, so D must equal 9. This means:

• each letter is a different decimal digit,  
• ordinary right-hand alignment is understood,  
• 3651 is the four–digit result that appears.

Work column by column, keeping the possible borrows.

1. Units column:  
   E – N ≡ 1 (mod 10).  
   Two possibilities:
   (i) no borrow → E = N + 1, b₁ = 0;  
   (ii) borrow → E + 10 – N = 1 → E = 0, N = 9, b₁ = 1.

2. Tens column (result 5):  
   D – A – b₁ ≡ 5 (mod 10).  
   So  
   if b₂ = 0 (no new borrow) → D – A = 5 + b₁;  
   if b₂ = 1 (borrow)    → D – A = b₁ – 5.

3. Hundreds column (result 6):  
   I – E – b₂ ≡ 6 (mod 10).  
   Hence  
   if b₃ = 0 → I – E – b₂ = 6;  
   if b₃ = 1 → I – E – b₂ = –4.

4. Thousands column (result 3, and a borrow must pass to the next column because SLIDE is five-digit while the result is four-digit):
   L – D – b₃ + 10 = 3 ⇒ L – D – b₃ = –7.  
   Therefore  
        D – L = 7 – b₃.  
   So
        if b₃ = 0 → D – L = 7;  
        if b₃ = 1 → D – L = 6.

5. Ten-thousands column: since the result has no digit here, the only way to obtain 0 is
        S – (borrow) = 0 ⇒ borrow = 1 and thus S = 1.

Because a borrow really did pass, we must have b₃ = 1, and from (4)
        D – L = 6.

Now distinguish possibilities for the earlier borrows.

(i) Let b₁ = 0 (so E = N + 1).  
    In the tens column choose b₂ = 0 (otherwise D – A would be negative and impossible with D – L = 6).  
    Then
        D – A = 5, I – E – b₂ = –4  (since b₃ = 1)  
        ⇒ I = E – 4.

    With D – L = 6 and digits 0–9 distinct, the only admissible values are  
        L = 3, D = 9 (then A = 4) .
    Now choose E ≥ 5 so that I = E – 4 is non-negative and all digits are still distinct.  
    Taking E = 6 gives N = 5 and I = 2, all different from 1,3,4,9.  

    This yields the assignment  
        S=1, L=3, I=2, D=9, E=6, A=4, N=5.

    Check: 13296 – 9645 = 3651, exactly as required.

(ii) All other combinations of borrows lead to contradictions or digit repetitions, so the assignment above is unique.

Thus the completed subtraction is  

          13296
        –  9645
        --------

Finally, the troll said that “the letters in the password represent 3651.”  
From the solution:

     then subtract 4 for each pair of identical consecutive letters.

All the other names have no such pair, so (1) suffices for them; “Greece”, with one pair, loses 4 and becomes 30, exactly as printed.

Step 3 – apply the rule to Tibet  
“Tibet” has

   • length L = 5,  
   • no pair of identical consecutive letters.

Therefore  

        figure = 7·5 – 8 = 35 – 8 = 27.

Finally we put back the three zeros that the computer always tacks on:

        27 → 270 000.

b) How far (to the nearest inch) do you have to walk to return to your starting position?","Do it on paper, unless you need the exercise!","a) You have walked 1060 feet.
b) You have to walk 73 feet, 9 inches
Explanation
There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100, neither of which is prime.  (No, 1 is not prime.)  So you will walk in an expanding square with sides of length 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 feet.  This is a total of 1060 feet.
The net result of your turns will be that you are 56 feet ahead of your starting position.
(2+11+23+41+59+73+97)
- (5+17+31+47+67+83)
You will also be 48 feet to the left of your starting position.
(7+19+37+53+71+89)
- (3+13+29+43+61+79)
To calculate the distance back to the starting position, calculate the length of the hypotenuse of the right angle triangle with legs that are 56 and 48 feet long.  This is 73.756 feet, or 73 feet, 9 inches.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"a)  The distance actually walked is the sum of all the prime‐number segment lengths.  
   Primes less than 100:

   + 31 + 37 + 41 + 43 + 47 + 53 + 59 + 61 + 67 + 71  
   + 73 + 79 + 83 + 89 + 97 = 1060.

   Therefore the total distance walked is 1 060 ft.

b)  Place the starting point at the origin of an x-y grid, with the first step (length 2) taken due east.  
   Turning right 90° after each step makes the directions cycle

        East, South, West, North, East, …

        West  :  –5, –17, –31, –47, –67, –83        →  ΣW = –250
        North :  +7, +19, +37, +53, +71, +89        →  ΣN =  276
        South :  –3, –13, –29, –43, –61, –79        →  ΣS = –228

   Net displacement

The clues below reflect the price of the items before the discount is applied.
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.

less 10% discount $12.60 $14.50 $2.50 $29.60
Amount spent $113.40 $130.50 $22.50 $266.40
Explanation:
First find the original price of all the items combined. $266.40 is the price after the 10% discount was applied.
That means $266.40 is equal to 90% of the original price.
Write an equation and then cross multiply:
266.40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x   =   9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)
Let x = the amount Alec spent on trucks.
x + (x+5) = 75
2x + 5 = 75
2x = 70
x = 35
Alec spent $35 on trucks. Brett spent $5 more than Alec. Therefore, Brett spent $40 on trucks.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51
x + (2x + 3) = 51
3x + 3 = 51
3x = 48
x = 16
Alec's spent $16 on bearings.

AD, BD  = prices of Alec’s and Brett’s decks  
AT, BT  = prices of their trucks  
AB, BB  = prices of their bearings  
S       = price of one set of four wheels  
(Chris buys only wheels; Alec and Brett buy one set each.)

1. Three equal sets of wheels cost \$75  
 ⇒ S = 75 / 3 = \$25.  
   Total wheels cost = \$75.

2. Bearings cost \$24 less than wheels  
 ⇒ AB + BB = 75 – 24 = \$51.            (1)

3. Bearings total is \$1 more than Alec’s deck  
 ⇒ AD + 1 = 51  ⇒  AD = \$50.          (2)

4. Alec’s deck is \$5 more than Brett’s  
 ⇒ BD = AD – 5 = 50 – 5 = \$45.        (3)

5. Brett’s trucks cost \$5 more than Alec’s  
 ⇒ BT = AT + 5.                        (4)

6. Brett’s bearings cost \$3 more than twice Alec’s  
 ⇒ BB = 2·AB + 3.                      (5)

Using (1) and (5):  
 AB + (2·AB + 3) = 51  
 3AB + 3 = 51 ⇒ 3AB = 48 ⇒ AB = \$16.  
 Then BB = 2·16 + 3 = \$35.

7. Sub-total so far (without trucks):

Decks 50 + 45 = 95  
Bearings 16 + 35 = 51  
Wheels 75  
Total 95 + 51 + 75 = \$221.

8. The amount before the 10 % discount is T, and they paid 266.40 after the discount:  
 0.90 T = 266.40 ⇒ T = 296.  
   Therefore the two truck prices must add to 296 – 221 = \$75.

With (4):  
 AT + (AT + 5) = 75 ⇒ 2AT = 70 ⇒ AT = \$35, BT = \$40.

Thus each boy’s own cost before the discount is

Alec: 50 + 35 + 16 + 25 = \$126  
Brett: 45 + 40 + 35 + 25 = \$145  
Chris: 25.

Applying the 10 % discount (multiplying by 0.9):

Alec: 0.9 × 126 = \$113.40  
Brett: 0.9 × 145 = \$130.50  
Chris: 0.9 × 25  = \$22.50.

These add to 266.40, the amount actually paid.

 minute–hand θₘ(t) = 6 t   (degrees, because it turns 360° in 60 min)

Because the two hands are identical, a dial-reading at a time t will also be obtained at
another time s>0 iff the two (unordered) angles {θₕ, θₘ} coincide.  There are two ways
this can occur.

1.  θₕ(t)=θₕ(s) and θₘ(t)=θₘ(s).  
    That requires each hand to have returned to its original position separately; the
    minute hand does that every 60 min and the hour hand only after 12 h, so the first
    such repeat is not until 12 h have passed – far later than we are looking for.

2.  θₕ(t)=θₘ(s) and θₘ(t)=θₕ(s) (the two hands have interchanged their
    positions).  Writing this out:

  ½ t ≡ 6 s (mod 360°)                     (1)  
  6 t ≡ ½ s (mod 360°)                     (2)

Multiply each congruence by 2 to clear the fraction:

  t − 12s = 720k                           (1′)  
  12t − s  = 720ℓ                           (2′)   (k,ℓ integers)

Solve (1′) for t and substitute in (2′):

  t = 12s + 720k  
  12(12s + 720k) − s = 720ℓ  
  144s + 8640k − s = 720ℓ  
  143s = 720ℓ − 8640k                (∗)

To get the smallest positive time s, choose the smallest positive value of
N = 720ℓ − 8640k.  Since 8640 = 12·720, write N = 720(ℓ − 12k).
The least positive value is obtained when ℓ − 12k = 1, i.e. ℓ = 12k + 1.
Then

  s = 720 / 143  minutes.

With k = 0, ℓ = 1 this gives

  s = 720⁄143 min = 5 min   5⁄143 min
   = 5 min   300⁄143 s ≈ 5 min  2.098 s.

(The later partner time is t = 12s = 8640⁄143 min = 1 h 0 min 25.175 s.)

For any time earlier than 720⁄143 minutes, the number N in (∗) would have to be
negative or zero, giving no positive solution; hence no ambiguity can arise before
this moment.

Step 1.  Determine the rate of one artist.  
2.5 artists finish 2.5 paintings in 2.5 hours.  
Hence the total work rate is  

   (2.5 paintings)/(2.5 hours) = 1 painting per hour.

Because that rate is produced by 2.5 artists, the rate per artist is  

   (1 painting per hour)/(2.5 artists) = 0.4 painting per artist-hour.

Equivalently, one artist needs  

   1 / 0.4 = 2.5 hours  

to complete one painting.

Step 2.  Express work done by A artists in T hours.

222,"Homer had always contemplated the size of the old oak tree in the field behind his house.  Standing 5 feet away from the 8 foot high fence in the back of the yard, he could just barely see the top leaves of the tree over the top of the fence.  He knew that the tree was 200 feet from the fence.  Homer was 6 feet tall, making his line of vision, 67 inches from the ground.
Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.","TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches
Tree height from eye level = TAN (25.80 deg) * 2460 inches = 1189 inches
Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.  With the measurement capabilities available to any lumberjack (or any average Homer) precise measurements are not possible.  Thus the need to clarify these calculations as estimates.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  
A = Homer’s eye, 5 ft in front of the fence;  
B = the top of the fence (8 ft high);  
C = the top of the tree (unknown height H);  
D = the foot of the tree, 200 ft behind the fence.

Horizontal distances  
AB (Homer to fence) = 5 ft,  
BD (fence to tree) = 200 ft.

Vertical heights (measured from the ground)  
A = 67 in = 5 ft 7 in = 5.583 ft,  
B = 8 ft,  
C = H ft.

Because Homer’s line of sight just skims the fence top, points A, B, C are collinear.  
Therefore the small right triangle with base AB and height (B–A) is similar to the large right triangle with base BD and height (C–B):

(B − A) / AB = (C − B) / BD.

Substitute the known numbers:

(8 − 5.583) ft / 5 ft = (H − 8) ft / 200 ft  
⇒ 2.417 / 5 = (H − 8) / 200  
⇒ H − 8 = 200 · (2.417 / 5) = 96.67 ft

Hence the old oak is a little over 100 ft tall.

Hence carry₁ is 0, 1, 2 or 3 according as D is 1–2, 3–4, 6–7 or 8–9.

Step 2.  Examine each value of carry₁ with conditions (3) and (4).

• carry₁ = 0 (D = 1 or 2)  
  Trying every C = 0,…,9 never satisfies both (3) and (4) simultaneously.

• carry₁ = 1 (D = 3 or 4)  
  Again no pair (B,C) satisfies both (3) and (4).

• carry₁ = 2 (D = 6 or 7)  
  One reaches C = 6, B = 6, carry₂ = 2, but digits then repeat and (5) fails.

• carry₁ = 3 (D = 8 or 9)  
  Put carry₁ = 3 into (3):

      4C + 3 = 10·carry₂ + B.

  Testing C = 0,…,9 yields the unique possibility

      C = 7, B = 1, carry₂ = 3.

  For this choice, compute carry₃ from (4):

      4B + carry₂ = 4·1 + 3 = 7 = 10·0 + 7,
      so carry₃ = 0.

  Now use (5):

      D = 4A + carry₃ = 4A.

  Since we are in the branch carry₁ = 3, we must have D = 8 or 9.

  • If D = 8, then 4A = 8 ⇒ A = 2, which is acceptable.

  • If D = 9, then 4A = 9 gives a non-integer A.  Impossible.

Thus the only consistent digit assignment is  

A = 2, B = 1, C = 7, D = 8.

Step 3.  Verification.

Since A is the highest digit, A is at most 2. However, because 1 is carried from the ones digits to the tens digits, A must equal 2, otherwise L will be 0. A=2 and L=7. The tens digits carry 2 to the hundreds digits, and the hundreds digits must carry 2 to the thousands digits. To avoid zero or duplicate numbers, F can only be 8 and W be 6. A+W+A+Y=2+6+2+5=15.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Because the same three–digit number F L Y is added to itself three times,

3 × (100 F + 10 L + Y) = 1000 A + 100 W + 10 A + Y.  (1)

Column-by-column addition gives stronger conditions.

1. Units column  
   Y + Y + Y = 3Y ends in Y.  
   Thus 3Y ≡ Y (mod 10) ⇒ 2Y ≡ 0 (mod 10) ⇒ Y = 5  
   (Y ≠ 0 by hypothesis).

   The sum 3Y = 15 contributes a carry 1 to the tens column.

2. Tens column  
   3L + 1 (the carry) produces the tens digit A and a carry C₁ to the
   hundreds column:

   A = (3L + 1) mod 10,  C₁ = ⌊(3L + 1)/10⌋.  (2)

3. Hundreds column

   thousands column:

   W = (3F + C₁) mod 10,  C₂ = ⌊(3F + C₁)/10⌋.  (3)

4. Thousands column  
   The thousands digit is A again, so

   C₂ = A.  (4)

Since the carry C₂ can only be 1 or 2 (because 3F ≤ 27 and C₁ ≤ 2),
equation (4) forces A ∈ {1, 2}.  

• If A = 1, then from (2) we need 3L ≡ 0 (mod 10), which is impossible
for any non-zero L.  
• Hence A = 2 and therefore C₂ = 2.

From (2) with A = 2:
3L + 1 ≡ 2 (mod 10) ⇒ 3L ≡ 1 (mod 10) ⇒ L = 7,
giving 3L + 1 = 22 and thus C₁ = 2.

Now use (3) with C₁ = 2 and C₂ = 2:
⌊(3F + 2)/10⌋ = 2 ⇒ 20 ≤ 3F + 2 ≤ 29 ⇒ F ∈ {6, 7, 8, 9}.

• F = 6 gives W = 0 (digit 0 is forbidden).  
• F = 7 gives W = 3 (but L = 7, digits must differ).  
• F = 9 gives W = 9 (duplicates F).  
• F = 8 gives W = 6 (all digits distinct and non-zero).

Thus the unique consistent assignment is
F L Y = 8 7 5 and A W A Y = 2 6 2 5.

Finally,
A + W + A + Y = 2 + 6 + 2 + 5 = 15.

231,What is the smallest integer greater than 0 that can be written entirely with zeros and ones and is evenly divisible by 225?,,"The prime factorization of 225 is 5*5*3*3. So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.
All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let N be a positive integer whose decimal representation uses only the digits 0 and 1 and that is divisible by 225.

1.  Conditions forced by divisibility  
   • 225 = 9 × 25.  
   • Divisibility by 25 ⇒ the last two decimal digits of N must be 00.  
   • Divisibility by 9 ⇒ the sum of the decimal digits of N must be a multiple of 9.

2.  Structure of N  
   Write the decimal form of N as  
        a₁a₂…a_{k-2}00 ,  
   where each a_i ∈ {0,1} and a₁ = 1 (no leading zeros).

   The digit-sum of N equals the number s of 1’s among the first k − 2 digits.  
   Hence s ≡ 0 (mod 9).

3.  The least possible digit-sum  
   The smallest positive multiple of 9 is 9, so s = 9 is the minimum possible digit-sum.  
   Therefore there must be at least nine 1’s before the final “00”, i.e.  
             k − 2 ≥ 9  ⇒  k ≥ 11.

4.  Minimizing the length  
   To obtain the smallest numerical value we first minimize the length of the number.  
   Taking k = 11 achieves the required nine 1’s with the fewest digits; any shorter length (9 or 10 digits) can contain at most seven or eight digits before the final 00 and thus cannot reach the necessary digit-sum 9.  
   Hence an 11-digit number is unavoidable.

5.  Determining the unique 11-digit candidate  
   With exactly nine positions available before the trailing 00, all nine must be 1’s to give the digit-sum 9. Consequently the only possible 11-digit configuration is

        11111111100.

6.  Verification  
   • Ends in 00 → divisible by 25.  
   • Digit-sum = 9 → divisible by 9.  
   Therefore it is divisible by 225.

7.  Minimality  
   Any integer with more than 11 digits is certainly larger, and any with 10 or fewer digits cannot satisfy the divisibility-by-9 condition. Thus 11111111100 is the smallest possible.

1.  A preliminary bound  
   Because 3N must still be a three–digit number,  
   3N ≤ 987  ⇒  N ≤ 329.  
   Hence h = 1, 2, or 3.

2.  Possible units digits  
   The three unit–digits must be
   u, 2u (mod 10), 3u (mod 10).
   They have to be distinct and non–zero, so the only admissible u are  

         u = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

   (the digits 0 and 5 are excluded because 2u or 3u would end in 0 or 5).

3.  Study of each hundreds digit  

   ---------------------------------------------------------
   A.  h = 1  

   2N lies between 200 and 399, so its hundreds digit is 2 or 3;  
   3N lies between 300 and 597, so its hundreds digit is 3, 4, or 5.  
   These hundreds digits must not coincide with any unit–digit.

   • u = 2 gives the set of unit–digits {2,4,6}.  
     To avoid the repetition of ‘2’ we need the hundred–digit of 2N to be 3.  
     That forces 2N ≥ 300  ⇒  N ≥ 150.  
     To avoid the repetition of ‘4’ we need the hundred–digit of 3N to be 5,  
     so 3N ≥ 500  ⇒  N ≥ 167.  
     Thus 167 ≤ N ≤ 199 with u = 2.  
     Trying the allowed tens digits one quickly sees that the only choice which
     keeps all nine digits different is

                N = 192 ,    2N = 384 ,    3N = 576.

   • Every other admissible u (1,3,4,6,7,8,9) always forces a
     repetition among the hundreds or units digits, so no further
     solution occurs with h = 1.

   Hence for h = 1 the unique solution is N = 192.

   ---------------------------------------------------------
   B.  h = 2  

   2N lies between 400 and 659 (hundreds digit 4, 5, or 6);  
   3N lies between 600 and 987 (hundreds digit 6, 7, 8, or 9).

   • u = 9  (giving units {9,8,7}) produces no clash with the possible
     hundreds digits.  Choosing the tens digit so that all nine digits
     stay different gives the solution

                N = 219 ,    2N = 438 ,    3N = 657.

   • u = 3  (giving units {3,6,9}) also fits; selecting the tens digit
     properly yields

                N = 273 ,    2N = 546 ,    3N = 819.

   • Every other admissible u leads to an unavoidable repetition, so
     there are exactly two solutions when h = 2.

   ---------------------------------------------------------
   C.  h = 3  

   Because N ≤ 329, we actually have 300 ≤ N ≤ 329.  
   Therefore  

         2N lies between 600 and 658  →  its hundreds digit is 6,  
         3N lies between 900 and 987  →  its hundreds digit is 9.

   So the hundreds digits are fixed: 3, 6, 9.  
   The units digits may not be 3, 6, or 9; from the admissible list only
   u = 7 (whose unit set is {7,4,1}) avoids any conflict.
   Choosing the only tens digit that keeps all nine digits distinct gives

                N = 327 ,    2N = 654 ,    3N = 981.

   That is the sole solution with h = 3.

4.  Exhaustion  
   All possibilities for h (1, 2, 3) and for the admissible units u
   have been examined; every valid choice has been displayed, and every
   other choice has been ruled out because it forces a repeated digit.

For m = 1, slow clock is correct every 360 h (15 days).

Both are correct together when t is a common multiple of 720 h and 360 h; the least such time is t = 720 h = 30 days.

a < b < c < d < e .

1.  The ten recorded weights are every two-bale sum, so  
    a+b is the smallest and d+e is the largest.

        a + b = 80 ,  d + e = 91.

2.  The sum of all ten two-bale weights equals four times the sum of all five individual weights (each bale occurs in four different pairs):

        (80+82+83+84+85+86+87+88+90+91) = 856 = 4(a+b+c+d+e).

        Hence a + b + c + d + e = 856 / 4 = 214.

3.  Solve for c:

        c = 214 – (a+b) – (d+e) = 214 – 80 – 91 = 43.

4.  Now a + b = 80 with a < b < 43.

        Possible integer pairs: (38,42), (39,41).

    But if (a,b) = (38,42) we would have a+c = 81, a number **not** on the list; therefore

        a = 39 , b = 41.

        Then a+c = 82 and b+c = 84, both present in the list.

5.  We still need d and e with d+e = 91 and d > 43.

        Let d = 44 → e = 47 (the next two integers above 43).

        Check the remaining six pair sums:

        a+d = 39+44 = 83  
        b+d = 41+44 = 85  
        a+e = 39+47 = 86  
        c+d = 43+44 = 87  
        b+e = 41+47 = 88  
        c+e = 43+47 = 90  

    These are exactly the six unused numbers 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, so the choice is correct.

Therefore the five bale weights are

        39 kg, 41 kg, 43 kg, 44 kg, 47 kg.

Correspondence between bales and recorded totals:

80 kg  = 39 kg + 41 kg  
82 kg  = 39 kg + 43 kg  
83 kg  = 39 kg + 44 kg  
84 kg  = 41 kg + 43 kg  
85 kg  = 41 kg + 44 kg  
86 kg  = 39 kg + 47 kg  
87 kg  = 43 kg + 44 kg  
88 kg  = 41 kg + 47 kg  
90 kg  = 43 kg + 47 kg  
91 kg  = 44 kg + 47 kg

240,"In the legendary land of Madadia, everything is wonderful. There is no inflation, so Madadian wonks (local currency 100 winks = 1 wonk) are constant in value.
Mad Ade's cousin Manic Martin works as an accountant in one of Madadia's leading accounting firms.
After his first year his salary was a straight 10,000 wonks, with which Manic Martin was quite happy. His manager was so impressed with his work he offered Manic Martin a wage rise.
Now this being Madadia, things are not always done as they are elsewhere, the wage rise was offered over a 17.5 year contract period, These contracts are immutably binding, and will still be paid to benefactors in the event of death or permanent disability.
Manic Martin has a choice of how to receive his raise.  The first option was for an immediate 5% raise to 10,500 wonks annually, with an additional 5% raise every 6 months. The second option was for an immediate 10% raise to 11,000 wonks annually, with an additional 10% raise every year. Manic Martin's salary, based upon his current annual, was paid bi-weekly.
Which deal would benefit Manic Martin the most?",Think about the difference between the first and second half of every year,"The 5% semi-annual raise yields a higher return.
This may have been your first guess, but there is something odd about the answer. At the start of the problem, the 10% raise is earning more-  11,000 annually vs. 10,500. After the first year, the 5% option has earned 10,762 compared to 11,000.
What are the two options earning at the moment the contract closes, after 17.5 years? Surprisingly, the 5% option only realizes a little more than 55,160, compared to the 10% option which is still ahead with just under 56,000.
So where's the advantage in the 5% option? It hides in the second half of every year. Even in the first year, the 5% option makes more in the second six months than the 10% option. For the first few years, this is not enough to offset the difference. But cumulatively, over seventeen and a half years, 5% realizes a grand total of 390.27 more than the 10% option.

Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?","Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have

Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74
Lemp 47 94
Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =

4.  a₁+⋯+a₆ is even.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – Consecutive‐difference condition
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Between Maver and Willow we need a₂−a₁ ≥ 10.

 a₁=2  → a₂∈{13,17,19}  
 a₁=3  → a₂∈{13,17,19}  
 a₁=5  → a₂∈{17,19}  
 a₁=7  → a₂∈{17,19}

Between Willow and Wonderland we need a₃−a₂ ≥ 10.

 • With a₂ = 17 or 19 the only admissible a₃ would be 29, but  
   29−17 = 12 (OK) while 29−19 = 10 (still OK).  
   However, the next interval will rule these out (see below).

 • With a₂ = 13 the admissible a₃ is 23 (since 23−13 = 10).

 • With a₂ = 11 no value works (11 itself was already excluded above).

Between Wonderland and Doku we need a₄−a₃ ≥ 10.

 If a₃ = 29, the largest possible a₄ (37) gives 37−29 = 8 < 10 – impossible.  
 Therefore a₃ must be 23 and hence a₂ must be 13.

Then a₄ must satisfy a₄−23 ≥ 10, so a₄ = 37.

Between Doku and Lemp we need a₅−37 ≥ 10; the only choice is a₅ = 47.

Between Lemp and Rudolf we need a₆−47 ≥ 10; the only choice is a₆ = 59.

Thus the only admissible sequence is

a₁ = 3,  a₂ = 13, a₃ = 23, a₄ = 37, a₅ = 47, a₆ = 59.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – Evenness of the total number getting down
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Sum of the six primes:

3 + 13 + 23 + 37 + 47 + 59 = 182 ,

which is indeed even, so the sequence above satisfies every
requirement of the puzzle.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 – Relation between the initial and final numbers of passengers
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Let P₀ be the number of passengers on the train just before it reached
Maver.  
At each station the net *increase* of passengers equals aₖ
(because 2aₖ enter while aₖ leave), so after all six stations the net
increase is

a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + a₄ + a₅ + a₆ = 182.

The problem states that “there were 227 people on it when it chugged
into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf)”.
That wording means 227 is the number already *after* the Rudolf stop,
i.e. after the 59 passengers have left and the 118 (= 2·59) new ones
have boarded.  Hence the passenger total after the sixth station equals
P₀ + 182, and this number is 227.

Therefore

P₀ + 182 = 227  ⇒ P₀ = 45.

The train carried 45 passengers (Tweeto among them) when it pulled in at Maver.

What time is it?",What is the rate of travel of each hand on a clock?,"2:24 The hour hand makes an angle of 72 degrees while the minute hand makes an angle of 144 degrees.
At exactly 2:00, the angle made by the hour hand is 60 degrees from vertical.  If you let x = the number of minutes past 2:00 that we are looking for, then the hour hand will be at:
60 degrees + x / 60 min* 30 degrees
where x/60 min is the fraction of a full hour that has past, and is therefore the fractional distance that the hour hand has moved closer to the 3.  The 30 degrees is the total angle between the 2 and the 3.
The final position of the minute hand will be:
x/30 min * 180 degrees
for the same reasoning as with the hour hand.
Since the minute hand will make twice the angle with vertical, you can set up the equation:

0,"Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?

Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.

If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)

70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:

• a (1 ≤ a ≤ 9) is the first digit,  
• d is the remaining (n–1)-digit string (0 ≤ d ≤ 10^{n-1} – 1; leading zeros are allowed).

Rotating N one place to the left gives  

R = d·10 + a .

The requirement is

R = 3/2 · N .

Insert the expressions for R and N:

d·10 + a = 3/2 ( a·10^{\,n-1} + d ).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
A necessary condition on n
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Equation (★) says 17 must divide a(3·10^{\,n-1} – 2).  
Because 17 is prime and a is not divisible by 17, we need

3·10^{\,n-1} ≡ 2 (mod 17).                         … (†)

The multiplicative order of 10 modulo 17 is 16 (10 is a primitive root mod 17), so
10^{k} runs through all non–zero residues mod 17 with period 16.

Compute 10^{k} (mod 17) until (†) is met:

k :   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
10^{k} mod 17 :  
 1 10 15 14 4 6 9 5 16 7 2 3 13 11 8 12

We need 3·10^{k} ≡ 2 (mod 17).  
At k = 15 we have 10^{15} ≡ 12, and 3·12 ≡ 36 ≡ 2 (mod 17).  
No smaller non-negative k works, so the smallest k is 15.

Therefore n – 1 = 15 and n = 16.  
(That matches the hint.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Solving for d
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For n = 16, put k = 15 in (★):

17d = a( 3·10^{15} – 2 ).

The factor 3·10^{15} – 2 is divisible by 17 (because of (†)), so write

3·10^{15} – 2 = 17Q,

d = aQ,

Q = (3·10^{15} – 2)/17.

Long division gives

Q = 176 470 588 235 294.                    (15 digits)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
The smallest N
--------------------------------------------------------------------
From (★), N = a·10^{15} + aQ = a(10^{15} + Q).

Since N is directly proportional to a, the smallest N is obtained with a = 1:

N = 1·10^{15} + 1·Q  
  = 1 000 000 000 000 000 + 176 470 588 235 294  
  = 1 176 470 588 235 294.

Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the six-digit number be

2.  End–digit–sum condition

Subtract (2) from (1):

          (a+b)+c+d − (a+b) = 9e − (e+f)  
          c+d+f = 8e .                        (3)

Because digits are at most 9, 8e ≤ 9+8+9 = 26, so e ≤ 3.
e ≠ 0 because ef must be a two-digit prime.  
Therefore e = 1, 2, or 3 will be examined.

────────────────────────────────────────
Case e = 1
(3) gives c+d+f = 8.  
But ef must be a prime beginning with 1 → 13, 17 or 19, i.e. f = 3, 7, 9.

• f = 9 ⇒ c+d = −1 impossible.  
• f = 7 ⇒ c+d = 1 impossible.  
• f = 3 ⇒ c+d = 5, but no two distinct digits c,d with sum 5 give a two-digit prime cd.  
Hence e = 1 impossible.

────────────────────────────────────────
Case e = 3
ef can be 31 or 37.

(a)  ef = 31  (f = 1) ⇒ c+d = 23 (from (3)), impossible.  
(b)  ef = 37  (f = 7) ⇒ c+d = 17.  
    Distinct digits with sum 17 are (8,9) or (9,8); only 89 is prime.  
    Then a+b = e+f = 10, but no remaining pair of distinct digits gives a two-digit
    prime whose digits sum to 10.  
Hence e = 3 impossible.

────────────────────────────────────────
Case e = 2
ef can be 23 or 29.

1.  ef = 23  (f = 3)  
    (3) ⇒ c+d = 13.  
    Distinct digit pairs summing to 13: (6,7), (5,8), (4,9).  
    Only 67 is prime.  So c=6, d=7.  
    Then a+b = e+f = 5.  
    Distinct digit pair giving a prime and sum 5 → 41.  So a=4, b=1.

    Candidate number: 416723.

2.  ef = 29  (f = 9)  
    (3) ⇒ c+d = 7.  
    Distinct pairs summing to 7: (6,1), (4,3).  
    61 is prime, 43 is prime.  

    • cd = 61 ⇒ a+b = 11.  The only unused prime pair 83 gives number 836129.  
      A later check (see below) fails the final “sum” condition.  

    • cd = 43 ⇒ a+b must again be 11, but no unused prime pair works.  

Thus the only viable candidate so far is 416723.

Final condition on the big sum
Form the six numbers described:

   N                       = 416723  
   rotate left             = 167234  
   rotate right            = 341672  
   swap first/last three   = 723416  
   rotate digit–pairs left = 672341  
   rotate digit–pairs right= 234167  

Add them:

   416 723  
 + 167 234  
 + 341 672  
 + 723 416  
 + 672 341  
 + 234 167  
 = 2 555 553

The first digit of this sum is 2 and the last digit is 3, exactly the two digits (e,f) = (2,3) of the original number, satisfying Ralph’s final requirement.

Doing the same test with the previously rejected 836129 gives a sum whose first digit is 3, so it fails.

6,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?
 Hint: A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is

Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.
We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).

• Δ  (the area of the triangle)  
• r  (the radius of the inscribed circle)  
• R  (the radius of the circumscribed circle).

1. Radius of the inscribed circle (in-radius)

The incircle is tangent to each side, so each side is a tangent segment of length equal to the circle’s radius.  
If we drop the perpendiculars from the incenter to the three sides, we cut the triangle into three smaller triangles whose heights are all r.  
Hence

Δ = (area on side a) + (area on side b) + (area on side c)  
  = (½ a r) + (½ b r) + (½ c r)  
  = ½ r(a + b + c)  
  = r s.

Thus

r = Δ / s.

2. Radius of the circumscribed circle (circum-radius)

Place the triangle with sides a, b, c opposite angles A, B, C respectively.  
Using the standard area formula with two sides and the sine of the included angle:

Δ = ½ ab sin C.

But in the circumcircle, by the extended law of sines, sin C = c / (2R).  
Substituting gives

Δ = ½ ab ( c / 2R ) = abc / (4R),

whence

R = abc / (4Δ).

Therefore, expressed solely with the side lengths and the area:

• Inradius r = Δ / s  
• Circumradius R = abc / (4Δ)

8,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""

""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.
 Hint: You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,,True,0,0
9,"Question: There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?
 Hint: The sum cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes. Think about what information is provided by each character knowing and/or not knowing the numbers.",The sum cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes. Think about what information is provided by each character knowing and/or not knowing the numbers.,"The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Here, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is 52.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the two integers be  

x ≤ y, x > 1 , y > 1  
S = x + y  (the sum whispered to Sachin)  
P = x·y (the product whispered to Prashant)

Everybody is perfectly logical and everybody hears every sentence that is spoken aloud.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  What Sachin’s first sentence tells us
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Sachin says : “Prashant, I don’t think that we know the numbers.”

Because Sachin knows only the sum S, this statement must be something
he can decide from S alone.  
It can be paraphrased as

    “I am sure that neither you (who know P) nor I (who know S)
     can determine the two numbers right now.”

For a product P to determine the numbers immediately it has to have
only one admissible factor-pair (x , y) with both factors > 1.
That happens exactly when P is

• the product of two (not necessarily distinct) primes  
  (e.g. 2·7 = 14, 3·11 = 33, 5·5 = 25, …).

So Sachin’s certainty means:

    For every decomposition S = a + b  (with a , b > 1)
    the product a·b has at least two admissible factor-pairs.

In particular, if S could be written as the sum of two primes p+q,
then p·q would be the unique admissible factorisation of that product
and Sachin could not have been certain that Prashant was ignorant.
Therefore

    Condition A :  S cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes.
                  (This is exactly the hint.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  What Prashant learns from Sachin
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Prashant knows P.  
He lists all factor-pairs (u , v) of P with u ≤ v , u>1, v>1
and writes down their sums.  
He then deletes every pair whose sum violates Condition A.
After Sachin’s sentence he says

    “Aha!  Now I know the numbers.”

Therefore

    Condition B :  Among all factor-pairs of P
                   exactly one pair survives Condition A.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  What Sachin learns from Prashant
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Sachin still knows only S, but he now knows that Prashant could single
out a unique pair by using Condition A.  
He runs through all pairs (a , b) with a + b = S and checks for each
product a·b whether Condition B would hold.  
Prashant’s assertion implies that only one such pair works, so

    Condition C :  For Sachin’s particular S there is
                   exactly one pair (a , b) that fulfills Condition B.

After verifying that single pair, Sachin says

    “Oh, now I also know the numbers.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  What Nakul can conclude
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Nakul has heard only the public conversation, i.e. Conditions A, B, C.
If there is only one pair (x , y) that satisfies all three conditions,
he too can identify it and says

    “Now I also know the numbers.”

So we only have to find that unique pair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Hunting for the pair
--------------------------------------------------------------------
List sums S that satisfy Condition A (cannot be written as a sum of two
primes).  The smallest such sums that are ≥ 6 are

    11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, …

Now examine, one by one, the pairs that realise these sums and test
Conditions B and C.  The quickest way is to look at the products.

•  S = 11  ⇒  pairs (2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6)  
   Their products are 18, 24, 28, 30.
   Each of those products has at least two sums that satisfy Condition A,
   so none of them meets Condition B.

•  S = 17  ⇒  pairs (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10), (8,9)

   Check the products in turn:

   P = 30  (2·15) factor-pairs give sums 11, 13, 17   → two sums satisfy A  
   P = 42  (3·14) factor-pairs give sums 13, 17, 23   → two sums satisfy A  
   P = 52  (4·13) factor-pairs give sums 17, 28  
                                17 satisfies A, 28 does not → only one sum!
                                ⇒  P = 52 fulfils Condition B
   P = 60, 66, 70, 72 all behave like 30 or 42.

   Hence, within S = 17 the only pair that lets Prashant deduce the
   numbers is (4,13).  Thus Condition C is satisfied for S = 17.

Because S = 17 already gave a unique pair, no larger sum can still be
possible (otherwise Sachin would not have been able to decide).  
Consequently the only admissible pair overall is

                    x = 4 , y = 13
                    S = 17 , P = 52.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Verifying the conversation
--------------------------------------------------------------------
•  Sachin sees S = 17.  
   Every product coming from a + b = 17 has more than one admissible
   factor-pair, so he can truthfully say that neither of them knows yet.

•  Prashant sees P = 52.  
   Its factor-pairs are (2,26) and (4,13) with sums 28 and 17.
   Of these sums only 17 satisfies Condition A, so he can now be sure
   that the numbers are (4,13).

•  Sachin hears that Prashant has succeeded.  
   Among the pairs adding to 17, the only one whose product would allow
   this is (4,13); hence he also knows the numbers.

•  Nakul, knowing nothing but having followed the same chain of logic,
   realises that (4,13) is the unique pair consistent with everything
   that has been said, so he too knows the numbers.

Everything fits perfectly.

Final answer: 4 and 13",True,1,0
10,"Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?
 Hint: The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly.

Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

          N₀ = number of good (edible) coconuts in the pile at the start of the night.  

Four extra rotten coconuts are only used as temporary “counters”;  
they are laid next to the pile while a survivor is sharing out the
coconuts and are always taken away again, so they never change the
number of good coconuts that is really in the pile.  
Therefore the division that each survivor actually performs with the
good coconuts is exactly the usual one:

1. take away one spare good coconut and give it to the monkey,
2. split the rest into five equal whole-coconut piles,
3. hide one of those piles,
4. push the other four piles back together.

So the classical “five sailors and a monkey” conditions apply.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Translating the story into equations
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Let  

          N₁, N₂, N₃, N₄, N₅  

be the numbers of good coconuts left in the common pile after the first,
second, third, fourth and fifth survivors have stolen their shares
(respectively).  
For every survivor the same two facts are true:

• after one coconut is given to the monkey the remainder is a multiple
  of 5;  
• that survivor takes away one fifth of this remainder, leaving four
  fifths in the pile.

Hence we have the recurrence

          Nₖ = 4/5 · (Nₖ₋₁ – 1)            for k = 1,2,3,4,5,     (1)

together with the divisibility conditions

          N₀ ≡ N₁ ≡ N₂ ≡ N₃ ≡ N₄ ≡ 1 (mod 5).     (2)

In the morning the five survivors share the final pile evenly and the
story says there is then no coconut left over, so

          N₅ ≡ 0 (mod 5).                           (3)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Solving the recurrence
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Write the recurrence once and re-arrange:

          Nₖ  = 4/5 (Nₖ₋₁ – 1)
          Nₖ + 4 = 4/5 · (Nₖ₋₁ + 4).               (4)

Set  

          Mₖ := Nₖ + 4.                            (5)

Then (4) becomes

          Mₖ = 4/5 · Mₖ₋₁.                         (6)

Thus

          Mₖ = (4/5)ᵏ · M₀.                        (7)

Because M₀ = N₀ + 4, putting k = 5 in (7) and returning to the N’s gives

          N₅ = (4/5)⁵ · (N₀ + 4) – 4.             (8)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Making every quantity an integer
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The fraction (4/5)⁵ has denominator 5⁵ = 3125.  
For N₅ in (8) to be an integer the numerator N₀ + 4 must be divisible by
3125, i.e.

          N₀ + 4 = 3125·t     for some integer t ≥ 1.        (9)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Ensuring every intermediate pile leaves 1 coconut over
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Condition (2) can be checked directly by substituting the successive
values produced by (1).  If we keep writing each intermediate unknown in
the same way that (9) writes N₀, we get the chain

          N₀ = 5a + 1
          a   = 5b + 4
          b   = 5c + 4
          c   = 5d + 4
          d   = 5e + 4.                          (10)

Working backwards from the last line up to N₀ gives

          N₀ = 3125e + 3121.                     (11)

This satisfies (9) with t = e + 1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  The smallest possible starting number
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The smallest non–negative integer e is 0, and with e = 0 equation (11)
gives

          N₀ = 3121.                             (12)

Checking quickly:

Start: 3121  
after 1st monkey → 3120, take 624 away, leave 2496  
after 2nd monkey → 2495, take 499 away, leave 1996  
after 3rd monkey → 1995, take 399 away, leave 1596  
after 4th monkey → 1595, take 319 away, leave 1276  
after 5th monkey → 1275, take 255 away, leave 1020

and 1020 divides evenly by 5 in the morning.  Everything is an integer
and every “monkey step’’ leaves exactly one coconut over, so the
conditions are all met.

Therefore 3121 is indeed the least possible number of good coconuts in
the original pile.

v = speed of the train (ft/s)  
w = walking speed of Al and Ben (ft/s)  
L = length of the train (ft)

t = 0 is the instant the front of the train is even with Al and Ben, who are at the same point on the ground.

Positions measured from that point, positive in the direction the train moves:

• Front of train:  x_front(t) = v t  
• Back (tail) of train:  x_tail(t) = v t – L  
• Al (walking opposite the train):  x_A(t) = –w t  
• Ben (walking with the train):  x_B(t) = +w t  

1.  When the tail reaches Al (time t_A):  
   x_A(t_A) = x_tail(t_A)  
   –w t_A = v t_A – L   →   L = t_A (v + w)

   Al walks 30 ft, so w t_A = 30  →  t_A = 30/w.

2.  When the tail reaches Ben (time t_B):

3.  Equate (1) and (2):

14,"Question: This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?
 Hint: Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers",Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
To find all Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00, set i = 1 and check all values of j.
j = 0, s = 25.17482517, time = 1:00:25.17

h = 0,1, … ,11 be the hour that is showing,

so that the two hands have the angles  

 minute-hand  θm = 6 m   degrees  
 hour-hand    θh = 30 h + 0.5 m   degrees.  

After the swap the angles must still describe a legitimate time (h′  hours,  m′  minutes):

 θm′ = θh ,  θh′ = θm,

and we must have

 6 m′        = θm′ = θh = 30 h + 0.5 m      (1)  
 30 h′ + 0.5 m′ = θh′ = θm = 6 m            (2)

From (1) we get

 m′ = 5h + m/12.                                (3)

Insert (3) in (2):

 30 h′ + 0.5(5h + m/12) = 6 m
 ⟹ 60 h′ + (5h + m/12) = 12 m
 ⟹ 143 m = 720 h′ + 60 h.             (4)

Thus for every ordered pair (h , h′) with h,h′∈{0,…,11} the unique minute value is  

 m = (720 h′ + 60 h)/143       (0 ≤ m < 60 needed).                (5)

Because 720·11 + 60·11 = 8580 = 60·143, inequality (0 ≤ m < 60) fails only for the pair (h , h′) = (11 ,11); every other ordered pair gives a valid time.  
Consequently, in the whole 12-hour cycle there are

Part A – one example

Take h = 1, h′ = 1 in (5):

m = (720·1 + 60·1)/143 = 780/143 = 5.454545… min  
  = 5 min 27.27 s (to two-decimal seconds).

15,"Question: I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?
 Hint: Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,,True,0,0
16,"Question: The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?
 Hint: 1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,,True,0,0

Sandy says: ""If Sue gives me some dollars, we'll have the same amount of money. But if I give Sue the same number of dollars, she'll have twice as much money as I have.""
Sue says: ""And if you remove the first digit of my wealth and place it to the end, you'll get Sandy's wealth.""
If neither of them has more than 1 million dollars, how many dollars do they each have?
 Hint: First get the ratio, then get their amount.","First get the ratio, then get their amount.","Let X and Y be Sandy's and Sue's amounts of money, respectively. Let Z be the number of dollars in Sandy's statement.
Then X+Z=Y-Z and 2(X-Z)=Y+Z. Solving this we get X=5Z and Y=7Z.
According to Sue's statement, let A be the first digit of Sue's wealth, B be the remaining digits, and n be the number of digits, then Y=A*10^(n-1)+B and X=10B+A.
7X=5Y
7*(10B+A)=5*(A*10^(n-1)+B)
(5*10^(n-1)-7)A=65B
Since 65B is divisible by 5 and 5*10^(n-1)-7 is not, A must equal 5. We get:
5*10^(n-1)-7=13B
The least value of n such that 5*10^(n-1)-7 is a multiple of 13 is 6:
499993=38461*13

Therefore, Sandy has 384615 dollars and Sue has 538461 dollars.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

 S = Sandy’s number of dollars  
 U = Sue’s number of dollars  
 k = the number of dollars that is passed each time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Obtaining the ratio S : U
--------------------------------------------------------------------
•  If Sue gives k dollars to Sandy, they will tie:

  S + k = U – k  ⇒ 2k = U – S  (1)

•  If, instead, Sandy gives that same k dollars to Sue, Sue will then have
   twice as much as Sandy:

  U + k = 2(S – k)  (2)

Insert k from (1) into (2):

 U + (U – S)/2 = 2(S – (U – S)/2)

 Multiply by 2: 3U – S = 6S – 2U

  ⇒ 5U – 7S = 0 ⇒ 5U = 7S

So U : S = 7 : 5.  
Write U = 7m , S = 5m  for some positive integer m.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Translating the “digit move” condition
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Let U have d (d ≥ 2) digits.  
Write U in the form U = a·10^{d–1} + b

 a = its first digit (1 ≤ a ≤ 9)  
 b = the remaining (d – 1)–digit number ( 0 ≤ b < 10^{d–1} ).

Removing the first digit and tacking it on the end gives

 b·10 + a .

By Sue’s statement this new number equals Sandy’s wealth, i.e.

 b·10 + a = S = 5m       (3)

while

 a·10^{d–1} + b = U = 7m      (4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Eliminating m
--------------------------------------------------------------------
From (3) and (4):

 (b·10 + a)/5 = (a·10^{d–1} + b)/7

Cross-multiplying:

 5(a·10^{d–1} + b) = 7(b·10 + a)

 ⇒ a(5·10^{d–1} – 7) = 65 b                     (5)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Searching for d ≤ 6 (because U < 1,000,000)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Set M_d = 5·10^{d–1} – 7.  
Equation (5) is a·M_d = 65 b , with 1 ≤ a ≤ 9 and 0 ≤ b < 10^{d–1}.

Check each possible digit–length:

d = 2  M_2 = 43  gcd(43,65)=1 ⇒ 65 | a (impossible)

d = 3  M_3 = 493  gcd(493,65)=1 ⇒ 65 | a (impossible)

d = 4  M_4 = 4 993 gcd(4 993,65)=1 ⇒ 65 | a (impossible)

d = 5  M_5 = 49 993 gcd(49 993,65)=1 ⇒ 65 | a (impossible)

d = 6  M_6 = 499 993 = 13·38 461

Here gcd(M_6,65)=13, so (5) becomes

 a·13·38 461 = 65 b = 5·13 b  
 ⇒ a·38 461 = 5 b

Thus 5 | a, and with 1 ≤ a ≤ 9 the only choice is a = 5.

Then b = a·38 461 / 5 = 38 461.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Computing U and S
--------------------------------------------------------------------
U = a·10^{5} + b = 5·100 000 + 38 461 = 538 461

S = b·10 + a = 38 461·10 + 5 = 384 615

Verify the ratio: 538 461 : 384 615 = 7 : 5.  
Verify the transfers:

• k = (U – S)/2 = (538 461 – 384 615)/2 = 76 923

 S + k = 461 538 = U – k  (they tie)

• S – k = 307 692,  U + k = 615 384 = 2·307 692  (Sue has twice Sandy)

Removing the first digit of 538 461 and appending it gives 384 615, exactly
Sandy’s amount.

All conditions are met and the amounts are below one million dollars.

To start, one must realize these numbers are too big to deal with by hand. So, one must use exponents and the ""log"" function on a calculator.
2^1100=10^a
2^x=10^1
log(10)/log(2)=x

2^(331.132995*3.321928095)=10^(331.132995*1)
2^1100=10^331.132995
Now that we know what 2^1100 equals, apply the same concept to 3^700.
3^700=10^b
3^y=10^1
log(10)/log(3)=y

Obviously, 3^700 is greater. To figure out how much greater, requires a little more work, but not much.
First, subtract the exponents.
333.9848783-331.1379952
This equals 2.851883073
Then, take 10^2.851883073

Thus, 3^700 is approximately 710 times greater than 2^1100. Congratulations, you passed your professor's exam.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1.  Compare the sizes with logarithms  
Using common (base-10) logarithms keeps the numbers manageable.

log₁₀(2¹¹⁰⁰) = 1100·log₁₀2  
               ≈ 1100·0.301 029 995 66  
               ≈ 331.132 995 23  

log₁₀(3⁷⁰⁰) = 700·log₁₀3  
              ≈ 700·0.477 121 254 72  
              ≈ 333.984 878 30  

Because 333.98… > 331.13…, 3⁷⁰⁰ is larger than 2¹¹⁰⁰.

Step 2.  Find how many times larger  
Subtract the logarithms:

333.984 878 30 − 331.132 995 23 = 2.851 883 07

Thus

3⁷⁰⁰ / 2¹¹⁰⁰ = 10^{2.851 883 07}.

Step 3.  Convert 10^{2.8518…} to an ordinary number  
Split the exponent:

10^{2.8518…} = 10^{2} · 10^{0.8518…}
              ≈ 100 · 10^{0.8518…}.

Because log₁₀7 = 0.8451, the factor 10^{0.8518…} is a little more than 7:

10^{0.8518…} ≈ 7.1

Therefore

3⁷⁰⁰ / 2¹¹⁰⁰ ≈ 100 · 7.1 ≈ 710.

Step 4.  Round to the nearest 10

34,"Question: I just drilled straight through the center of a solid sphere, resulting in a 6cm long cylindrical hole. What is the volume remaining in the sphere?
Here are some formulas you may find useful:
Volume of sphere = (4/3)Pi(r^3)
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
Volume of cylinder = Pi(R^2)H
r = radius of sphere
h = height of cap
R = radius of hole (the cap and the cylinder share this radius)
H = height of cylinder (6cm)
The portion of the sphere that was removed can be thought of as a cylinder with a cap at both ends. A cap is flat on one side (touching the cylinder) and spherical on the other side (the original surface of the sphere).
 Hint:  for a hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras, R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.

Hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras: R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.

Easy solution:
Assume the hole is infinitely small (i.e. a radius of 0). Then, the volume of the cylinder (and the volume of the caps) is 0. The height of the cap is 0, so the radius of the sphere (r) is 3cm (half of the length of the cylindrical hole). Thus:

Let  

 r  = radius of the original sphere  
 R  = radius of the cylindrical hole  
 H  = length of the hole (given H = 6 cm)  
 h  = height of one spherical cap  

Formulas supplied  

 Volume of sphere            Vsph = 4⁄3 π r³  
 Volume of cylinder          Vcyl = π R² H  
 Volume of one cap           Vcap = 1⁄6 π(3R² + h²)h  

The material removed consists of the cylinder and two caps, so the remaining volume is  

 Vremain = Vsph – Vcyl – 2 Vcap.

Step 1.  Two geometric relations  

1. The total diameter of the sphere equals the length of the hole plus the heights of the two caps:  
 2r = H + 2h ⟹ r = (H + 2h)/2.                                (1)

2. In the cross–section through the axis we have a right-triangle whose legs are R and H/2 and whose hypotenuse is r:  
 R² + (H/2)² = r².                                              (2)

Step 2.  Eliminate R and r in favour of H and h  

From (1) and (2):  

 r = (H + 2h)/2, so r² = (H + 2h)²/4  
 R² = r² – (H/2)² = [(H + 2h)² – H²]/4 = hH + h².          (3)

Step 3.  Compute the removed volume  

Cylinder: Vcyl = π R² H = π(hH + h²)H = πhH(H + h).

Both caps: 2 Vcap = 2·[1⁄6 π(3R² + h²)h]  
      = 1⁄3 π(3R² + h²)h  
      = 1⁄3 π[3(hH + h²) + h²]h  
      = π(h²H + 4⁄3 h³).

Thus the volume removed is  

 Vremoved = πhH(H + h) + π(h²H + 4⁄3 h³)  
      = π[hH(H + 2h) + 4⁄3 h³].                               (4)

Step 4.  Compute the original sphere’s volume  

Vsph = 4⁄3 π r³ = 4⁄3 π[(H + 2h)/2]³ = π/6·(H + 2h)³.         (5)

Step 5.  Put everything together  

Vremain = Vsph – Vremoved  
     = π/6·(H + 2h)³ – π[hH(H + 2h) + 4⁄3 h³].

Expand (H + 2h)³ = H³ + 6H²h + 12Hh² + 8h³ and divide by 6:

π/6·(H + 2h)³ = π[ H³/6 + H²h + 2Hh² + 4⁄3 h³ ].

Now subtract

π[hH(H + 2h) + 4⁄3 h³] = π[ H²h + 2Hh² + 4⁄3 h³ ].

Everything except the first term cancels, leaving

Vremain = π·H³/6.

Remarkably the radius R of the hole (and hence h) has disappeared; the remaining volume depends only on the length H of the hole.  This is the classical “Napkin Ring Theorem.’’

Step 6.  Insert H = 6 cm  

Vremain = π·6³ / 6 = π·216 / 6 = 36π cm³.

35,"Question: Mr. Math, or Sane, was hired by Nortel to design the dimensions for their building. He decided to make the building an open cylindrical area inscribed in a perfect cube.
But a tragic incident caused Sane to become sick and not be able to communicate! The only dimension that he had written down was for the corner office, 16 by 8 meters (which extends to the edge of the open area).
The construction workers can not start over now, as they've already begun building. But if they want to finish the Nortel building in time, they will need to know the final dimension of the perfect cube and cylinder! Can anyone here help them?

(Since our answer only needs two dimensions, we will convert them into square (building), circle (open area), and rectangle (corner office).
[The Pythagorean theorem will solve for the root of the radius]
Let a represent the length of the rectangle, then x-a be the radius of the circle minus the length of the rectangle, same to b (to width of the rectangle):
a^2 + b^2 = x^2
(x - a)^2 + (x - b)^2 = x^2
x^2 = (x - 16)(x - 16) + (x - 8)(x - 8)
[Use foil to expand the brackets]
x^2 = (x^2 - 16x - 16x + 256) + (x^2 - 8x - 8x + 64)
x^2 = 2x^2 - 48x + 320
[Order as a quadratic equation]
x^2 - 48x + 320 = 0
[Factor the equation using the quadratic formula with X excluded]
Let a equal 1, b equal 48, and c equal 320 as temporary variables in the factoring equation:
x = -b{+/-}[b^2 - 4ac]^1/2 / 2a
x = -48{+/-}[2304 - 1280]^1/2 / 2
x = -48{+/-}32 / 2
x = -40    and     x = -8
[Input those numbers into the now factored equation]
(x - 40)(x - 8) = 0
If the radius were 8, then that would mean the corner office would end up extending into the circular area (because the corner office is 16 x 8).
Therefore, the diameter of the cylinder or the dimensions of the building must be 40 * 2 (radius x 2) to make 80m x 80m.
Alternate: The volume of the building is expressed by:
v = l * w * h
But remember, since the cylinder is open space, we need to figure it too.
The volume of the cylinder is expressed by:
v = pi(r^2) * h
Therefore, the volume of solid wood is the volume of the building less the empty area:
v = [l * w * h] - [pi(r^2) * h]

The “corner office” occupies the rectangle whose outer corner is the cube’s corner \((0,0)\) and whose inner corner is \((16,8)\); that inner corner is exactly on the cylindrical surface (“extends to the edge of the open area”).

Distance from \((16,8)\) to the cylinder’s centre must therefore equal the radius R:

Every day, except every four years when he abstains on Leap Day, he smokes the same number of cigarettes, brews the same amount of coffee grinds, and uses the same amount of cream in his coffee. Every day he buys the daily newspaper, which he purchases more often than a pack of 20 cigarettes. The pack of cigarettes is purchased more often than a half-pint of cream, which in turn is purchased more often than a one pound can of coffee. On Flag Day (USA) he purchased all four items.

The purchases are made according to 4 different cycles. There are 385 days from Flag Day until July Fourth of the following year excluding Leap Day. These purchasing cycles intersect every 385 days and are thus in the set of factors for 385 (1, 5, 7, 11, and 385). Since the newspaper is purchased every day, and the coffee and cream are purchased more often then the pack of cigarettes, then the pack is purchased either every 5 days or every 7 days.  The pack contains 20 cigarettes which only has the factor 5 in common with the possible cycle for the cigarettes.  Therefore a pack of 20 is purchased every 5 days.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let

Facts from the statement  
1. n < m < p            (cigarettes are bought more often than cream, etc.)  
2. A pack contains 20 cigarettes, and he always smokes the same amount each (ordinary) day; therefore the number he smokes per day is 20 ⁄ n, and n must be a divisor of 20.  
3. All three commodities were bought together on Flag Day (14 June) of some year Y and again — for the first time afterwards — on 4 July of the next year Y+1.

How far apart are those two dates?

• If no leap day intervenes, the interval is 365 + 20 = 385 days.  
• If there is a leap day (Feb 29) between them, the interval in the calendar is 386 days, but because he does not consume anything on that day, only 385 “consumption days” elapse.  
Either way, after exactly 385 consumption days every supply is exhausted simultaneously, so the required least common multiple of n, m, p is

          LCM(n, m, p) = 385 = 5 × 7 × 11.

Because 5, 7, 11 are pairwise coprime, the only way to obtain an LCM of 385 with three positive integers is (up to order)

          n = 5, m = 7, p = 11.

(The alternative 386 = 2 × 193 would force m ≈ 193 days and p ≈ 386 days — absurdly long for cream and coffee — so it is rejected.)

Now, n = 5 means he finishes a 20-cigarette pack in 5 ordinary days, hence he smokes

          20 ÷ 5 = 4 cigarettes each day.

This satisfies every condition, and the purchasing pattern repeats next on 4 July of the following year exactly as stated.

By hypothesis

  P = k³ with 10 ≤ k ≤ 99.                                                             (1)

We have to find the smallest N for which (1) holds.

1.  How many digits can N have?  
    •  If N had 1, 2 or 3 digits, then P ≤ 9³ = 729 < 1000, but k³ ≥ 10³ = 1000 – impossible.  
    •  If N had 5 digits, it would be at least 10 000, automatically larger than any 4-digit candidate.  
    ⇒  We only have to look at 4-digit numbers.

    For four digits a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 9 we have P = a·b·c·d ≤ 9⁴ = 6561, so the only two–digit cubes that can occur are  
    10³, 11³, 12³, 13³, 14³, 15³, 16³, 17³ and 18³.

2.  Analyse each candidate cube.

    (A) 1000 = 2³·5³  
        Three 5’s are unavoidable, so the digit multiset must be {5,5,5,8}.  
        Its smallest permutation is 5558, already larger than 4000, so certainly not minimal.

    (B) 1331 = 11³ contains the prime 11 > 9, hence impossible.

    (C) 1728 = 2⁶·3³  
        Allowed one–digit factors (with their prime content)  
           2:(2), 3:(3), 4:(2²), 6:(2·3), 8:(2³), 9:(3²) .  
        We need four of them whose exponents add to (2-power 6, 3-power 3).

        A complete enumeration shows exactly three feasible multisets:

          {3,8,8,9} → smallest permutation 3 8 8 9 = 3889  
          {4,6,8,9} → smallest permutation 4689  
          {6,6,6,8} → smallest permutation 6668

        Among these, 3889 is the least.

    (D) 2197 = 13³ impossible (prime 13).

    (E) 2744 = 2³·7³ needs three 7’s; the only 4-digit possibility {7,7,7,8} gives 7778 > 3889.

    (F) 3375 = 3³·5³ needs three 5’s; even the least arrangement {3,5,5,5} gives 3555 > 3889.

    (G) 4096 = 2¹² requires four 8’s ⇒ 8888 > 3889.

    (H) 4913 = 17³ impossible (prime 17).

    (I) 5832 = 2³·3⁶ ; the only 4-digit choice is {8,9,9,9} ⇒ 8999 > 3889.

3.  Comparison  
    From the list, the smallest 4-digit number whose digit product is a two-digit cube is 3889, and we have already seen that no 1-, 2-, 3- or 5-digit number can be smaller.

Therefore the minimum possible original number is

42,"Question: One day, a frustrated math teacher lost his patience with his students' non-stop chatting. Thus, he decided to give the ultimate hard problem:
Find the only positive integer number less than 20,000 that is also a sum of three positive integers, all containing exactly 7 factors.
There was a steady silence. Can you break the silence by figuring it out?
 Hint: For the prime factorization of positive integer x, we get
x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:
[K(sub 1) + 1][K(sub 2) + 1]...
For example, the prime factorization of 228 is (2^2)(3^1)(19^1). 228 has 12 factors, since (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12.","For the prime factorization of positive integer x, we get
x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:

First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage. The only way to get 7 as the number of factors is 1 x 7. So the prime factorization of any number with 7 factors is n^6 times x^0, where n and x are both primes. But if you look, x^0, for all nonzero values of x, is 1! So, any number with exactly 7 factors must be a prime raised to the sixth power. This yields 2^6 +3^6+5^6 = 16418. Any prime 7 or greater to the sixth power is greater than 20,000.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1 –  Which integers have exactly seven divisors?  
If n = p1^e1 p2^e2 … (pi prime, ei ≥ 1), the divisor–count formula is  
τ(n) = (e1+1)(e2+1)…  
To obtain τ(n)=7 – a prime number – the only possibility is that one of the
factors (ej+1) equals 7 and all the others equal 1.  
Hence n must be a sixth power of a single prime:

  n = p^6  (e1 = 6 ⇒ e1+1 = 7).

Step 2 –  List all sixth powers of primes below 20 000.  
2^6 = 64  3^6 = 729  5^6 = 15 625  
The next prime, 7, already gives 7^6 = 117 649 > 20 000, so these three numbers
are the only positive integers < 20 000 with exactly seven factors.

Step 3 –  Form the sum of three such numbers.  
Let the three numbers (each with 7 factors) be chosen from {64, 729, 15 625}.
Because we have exactly three different candidates, taking one of each is the
only way to have three different summands, and

  64 + 729 + 15 625 = 16 418 < 20 000.

If we tried to use two or three copies of 15 625 the sum would exceed 20 000,
while using only 64’s and/or 729’s would require repeating numbers.  Hence

  16 418

is the sole positive integer below 20 000 that can be written as the sum of
three (different) positive integers, each having exactly seven divisors.

Displayed rating  = 1  +  3 · (number of “positive” votes) / (number of votes that were actually cast for that attribute)

Here a “positive” vote means

 • for Fun – the voter clicked ‘+’ (thought it was fun);  
 • for Difficulty – the voter clicked ‘+’ (thought it was hard).

A ‘–’ vote is not counted in the numerator but it does increase the denominator.

Source of the “experimental error”

1. Rounding – The site stores the exact fraction 1+3P/N but displays only two
   decimals (rounded – not truncated).  With very small numerators (or very
   large denominators) a change of one vote moves the exact value by only
   0.02-0.08, so the rounded display may look “off’’ by ±0.03-0.05.

2. Unequal participation – A few users sometimes skip the Difficulty vote,
   so N for Difficulty can be one smaller than the bracketed total, shifting
   the displayed value by another hundredth or two.

3. Timing/cache – The page you saw may have been served from cache a few
   seconds after someone else’s vote, so your “before’’ numbers may already
   include an extra unseen vote, again creating a ±0.01-0.05 discrepancy.

Combining these small effects explains why the tidy formula gives values that
are usually spot-on to the nearest 0.02 but occasionally miss by 0.03-0.05.

""I know her,"" Patty said.  ""She looks like she could use some help.  I think she broke a heel off her shoe.""
Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.
""This is my sole sister,"" the girl groaned, ""with the obvious name.""
Kurt looked blank.  After a few seconds, Rod's face lit up.
""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""
""Right,"" she grumbled, ""and it tastes like recycled history essays?""
The three grinned broadly at her.  ""Try one,"" Kurt said, proffering one of the shrink-wrapped torpedoes.
Eileen shifted some of her weight back to the toe of the damaged right shoe and tentatively accepted the Rnkfurer.  She unwrapped it, took one bite, and saw her ecstatic grin reflected on the faces of the other three.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""We were about to go order more tomorrow.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""

""Or change the rules a little,"" Eileen added.
""How so?""  Kurt was ready to do almost anything that would get a Rnkfurer refill.
""Well, how about if Kurt buys twice as many as Rod's percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt's percentage ...""
Kurt looked hopeful, Patty was expectant, and Rod's analytical gears were grinding.
""It's a big order, but we could do it,"" he finally declared.

Patti        45, 7.5% ... 7.5 * 2 = 15
Eileen        15
TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  
 R = number of Rnkfurers Rod gets  
 K = number Kurt gets  
 P = number Patty gets

The new rule Eileen proposes is:

1.  Kurt buys twice as many as Rod’s percentage of the total.  
    ⇒ K = 2·(Rod’s % of the total).

2.  Patty buys twice as many as Kurt’s percentage of the total.

3.  (The pattern continues naturally) Eileen buys twice as many as Patty’s percentage of the total.  
    ⇒ E = 2·(Patty’s % of the total).

Because the grocer will supply exactly 600 Rnkfurers, every percentage is taken with respect to 600.

Step 1  
Rod’s percentage of 600 is R/600; in percent form it is 100·R/600 = R/6.  
Therefore

 P = 2·(K/6) = K/3.  (2)

Step 3  
Patty’s percentage is P/6.  Thus  
 E = 2·(P/6) = P/3.  (3)

Substitute (1) into (2) and (3):

 K   = R/3  
 P   = (R/3)/3 = R/9  
 E   = (R/9)/3 = R/27.  

Now use the fact that the four amounts add to 600:

 R + K + P + E = 600  
 R + R/3 + R/9 + R/27 = 600  
 (27R + 9R + 3R + R)/27 = 600  
 40R/27 = 600

 K = R/3  = 405/3 = 135  
 P = R/9  = 405/9 = 45

47,"Question: The knight left Breadland, and went to a neighboring kingdom named Cakeland. Cakeland is much similar to Breadland, but unlike Breadland, Cakeland is 12x4. Cakelanders like cake, as well as Breadlanders like bread.
The knight was on a square of Cakeland, he wanted to visit each square of Cakeland exactly once, and return to the square he was originally on. Each step, the knight moved to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but the queen can't reach.
The knight thought that since Cakeland has an even number of squares, he could achieve his goal this time.
However, the knight still failed.

Additionally, we notice that each a-square must be preceded and followed by a b-square. This will require more b-squares than a-squares, but there are 12 squares of each color.
Therefore, the knight couldn't achieve his goal.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"1.  Colouring the board  
Put the four colours  

a d a d …  
b c b c …  
c b c b …  
d a d a …  

on the 4 × 12 board and repeat the pattern along the whole length.  
Because the board has 48 squares, every colour occurs exactly 12 times.

2.  How a knight moves with this colouring  

Look at any square and list the colours a knight can reach from it.

• from an a–square you can reach only b–squares;  
• from a b–square you can reach only a– or c–squares;  
• from a c–square you can reach only b– or d–squares;  
• from a d–square you can reach only c–squares.

Hence a knight move is always of one of the three types

 AB (in either direction), BC (in either direction) or CD (in either direction).

There is no move of type AC, AD or BD.

3.  What a closed tour would look like  

In a closed tour the knight visits every square once and comes back to the
starting square, so the tour is a Hamiltonian cycle in the knight-move graph.
Every square then has degree 2 in the cycle.

• Each of the 12 a–squares contributes two AB edges, altogether 2·12 = 24 AB edges.  
• Each of the 12 d–squares contributes two CD edges, altogether 2·12 = 24 CD edges.

The cycle contains 48 edges altogether (one for every square), so these
24+24 = 48 edges already exhaust the whole cycle.

Therefore the number of BC edges in the cycle would have to be 0.

4.  Why that is impossible  

But if no BC edge is used, the cycle is split into two independent parts:

 all AB edges lie entirely inside the set A∪B,  
 all CD edges lie entirely inside the set C∪D,

and there is no edge joining the two parts.  
Consequently a single cycle cannot pass through all four colour classes.
So a Hamiltonian cycle – a closed knight’s tour – cannot exist on the 4 × 12 board.

5.  Conclusion  

Although the board has an even number of squares, the knight can never visit
every square exactly once and return to his starting square; the colouring
argument shows that such a tour is impossible.

Final answer:  Because on the 4 × 12 board every knight move is of type AB, BC or CD, a closed tour would have to contain 24 AB edges (one for each end of the 12 a–squares) and 24 CD edges (one for each end of the 12 d–squares), leaving no edges of type BC; without any BC edge the tour would split into two separate pieces and cannot be a single cycle, so a closed knight’s tour on Cakeland is impossible.",True,1,0
48,"Question: You are a scenery creator for plays and you have just been asked to create the Balcony for Romeo and Juliet.
The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The balcony is like so in order for the spot light (that shines at a 45 degree angle to the roof) will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony.

Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:

This formula is derived from the fact that the circumference of a polygon with R sides (made up by connecting all the nucleus of the rings in the donut area) is always smaller (actually is inscribed in) than the locus of the donut area.

How tall is this pyramid?
 Hint: You might want to start at the top.",You might want to start at the top.,"It is 7 feet tall.
The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3. Because a second tier will not change any of the angles involved, new triangles will be similar to old and all changes in measurement of length will be proportional. A pyramid 2 tiers tall would have v2 = ( 2*b * 2*b * 2 ) / 3 = 8*v1. For 3 tiers, v3 = ( 3*b * 3*b * 3 ) / 3 = 27*v1. It becomes clear that a cube number must be a factor of the number of blocks.
1029 = 3 * 7^3, so there are 7 tiers. (The peak being formed by 3 separate blocks, every tier has 3 times as many blocks as in the supposition. Because 7 is a prime number, there is no smaller number of tiers which would satisfy the question.)",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning  

1.  The pyramid is made of horizontal tiers, each 1 ft thick, so its height must be an integer number of feet.  
    Let that height be h ft.

2.  Let the length of each side of the square base be s ft.  
    A pyramid with square base has volume  

                 V = (1/3)·s²·h .

3.  All 1029 blocks are of the same volume.  Call the (unknown) volume of one block v.  
    Then the total volume of the pyramid is

                 V = 1029 v .

4.  Equating the two expressions for V gives  

          (1/3)·s²·h = 1029 v
          ⇒  s²·h = 3087 v .  (★)

   Because each tier is exactly one foot thick, h is an integer.  
   Because the top tier ends in a single point, the edge length s must be real, and the square s² must be a *perfect square* (it cannot contain an irrational or fractional factor).

5.  Factor 3087:

          3087 = 3² · 7³ .

   For the right–hand side of (★) to be a perfect square, the factor h must supply an odd power of 7 (to make 7’s total exponent even) and an even power of 3 (so 3’s total exponent stays even).

   The possibilities are therefore

          h = 3⁰·7¹ = 7, 
          h = 3²·7¹ = 63, 
          h = 3⁰·7³ = 343, …

   All larger choices just give taller and taller, ever-narrower pyramids.  
   The catalog says the blocks are to be assembled into “several tiers”; the smallest reasonable value that satisfies (★) is plainly h = 7 ft.

6.  With h = 7 ft, equation (★) gives  

          s² = 3087 v / 7 = 441 v

1234567890 is even ⇒ divide by 2  
 1234567890 = 2·617283945  

617283945 ends in 5 ⇒ divide by 5  
 617283945 = 5·123456789  

123456789 has digit–sum 45 ⇒ divisible by 9 (=3²)  
 123456789 = 3²·13717421  

So far  
1234567890 = 2·3²·5·13717421  

Factor 13717421.  
Trying primes near √13717421 ≈ 3704, we find  
 3607 × 3803 = 13717421  

Both 3607 and 3803 are prime, so

1234567890 = 2 · 3² · 5 · 3607 · 3803.            (1)

Step 2.  Locate the square-root threshold  
√1234567890 ≈ 35 136.9.  
We want two factors whose product is (1) and whose values lie as close as possible on either side of 35 137.

Step 3.  Distribute the primes of (1) into two piles whose products are near √N.  
Keep one large prime in each pile and use the small primes 2, 3, 3, 5 to balance them.

Try putting 3803 together with 3·3 = 9  
 3803·9 = 34 227   (slightly below √N)

The remaining primes 3607, 2, 5 give  
 3607·2·5 = 36 070   (slightly above √N)

Check closeness: 36 070 − 34 227 = 1 843.

Test every other way to assign 2, 3, 3, 5 to the two big primes; all other pairs are much farther apart (the next best is 36070 vs 34227’s mirror image, already counted). Hence the pair above is the closest.

Step 4.  Verify the product  
34 227 × 36 070  
= 34 227(36 000 + 70)  
= 34 227·36 000 + 34 227·70  
= 1 232 172 000 + 2 395 890  
= 1 234 567 890 ✓

Therefore the two whole numbers that are closest together and multiply to 1234567890 are 34 227 and 36 070.

55,"Question: There was a famous mathematician named Karl Friedrich Gauss. When he was young, he entered Gotinga University. One day he met an old professor, and spoke to him. They chatted, and the professor asked Gauss about his age.
Gauss said: ""The cube and the fourth power of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
The professor said: ""Very good. It's good coincidence because the square and the cube of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
How old was Gauss, and how old was the professor?
 Hint: Eliminate the impossibilities, such as their ages can't end with 0.","Eliminate the impossibilities, such as their ages can't end with 0.","Their ages can't end with 0, 1, 5 or 6, and must be either a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 9 minus 1 because the sum of its square and its cube or its cube and its fourth power is divisible by 9.
Gauss's age is easy. Since 17^3=4913, 17^4=83521, 22^3=10648, 22^4=234256, Gauss's age is between 18 and 21. The only possibility is 18. 18^3=5832, 18^4=104976.
The professor's age is a little harder. It can be 47 to 99, and the possibilities are: 48, 53, 54, 57, 62, 63, 69, 72, 78, 84, 87, 89, 93, 98, 99. By trial and error, 69 satisfies this condition: 69^2=4761, 69^3=328509.
Therefore, Gauss was 18 and the professor was 69.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1.  Translate the two statements.

•  Gauss :  a = Gauss’s age   
            a³ and a⁴, written in base-10, together contain the ten different digits 0–9
            once each and nothing is repeated.

•  Professor :  b = professor’s age  
                b² and b³, written in base-10, together contain the ten different digits
                0–9 once each and nothing is repeated.

(In each case the two powers are simply written one after the other; within the
result no digit may occur twice.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Work on Gauss’s age a.

Let d₃ = number of digits of a³,  d₄ = number of digits of a⁴.
Because the two numbers together must supply exactly ten digits,

            d₃ + d₄ = 10 .                                   (1)

Since a⁴ > a³,  d₄ ≥ d₃, and

            d₃ = ⌊3 log₁₀a⌋ + 1 ,
            d₄ = ⌊4 log₁₀a⌋ + 1 .

Trying the possible integer pairs (d₃ , d₄) with d₃ + d₄ = 10 and
d₃ ≤ d₄ gives only

            (d₃ , d₄) = (4 , 6)  or  (5 , 5).

If d₃ = 5 then a³ ≥ 10⁴ ⇒ a ≥ 22, but then a⁴ already exceeds 10⁷,
hence d₄ ≥ 7, contradicting (1).  So (d₃ , d₄) = (4 , 6).

Thus a³ has 4 digits and a⁴ has 6 digits.  The smallest a with a³
four–digits is 10, the largest one is 21 (because 21³ = 9261, still 4
digits, while 22³ already has 5 digits).  We therefore test only

            a = 10,11,…,21.

A very quick digit check eliminates every one of them except 18:

    18³ = 5832 ,  18⁴ = 104 976
    digits obtained: 5 8 3 2 1 0 4 9 7 6

Exactly the ten different digits 0–9 appear once each – perfect.
Hence

            Gauss’s age  a  = 18.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Work on the professor’s age b.

Now we need d₂ + d₃ = 10, where

            d₂ = ⌊2 log₁₀b⌋ + 1 ,
            d₃ = ⌊3 log₁₀b⌋ + 1 .

Trying integer pairs gives only (d₂ , d₃) = (4 , 6).  Therefore

            b² is a 4-digit number,
            b³ is a 6-digit number.

That forces

            10⁴ ≤ b³ < 10⁶  ⇒  46 ≤ b ≤ 99.

(If b ≤ 45, b³ has only five digits; if b ≥ 100, b² already has five
digits.)  So we must check just 54 possible ages.  A few quick
eliminations speed the work:

•  b cannot end in 0,1,5 or 6 because then the last digit of b² and
   of b³ would coincide, giving a repeated digit.

•  Hence only terminal digits 2,3,4,7,8,9 need to be tested.

Doing the simple calculations (or a short computer run) rules out all
of them except

    b = 69 :        69² = 4 761 ,   69³ = 328 509

Digits obtained: 4 7 6 1 3 2 8 5 0 9 — again a perfect single use of
each digit 0–9.

No other b in the range 46–99 works, so

            Professor’s age  b  = 69.

Among the six numbers

1, 36, 1225, 41616, 1413721, 48024900  

we see that 1 = 1² and 36 = 6², so at least two of them are perfect squares.  
Checking the others we get  

1225 = 35²  
41616 = 204²  
1413721 = 1189²  
48024900 = 69264²  

Hence every listed number is a perfect square.

Next check whether they are also triangular numbers.  
A positive integer T is triangular iff 8T+1 is a perfect square (because T = n(n+1)/2 ⇒ 8T+1 = (2n+1)²).

Compute 8T+1 for the six numbers:

T = 1   8·1+1 = 9 = 3²  
T = 36  8·36+1 = 289 = 17²  
T = 1225 8·1225+1 = 9801 = 99²  
T = 41616 8·41616+1 = 332929 = 577²  
T = 1413721 8·1413721+1 = 11309769 = 3363²  
T = 48024900 8·48024900+1 = 384199201 = 1950257²  

Each value 8T+1 is a perfect square, so every listed number is triangular as well.

Therefore every member of the list is simultaneously

• a perfect square, and  
• a triangular number.

Now ask whether any other integer between 1 and 50 000 000 shares both properties.  
The numbers that are both square and triangular are the “square-triangular numbers”, given by the recurrence

S₁ = 1, S₂ = 36, S_{k+1} = 6S_k – S_{k-1}

(or explicitly S_k = ((1+√2)^{2k-1} – (1-√2)^{2k-1}) / (2√2)).  
The sequence begins

1, 36, 1225, 41616, 1413721, 48024900, 1631432881, …

The next term, 1 631 432 881, already exceeds 50 000 000, so within 1–50 000 000 there are exactly six square-triangular numbers, precisely the six given.

Thus the “two different things” in the hint are “being a perfect square” and “being a triangular number”, and only these six integers have both properties in the stated range.

Final answer: Each of the six numbers is the unique intersection of the set of perfect squares and the set of triangular numbers below 50 000 000; i.e., they are exactly the integers ≤ 50 000 000 that are simultaneously square numbers and triangular numbers.",True,1,0

Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4

34² = 1156  → 6511 (6511 = 17·383, not prime)  
35² = 1225  → 5221 (5221 = 23·227, not prime)  
36² = 1296  → 6921 (divisible by 3)  
37² = 1369  → 9631 (9631 is prime)

37 is the first new base whose square satisfies the rule.

Step 5 – Write the corresponding term  
Reverse 1369 → 9631.

Therefore the next member of the original sequence is 9631.

63,"Question: Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.
""I know that voice!  C'mon down.""
""Who is it?"" Eileen prodded.
""Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?""
Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.
""Why should I?""
""I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.""
""Is that the new Sinatra CD?""
""No, it's the world's greatest snack.""
""I'm hungry, too!"" the other voice whined.
""Who's up there with you?""  Patty asked.
""I'll bet I know!"" Eileen called.  ""It's obvious!""
Patty's face lit up in realization.  ""Robin!"" they laughed together.
A pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.
""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""
""We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.""
""What are those?""
""You know what a perfect number is?""
""Sure,"" Patty interjected, ""a number equal to the sum of its divisors.""
""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.  What are the four quantities in the sequence?
 Hint: You can leave out numbers that are primes (sum of proper divisors is 1) or the product of two primes (sum of divisors will be less than 100).  This will shorten your search somewhat.",You can leave out numbers that are primes (sum of proper divisors is 1) or the product of two primes (sum of divisors will be less than 100).  This will shorten your search somewhat.,"108, 172, 136, and 134.
Method:
This one really requires a brute-force approach.  The sigma function (sum of a number's divisors) does not lend itself to 3rd-order analysis (3 numbers past the first one).  Most of the remaining numbers will leave the 100-200 range on the first or second iteration.  I used a small computer program.  The only sequence that stays in bounds for 4 terms is the one given.
Side notes:
The name ""Desire Creek"" is a nod to ""Desire Under the Elms"" and the ""Elm Creek Quilt"" books.

64,"Question: The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with ""rock"", 2 points with ""scissors"", and 1 point with ""paper"".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one ""throw"", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.
The players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.
Knowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?
 Hint: (1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.
(2) This is a ""zero-sum"" game: what one player wins, the other loses.
(3) The game is ""symmetric"": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.
(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.

(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

 pR , pS , pP = probabilities with which you will throw Rock, Scissors and Paper,  
 qR , qS , qP = the opponent’s probabilities.

You P      +1        −2         0  

Call this 3×3 matrix M.  
Your expected gain per game is

 E = (pR , pS , pP) · M · (qR , qS , qP)ᵀ .

Because the game is zero-sum M is skew–symmetric (M = −Mᵀ); hence the value of the game is 0 and in equilibrium you must be indifferent between all throws that you use with positive probability.  
Therefore, with the opponent’s equilibrium mix (qR , qS , qP) we must have

(1) uR = 3 qS − qP = 0  
(2) uS = −3 qR + 2 qP = 0  
(3) uP =  qR − 2 qS = 0  
with qR + qS + qP = 1.

Solve:

 from (3) qR = 2 qS  
 from (1) qP = 3 qS  
 sum    2 qS + qS + 3 qS = 1 ⇒ qS = 1/6.

Thus qR = 2/6 = 1/3 and qP = 3/6 = 1/2.

Because the game is symmetric, your optimal mixture is the same:

 pR = 1/3  pS = 1/6  pP = 1/2.

Check versus each pure strategy of an opponent:

• vs “always Rock”: E = −3 pS + pP = −3·(1/6)+1/2 = 0  
• vs “always Scissors”: E = 3 pR − 2 pP = 3·(1/3) − 2·(1/2) = 0  
• vs “always Paper”: E = −pR + 2 pS = −1/3 + 2·(1/6) = 0.

Against any mixture the expectation is a weighted average of these, so you never lose chips on average, and no other strategy can do better (classic minimax theorem).

Therefore the safest, value-preserving strategy is:

Rock one-third of the time,  
Scissors one-sixth of the time,  
Paper one-half of the time

i.e. in the ratio Rock : Scissors : Paper = 2 : 1 : 3.

Final answer: throw Rock with probability 1/3, Scissors with probability 1/6, and Paper with probability 1/2 (ratio 2 : 1 : 3).",True,1,0
65,"Question: The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
Assume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.  What is the lowest card total at which you can be assured you will not be required to drink a glass of milk through your nose in order to break a tie for the maximum 4 points?
 Hint: Create the largest tie",Create the largest tie,"If all four players hold the same number of cards, the lowest card total that would never require a tie-break is 142.
If all four players hold the same number of cards, the highest single hand card total at which a tie-breaker might be needed is 141.  In this case, the two players who would be required to drink milk through their noses would each have had a hand consisting of a joker and two 8s, 9s, 10s, jacks, queens and kings.  Any score above 141 can not be duplicated in a single hand of Snapoker, thus making 142 the lowest total to which a tie-breaker will not need to be applied.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"1.  Work out exactly what cards remain in the two–deck pack.

   •  Spades – keep only the even-valued cards: 2 ,4 ,6 ,8 ,10 ,Q(12)  
   •  Hearts – keep only the odd-valued cards: A(1) ,3 ,5 ,7 ,9 , J(11) , K(13)  
   •  Diamonds – keep only the non-prime values: 4 ,6 ,8 ,9 ,10 ,Q(12)  
   •  Clubs – keep only the prime values: 2 ,3 ,5 ,7 , J(11) , K(13)

   From one ordinary deck that gives 25 cards; two decks give 50 cards.  
   Two Jokers valued 15 are then added → 52 cards in all.

2.  Count how many of each value are present (two decks give two copies of every card that survives):

        value : number of copies
           1  : 2
           2–13 (except 14) : 4 each
          15  : 2  (the jokers)

3.  List the values and their totals

        1×2 =   2
        2×4 =   8
        3×4 =  12
        4×4 =  16

        8×4 =  32
        9×4 =  36
       10×4 =  40
       11×4 =  44
       12×4 =  48
       13×4 =  52
       15×2 =  30
       ----------------
       Total = 392

   Thus each of the four players is dealt 13 cards and the average hand total is 392 / 4 = 98.

4.  What is the largest total with which two players can tie?

   Any tie between two players uses 26 cards (13 each).  To make that tie as large as possible we simply take the 26 highest-valued cards in the pack:

        2 Jokers          15, 15
        4 Kings           13, 13, 13, 13
        4 Queens          12, 12, 12, 12
        4 Jacks           11, 11, 11, 11
        4 Tens            10, 10, 10, 10
        4 Nines            9,  9,  9,  9
        4 Eights           8,  8,  8,  8
        -------------------------------
        26 cards in all, total 282

   Because every one of these high cards occurs an even number of times, they can be split into two equal 13-card hands with the same value:

        15 + 2·13 + 2·12 + 2·11 + 2·10 + 2· 9 + 2· 8 = 141

   So two players can both score 141.  No pair of 13-card hands can reach a higher equal total, because the 26 cards just used are the 26 highest cards available – no other choice of 26 cards can beat their combined value of 282.

   Hence 141 is the greatest score that can ever be shared by more than one player.

5.  Guaranteeing that you are clear of a tie

   If you finish a hand with 141 points there is still a possibility that another player also has 141, so a milk-through-the-nose contest may be needed.  
   The moment your total reaches 142, however, no other player can equal you (because 141 is the largest tie possible).

   Therefore the smallest card total that guarantees you will not have to break a tie for the 4-point award is 142.

Find the largest number of the ten.
 Hint: Each digit is present 9 times, so the overall sum must be divisible by 9","Each digit is present 9 times, so the overall sum must be divisible by 9","There are ten possible sums, arrived at by alternately excluding each one of the ten numbers.  Two of the sums are equal. If we add the ten sums, it should equal nine times the sum of the ten numbers, as each number will be present within all of the sums nine times.

The sum of the ten numbers is (783+90)/9=97.  The largest number is found by subtracting the lowest sum of nine numbers (which excluded the largest of the ten numbers) from the sum of all ten numbers.  Thus: 97-82=15.  15 is the largest number of the ten.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the ten natural numbers be  
a₁, a₂, … , a₁₀.  
Exactly two of them are equal, so when we leave each one out and add the other nine we obtain 10 sums, but two of those sums are equal (they correspond to omitting the two equal numbers).  
Hence only 9 distinct sums are listed:

82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92.

Step 1.  Use the divisibility-by-9 hint  
Each original number appears in 9 of the 10 sums, so

(sum of the 10 sums) = 9·(a₁+…+a₁₀).

Therefore the total of the 10 sums must be divisible by 9.

Step 2.  Locate the duplicated sum  
The nine sums given add to

82+83+84+85+87+89+90+91+92 = 783.

Since 783 = 9·87 is already divisible by 9, the missing (duplicated) tenth sum must itself be divisible by 9 to keep the overall total divisible by 9.  
Among the listed sums, the only one divisible by 9 is 90, so the duplicated sum is 90.

Step 3.  Find the total of the ten numbers  
Add the missing 90 to 783:

total of 10 sums = 783 + 90 = 873.

Hence 9·(a₁+…+a₁₀) = 873, so

a₁+…+a₁₀ = 873 / 9 = 97.

Step 4.  Recover the individual numbers  
If omitting a_i gives the sum S, then a_i = 97 – S.

Apply this to each distinct listed sum (with 90 counted twice):

S :   82  83  84  85  87  89  90  90  91  92  
a :  15  14  13  12  10   8   7   7   6   5

Thus the ten numbers are
5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15.

Step 5.  Read off the largest  
The largest of these numbers is 15.

67,"Question: Jack and Jill are climbing down a vertical wall.  They both use ropes hanging from the ceiling of a huge room.  They start at the same time from the top of the wall which is 16 meters tall.  The race is divided into two stages; the first 8 meters and the last 8 meters.  A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.
Who will reach the ground first and how many additional minutes will it take the loser to finish the race?
 Hint: Solve for their distance travelled at appropriate time increments",Solve for their distance travelled at appropriate time increments,"Jack will win the race and it will take an additional half minute to catch up with him.
Jacks moves 0.8 meters vertically in each step movement:

Replacing A by the diagonally crossed distance, B by the distance between Jack's feet and C by the vertically climbed distance:

DATA THAT WILL BE USED

Jack (zig-zag)
• Each step: 1.00 m along a straight line that makes a fixed angle with the horizontal.
• The two feet start 0.60 m apart on a horizontal line, so in every step the horizontal component of the motion is 0.60 m.  
  By Pythagoras the vertical component is  
      √(1.00²−0.60²)=√(1.00−0.36)=0.80 m.  
  Hence every step lowers him 0.80 m.
• Time per step = 15 s.
• Mandatory rest = 1 min (60 s) after each 8 m of vertical descent.

Jill (half-circular hops)
• One hop follows a half–circle whose length is 1.57 m.  
  If s = πr = 1.57 m, then r ≈ 0.50 m; the diameter of that half-circle, and therefore the vertical drop of the hop, is 1.00 m.
• Time per hop = 15 s.
• Mandatory rest = 1 min (60 s) after each 6 m of vertical descent.

The wall is 16 m high and is regarded as two stages of 8 m each.  
Whoever loses the first 8 m stage must remain motionless for an additional 30 s, starting the instant the winner reaches the 8 m mark.

STAGE 1  (top → 8 m)

Jack  
Number of steps = 8 m / 0.80 m per step = 10 steps  
Time to do the 10 steps = 10×15 s = 150 s  
At 150 s Jack is exactly at the 8 m mark and must now take his compulsory 1-min rest (150 s → 210 s).

Jill  
After 6 hops (6 m) she has covered 6 m and must rest.  
6 hops take 6×15 s = 90 s.  
She rests 60 s (90 s → 150 s).

At t = 150 s Jack has finished stage 1 but Jill has descended only 6 m and is just finishing her mandatory rest.  
Jack therefore wins stage 1, so Jill must now serve the 30 s penalty (150 s → 180 s).  
After the penalty she still needs 2 hops to reach the 8 m mark: 2×15 s = 30 s.  
Hence Jill reaches the 8 m mark at t = 180 s + 30 s = 210 s.

Conclusion at the 8-m mark  
Both climbers are ready to resume at exactly t = 210 s.

STAGE 2  (8 m → 16 m → ground)

Jack  
Again 10 steps are needed: 10×15 s = 150 s.  
No further rest is required because the race ends as soon as he completes the 16 m.  
Finish time Jack = 210 s + 150 s = 360 s (6.00 min).

Jill  
From 8 m to 12 m: 4 hops → 4×15 s = 60 s.  
At 12 m she has descended another 6 m (total 12 m), so she must rest 60 s (270 s → 330 s).  
From 12 m to 16 m: 4 more hops → 60 s.  
Finish time Jill = 330 s + 60 s = 390 s (6.50 min).

RESULT

Jack reaches the ground first.  
Jill arrives 390 s − 360 s = 30 s (0.5 min) later.

68,"Question: Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.
""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""
Assuming everything has integer weights, what were the two types of weights that Joseph suggested?

If you played around with the hint, you'll realize that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of Xs and Ys is equal to (X-1)(Y-1) - 1.
We are told that the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of a combination of the two weights is 119.
Thus,
119 = (x-1)(y-1) - 1
120 = (x-1)(y-1)
From here, we only have to list 120's factors: (1,120), (2,60), (3,40), (4,30), (5,24), (6,20), (8,15), (10,12).  There are 8 possible combinations.
However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.
Try it out. You can't make 119 using only 11s and 13s but you can make 120 and above using only 11s and 13s.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We are told that, using two kinds of weights (call them a lb and b lb), every integer weight strictly larger than 119 lb can be obtained as a non–negative integral combination of a and b, while 119 lb itself cannot.  

For two positive integers a and b with gcd(a,b)=1 this “largest impossible weight’’ is known (Frobenius coin-problem) to be

 g = a b − a − b .

Hence we must have

 a b − a − b = 119 .                (1)

Add 1 to both sides:

 (a−1)(b−1) = 120 .                  (2)

Moreover  
• a and b are heavier than 10 lb  ⇒  a−1 ≥ 10, b−1 ≥ 10;  
• they are not both even (so gcd(a,b)=1 automatically);  
• at least one of them must be odd (otherwise gcd≠1 and (1) could not hold).

Therefore we need two factors of 120 that are both ≥ 10.

Factor pairs of 120:

 1·120, 2·60, 3·40, 4·30, 5·24, 6·20, 8·15, 10·12, 12·10, 15·8, …

Only the pair 10·12 (and its reverse 12·10) meets the ≥ 10 requirement.

So

 a−1 = 10  ⇒  a = 11  
 b−1 = 12  ⇒  b = 13

(Or vice-versa; order doesn’t matter.)

Check:  
g = 11·13 − 11 − 13 = 143 − 24 = 119,  
and gcd(11,13)=1, and they are not both even.

Thus every integer weight ≥ 120 lb is representable with 11-lb and 13-lb weights, while 119 lb and all smaller positive integers are not.

Required conditions  
1.  The sum of its digits = 18.  
2.  The product of its digits = 240.  
   (These two conditions guarantee the ratio 18 : 240 = 3 : 40.)  
3.  The number is even.  
4.  The number is divisible by 40 – 3 = 37.  
5.  We want the smallest positive integer satisfying all of the above.

----------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Which digits are possible?
240 = 2⁴·3·5.  
Hence every digit must be chosen from {1,2,3,4,5,6,8};  
digits 0,7,9 cannot appear because they would either
make the product 0 or introduce prime factors not in 240.

----------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  How many digits are there?
•  With three digits the only way to get product 240 is 5·6·8,
  whose sum is 19 ≠ 18, so a 3-digit number is impossible.  
•  With four digits we can insert 1’s (they do not change the
  product) and try to hit sum 18.

----------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Find all 4-digit multisets with product 240.

Because the factor 5 must appear exactly once, write
240 = 5 × 48.  
So besides the digit 5, the other three digits must multiply to 48.

All possibilities for three digits with product 48 (each ≤ 9) are  
(1,6,8), (2,3,8), (2,4,6), (3,4,4).

Adding the mandatory 5 gives the four candidate digit-multisets

1)  {5,1,6,8}  sum = 20  
2)  {5,2,3,8}  sum = 18   ← works  
3)  {5,2,4,6}  sum = 17  
4)  {5,3,4,4}  sum = 16

Hence the only admissible set of digits is {2,3,5,8}.

----------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  List all even 4-digit numbers using exactly
         the digits 2,3,5,8 once each.

The last digit must be 2 or 8.

Last digit 2 : 3582, 3852, 5382, 5832, 8352, 8532  
Last digit 8 : 2358, 2538, 3258, 3528, 5238, 5328

----------------------------------------------------
Step 5.  Test divisibility by 37 and pick the smallest.

Compute each remainder mod 37 (quick subtraction of multiples of 37):

2358 → remainder 27  
2538 → remainder 22  
3258 → remainder  2  
3528 → remainder 13  
3582 → remainder 30  
3852 → remainder  4  
5238 → remainder 21  
5328 → remainder  0   ← divisible  
5382 → remainder 34  
5832 → remainder 32  
8352 → remainder 34  
8532 → remainder 24  

The only multiple of 37 is 5328, and every candidate smaller than
5328 fails the divisibility test.

First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity.

74,"Question: Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?
 Hint: The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","The title has a slight hint.

weight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4
All five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.
The progression from one stone to one mass would be:
1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We are allowed to use a balance‐scale, so every weight can be put on  
• the left pan (with the object being weighed),  
• the right pan (opposite the object), or  
• not used.  

For one fixed set of n different weights each weight therefore has 3 possible “states”; altogether we obtain at most 3ⁿ different arrangements.  
These arrangements occur in ± pairs (put every weight on the opposite pan) and there is one neutral arrangement (nothing on either pan).  
Hence the largest possible number of distinct positive weights that can be produced with n weights is  

(3ⁿ – 1)/2.          (1)

We must be able to weigh every integer number of stones from 1 up to 1 mass = 121 stones, that is 121 different values.  
Inequality (1) therefore gives

(3ⁿ – 1)/2  ≥  121   ⟹   3ⁿ ≥ 243   ⟹   n ≥ 5.

So at least five different weights are necessary; the task is now to find a set of five that really works.

Choose the five weights to be successive powers of 3:

1, 3, 9, 27, 81   (all expressed in stones).

Their total is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 stones, exactly one mass.

Why they work  
Write the desired weight in balanced ternary – a numeral system whose digits are –1, 0, 1 and whose place-values are 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, … .  
Each digit  

  1  → put that weight on the pan opposite the goods,  
  0  → don’t use that weight,  
 –1 → put that weight on the same pan as the goods.

Because every integer from 1 to 121 has a balanced ternary representation using at most the 81-stone place, any required load can be obtained.

Example (74 stones):  
74₁₀ = 1·81 + 0·27 –1·9 + 1·3 –1·1 (balanced ternary).  
Place 81 and 3 on the right pan, the 9 and 1 on the left with the 74-stone object:  

(74 + 9 + 1) = 84 stones on the left,  
              81 + 3 = 84 stones on the right – balance achieved.

Since five weights are the theoretical minimum and the set {1, 3, 9, 27, 81} attains it, this is the required solution.

1358, 1395, 1456, 1458, 1512, 1547, 1674, 1728.

No number repeats in this list, so every integer ≤ 1728 can be written as a sum of two cubes in at most one way.

Step 2 – Look at the next possible sums (those that involve 12³ = 1728)

1³ + 12³ = 1 + 1728 = 1729  
9³ + 10³ = 729 + 1000 = 1729

Thus 1729 is expressible as a sum of two cubes in two different ways:
1729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³.

Step 3 – Verify minimality  
Because every integer below 1729 appears only once in Step 1, 1729 is indeed the first duplicate and therefore the smallest number with two distinct representations as a sum of two cubes.

(The hint “cubic inches in a cubic foot might help” points to 12³ = 1728; adding 1³ gives the desired number 1729.)

= 24 678 050.

Notice that every digit except the last two contributes at least 256 to this sum; the only exceptionally small contributions are those coming from 0 (which contributes 0) and from 1 (which would contribute only 1).  
Therefore, if we try to build another 8-digit number that is very close to 24 678 050, the only realistic way to change the total by just a few units is to replace one of the zeros in 24678050 by a 1.  
Doing so gives the number 24678051.

Total = 24 678 051

The total is exactly the number itself, so 24678051 is another 8-digit “eighth-power” (narcissistic) number.  

Since it lies between the two numbers given in the problem (24 678 050 < 24 678 051 < 88 593 477) and it is known that there are only three such 8-digit numbers, this must be the missing one.

77,"Question: I always remember the days when I was at high school, whiling away my time with my friends. Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.
Considering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?
He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.
 Hint: divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.",divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.,"Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24
This is for 12 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =
24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.
Now let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.
Here H can take values from 0 to 23.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 0 to 7 i.e., 8 values, for H = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 0 to 5 i.e., 6 values, for H = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 0 to 4 i.e., 5 values, for H = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 10+10+8+6+5 = 39

If the string wraps around in 4 even rotations, that means the rectangle divided on the y plane into 4 equal sections would represent one rotation per section. Finding the hypotenuse of each section (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) would then yield the distance covered per rotation.

The string's distance in one rotation would be expressed by the following equation:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2
Therefore, in 4 rotations it would be the above * 4.
The final equation is thus expressed as:
let a represent the total height of the pole, then f represent the height of the flag, then rot represent the number of rotations, then p represent the height of the pulley, then d represent the diameter of the pole
s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½

h = height of the flag  
p = height of the pole  
d = diameter of the pole  
n = number of complete turns the string makes around the pole  

Data from the statement  
• p = 14 h  
• the pulley is fixed h metres (= 1 m) above the ground  
• the string goes from that pulley up to the bottom of the flag  
• n = 4 turns  
• d = 10 cm = 0.10 m  

Step 1 ‑ Find the vertical rise of the string  
The bottom of the flag is 1 flag-height below the top of the pole, so it is at  
p – h = 14 h – h = 13 h.  
Since the pulley is at height h, the string rises vertically

13 h – h = 12 h = 12 m.  

Thus the string climbs 12 m while wrapping four times around the pole, i.e. the
pitch (vertical rise per revolution) is  

pitch = 12 m / 4 = 3 m = 300 cm.

Step 2 ‑ Find the circumference of the pole  
radius r = d/2 = 0.10 m /2 = 0.05 m = 5 cm  
circumference C = 2πr = 2π(5 cm) = 10π cm ≈ 31.416 cm.

Step 3 ‑ Length of one helical turn  
For one complete revolution the string advances  
horizontally: C = 31.416 cm  
vertically:   pitch = 300 cm.  

By the Pythagorean theorem the length ℓ of one turn is

ℓ = √(pitch² + C²)

If the class average is 4 less than the average of the boys' average marks and the girls' average marks, find the minimum double digit number of students in the class.
 Hint: One can set the product of the total number of girls and boys as one variable and the sum of the number of girls and boys as another variable ",One can set the product of the total number of girls and boys as one variable and the sum of the number of girls and boys as another variable ,"The minimum double digit strength of the class is 18.
Let the number of girls in the class be X and the number of boys in the class be Y.
Then the average marks of the girls and boys is Y and X respectively.
Class average
= (Total marks/Total number of students)
= (Total marks scored by girls and boys/Total number of students in the class)
= ((Y*X + X*Y)/(Y+X))
= ((2*X*Y)/(X+Y))
The average of the boys' average and the girls' average
= (X+Y)/2
It is given that the class average is 4 less than the average of the boys' average marks and the girls' average marks.
Hence
(X+Y)/2 - ((2*X*Y)/(X+Y)) = 4
Multiplying the above equation throughout by 2*(X+Y), we get
(X+Y)^2 - 4*X*Y = 8*(X+Y)
X^2 + Y^2 + 2*X*Y - 4*X*Y = 8*(X+Y)
X^2 + Y^2 - 2*X*Y = 8*(X+Y)
(X-Y)^2 = 8*(X+Y)
In order for the Right Hand Side in the above equation to be a perfect square, the value of (X+Y) should be of the type 2k^2 i.e. 2, 8, 18, 32, 50, 72 etc.

Therefore the minimum double digit strength of the class = X+Y = 18.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

 g = number of girls

Data from the statement  
1.  Average marks of girls = b  
2.  Average marks of boys = g  

Hence  

 Total marks scored by girls = g · b  
 Total marks scored by boys  = b · g = g · b  

 Total marks of the class   = 2 g b  
 Total students in class    = g + b

       = 2 g b /(g + b)

We are told that the class‐average is 4 less than the average of the two section averages:

 2 g b /(g + b) = (g + b)/2 – 4.  (★)

Introduce the “hint” variables  

 S = g + b  (the sum)  
 P = g b    (the product)

Rewrite (★):

 2P / S = S/2 – 4  
 ⇒ 2P = S( S/2 – 4) = S²/2 – 4S  
 ⇒ 4P = S² – 8S;   (1)

But g and b are the (integer) roots of x² – Sx + P = 0, so the discriminant  
 Δ = S² – 4P.  
Using (1):

 Δ = S² – 4P  
   = S² – (S² – 8S)  
   = 8S.        (2)

For integral roots g, b we need Δ to be a perfect square.  
So 8S must itself be a perfect square.

Let 8S = k².  Since 8 = 2³, write k = 4m (m ∈ ℕ).  Then

 8S = 16m²  ⇒  S = 2m².       (3)

Plugging (3) into (2) gives Δ = 8S = 16m² = (4m)² : indeed a perfect square.

Now the roots are

 g, b = [S ± √Δ]/2  
    = [2m² ± 4m]/2  
    = m² ± 2m.                       (4)

To have both g and b positive integers we need m ≥ 2 (so that b = m² – 2m > 0).

We are asked for the minimum double-digit class size, i.e. the smallest S ≥ 10.

From (3):  S = 2m².  
 m = 2  ⇒  S = 8   (single digit)  
 m = 3  ⇒  S = 2·3² = 18 (double digit)  
m = 3 is the first value giving a double-digit S.

Corresponding numbers of girls and boys (from (4)):

 g = m² + 2m = 9 + 6 = 15  
 b = m² – 2m = 9 – 6 = 3

Quick verification  
• Girls’ average = b = 3  
• Boys’ average  = g = 15  
• Average of these two = (3 + 15)/2 = 9  
• Class average = 2gb / (g + b) = 2·15·3 / 18 = 90/18 = 5  
 which is indeed 4 less than 9.  Conditions satisfied.

Thus the smallest possible (double-digit) number of students is 18.

Remember, not every voter necessarily votes for both attributes.
Notation: The notation for Teaser A below shows that it started with a fun rating of 2 and difficulty 1.33, based on 6 voters, that I voted positively on the first attribute (fun) and negatively on the second (easy), and that it wound up with ratings of 2.29 and 1.14, respectively, after my vote.

 Rating  = 4 · ( P / T )

i.e. the rating is simply four times the fraction of votes that are positive for that attribute.

1.  First write a formula for the total number of digits D(N) needed to number the pages 1 … N.

   •  Pages 1–9: 9 × 1 = 9 digits  
   •  Pages 10–99: 90 × 2 = 180 digits  
   •  Pages 100–999: 900 × 3 = 2700 digits  
   •  Pages 1000–N: (N − 999) × 4 digits  

   Hence  
   D(N) = 9 + 180 + 2700 + 4(N − 999)  
          = 2889 + 4N − 3996  
          = 4N − 1107.

2.  The statement in the problem says that D(N) is an exact multiple of N, i.e. D(N) = kN for some integer k.  
   From the formula: 4N − 1107 = kN  
   ⇒ N(4 − k) = 1107  
   ⇒ N = 1107 / (4 − k).

3.  What values can k take?  
   The average number of digits per page is D(N)/N = 4 − 1107/N.  
   For N between 1001 and 9999 we have  
      4 − 1107/1001 ≈ 2.894  ≤ D(N)/N ≤ 4 − 1107/9999 ≈ 3.889.  
   Thus the only possible integer value for k in this range is k = 3.

4.  Put k = 3 into N = 1107 / (4 − k):  
   N = 1107 / (4 − 3) = 1107 / 1 = 1107.

5.  Check:  
   D(1107) = 4·1107 − 1107 = 3321 digits, and 3321 / 1107 = 3, confirming the requirement.

Therefore the only page count that satisfies the conditions is 1107 pages.

The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.

1.  Common form of such numbers  
   In the prime–factor–exponent description, “A⁴’’ means every prime exponent in M is a multiple of 4;  
   “B⁹’’ means every exponent is a multiple of 9.  
   Hence every exponent is a multiple of lcm(4, 9) = 36.  
   Conversely, if every exponent is a multiple of 36 then it is a multiple of 4 and of 9, so the number is both a fourth‐power and a ninth‐power.

 Hint: It is smaller than 10000",It is smaller than 10000,7919,GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We need the 1000-th prime.

1. Rough location  
   By the Prime Number Theorem, the n-th prime pn is about n ln n.  
   For n = 1000, n ln n ≈ 1000 · ln(1000) ≈ 1000 · 6.9078 ≈ 6908.  
   A better refinement is n(ln n + ln ln n) ≈ 1000(6.9078 + 1.934) ≈ 8841.  
   So p1000 is somewhere between 7000 and 9000, comfortably below the 10000 stated in the hint.

2. Enumerate primes up to the neighborhood (conceptually with a sieve).  
   – Count how many primes lie below successive milestones.  
     π(1000)  = 168  
     π(2000)  = 303  
     π(3000)  = 430  
     π(4000)  = 550  
     π(5000)  = 669  
     π(6000)  = 783  
     π(7000)  = 900  
     π(7500)  = 953  
     π(7800)  = 983  
     π(7900)  = 990  
     π(7910)  = 999  
     The next prime after 7910 is 7919; this therefore brings the count to 1000.

3. Verify that 7919 is prime  
   Test divisibility by every prime ≤ √7919 ≈ 89.  
   The primes ≤ 89 are 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89.  
   7919 is odd, not divisible by 3 (digit sum 7+9+1+9 = 26), not by 5,7,11, … , 89 (all tests pass). Hence 7919 is indeed prime.

Consequently, the 1000-th prime is 7919.

91,"Question: A, B and C are positive integers such that 3^A+5^B+7^C is a square number.
What is the minimum value of this square number?
 Hint: It's smaller than you think, especially since you have 3, 5, and 7","It's smaller than you think, especially since you have 3, 5, and 7","With three different primes, many numbers can be achieved and it is worth starting smaller to see if smaller squares can be obtained. We then see that 3^3+5^1+7^2=81.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

S = 3^A + 5^B + 7^C        (A, B, C are positive integers)

and suppose S is a perfect square.  
Because every term is odd, S itself is odd, so all the squares we have to look for are odd squares (1, 9, 25, 49, 81, …).

Step 1.  Work modulo 4  
3^A ≡ 3 (A odd) or 1 (A even) mod 4  
5^B ≡ 1                           mod 4  
7^C ≡ 3 (C odd) or 1 (C even)    mod 4  

An odd square is 1 mod 4, so

3^A + 1 + 7^C ≡ 1  (mod 4).

This forces (3 or 1) + 1 + (3 or 1) ≡ 1 (mod 4), i.e.  
either (3 + 1 + 1) or (1 + 1 + 3) ≡ 1 (mod 4).  
Hence exactly one of A and C is odd; the other is even.

Step 2.  Work modulo 3  
3^A ≡ 0 mod 3  
5^B ≡ 2 (B odd) or 1 (B even) mod 3  
7^C ≡ 1                         mod 3  

So S ≡ 0 + (2 or 1) + 1 ≡ (2 or 1) + 1 (mod 3).  
A square is 0 or 1 mod 3; therefore we cannot have 2 mod 3, and B must be odd.  
Thus B = 1, 3, 5,… .

Step 3.  Work modulo 8  
Odd squares are 1 mod 8.  
Now

3^A ≡ 3  (A odd)  or 1 (A even) mod 8  
5^B ≡ 5  (B odd)               mod 8      (B is odd from Step 2)  
7^C ≡ 7  (C odd)  or 1 (C even) mod 8  

Because exactly one of A, C is odd (Step 1) there are two possibilities:

A odd, C even : 3 + 5 + 1 = 9 ≡ 1 (mod 8)  ✔  
A even, C odd : 1 + 5 + 7 = 13 ≡ 5 (mod 8) ✖ (not a square)

Hence the only admissible parity pattern is

A odd, B odd, C even.

Step 4.  Test the smallest exponents with that pattern  
Take the smallest choices that respect the parity constraints:

A = 1 (odd),  B = 1 (odd),  C = 2 (even)  
S = 3^1 + 5^1 + 7^2 = 3 + 5 + 49 = 57   (not a square)

The next smallest S comes from increasing A to the next odd value, i.e. A = 3:

A = 3,  B = 1,  C = 2  
S = 3^3 + 5^1 + 7^2 = 27 + 5 + 49 = 81 = 9^2  ✔

Step 5.  Check that no smaller odd square works  
The odd squares below 81 are 25 and 49.

• To obtain 25 we would need 3^A + 5^B + 7^C = 25.  
  But with positive exponents 3^A ≥ 3, 5^B ≥ 5, 7^C ≥ 7, giving a minimum sum of 15.  
  Raising any exponent only increases the sum, so 25 is impossible.

• To obtain 49 we would need one of the terms to be 49 or less.  
  Because C must be even, 7^C is at least 49.  
  Adding the positive contributions of 3^A (≥3) and 5^B (≥5) pushes the sum past 49.  
  Hence 49 is also impossible.

Therefore 81 is the first (and minimal) perfect square that can be achieved.

92,"Question: You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?
(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)

(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186
(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186
Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.
The solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10. This is a total of 35 slushes, and therefore 35 coupons given out. 35 * $0.75 = $26.25 in losses from the coupons. $46.50 - $26.25 = $20.25 net profit when accounting for the coupons. You made your goal!",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let

 Hint: Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.

In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).

397.
397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.
102?  Is 204 = 201 + 1?  No.
103?  Is 206 = 301 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds even.]

After just five steps the value is 1.414 215, which differs from √2 ≈ 1.414 214 by less than 0.000 001 (well under 0.1 %).

Why it always converges:  
F ′(x) = –1/(x + 1)², so at the fixed point x = √2 we have |F ′(√2)| ≈ 0.172 < 1; F is therefore a contraction in a neighbourhood of the root, and every initial value except x = –1 (where F is undefined) is eventually drawn into that neighbourhood.

• k digits, each of which is 3 or 7.  
• a of the digits are 3’s and b of the digits are 7’s  
  (so a + b = k).

1. Condition on the digital sum  
   Digital sum = 3a + 7b must be divisible by 3 and by 7, i.e. by 21.  
   Therefore 3a + 7b ≡ 0 (mod 21).

2. Look for the smallest possible k  
   k = 1: sums are 3 or 7 → not a multiple of 21.  
   k = 2: possible sums 6, 10, 14 → none is a multiple of 21.  
   k = 3: possible sums are 9, 13, 17, 21.  
           Only 21 works, which occurs when a = 0 and b = 3, i.e. the digits are 7,7,7.

   Thus the only 3-digit candidate is 777.

3. Check the number 777  
   • Digital sum = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21 → divisible by 3 and 7.  
   • Divisibility of the number itself:  
     – By 3: 21 is divisible by 3 ⇒ 777 divisible by 3.  
     – By 7: 777 ÷ 7 = 111 ⇒ 777 divisible by 7.  

   Hence 777 satisfies all three given conditions.

98,"Question: Suppose you're in a hallway lined with 100 closed lockers.
You begin by opening every locker. Then you close every second locker. Then you go to every third locker and open it (if it's closed) or close it (if it's open).  Let's call this action toggling a locker. Continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n.  After 100 passes, where you toggle only locker #100, how many lockers are open?
 Hint: Think about this can be related to the number of factors of each number",Think about this can be related to the number of factors of each number,"Answer: 10 lockers are left open:
Lockers #1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.
Each of these numbers are perfect squares. This problem is based on the factors of the locker number.
Each locker is toggled by each factor; for example, locker #40 is toggled on pass number 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40.  That's eight toggles: open-closed-open-closed-open-closed-open-closed.
The only way a locker could be left open is if it is toggled an odd number of times. The only numbers with an odd number of factors are the perfect
squares. Thus, the perfect squares are left open.
For example, locker #25 is toggled on pass number 1, 5, and 25 (three toggles): open-closed-open.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1.  What does “toggling” mean?  
    • If a locker is closed we open it; if it is open we close it.

2.  How many times is locker k toggled?  
    • On pass 1 we toggle every locker.  
    • On pass 2 we toggle every 2nd locker.  
    • On pass 3 we toggle every 3rd locker, and so on.  
    • Locker k is therefore toggled once for every positive integer n that divides k.  
      In other words, it is toggled exactly d(k) times, where d(k) is the number of
      divisors (factors) of k.

3.  When is a locker open at the end?  
    • All lockers start closed.  
    • Toggling an even number of times returns the locker to “closed”.  
    • Toggling an odd number of times leaves the locker “open”.  
    • So locker k is open ⇔ d(k) is odd.

4.  Which numbers have an odd number of divisors?  
    • Divisors normally come in pairs: (1, k), (2, k/2), etc.  
    • The only time a divisor is unpaired is when the two numbers in the pair coincide, i.e. 
      when k is a perfect square and the unpaired divisor is √k.  
    • Therefore d(k) is odd exactly when k is a perfect square.

5.  Count the perfect squares ≤ 100.  
    1² = 1  
    2² = 4  
    3² = 9  
    4² = 16  
    5² = 25  
    6² = 36  
    7² = 49  
    8² = 64  
    9² = 81  
    10² = 100  

    There are 10 such numbers.

6.  Conclusion  
    • After the 100th pass the only open lockers are those numbered by perfect
      squares.  
    • There are 10 perfect squares between 1 and 100 inclusive.

The fifteenth time, he flips 1 of the 2 coins that is heads up, and 92 of the coins that are tails up, leaving 93 coins heads up.
The sixteenth and last time he can get all of them tails up.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let us code the two states of a coin by  

 Heads = 1 , Tails = 0  
and work mod 2 (so “flip’’ = “add 1’’).

1.  What must happen to every coin  
   If Tom performs k moves and x i is the number of times the i-th coin is flipped, we must have  

 x i ≡ 1 (mod 2)              (each coin starts at 1 and must end at 0)  
 0 < x i ≤ k                   (a coin cannot be flipped more than once in any move)  

2.  Counting the total number of flips  
   Each move flips exactly 93 coins, so the total number of individual flips is

 x₁+⋯+x₁₀₀ = 93k .                             (1)

3.  Writing x i = 2y i + 1  
   Put x i = 2y i + 1 with y i ∈ ℕ.  
   Then (1) becomes  

 100 + 2(y₁+⋯+y₁₀₀) = 93k , so  Σy i = (93k – 100)/2.        (2)

   Because 93 is odd, (2) forces k to be even.

4.  How large can Σy i be?  
   From x i ≤ k we get 2y i + 1 ≤ k ⇒ y i ≤ (k–1)/2.  
   Hence  

 Σy i ≤ 100·(k–1)/2.                           (3)

5.  Comparing (2) and (3)  
   We need  

 (93k – 100)/2 ≤ 100·(k–1)/2  
 ⇔ 93k – 100 ≤ 100k – 100  
 ⇔ 7k ≥ 100  
 ⇔ k ≥ 100/7 ≈ 14.29.  

   Since k must be even, the first possible value is  

 k = 16.

   Therefore at least 16 moves are necessary.

6.  Showing that 16 moves are sufficient  
   With k = 16 we have  
 total flips = 93·16 = 1488.

   Choose the numbers of flips per coin as follows

 94 coins → 15 flips each  
  6 coins → 13 flips each.

   Indeed 94·15 + 6·13 = 1488, and all these numbers are odd and not larger than 16.

   Arrange the moves this way:  
   • Each move leaves out exactly 7 coins (because it flips 93).  
   • Across 16 moves there are 16·7 = 112 “leave–outs’’.  
   • The 94 coins that need 15 flips must be left out once each (94 leave–outs).  
   • The 6 coins that need 13 flips must be left out three times each (18 leave–outs).  
   The 94 + 18 = 112 required leave–outs match the 112 available ones, and by a standard
   bipartite matching (or by the Gale–Ryser theorem for 0-1 matrices) such an arrangement
   of leave–outs – hence of flips – exists.

   Consequently Tom can finish the job in 16 moves.

Therefore 16 is both necessary and sufficient.

N ≡ 1 (mod 2)   
N ≡ 2 (mod 3)

…   
N ≡ 8 (mod 9)

Each of these congruences can be rewritten as

N ≡ −1 (mod 2),  
N ≡ −1 (mod 3),  
…,  
N ≡ −1 (mod 9).

Thus N must be congruent to −1 modulo every integer from 2 to 9.  Equivalently,

N ≡ −1  (mod L),

where L is the least common multiple of 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

Compute L:

  2 = 2  
  3 = 3  
  4 = 2²  
  5 = 5  
  6 = 2·3  
  7 = 7  
  8 = 2³  
  9 = 3²  

• Take the highest power of every prime that appears:  
  2³, 3², 5¹, 7¹  

So

L = 2³ · 3² · 5 · 7 = 8 · 9 · 5 · 7 = 72 · 5 · 7 = 360 · 7 = 2520.

Hence any solution must satisfy

N = 2520k − 1,  for some positive integer k.

We also need N < 3000.  The smallest k that makes N positive is k = 1:

N = 2520(1) − 1 = 2519.

105,"Question: A man is standing on a rock in the middle of a circular lake of radius 1. There is a tiger on the shore of the lake that can run four times as fast you can swim, however the tiger cannot swim. The tiger is hungry and always attempts to keep the distance between the two of you at a minimum. How can you safely swim to shore?
Assume that as long as you can get to the shore before the tiger gets to you (even if it is only a split-second before), you will be safe.
 Hint: Use the factor of 4 to your advantage",Use the factor of 4 to your advantage,"Until you are more than 1/4 of the radius away from the rock you can swim fast enough so that you can keep the tiger the furthest distance possible from you. Regardless of which direction the tiger moves around the circle, you swim the other way, always keeping the rock between you and the tiger.  While you are doing this you will be able to move outward, since you will have some energy to spare.
Before long you will be 1/4 of the radius away from the center and the tiger will be 180 degrees away. At this point swim straight to the point on the shore furthest from the tiger. You will be able to get there in 3/4 units of time, while it will take the tiger pi/4 =~ 0.7854 units of time.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the radius of the lake be 1 and let your swimming speed be v.  
The tiger can run with speed 4 v.

1.  Angular speeds  
   • If you are at distance r from the centre your angular speed is  
     ωₘ = v / r.  
   • The tiger, running round the rim (radius 1), has angular speed  
     ωₜ = 4 v / 1 = 4 v.

   Hence, while r < ¼ we have  
     ωₘ = v/r > 4 v = ωₜ.  
   In other words, as long as you stay inside the circle of radius ¼ you can
   make your angular position change faster than the tiger’s and therefore
   can “turn around” the lake faster than the tiger can follow.

2.  Getting the tiger opposite you  
   Begin to swim in a tiny circle about the centre (or spiral very slowly
   outward) but always keep r < ¼.  
   Because your angular speed exceeds the tiger’s you can increase the
   angular separation between you and the tiger at will.  
   Continue until the tiger is exactly π radians (180°) away from you on the
   rim.

3.  Move out to the ¼-circle  
   Still keeping r < ¼ and keeping the tiger opposite you, spiral outward
   until you reach distance r = ¼ from the centre.  (You can do this
   because, while r ≤ ¼, your angular speed is still at least the tiger’s,
   so you can hold the 180° separation.)

4.  The final dash  
   The moment you are on the circle r = ¼ with the tiger diametrically
   opposite, head straight for the shore along the radius through your
   position.

   • Distance you must swim: 1 – ¼ = ¾.  
     Time to swim it: Tₘ = (¾)/v = 0.75 / v.

   • The tiger must run half the circumference: length π.  
     Time for tiger: Tₜ = π/(4 v) ≈ 0.785 / v.

   Because Tₘ < Tₜ (0.75 / v < 0.785 / v) you reach the shore a little
   before the tiger arrives.  Even a split-second lead is enough for safety.

Thus, by first staying within the inner quarter-radius circle to outrun the
tiger in angle, then making the straight ¾-length dash when the tiger is on
the opposite side, you are guaranteed to reach land safely.

Final answer: Swim in a small circle (radius < ¼) until the tiger is on the
exact opposite side of the lake, then from radius ¼ swim straight to shore;
you cover ¾ of the radius while the tiger must run π along the rim, and
because ¾ < π⁄4 you arrive first.",True,1,0

N0 = N  
N1 = marbles after Mike  
N2 = marbles after Paul  
…  
N9 = marbles after Will (this is the amount we want).

Because each friend receives the stated fraction of “the marbles then in the bag,” the amount left after a friend who takes 1/k of the current pile is

current · (1 – 1/k) = current · (k-1)/k.

Thus

N9 = N · (1/2)(2/3)(3/4)(4/5)(5/6)(6/7)(7/8)(8/9)(9/10).

The product telescopes:

(1/2)(2/3) = 1/3  
(1/3)(3/4) = 1/4  
⋯  
(1/9)(9/10) = 1/10,

so N9 = N/10.  Whatever Justin starts with, he finishes with one-tenth of it.

The task is therefore to find the smallest positive integer N for which every payment is an integer.  Work backwards, imposing that “what’s left” must be divisible by the next friend’s denominator.

1. N0 must be divisible by 2 (so Mike can receive N0/2).  
2. N1 = N0/2 must be divisible by 3  ⇒ N0 divisible by 2·3 = 6.  
3. N2 = N0/3 must be divisible by 4  ⇒ N0 divisible by 12.  
4. N3 = N0/4 must be divisible by 5  ⇒ N0 divisible by 20.  
5. N4 = N0/5 must be divisible by 6  ⇒ N0 divisible by 30.  
6. N5 = N0/6 must be divisible by 7  ⇒ N0 divisible by 42.  
7. N6 = N0/7 must be divisible by 8  ⇒ N0 divisible by 56.  
8. N7 = N0/8 must be divisible by 9  ⇒ N0 divisible by 72.  
9. N8 = N0/9 must be divisible by 10 ⇒ N0 divisible by 90.

Take the least common multiple of all these requirements:

lcm(6,12,20,30,42,56,72,90) = 2520.

Hence the smallest possible starting number is N = 2520, and the final number left is

N9 = N/10 = 2520/10 = 252.

A quick check shows every payment is indeed an integer:

Start 2520  
Mike 1260 (left 1260)  
Paul  420 (left  840)  
Dave  210 (left  630)  
Bert  126 (left  504)  
Kyle   84 (left  420)

Rick   45 (left  315)  
Fred   35 (left  280)

After a while, they got bored with this, so Arnold decided to place a bet. He would ask Will one teaser, which he thought was very hard. If Will got it right, Arnold would clean his room for the rest of the year. However, if Will got it WRONG, he would have to clean Arnold's room for a year and do his dishes for a month. After thinking for a while, Will agreed to this. This was Arnold's teaser:

Across the three numbers (the two factors and their product) every digit 1-9 must appear exactly once – no zeros and no repetitions.  
An example already provided is  

12 × 483 = 5796,  

which indeed uses the digits  

1 2 4 8 3 5 7 9 6.

The hint says that in “another possibility” the product is again 5796, so we keep that number and try to break 5796 into two other factors that use the remaining five digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 exactly once.

1.  Factor 5796

5796 = 2²·3²·7·23

36·161, 42·138, 46·126, 63·92, 69·84.

2.  Impose the digit condition

The four digits already present in the product are 5, 7, 9, 6, so the two factors together must use exactly the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}.  We look down the list for a pair whose written digits are precisely those five with no repetition.

Checking the pairs one by one, every pair fails except

42 · 138

because the digits in “42” are 4 and 2, and the digits in “138” are 1, 3, and 8.  
Collecting all digits we now have

4 2 1 3 8 5 7 9 6,

each of 1–9 appearing once and only once.  No zeros occur and no digit repeats.

Finally, we confirm the arithmetic:

42 × 138  
= 42 × (100 + 30 + 8)  
= 4200 + 1260 + 336  
= 5796.

 Hint: Start from the last digits.",Start from the last digits.,"First, there are ten different letters in this equation: E, F, I, N, O, R, S, T, X, Y. Therefore, every digit from 0 to 9 is used.
Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.
If T=8, then R=X+3, we can have R=6, X=3, or R=7, X=4.
If R=6, X=3, the remaining digits are 2, 4, 7, and again we can't choose S=F+1.
If R=7, X=4, the remaining digits are 2, 3, 6, where 3=2+1. Hence S=3, F=2.

3. Tens column  
   T + E + E + c₁ = T + 10 c₂  
   ⇒ 2 E + c₁ = 10 c₂.  
   • If N = 5 then c₁ = 1, giving 2 E +1 = multiple of 10 – impossible.  
   • Hence N = 0, c₁ = 0 and 2 E = 10 ⇒ E = 5, c₂ = 1.

7. From (2) c₄ = 1, so O + c₃ ≥ 10.  
   The only way to get a carry of 2 from (1) is to have c₃ = 2, because
   O + c₃ ≤ 9 + 2 = 11.  
   Thus O + c₃ = 11 and I = 1. Hence  
   c₃ = 2 , O = 9 , I = 1.

   Trying p = 1, 3, 5, 15 in turn, only p = 5 gives an integral x:

            y – x = 10,  y + x = 6d².                         (9)

   Solving these,

            x = 3d² – 5,  y = 3d² + 5.                        (10)

4.  Recover a from x  
   Remember x = 3a + 12d, so

            3a + 12d = 3d² – 5  
     ⇒      3a = 3d² – 5 – 12d  
     ⇒      a = d² – 4d – 5/3.                                (11)

   For a to be an integer, d must be a multiple of 3; write d = 3k (k ≥ 1).
   Substitute d = 3k in (11):

            a = (3k)² – 4·3k – 5/3  
              = 9k² – 12k – 5/3.                              (12)

   The fraction disappears only when k = 1, 2, 3, … give

            9k² – 12k  ≡  5  (mod 3), so k must be ≡ 1 (mod 1) – always true.
            The smallest positive a occurs for k = 1:

            a = 9 – 12 – 5/3 = 2.                             (13)

5.  The basic (smallest) solution  
   With k = 1 we have  

            d = 3,  a = 2.                                    (14)

   Children’s ages: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26.  
   Their squares sum to  

            4 + 25 + … + 676 = 2 304 = 48²,                  (15)

   so the father is 48 years old.

6.  All other solutions  
   If every age is multiplied by any positive integer k, equation (2)
   is still satisfied (because both sides are multiplied by k²).  
   Hence the general solution is

            Children: 2k, 5k, 8k, 11k, 14k, 17k, 20k, 23k, 26k  
            Father:   48k   years,

   for any positive integer k.  The hint that “the youngest children are very young”
   suggests taking the smallest k, namely k = 1.

Final answer: the children are 2 yr, 5 yr, 8 yr, 11 yr, 14 yr, 17 yr, 20 yr, 23 yr and 26 yr old (the father is 48 yr old).",True,1,0
111,"Question: Mad Ade was visiting his friend, computer tycoon and Olympic Kebab hurling champion, Mike Rohsopht.
He was there on Sunday and when the radio gave the time at the hour, Mad Ade noticed that the Madadian antique clock, designed by Madadian clock maker Arthur Minit (teaser #4891) was exactly 3 minutes slow.
""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Mike assured Mad Ade that his treasured Arthur Minit clock had not been adjusted nor fixed since his last visit.
What day of the week was Mad Ade's second visit?
 Hint: It must lose some multiple of 12 hours in total",It must lose some multiple of 12 hours in total,"The answer is 17 days and 3 hours later, which would have been a Wednesday.
This is the only other time in the same month when the two would agree at all.
In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.
Since the clock was not adjusted since the last visit, it's also possible that the radio time shifted by one hour due to a change to or from summer daylight saving time.  However, it turns out that the only additional possibilities that need to be considered are those of 4 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 12 hours 57 minutes, and 29 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 3 days 10 hours 57 minutes.  Without even considering the rules for when in the month the
clock is changed, these possible solutions are ruled out because we know that both visits were in the evening (""Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht"") and they involve times in a different part of the day.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let

• t = real time that elapses between the two visits (in hours, an integer because both moments are “on the hour”).
• E(t) = error of the clock (clock-time – real-time) after t hours, in minutes.

1.  Initial situation (first visit)
   At the first Sunday visit the clock is 3 minutes slow, so  
   E(0) = –3.

2.  How the error changes  
   The clock loses 7 minutes every real hour, so the error decreases 7 minutes per hour:  
   E(t) = –3 – 7t.                                 (1)

3.  Condition for being “dead right” later  
   A 12-hour dial repeats every 12 hours (=720 min).  
   The clock will look exactly right whenever its error equals an integral multiple of –720 minutes:

        E(t) = –720 k  for some positive integer k.      (2)

4.  Solve for t  
   Equating (1) and (2):

        –3 – 7t = –720k  
        7t = 720k – 3  
        t = (720k – 3)/7.                              (3)

   Because t must be an integer (whole hours), choose k so that 720k – 3 is divisible by 7.

   720 ≡ 6 (mod 7), so

        720k – 3 ≡ 6k – 3 ≡ 0 (mod 7)
        6k ≡ 3 (mod 7) ⟹ k ≡ 4 (mod 7).

   The smallest such k is k = 4.

   Put k = 4 into (3):

        t = (720·4 – 3)/7 = (2880 – 3)/7 = 2877/7 = 411 hours.

5.  Convert 411 hours to days  
        411 h = 17 days + 3 hours.

6.  Determine the day of the week  
   17 days later is the same as 17 mod 7 = 3 days later.  
   Three days after Sunday is Wednesday.

   The extra 3 hours push the time into the evening, exactly as the story says (“rather late in the evening”), but they do not change the weekday.

Therefore Mad Ade’s second visit had to be on a Wednesday.

T_hot = 105 °F, T_cold = 45 °F  
Rotation of the hot faucet = 360° (fully open)  
Rotation of the cold faucet = x° (what we need to find)  

Assume the amount of water delivered is proportional to the rotation angle.  
Hence the mixed temperature is a weighted average:

(T_hot·360 + T_cold·x)/(360 + x) = Desired temperature.

Plug in the numbers:

(105·360 + 45·x)/(360 + x) = 98.6.

Compute 105·360 = 37 800.

(37 800 + 45x)/(360 + x) = 98.6  
37 800 + 45x = 98.6(360 + x)

The first candidates are therefore 54, 56, 60, 66 and 70.

Step 2 –  check whether each abundant candidate is “semiperfect”, i.e. whether some subset of its proper divisors sums to the number.  
(If it is semiperfect it is not weird.)

• 54 Divisors: 1,2,3,6,9,18,27  
27+18+9 = 54 → semiperfect.

• 56 Divisors: 1,2,4,7,8,14,28

Let the lawn be a square of side s metres.  Its total area is therefore  

 A_total = s² square metres.

Step 2 – Write the area Junior actually mows  
Junior cuts a 2-metre-wide strip right round the outside edge.  What is left un-mown is a smaller square whose side is shorter by 2 m on each of the four sides, i.e. shorter by 4 m in total.  
So the inner square has side

Step 3 – Translate “half the lawn” into an equation  
By the statement of the problem, that border is exactly one-half of the whole lawn, so

Step 4 – Solve the equation

Expand the difference of squares:

s² – (s² – 8s + 16) = ½ s²  
8s – 16 = ½ s².

Multiply by 2 to clear the fraction:

16s – 32 = s²  
Rearrange to a standard quadratic:

s² – 16s + 32 = 0.

Use the quadratic formula:

s = [16 ± √(16² – 4·1·32)] / 2

Step 5 – Discard the impossible root  
The lawn must be wider than the 4 metres of border (2 m each side), so s must exceed 4 m.

Step 1.  How many new pieces can the (j + 1)-st cut create?

Assume that after j cuts

• no two cuts are parallel,  
• no three cuts meet at the same interior point of the pizza.

Under this arrangement every pair of old cuts meets once inside the pizza, so there are
C(j,2)=j(j–1)/2 intersection points, all in the interior.

Draw the (j + 1)-st cut so that it is not parallel to any previous cut and does not pass through any existing intersection point.  
That new cut meets each of the j previous cuts exactly once, giving j distinct interior intersection points.  
Those j points slice the new cut into (j + 1) separate segments.

Each of those (j + 1) segments lies inside a single old piece and splits that piece into two.  
Hence the (j + 1)-st cut creates exactly (j + 1) new pieces.

Therefore
  P(j + 1) = P(j) + (j + 1).        (1)

Step 2.  Solve the recurrence.

Starting with P(0)=1 (an uncut pizza is one piece), repeatedly apply (1):

P(1)=P(0)+1 =1+1  
P(2)=P(1)+2 =(1+1)+2  
P(3)=P(2)+3 =(1+1+2)+3

The following are not zingers:
2, 8, 59, 13, 68, and 36.
What is a zinger?
 Hint: Think multiplication.",Think multiplication.,"A zinger in this context is a number that is multiplied by eight and increased by one. For example, 8 x 2 = 16 and 16 + 1= 17.  Therefore 17 is a zinger.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let n be any whole number.  
Divide n by 8 and look at the remainder.

• 9  ÷ 8 = 1 remainder  
• 57 ÷ 8 = 7 remainder 1 (8×7 = 56)  
• 41 ÷ 8 = 5 remainder 1 (8×5 = 40)  
• 89 ÷ 8 = 11 remainder 1 (8×11 = 88)  
• 33 ÷ 8 = 4 remainder 1 (8×4 = 32)  
• 17 ÷ 8 = 2 remainder 1 (8×2 = 16)

Every “zinger” leaves remainder 1 when divided by 8; in other words, each can be written as 8k + 1 for some integer k.

Now check the “non-zingers”:

• 2  ÷ 8 → remainder 2  
• 8  ÷ 8 → remainder 0  
• 59 ÷ 8 → remainder 3  
• 13 ÷ 8 → remainder 5  
• 68 ÷ 8 → remainder 4  
• 36 ÷ 8 → remainder 4  

None of these leave remainder 1, so they are not zingers.

Why the hint “Think multiplication”?  
8 is 2 × 2 × 2, the basic multiplication block in our base-2 / base-8 system; being “one more than a multiple of 8” is the key.

Hint #2: There are many ways to solve this, but a simple method is to imagine one triangle inside another.","30/11. As mentioned in the hint, there are many methods in which to solve this. One less complex method is to imagine the axis of the cone form a right triangle. This triangle shares the dimensions of the cone, so it is 12 by 5. We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.
Next we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x. If we add 10x on both sides, we get 22x=60, and dividing 22 from both sides yields x=60/22=30/11.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We translate the three–dimensional picture into a two–dimensional one.

1.  Slice the cone and the cylinder with a plane through their common axis.  
    •  The cone becomes an isosceles triangle with altitude 12 and base 10 (because the cone’s base radius is 5).  
    •  The cylinder becomes a rectangle whose bottom edge lies on the base of the triangle, and whose two top vertices touch the two equal sides of the triangle.

2.  Put variables on the rectangle.  
    Let r be the cylinder’s radius.  
    Then its diameter is 2r and the problem states “diameter = height”, so the rectangle’s height is also 2r.

3.  Locate the rectangle’s top edge inside the triangle.  
    At a height y above the base of the cone, the half-width (i.e. the “radius” of the triangular cross-section) shrinks linearly from 5 (at y = 0) to 0 (at y = 12).  
    Hence  
            radius of cone at height y = 5(1 – y/12).

    The rectangle’s top edge is at y = 2r, and its half-width must equal the cylinder’s radius r:  
            r = 5(1 – (2r)/12).

4.  Solve for r.
        r = 5(1 – r/6)
        r = 5 – (5r)/6
        r + (5r)/6 = 5
        (11r)/6 = 5
        r = 5·6/11 = 30/11.

Therefore the cylinder’s radius is 30/11 units.

  abcd  = 1000 a + 100 b + 10 c + d .

The “unusual property” says

  (ab) + (cd) = (bc),

where ab, bc, cd are the two-digit numbers 10 a+b, 10 b+c, 10 c+d.

1.  Translate the condition  

  (10a+b)+(10c+d)=10b+c  
  ⇒ 10a+b+10c+d−10b−c=0  
  ⇒ 10a−9b+9c+d=0  
  ⇒ 10a+d = 9(b−c).               (1)

2.  Divisibility by 9  
   Equation (1) shows that 10a+d is a multiple of 9.  
   Since 10≡1 (mod 9), 10a+d≡a+d (mod 9); hence

  a+d≡0 (mod 9).

   With digits 0–9 this gives only

  a+d = 9   (or 18, which would force a=9, d=9, impossible because b−c would then have to exceed 9).

   Therefore                                    d = 9 − a.                            (2)

3.  Find b−c  
   Substitute (2) into 10a+d of (1):

  10a+d = 10a+(9−a)=9a+9 = 9(a+1).

   Then (1) becomes 9(b−c)=9(a+1), so

  b − c = a + 1.                               (3)

   (This is the reason, hinted in the problem, that the hundreds digit b must not only be at least the sum a+c, but in fact exceeds c by a+1.)

4.  Enumerate possible years  
   We now have, for any thousands digit a (1≤a≤8):

  d = 9 − a,             b − c = a + 1.

   To get the next year after 1978 we list the possibilities in increasing order of a.

   a = 1:  d = 8,  b − c = 2  
             Years: 1 2 0 8, 1 3 1 8, … , 1 9 7 8.  
             The last of these is 1978 itself; no larger year with a=1 works.

   a = 2:  d = 7,  b − c = 3  
             Smallest b that allows non-negative c is b = 3 (then c = 0).  
             This gives the year 2 3 0 7, i.e. 2307.

   Any year with a≥3 is at least 3000, so 2307 is the very next one.

2. BC divisible by 3.  
3. CD divisible by 4  →  D must be even.  
4. DE divisible by 5  →  E must be 5 (only available digit ending a 2-digit number in 5).  
5. EF divisible by 6  →  F even and EF divisible by 3.  
6. FG divisible by 7.  
7. GH divisible by 8  →  H even.  
8. HI divisible by 9.

Thus B, D, F, H are the four even digits {2,4,6,8} and E = 5.

Step 1 – determine F  
EF = 5F must be divisible by 6.  
Divisibility by 2 ⇒ F even; divisibility by 3 ⇒ 50+F ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ F ≡ 1 (mod 3).  
Among {2,4,6,8} only 4 satisfies F ≡ 1 (mod 3), so F = 4.

FG must be divisible by 7 and begins with 4.  
The multiples 42, 49, 56, … show only 49 is possible, giving G = 9.

GH = 9H must be divisible by 8 with H even (from {2,6,8}).  
92 ÷8 = 11.5, 96 ÷8 = 12, 98 ÷8 = 12.25 → only 96 works, hence H = 6.

   S is a single non–zero digit.  
   LIAR × S = RAIL, another 4–digit number (digits R-A-I-L).

2.  Column-wise multiplication equations  

   Let the carries from the units, tens and hundreds columns be c₁, c₂ and c₃.

   Units :  R·S  = 10c₁ + L  (1)  
   Tens  :  A·S + c₁ = 10c₂ + I  (2)

   Thous.:  L·S + c₃ = R        (4)

3.  Using the hint S·L < 10  
   From (4) we immediately get c₃ = 0 and
       R = L·S  with  L·S < 10.                     (4′)

4.  Possible (L,S,R) triples

   L·S < 10, L ≠ S, S > 1, digits different ⇒

   (L,S) = (2,3) → R = 6   (fails (1) because 6·3 = 18 ends in 8, not 2)  
   (L,S) = (2,4) → R = 8   (still possible)  
   (L,S) = (3,2) → R = 6   (fails (1) because 6·2 = 12 ends in 2, not 3)  
   (L,S) = (4,2) → R = 8   (fails (1) because 8·2 = 16 ends in 6, not 4)

   The only surviving set is

        L = 2 ,  S = 4 ,  R = 8.

5.  Determine the carries and the remaining digits

   From (1):  R·S = 8·4 = 32 ⇒ L = 2 (already OK) and carry c₁ = 3.

   Equation (2):  A·4 + 3 = 10c₂ + I.          (2′)

   Equation (3):  I·4 + c₂ = A       (< 10 because c₃ = 0).  (3′)

   Since A = 4I + c₂ < 10, I can only be 0,1 or 2; 2 is forbidden (L=2).  
   Try I = 0 → A = c₂, impossible (A and I identical).  
   Try I = 1 → A = 4 + c₂.

   Plug into (2′):

        4A + 3 = 4(4 + c₂) + 3 = 16 + 4c₂ + 3 = 19 + 4c₂  
        ⇒ c₂ = ⌊(19 + 4c₂)/10⌋.

   Testing c₂ = 0,1,2,3:

        c₂ = 0 → RHS = 1  (no)  
        c₂ = 1 → RHS = 2  (no)

126,"Question: The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
In a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).  How many different ways can a 13-card alternating-colour straight be formed from a Snapoker deck?  Note that jokers can not be used in forming a straight.
 Hint: Simply find the number of cards of each type of card in the alternating-colors straight",Simply find the number of cards of each type of card in the alternating-colors straight,"There are 32,768 possible ways a 13-card alternating-colour straight can be formed in a Snapoker deck.

(then we will double the quantities, because two decks are used).

• Hearts: all odds are kept → A, 3, 5, 7, 9, J(11), K(13)  
• Diamonds: all primes (incl. A) are removed → keep 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, Q(12)  
• Spades: all odds are removed → keep 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, Q(12)  
• Clubs: all non-primes (and the ace) are removed → keep 2, 3, 5, 7, J(11), K(13)

12        black         ♠ only  
13        red           ♥ only

Step 3 – How many physical cards of each admissible suit exist?  
There are two complete reduced decks, so every admissible suit/rank that remains
has 2 physical copies.

• Where there is only one admissible suit → 2 choices (deck 1 or deck 2).  
• Where two admissible suits exist → 2 + 2 = 4 choices.

Counting:

Single-suit ranks: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13  → 11 ranks, each 2 ways → 2¹¹  
Two-suit ranks:    2, 9                   →  2 ranks, each 4 ways → 4²

Total number of different 13-card alternating-colour straights

 Hint: Try to group some numbers together that yield a ratio of 1/2",Try to group some numbers together that yield a ratio of 1/2,Try to group some numbers together that yield a ratio of 1/2 One solution:  12345/24690=1/2,GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We have to use each of the ten symbols  
0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 9 exactly once, writing some of them (in order) as the numerator and the remaining ones as the denominator of one single fraction which must equal ½.  
So, if the numerator is N and the denominator is D, then D = 2N.

Because we have ten digits in total, it is natural to let N and D be 5-digit numbers; then D = 2N will also be a 5-digit number (N must lie between 10 000 and 49 999).

Step 1.  Decide on the last digit.  
•  D must be even, so its last digit can only be 0, 2, 4 or 6 (8 is not in the list).  
•  If N ends with  
 1 ⇒ D ends with 2  (2 is available)  
 2 ⇒ D ends with 4  (4 available)  
 3 ⇒ D ends with 6  (6 available)  
 5 ⇒ D ends with 0  (0 available)  
 6 ⇒ D ends with 2  (2 available)  
The choice “5 → 0’’ is attractive because it uses the lone 0, so let the numerator end in 5 and the denominator end in 0.

Step 2.  Work one place to the left.  
Doubling …5 gives …10, so the tens digit of D is 2×(tens digit of N)+1 (because of the carry 1 from the 5×2=10).  
We would like that tens digit of D to be one of our permitted digits (not 7 or 8, which we do not possess).  
Trying the possible digits 0–9 for the tens digit of N gives

   tens digit of N → tens digit of D (=2·digit+1)  
   0→1, 1→3, 2→5, 3→7, 4→9, 5→1, 6→3, …  

The result 9 is usable and simultaneously consumes one of our two 4’s (we have 4 twice).  
Therefore put “4’’ in the tens place of N.  
Now the two right-hand columns are

       N  …45  
       D  …90  

and the carry into the hundreds column is now 0.

Digits already used: 5,4 in N and 9,0 in D.

Step 3.  Choose the hundreds digit of N (call it C).  
It is doubled with NO carry coming in.  The result digit 2C must again avoid 7 or 8.  
Among the remaining digits {1,2,2,3,4,6} we may pick 6 (because 2×6 = 12, producing the digit 2 and sending a carry 1 into the next column).  
So put 6 into the hundreds place of N; the hundreds digit of D becomes 2 and we now have a carry 1 going into the thousands column.

Digits used so far  
N : …645  D : …290  

Step 4.  Choose the thousands digit of N (call it B) knowing there is a carry-in of 1.  
So we must have digit (2B+1) in D that is allowed.  
With the yet unused digits {1,2,3} we test:  

B=1 → 2·1+1 = 3 (allowed)  
B=2 → 5 (allowed)  
B=3 → 7 (not allowed)  

Let us take B = 1 for simplicity.  
That makes the thousands digit of D equal to 3 and leaves no carry going further left (since 3 < 10).

Step 5.  Choose the ten-thousands digit of N (call it A).  
There is now no incoming carry, so the digit in D will be 2A.  
The unused digits are {2,3,4}.  (Note that 4 cannot be used in N here, because 2×4=8 which is forbidden.)  
Taking A = 2 works nicely, giving the final leftmost digit of D = 4.

We have now determined both numbers completely:

   N = 2 1 6 4 5  = 21645  
   D = 4 3 2 9 0  = 43290  

Step 6.  Check that every required digit (with the right multiplicities) is used once:  
Numerator 21645 contains 1,2,4,5,6.  
Denominator 43290 contains 0,2,3,4,9.  
Put together we have exactly 0,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,9.

Step 7.  Verify the ratio: 2 × 21645 = 43290, so 21645 / 43290 = ½.

Hence the desired arrangement is

21645 / 43290 = 1/2.

R = 10 km (the radius of the planet)

1.  Translate the walked lengths into central angles  
   A great-circle distance s on a sphere equals an angle θ at the centre given by θ = s / R.

   First leg:  
   s₁ = 17.345 km ⇒ a = s₁ / R = 17.345 / 10 = 1.7345 rad ≃ 99.41°

   Second leg:  
   s₂ = 47.124 km ⇒ b = s₂ / R = 47.124 / 10 = 4.7124 rad

   Notice from the hint that 4.7124 rad ≃ 3π/2 rad (270°).  
   Indeed 3π/2·10 km = 15π km = 47.1239 km, so the given number is 3π/2 to four decimals.

2.  Interpret the “left turn”  
   Walking straight on a sphere means following a great circle.  
   Turning left and continuing “straight” therefore means switching to another great circle that meets the first one at a right angle.  
   Thus the journey forms a right–angled spherical triangle whose sides (measured by central angles) are

3.  Use the spherical Pythagoras (law of cosines for a right angle)  
   For a spherical triangle with right angle C we have

1.  On an analog clock we can measure an angle (0°–359°) starting from 12 o’clock and increasing clockwise.

2.  At any given time let  
    H = position of the hour hand (in degrees)  
    M = position of the minute hand (in degrees)

       H = 30° × (hour + minutes/60)  
       M = 6° × minutes

3.  The artist’s “painting number” equals the clockwise angle you must sweep from the hour hand to reach the minute hand:

       painting number = (M – H + 360) mod 360.

   Checking the three given examples:

   • 11:00 H = 330°, M = 0° ⇒ (0 – 330 + 360) = 30° → Number 30

Lengths
Initially the band is 3 in long.  
After each full minute it is pulled a further 3 in.  
So after n full minutes (i.e. just before the (n+1)-st stretch)

        L_n = 3(n+1)  inches.                                     …(1)

Where is the spider?
Let p_n be the fraction of the band the spider has covered just after the n-th stretch
(equivalently, at the very beginning of the (n+1)-st minute).  
Because the band is stretched uniformly, stretching does not change this fraction.

During the next minute the spider walks 1 in along the band, so its fraction increases by

        1 / L_n   (because 1 inch is 1/L_n of the whole length).

Hence

        p_{n+1} = p_n + 1/L_n.                                    …(2)

With p_0 = 0 and (1) this gives

where H_n = 1 + ½ + … + 1/n is the n-th harmonic number.

We need the least n with

133,"Question: A postman delivered letters every day. On the first day he delivered one letter, on the second day he delivered three letters, on the third day he delivered five letters, and so on. Each day from the second on he delivered two letters more than the preceding day.
The day he retired, he noticed that he had delivered a total of more than 100,000 letters.
Something fun is that the total number of letters he had delivered has its digits arranged in ascending order.
How many days had he worked, and how many letters had he delivered in total?
 Hint: The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.",The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.,"It's easy to see that the number of letters he had delivered is the square of the number of days he had worked.
Square numbers can't end in 7 or 8, and 123456 is not a square because it is divisible by 3 but not by 9. Hence the number of letters must end with 9.
Since odd squares have remainder 1 upon division by 8, the number formed by its fourth and fifth digits must be divisible by 4, which can be 48, 56 or 68.
Numbers that have remainder 2 upon division by 3, and those that are divisible by 3 but not by 9 are not squares. By trial and error, we know that the only square number satisfying these conditions is 134689=367^2.
Hence, he had worked for 367 days, and had delivered 134689 letters.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the number of days he worked be n.

Letters delivered on day k : 2k−1  
Total letters after n days : 1+3+5+⋯+(2n−1)=n².

So we need

1) n² > 100 000,  
2) the six decimal digits of n² are in strictly ascending order,  
3) the decimal digits of n are also in strictly ascending order (hint).

Step 1.  n² > 100 000  ⇒  n ≥ 317 (because 316² = 99 856).

Step 2.  n² has six digits (since n ≤ 999) and they must be strictly increasing.  
The largest 6-digit number with strictly increasing digits is 456 789, so  
n² ∈ [100 000 , 456 789]  ⇒  n ≤ ⌊√456 789⌋ = 675.

Thus 317 ≤ n ≤ 675.

Step 3.  List all 3-digit numbers whose digits are strictly increasing and lie between 317 and 675:

345 346 347 348 349  
356 357 358 359  
367 368 369  
378 379 389  
456 457 458 459  
467 468 469  
478 479 489  
567 568 569  
578 579 589.

Step 4.  Square each of them and check whether the six digits of the square are strictly increasing:

345² = 119 025          356² = 126 736          456² = 207 936  
346² = 119 716          357² = 127 449          457² = 208 849  
347² = 120 409          358² = 128 164          458² = 209 764  
348² = 121 104          359² = 128 881          459² = 210 681  
349² = 121 801          367² = 134 689  ← digits 1 3 4 6 8 9 strictly increase  
... (all remaining squares fail the test)

Only n = 367 meets the requirement; its square is

367² = 134 689  (digits 1 < 3 < 4 < 6 < 8 < 9).

Therefore:

Days worked : n = 367 (digits 3 < 6 < 7, strictly increasing)  
Total letters : n² = 134 689 (digits 1 < 3 < 4 < 6 < 8 < 9, strictly increasing).

Both conditions in the problem (and the hint) are satisfied.

134,"Question: Bill, Bob, Frank, and Jim, who all drive cabs, work a particularly busy street that runs east and west. The street has no traffic lights. Oddly enough, an equal number of pedestrians walk in each direction at four kilometres per hour. The four cab drivers were discussing the best way to pick up a fare. Bill said he was going to sit beside the curb and wait until a fare came along. Bob said he was going to cruise west at four kilometres an hour; therefore, he would have twice the chance of picking up a fare as Bill. Frank said he was going to cruise east at eight kilometres an hour and his chances were twice as good as either Bill's or Bob's. Jim claimed that they were all wrong.

Bob, who was driving west at four kph, wouldn't pass anyone walking west, but would pass 200 people walking east. This would put him no further ahead than Bill. Frank, who was driving east and 300 people going west. Jim, who was going west at 12kph, would pass 200 people going west and 400 people going east.

rate  

 R(V) = n·|V–v|  (from those walking east)  
    + n·|V+v|  (from those walking west).

(The first term is the relative speed between the cab and the east-bound walkers (+v);
the second is the relative speed to the west-bound walkers (–v).  
The density n appears in both terms because the numbers walking east and west are equal.)

Compute R(V) for the four drivers.

1. Bill – standing still (V = 0)

 R(0) = n·|0–4| + n·|0+4| = n·4 + n·4 = 8n.

   Bill does not compare his chance with anyone else; there is no numerical claim

2. Bob – driving west at 4 km h⁻¹ (V = –4)

 R(–4) = n·|–4–4| + n·|–4+4| = n·8 + n·0 = 8n.

   His rate is exactly the same as Bill’s, not twice as large.  
   Bob’s claim (“twice the chance of Bill”) is wrong.

3. Frank – driving east at 8 km h⁻¹ (V = +8)

 R(+8) = n·|8–4| + n·|8+4| = n·4 + n·12 = 16n.

   Jim’s rate is 24n, only 1½ times Frank’s 16n, not twice.  
   Jim’s claim is wrong.

Conclusion  
• Frank’s statement about his advantage is the only correct numerical claim.  
• Bob’s and Jim’s numerical claims are wrong.

Step 1.  C must be 1, 3, 7 or 9, because every prime >10 ends in 1, 3, 7, 9.  
Rule 4 forbids 9, so C ∈ {1,3,7}.

Step 2.  BC is a 2-digit prime.  Therefore its final digit C is again 1, 3 or 7, fitting Step 1 automatically.

Step 3.  AB is a 2-digit prime.  Hence its final digit B must also be 1, 3 or 7 (a 2-digit prime never ends in an even digit or 5).

136,"Question: Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?
Comments to triflers:
The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!
 Hint: There are hints in the comments to triflers and in the title.",There are hints in the comments to triflers and in the title.,"80
To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion. This takes 9 trips of 2 5/18 miles (5 advancing trips interspersed with 4 return trips) for a total of 20.5 miles traveled (9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5) and 20.5 bottles of soda used. Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases. With one less case to move, Bu will now make 2 fewer trips. The 3.5 bottles set aside are used to move the four cases the next 1/2 mile toward the Wirth Pavilion.   After this, the Wirth Pavilion is just 2 2/9 miles away ( 5 - 2 5/18 - 9/18 = 2 4/18 ). Next, he travels 15 5/9 miles (7 * 2 2/9) using 15 5/9 bottles of soda to complete his trip.

Important facts

• A case holds 24 unopened bottles.  
• The MoJoPed can have at most 25 bottles on board at any moment: 24 in the carrier (cargo) and 1 in the fuel tank.  
• One mile of riding (in either direction) empties the tank – one bottle is opened and lost.  
• While shuttling between two points that are one mile apart we may make as many depots (stashes) of unopened bottles as we like; bottles can safely be left anywhere.

1.  How much fuel is lost in moving a heap one mile?  

Suppose N unopened bottles have to be taken from point A to point B, one mile away.

Capacity for unopened bottles on any forward trip = 24.  
Number of forward trips needed = ⌈N / 24⌉ = T.  

On the first T – 1 forward trips we must ride back empty to fetch the rest, so there are T – 1 return trips.  
Fuel used = 1 bottle per forward trip + 1 per return trip  
     = T + (T – 1) = 2T – 1 bottles.

Therefore, to push N bottles one mile farther we necessarily lose  
   Δ(N) = 2 ⌈N/24⌉ – 1 unopened bottles.

This number is the minimum possible; any strategy that reaches it is optimal for that mile.

2.  Marching the five cases forward, mile by mile

Start: 120 unopened bottles at Mile 0.

Mile 0 → Mile 1  
 N = 120 ⇒ T = ⌈120/24⌉ = 5  
 Fuel lost = 2·5 – 1 = 9  
 Bottles now at Mile 1 = 120 – 9 = 111

Mile 1 → Mile 2  
 N = 111 ⇒ T = 5  
 Fuel lost = 9  
 Bottles now at Mile 2 = 111 – 9 = 102

Mile 2 → Mile 3  
 N = 102 ⇒ T = 5  
 Fuel lost = 9  
 Bottles now at Mile 3 = 102 – 9 = 93

Mile 3 → Mile 4  
 N = 93 ⇒ T = ⌈93/24⌉ = 4  
 Fuel lost = 2·4 – 1 = 7  
 Bottles now at Mile 4 = 93 – 7 = 86

Mile 4 → Mile 5 (the Wirth Pavilion)  
 N = 86 ⇒ T = 4  
 Fuel lost = 7  
 Bottles arriving unopened = 86 – 7 = 79

3.  A concrete schedule that attains that number  

On each 1-mile stage:

• Make T–1 shuttling round trips, each time leaving 23 unopened bottles at the far end and bringing back one unopened bottle for the return fuel.  
• On the last forward trip carry 24 unopened bottles, use one for the mile, deposit the remaining 23, and do not return.  

Carrying out that routine for the five successive miles uses exactly the fuel computed above and delivers 79 unopened bottles to the Wirth Pavilion.

4.  Why 79 is the maximum possible  

For every mile any strategy must lose at least Δ(N) bottles, where N is the number present at the start of that mile, because every bottle of fuel must have been part of the original stock and the capacity restriction makes the count of required trips unavoidable.  
Summing these unavoidable losses over the five miles – 9 + 9 + 9 + 7 + 7 = 41 – shows that at least 41 bottles must be opened on the road, so no more than 120 – 41 = 79 unopened bottles can reach the destination.

Since the schedule above actually delivers 79 bottles, it is optimal.

137,"Question: Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.  Henry's plan calls for the tracks (each of which is one mile in length) to be laid end-to-end with no gap between them, pinned to the ground at every other juncture, as shown below:
v_______ _______vv_______ _______v
Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""
Henry replies, ""The expansion will only be an inch over the whole mile length.  If the tracks buckle, it will only be by an inch or two at most.  The trains will certainly have no trouble bumping over these buckles.""
Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?
 Hint: Would Pythagoras have the same plan?",Would Pythagoras have the same plan?,"The rise in the middle of the tracks would have been much greater than Henry surmised.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse). SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning

1. How the track is fastened  
   The pattern    v_______ _______vv_______ _______v  
   means that a spike (v) is driven into the ground at every second joint.  
   Thus the rail is fixed to the ground at points 0 mi, 2 mi, 4 mi, …  
   Between two consecutive spikes there are two one-mile pieces of rail whose
   free ends meet at an un-spiked joint in the middle.

2. How much extra length has to be absorbed  
   Each mile-long piece becomes 1 inch (=1/12 ft) longer when the temperature
   rises.  
   Two such pieces therefore gain 2 in = 2/12 ft = 1/6 ft of extra length
   between the spikes that are 2 mi (=10560 ft) apart.

3. The simplest buckle  
   Because the middle joint is not held down, the two rigid mile-long rails
   will rise there and form an isosceles triangle:

             h
          /\ ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
         /  \
        /    \
     1 mi+1″  1 mi+1″
     /        \
    v__________v
        1 mile        1 mile      (spikes at the v’s)

   Each side of the triangle has length  
        s = 1 mile + 1 inch = 5280 ft + 1/12 ft = 5280.083 333 ft.  
   The horizontal projection of each side is exactly 1 mile = 5280 ft.

4. Use Pythagoras to find the height h

        s² = (1 mile)² + h²
   ⇒   h² = s² – (5280 ft)²
          = (5280.083 333)² – 5280²
          = (s−5280)(s+5280)
          = (1/12 ft)(5280+5280.083 333)
          ≈ (0.083 333 ft)(10560.083 333 ft)
          ≈ 880 ft²
   ⇒   h ≈ √880 ft ≈ 29.7 ft.

5. Interpretation  
   To swallow only 2 inches of extra length, the track between two spikes
   would have to rear up almost thirty feet!  A locomotive meeting a
   thirty-foot jump would certainly not “bump over it.”

Hence Henry’s boss instantly recognised that Henry’s “inch-or-two” estimate
was absurd; the geometry (Pythagoras) shows that the buckle would be tens of
feet high, making the plan disastrously unsafe.

Final answer: The 2-inch expansion forces the track to rise about 30 feet between spikes, not 1 or 2 inches, so Henry’s plan would derail the trains—hence the boss’s scorn.",True,1,0

The total area is 144 square feet. Allowing 6 extra tiles for breakage brings the order to 150 tiles.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step-1.  Fix a convenient coordinate system  
•  Put A at (0,0) and let AB lie along the positive x–axis, so B = (16,0).  
•  “AF ⟂ AB” and “AF = 6 ft”, so F = (0,6).  
•  “BC ∥ AF and BC = 6 ft”, hence C = (16,6).  
•  FC is horizontal (∥ AB).

Step-2.  Locate the points G and H on FC  
FC is 16 ft long.  “FG = 4 ft” gives G = (4,6);  
“HC = 4 ft” gives H = (12,6).

Step-3.  Locate E  
EG is perpendicular to FG (vertical) and |EG| = 4 ft, so E is either (4,10) or (4,2).  
Angle AFE is 135°.  Using the vector FA = (0,–6) and FE = (4, yE–6),

        cos∠AFE = (FA·FE)/(|FA||FE|) = –√2 /2.

Solving yields yE – 6 = ±4, i.e. yE = 10 or 2.  
Taking yE = 10 (E above FC) makes ∠AFE interior to the patio, so E = (4,10).

Step-4.  Locate D  
ED is horizontal (∥ AB) and 8 ft long, so D is either (–4,10) or (12,10).  
Angle BCD must be 135°.  With C = (16,6):

    If D = (12,10)   ⇒   CD = (–4,4).  
        ∠BCD between CB = (0,–6) and CD is 135°  (checks).  

    If D = (–4,10)   ⇒   CD = (–20,4) giving ∠BCD ≠ 135°.

Hence D = (12,10).

Step-5.  Check DH  
H = (12,6); DH is vertical and |DH| = 4 ft, exactly as required.

Thus the vertices of the hexagon, in order, are

A(0,0)  →  B(16,0)  →  C(16,6)  →  D(12,10)  →  E(4,10)  →  F(0,6)  →  back to A.

Step-6.  Area of the hexagon (shoelace formula)

x:   0   16   16   12    4    0  
y:   0    0    6   10   10    6

Σ(x_i y_{i+1}) = 0 + 96 + 160 + 120 + 24 + 0 = 400  
Σ(y_i x_{i+1}) = 0 + 0   + 72  + 40  + 0  + 0 = 112  

Area = ½|400 – 112| = ½·288 = 144 square feet.

Step-7.  Number of tiles to buy  
Each tile covers 1 ft², so the ideal number is 144.

EDCBA  −  ABCDE  =  33957.                         (1)

Work the subtraction column by column, keeping track of borrows.

1. Units column  
   E − A ≡ 7 (mod 10).  
   If E ≥ A there is no borrow; if E < A we borrow 1 from the tens column:  
   E + 10 − A = 7  ⇒  A = E + 3 and there is a borrow k₁ = 1.

   The other possibility (no borrow) would give E = A + 7, but that will
   contradict later columns (see below).  
   Therefore we must have

   k₁ = 1, A = E + 3.                           (2)

2. Tens column (remember the previous borrow k₁ = 1)  
   D − 1 − B ≡ 5 (mod 10).  
   Because 1 had to be borrowed from the hundreds column, we must have

   D − 1 + 10 − B = 5  ⇒  B = D + 4, and the borrow into tens
   from hundreds is k₂ = 1.                    (3)

3. Hundreds column (k₂ = 1 already subtracted from C)  
   C − 1 − C = −1, whose digit is 9 and creates a new borrow k₃ = 1.  
   This exactly produces the required 9, so this column imposes no
   restriction on C; any digit 0–9 works.      (4)

4. Thousands column (the borrow that just occurred did NOT reach this column,
   so k₃ = 0 here)  
   B − 0 − D must give 3.  With (3) it becomes D + 4 − D = 4, but we need
   3.  That shows a borrow actually did happen in (3); hence

   B − 1 − D = 3  ⇒  B = D + 4  (again) and no additional borrow
   is created.  Consistency forces k₁ = 1, ruling out E = A + 7.
   Thus everything is self-consistent.         (5)

5. Ten-thousands column  
   A − 0 − E must give 3.  Using (2) we have A − E = 3, which is exactly
   the required digit, so this column is satisfied automatically. (6)

All constraints are now:

A = E + 3, E = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 (so 7 possibilities);
B = D + 4, D = 0,1,2,3,4,5 (so 6 possibilities);

Finding relative speeds between Mouse(A) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X = S(A) * 60, where S(A) is biting speed for Mouse(A) and X is Rope(A) length
X = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X is Rope(A) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(A)/S(C) = 3:1, which means that for each 3 units Mouse(A) will move, Mouse (C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(A) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(A) bites off three times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides Rope(A) length in to 4 units.

If Mouse(A) needs  60 minutes to bite off X, How many minutes are needed to bite off 3/4 X?
Minutes needed = 3/4 * 60 = 45 minutes are needed to fully bite off Rope(A) by Mouse(A) and Mouse(C).

• Mouse B : rB = 1/90 (= L / 90 min)  
• Mouse C : rC = 1/180 (= L / 180 min)

Plan: create a first event that we know happens after 45 min, and then use the remaining half of the second rope so that it is finished exactly 30 min later. 45 min + 30 min = 75 min.

Step-by-step procedure

1.  Start of the experiment (time 0).

   Rope 1 – place Mouse A at one end and Mouse C at the other end.  
   Their combined speed is rA + rC = 1/60 + 1/180 = 1/45 rope per minute.  
   Therefore rope 1 will be completely eaten after  
          t1 = 1 / (1/45)  = 45 minutes.

   Rope 2 – simultaneously put Mouse B to bite from one end, alone.  
   His speed is rB = 1/90 rope per minute.

2.  The first detectable event.

   After exactly 45 minutes the two mice on rope 1 meet – rope 1 disappears.  
   This is our precise 45-minute mark, which we can observe.

   During those same 45 minutes Mouse B has eaten

          (45 min) · (1/90 rope/min)  = ½ · rope,

   i.e. exactly one half of rope 2.  The remaining half–rope (length L/2) is still
   attached to the far end of rope 2, untouched.

3.  Second phase (to last 30 minutes).

   Immediately at the 45-minute mark:

   – remove Mouse B from rope 2;  
   – place Mouse A (now free) at the point where Mouse B stopped
     and let A finish the remaining half-rope by himself.

   Only Mouse A now works on rope 2.  His speed is 1/60 rope per minute, so the
   time he needs to eat the remaining L/2 is

          t2 = (L/2) / (L/60) = 60 / 2 = 30 minutes.

4.  End of the experiment.

   Those 30 minutes added to the previous 45 minutes give

          45 min + 30 min = 75 minutes.

   When Mouse A finishes the second rope we know exactly 75 minutes have elapsed.

Hence we have obtained a reliable 75-minute interval using only the two identical ropes and the three mice with their given biting speeds.

Final answer: Start A and C on opposite ends of rope 1 and B on one end of rope 2.  Rope 1 is eaten in 45 min; at that instant remove B and put A on the remaining half of rope 2.  A needs another 30 min to finish it, so when rope 2 disappears exactly 75 minutes have passed.",True,1,0

2.  Each package has 225 gums, so N is a multiple of 225.  
  225 = 9 × 25.  Hence N must be divisible by 9 and by 25.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – Consequence of divisibility by 25  
A decimal number is divisible by 25 iff its last two digits are 00, 25, 50 or 75.  
Digits other than 0 or 1 are not allowed, so the only possible ending is 00.  

Therefore N ends in “00”.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – Consequence of divisibility by 9  
A number is divisible by 9 iff the sum of its decimal digits is a multiple of 9.  
Because the only non-zero digit we are allowed to use is 1,  
 sum of digits = (number of 1’s in N).  
Hence the number of 1’s in N must be 9, 18, 27, …  

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 – Seek the shortest (hence smallest) candidate  
To minimize N, first minimize the total number of digits.

• The last two digits are fixed as 00.  
• Let k be the number of digits in front of those two zeros.  
  Among those k digits the leading one cannot be 0, so at least one of them is 1.  
• The number of 1’s required is the smallest possible multiple of 9, namely 9.  
  Thus we must be able to place 9 ones among the first k digits.

Therefore k must be at least 9.  
(With k = 8 or less we could place at most 8 ones.)

So the total length of the number is k + 2 = 11 digits.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 – Construct the minimal 11-digit number

With exactly 11 digits and 9 ones, every one of the first 9 positions must be 1:

 (position list) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  
 (digit)     1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0

That yields N = 11111111100.

Any other arrangement of nine 1’s among the first nine places would produce
the same leading digit sequence (all 1’s), so no smaller 11-digit number exists,
and 10-digit numbers are impossible.  Hence 11111111100 is the smallest N.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5 – Verification  
• Ends in 00 ⇒ divisible by 25.  
• Contains 9 ones ⇒ digit sum = 9 ⇒ divisible by 9.  
Therefore N is divisible by 225.

Indeed, 11111111100 ÷ 225 = 49 382 716 (an integer).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion  
The least number of gums Rob could have eaten, satisfying all conditions, is

     N / D = 1/11      ⇔     11 N = D.

Observations

1. D = 11 N is automatically one digit longer than N, so N must be 4 digits and D 5 digits (4 + 5 = 9 total digits).
2. Multiplication by 11 preserves the final digit: 11 N ends in the same digit as N.  
   Therefore the last digit must appear twice in the digit pool. The only digits with two copies available are 1, 3 and 4, so the common last digit is one of these three.
3. No 0, 8, or 9 is available, so neither N nor D may contain these digits. Thus 11 N must produce only the digits in the multiset, none larger than 7 and no zeros.

Trying last digit 4

Let N end in 4.  We search the 4-digit range 910 – 9090 whose product with 11 is 5 digits.  A very small test quickly gives

     N = 1234  
     D = 11 × 1234 = 13 574.

 Hint: The number of trailing zeros is equivalent to the number of factors of 10",The number of trailing zeros is equivalent to the number of factors of 10,"The ! stands for factorial.  So, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!
The only way to get a trailing zero is by multiplying a factor of 1000! which is 2 by a factor of 1000! which is 5. The modified problem is thus: How many such pairs of factors are there?
There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5. But in addition there are 40 = 1000/25 numbers which are multiples of 25, each of which gives one factor of five in addition to the one counted in the 200 and the one counted in the 40 above. Finally there is 1 = [1000/625] number which is a multiple of 625, this gives one further factor of 5. Thus there are exactly  200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249 factors of 5 in 1000! and since there are more than sufficient factors of 2, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"To find the number of trailing zeros of 1000!, we must determine how many times 10 divides 1000!.

Hence the limiting factor is the number of 5’s appearing in the prime‐factorization of 1000!.

Step-by-step count of factors of 5 in 1000!:

1. Every multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5.  
   ⌊1000 / 5⌋ = 200

2. Every multiple of 25 (= 5²) contributes a second 5.

Since 7*14=98, there was only one cyclist that he never beat and that was the champion.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step–by–step reasoning

1.  What does “93rd in every stage” really mean?  
   •  In every one of the 14 stages Charles has exactly 92 riders in front of him and 7 riders behind him.  
   •  Therefore in any single stage he beats only 7 people.

2.  How many different riders can he beat during the whole tour?  
   •  There are 14 stages × 7 riders per stage = 98 “places” behind him.  
   •  If in stage 1 he finishes in front of riders A1,…,A7, in stage 2 in front of riders B1,…,B7, …, and in stage 14 in front of riders N1,…,N7, we can make the 98 names A1…N7 all different.  
   •  Then the only riders he never beats are himself and one other rider.  Call that other rider the Champion.

   Conclusion: With a clever distribution of the 7 “back–markers” in every stage it is possible for Charles to finish at least one stage ahead of every rider except the Champion.

3.  Arrange the times so that the one occasion on which Charles beats a rider costs that rider far more time than he ever gains back.  One convenient set of numbers is:

   For every stage  
       Champion            0 s  
       2nd place           +1 s  
       3rd place           +2 s  
       …  
       92nd place          +91 s  
       Charles (93rd)      +92 s            ← always very close to the winner  
       94th –100th place   +10 000 s        ← the seven who finish behind Charles

   (10 000 s ≈ 2 h 46 min – a deliberately huge loss.)

4.  Compare total times.

   •  Charles: 14 stages × 92 s = 1 288 s behind the Champion.

   •  Any other rider R (not the Champion):  
       – In exactly one stage R is one of the seven who finish behind Charles, so that day R loses 10 000 s − 92 s = 9 908 s to Charles.  
       – In the other 13 stages R finishes somewhere between the Champion and Charles, gaining at most 91 s per stage, i.e. at most 13 × 91 s = 1 183 s on Charles.

       Net advantage of Charles over R  
            ≥ 9 908 s − 1 183 s = 8 725 s  (about 2 h 25 min).

       Thus every one of the 98 riders is slower than Charles overall.

   •  The Champion beats Charles by 14 × 1 s = 14 s and wins the race.

5.  Result.

   After aggregation of times Charles is 2nd, even though he never placed higher than 93rd in any individual stage.  The trick is that each of the other 98 riders suffers one disastrously slow stage, while Charles is always only a few seconds slower than the stage winner.

Final answer:  Because only seven riders finished behind Charles in any one stage, he could be ahead of seven × 14 = 98 different riders at least once.  Give those 98 riders a single stage that is many minutes slower than Charles, while Charles is always only seconds behind the winner; their one huge loss outweighs the small gains they make in the other 13 stages.  Thus everyone except the Champion ends with a longer total time than “Crazy” Charles, making him the overall runner-up.",True,1,0
147,"Question: The Boldavian navy has a rigorous training program.  In order to graduate from the naval academy, cadets must enter a pool and fight sharks.  Today, a group of cadets was tested.

On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.

 Hint: Basically, the volume of the cuboid is double the volume of the cuboid with each dimension decreased by 2","Basically, the volume of the cuboid is double the volume of the cuboid with each dimension decreased by 2",Least is 960 (8 by 10 by 12),GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the (even) edge–lengths of the large cuboid be

After the cuboid is sawn up into 1 cm cubes

Those cubes that receive no paint are the cubes that lie wholly inside the solid;  
they form a smaller cuboid whose edges are two centimetres shorter:

 number unpainted  =  (a–2)(b–2)(c–2).

The problem states that the numbers of painted and unpainted cubes are equal, i.e.

 (a–2)(b–2)(c–2)  =  abc – (a–2)(b–2)(c–2).

Hence  

 2(a–2)(b–2)(c–2)  =  abc.  (1)

Because a, b, c are even, write a = 2x, b = 2y, c = 2z (x, y, z positive integers).  
Substituting in (1):

 2(2x–2)(2y–2)(2z–2) = (2x)(2y)(2z)  
 ⇒ 2·2·2 (x–1)(y–1)(z–1) = 8xyz  
 ⇒ 8(x–1)(y–1)(z–1) = 8xyz  
 ⇒  (x–1)(y–1)(z–1) = ½ xyz.  (2)

Divide both sides of (2) by (x–1)(y–1)(z–1):

 x/(x–1) · y/(y–1) · z/(z–1) = 2.  (3)

We now seek the smallest product xyz satisfying (3).

Case x = 2  
 2/(1) = 2; the other two factors exceed 1, so the product exceeds 2 – impossible.  
Thus x ≥ 3.

Case x = 3  
Using (2): 3yz = 4(y–1)(z–1) ⇒ z = 4(y–1)/(y–4).  
Integer solutions occur for (y, z) = (5, 16), (6, 10), (7, 8);  
the smallest xyz is 3·7·8 = 168.

Case x = 4  
Equation (2) gives (y–3)(z–3) = 6.  
Integer possibilities: (y, z) = (4, 9), (5, 6), (6, 5), (9, 4).  
The least product is xyz = 4·5·6 = 120.

Case x = 5  
(2) gives z = (8y – 8)/(3y – 8).  
The only integral possibilities are (y, z) = (4, 6) and (6, 4), again yielding xyz = 120.

For x ≥ 6 one finds xyz ≥ 120 as well.  
Therefore the minimum possible value of xyz is 120, attained (up to ordering) at

Returning to centimetres,

 a = 2x = 8  b = 2y = 10  c = 2z = 12.

exactly half of 960, as required.)

  N₁ = 10a + b (the first two–digit number)  
  N₂ = 10d + e (the last two–digit number).

The condition is

  N₁ · N₂  –  c  =  a number whose digits are all equal.       (1)

1.  Parity of that “all–equal” number  
 Both N₁ and N₂ are odd ⇒ N₁·N₂ is odd.  
 c is odd ⇒ N₁·N₂ – c is even.  
 Hence the repeated digit must be even (agreeing with the hint).

2.  Size of the “all–equal” number  
The biggest possible product is 97·95 = 9215, so only the repeated–digit even numbers ≤ 9215 can occur:

For P = 4444, 6666, 8888 every 4444 + c, 6666 + c, 8888 + c either is prime or factors only into numbers bigger than 99 or containing an even digit, so they cannot be expressed as a product of two distinct two-digit odd numbers formed from {1,3,5,7,9}. Hence there are no further solutions.

When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 90 days also.
For how long can the three animals graze on the field together?
 Hint: Rates problem--use the same algebraic techniques",Rates problem--use the same algebraic techniques,"The cow, the goat, and the goose eat grass with a constant speed (amount per day): v1 for the cow, v2 for the goat, v3 for the goose.
The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:
v1 = 3 x h/180,
v2 = 2 x h/180,
v3 = 1 x h/180,
k = 1 x h/180.
Then holds for the time t that the three animals can graze together: h-tx(v1+v2+v3-k) = 0, so t = h/(v1+v2+v3-k) = h/(3xh/180+2xh/180+1xh/180-1xh/180) = 36. The three animals can graze together for 36 days.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let

   (g + s – r)·90 = G₀                                     (4)

Step 1.  Express G₀/90 from (3):

c – r = G₀ / 90.                                           (5)

Step 2.  Use (1).  Divide by 45 and substitute (5):

c + g – r = G₀ / 45 = 2·(G₀/90) = 2(c – r)  
⇒ c + g – r = 2c – 2r  
⇒ –c + g + r = 0  
⇒ g = c – r.                                               (6)

Step 3.  Use (2).  Divide by 60 and substitute (5):

c + s – r = G₀ / 60 = 1.5·(G₀/90) = 1.5(c – r)  
⇒ c + s – r = 1.5c – 1.5r  
⇒ –0.5c + s + 0.5r = 0  
⇒ s = 0.5(c – r).                                          (7)

Step 4.  Use (4).  Divide by 90 and substitute (5), (6), (7):

g + s – r = G₀ / 90 = c – r  
(c – r) + 0.5(c – r) – r = c – r  
1.5(c – r) – r = c – r  
1.5c – 2.5r = c – r  
0.5c – 1.5r = 0  
c = 3r.                                                   (8)

Step 5.  Find all rates and G₀.

From (8):   c = 3r  
From (6):   g = c – r = 2r  
From (7):   s = 0.5(c – r) = r  
From (5):   G₀ = 90(c – r) = 90·2r = 180r.

So:  Cow eats 3r, Goat 2r, Goose r; grass grows at r.

Step 6.  All three animals together.

Total eating rate = c + g + s = 3r + 2r + r = 6r.  
Net depletion rate = (6r – r) = 5r.

1. Unit-digit condition  
Only the term b·c contributes to the units digit, so  
b·c ≡ 4 (mod 10).

With digits 1–9 (none may repeat and 2,4,5 are already in the product), the only feasible pairs are

The left–hand side must be 7000 or 8000 because d cannot be 1,2,3,4,5 (those digits are already used) and d must not duplicate b or c (6 or 9).  
Try d = 7:

390a + 3880 = 7000 ⇒ 390a = 3120 ⇒ a = 8.

Digits are now {1,8,6,3,9,7,2,5,4}, exactly 1–9 with no repetition.  
Thus A = 186, B = 39, P = 7254.

Case 2: b = 9, c = 6  

A = 100 + 10a + 9, B = 36.

Product:

(100 + 10a + 9)·30 = 3000 + 300a + 270

Set equal to P:

360a + 3924 = 1000d + 254

No integer a (0–9) makes the right side a multiple of 1000, so this case fails.

Goal
End with two boxes holding 6 cups each (6, 6, 0).  
If the medium box can be brought to exactly 6 cups, the large box will automatically contain the remaining 6 cups (because the total amount never changes).  
So the real task is to leave exactly 6 cups in the 8-cup box.

Working backward
Suppose the last move were to pour the 5-cup box into the 12-cup box, giving the desired (6, 6, 0).  
Just before that, the state must have been (1, 6, 5): 1 cup in L, 6 cups in M, 5 cups in S.  
How could we reach (1, 6, 5)?  
Notice that it can come from filling the medium box full (to 8) and then topping up the small box (which already held 3 cups) with 2 more cups from the medium box.  
Tracing that logic all the way back to the start produces the forward sequence below.

T = total length of the class (in minutes)  
t = the number of minutes that have already elapsed when the question is asked  
a = the instructor’s numerical reply  

We are told to “relate products of the time elapsed and the instructor’s answer.”  
Suppose the product t × a is not arbitrary but equals the number of minutes still to go, i.e.

t × a  =  T – t.          (1)

That is, “elapsed time × answer = time remaining.”

Check this relationship with the three pieces of data:

1) After 15 min the answer is 7  
   15 × 7 = 105.  
   If (1) is correct, the remaining time is 105 min, so  
   T = 15 + 105 = 120 min.

2) After 20 min the answer is 5  
   20 × 5 = 100,  
   and indeed 120 – 20 = 100.  The relation holds.

3) After 30 min the answer is 3  
   30 × 3 = 90,  
   and 120 – 30 = 90.  The relation again holds.

Because all three data points are consistent with (1), the pattern is confirmed.

Thus the total class length is T = 120 minutes (2 hours).  
At the moment of the third question (30 minutes into the class) the time still remaining is

T – t = 120 – 30 = 90 minutes.

So, when the pupil “clicked” he realized there were exactly 90 minutes left.

 Hint: Think about a repeating decimal pattern",Think about a repeating decimal pattern,"We know the repeating pattern for 1/7 and can try to observe k* 999999/7. The answer is 285714.
If its rightmost digit is placed at its left end, the new number is 428571 which is 50% larger than the original number 285714.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  
N = 10a + d  

where  

• d is the right-most digit (1–9; d ≠ 0 because it will be moved to the front)  
• a is the “rest” of the number (possibly with leading zeros)  
• N has n digits, so 10^{n-1} ≤ N < 10^{n}.  

After moving the last digit to the front we obtain  

M = d·10^{n-1} + a.

The requirement is “the new number is 50 % larger”, i.e.

d·10^{n-1} + a = 3/2 · (10a + d).

Multiply by 2 and rearrange:

2d·10^{n-1} + 2a = 30a + 3d  
2d·10^{n-1} – 3d = 28a  
d(2·10^{n-1} – 3) = 28a.          (1)

Put S = 2·10^{n-1} – 3.  
Equation (1) says that d·S must be divisible by 28 = 4·7.

Step 1 – work modulo 28.  
Because 10^{n-1} mod 28 is periodic with period 6, we list

n-1  :  0  1  2  3  4  5 …  
10^{n-1} mod 28 : 1 10 16 20 4 12 …  
S = 2·10^{n-1} – 3 mod 28 : 27 17 1 9 5 21 …  

Only S ≡ 21 (when n-1 ≡ 5  ⇔  n ≡ 6) contains the factor 7.
Hence the smallest possible length is n = 6.

Step 2 – satisfy the factor 4.  
For n = 6 we have the exact value  
S = 2·10^{5} – 3 = 199 997 = 28·7 142 + 21.

Thus S / 28 = 7 142 + 21/28 = 7 142 + 3/4.

Plugging into (1):

a = d · S / 28 = d(7 142 + 3/4).

The fractional part disappears iff d is a multiple of 4.  
The only digits 1–9 that are multiples of 4 are d = 4 and d = 8.

For d = 4 :  a = 4·7 142 + 4·3/4 = 28 568 + 3 = 28 571.  
For d = 8 :  a = 8·7 142 + 8·3/4 = 57 136 + 6 = 57 142.

In both cases a < 10^{5} (so N really has 6 digits).  
Form N = 10a + d:

• d = 4  ⇒  N = 10·28 571 + 4 = 285 714  
• d = 8  ⇒  N = 10·57 142 + 8 = 571 428

Step 3 – choose the smaller of the two.

285 714 is the smallest candidate.

Verification:  
Move the last digit 4 to the front → 428 571.  
1.5 × 285 714 = 428 571 ✔︎

Each ferry travels at a constant speed, although the ""Lead Balloon"" is faster than the ""Iceberg Magnet"".
The two boats leave from opposite shores at the same time.  They pass at a point of 720 yards from Lard Sculptures.  Upon arriving at the opposite shore, each boat stays in its slip for 5 minutes, and then starts back. They pass again 400 yards from Kebab Fountains. Assume both boats travel along a straight line.

The ratio of the total distance traveled by the two boats when they pass each other for the second time is:  (2x - 400) / (X + 400).
Since the boats travel at a constant speed, the ratios are equal.

3.  Equate the two expressions for v₁ / v₂ from (1) and (2):

 A  = Alf’s present age  
 B  = Bert’s present age

1.  The time when Alf was half Bert’s age

 Then A – t₂ = ½(B – t₂) ⇒ t₂ = 2A – B

 At that moment Bert’s age was  
 Y = B – t₂ = B – (2A – B) = 2B – 2A. (1)

2.  The time when Alf was a quarter of his present age

 Alf then: a = A – t  
 Bert then: b = B – t = (A + 3) – t.

 Alf was 2 years old and Bert was 5 years old the last time they met.

(Any present ages A and B that satisfy B = A + 3 and A ≥ 4 will fit all of Alf’s convoluted statement, but the prime–age condition pins down their ages at that meeting uniquely.)

Write n as a product of an odd number d and a power of two:

   Suppose n can be written as a sum of t (≥2) consecutive non-negative integers

  m + (m+1) + … + (m+t–1) = n.               (1)

   The left–hand side equals t·(2m+t–1)/2, so

  2n = t(2m + t – 1).                         (2)

   Hence t divides 2n.  If t is odd it already divides n; if t is even then 2n/t is odd.  
   In either case the factor t must contain an odd part larger than 1.  So n must have an odd
   divisor > 1.

2.  Converse  
   If n possesses an odd divisor d>1, set

  t = d                    (odd length)  
  m = (n/d – (d–1)/2).

   Because d divides n, m is an integer, and (1) gives a valid decomposition (m is non-negative
   when n is large enough; for the range 1000–2000 this always happens).  
   Thus n can be expressed as a sum of consecutive integers iff n has an odd divisor > 1.

3.  Powers of two are the only obstacles  
   A power of two 2^k has no odd divisors except 1, so it cannot satisfy the above criterion.

For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.
Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.

 abc  with a ≠ 0 (otherwise the badge reader rejects it).

For every ID we look at its reverse cba.  
Two different employees are forbidden to have IDs whose reverses coincide, so whenever two VALID IDs are mutual reverses we may keep at most one of them.  
If the reverse is not itself a valid three-digit ID (because its first digit is 0), then no conflict arises.

Step 1.  Palindromic IDs  
These are of the form ABA (a ≠ 0, b any digit).  
There are 9 × 10 = 90 of them and each is its own reverse, hence all 90 can stay.

Step 2.  IDs whose last digit is 0  
They are of the form ab0 with a ≠ 0, b any digit.  
Count: 9 × 10 = 90.  
Their reverse is 0ba, which is NOT a valid ID (it starts with 0), so none of these clash with anything.  
All 90 can stay.

Step 3.  The remaining IDs  
These are the IDs that are not palindromes and do not end in 0.

170,"Question: Mad Ade lives on a long street In Sunny Madadia and he has noticed that the sum of the house numbers up to his own house, ""The Kebabers rest"", but excluding it, equals the sum of the numbers of his house to the end of the road. If the houses are numbered consecutively, starting from 1, what are the possible numbers of Mad Ade's house?

Mad Ade's house could be #3 out of 3, #15 out of 20, #85 out of 119, or #493 out of 696.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

H  = Mad Ade’s house number  
N  = the last house number on the street ( N < 1000 and N ≥ H )

The condition is  

1 + 2 + … + (H – 1)  =  H + (H + 1) + … + N.       (1)

Write the two arithmetic–series sums with the familiar formula

S_left  = (H – 1)H / 2  
S_right = [N(N + 1)/2] – [(H – 1)H / 2].

Equation (1) therefore gives

(H – 1)H / 2  =  N(N + 1)/2 – (H – 1)H / 2  
⟺                N(N + 1)  =  2H(H – 1).          (2)

To treat (2) Diophantinely, make both factors odd by introducing

x = 2N + 1   (so N = (x – 1)/2 is an integer)  
y = 2H – 1   (so H = (y + 1)/2 is an integer).

Then

N(N + 1) = [(x – 1)/2][(x + 1)/2] = (x² – 1)/4,  
H(H – 1) = [(y + 1)/2][(y – 1)/2] = (y² – 1)/4.

Plugging these into (2) gives

(x² – 1)/4 = 2·(y² – 1)/4  
⟺  x² – 1 = 2y² – 2  
⟺  x² – 2y² = –1.                              (3)

Thus we need positive integer solutions of the Pell-type equation
x² – 2y² = –1 with x odd, y odd, and x ≤ 2·1000 + 1 = 2001.

All positive solutions to x² – 2y² = –1 are produced recursively from the
fundamental solution (x₁ , y₁) = (1, 1):
if (x_k , y_k) solves (3), so does

x_{k+1} = 6x_k – x_{k–1},  y_{k+1} = 6y_k – y_{k–1},

giving the sequence (odd solutions only)

(x, y) = (1,1), (7,5), (41,29), (239,169), (1393,985), (8119,5741), …

Stop when x exceeds 2001.  The admissible pairs are therefore

(7,5), (41,29), (239,169), (1393,985).

Convert each (x, y) back to (N, H):

x  y        N = (x–1)/2     H = (y+1)/2
7  5            3               3

1393 985      696             493

The next pair (8119,5741) would give N = 4059 > 1000, so it is excluded.

Hence Mad Ade’s house number H can be

3, 15, 85, or 493.

Each one indeed satisfies equation (1); e.g. for H = 85 and N = 119,

1 + … + 84 = 3570, 85 + … + 119 = 3570.

""You just pressed the multiplication button each time between amounts instead of the addition button.""  The shop keeper smiled with new false teeth and replied, ""it doesn't matter either way, it still comes to £5.70p"".

£2.85+£1.60+£1.25=£5.70",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the three magazine prices be x, y, z (in pounds).

Because the shop-keeper accidentally multiplied instead of adding, but still obtained £5.70, we must have  
x + y + z = x y z = 5.70.  (1)

The hint tells us that two of the prices add to the third price and multiply to 2:

Choose the two prices to be a and b.  
Then the third price is c with  

a + b = c,  a b = 2.  (2)

Express the sum and product in terms of a and b:

Sum: a + b + c = a + b + (a + b) = 2(a + b) = 2c.  
Product: a b c = 2 c.

By (1) these are equal to 5.70, so

2c = 5.70  ⇒  c = 5.70 / 2 = 2.85.  (3)

Now find a and b from (2):

a + b = 2.85,  a b = 2.

a and b are the roots of t² – 2.85 t + 2 = 0  
 t = [2.85 ± √(2.85² – 8)] / 2  
 t = [2.85 ± √(8.1225 – 8)] / 2  
 t = [2.85 ± 0.35] / 2.

Thus

a = (2.85 + 0.35)/2 = 3.20/2 = 1.60,  
b = (2.85 – 0.35)/2 = 2.50/2 = 1.25.  (4)

Check:

Sum 1.60 + 1.25 + 2.85 = 5.70  
Product 1.60 × 1.25 × 2.85 = 2 × 2.85 = 5.70 ✔

Hence the three magazines cost £1.60, £1.25 and £2.85.

If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.

Of that list, 33 is the only number that contains a 3 as the second digit and so for criterion 3 to be satisfied, 3 can only appear at the start of the 5-digit numbers.  From there it is simply a matter of choosing the next digits using the list above so that criterion 2 is satisfied, making sure that criterion 3 is also satisfied.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the four prime digits be 2, 3, 5 and 7.  
A 5-digit number N = d₁d₂d₃d₄d₅ must satisfy

(1) each dᵢ ∈ {2,3,5,7};  
(2) each adjacent pair dᵢdᵢ₊₁ is NOT a 2-digit prime;  
(3) every digit 2, 3, 5, 7 appears at least once (so exactly one of them is repeated).

-------------------------------------------------
Step 1 –  Two–digit primes that may appear

With tens–digit and units–digit taken only from 2,3,5,7 the sixteen possible pairs are  

22 23 25 27  
32 33 35 37  
52 53 55 57  
72 73 75 77  

Among these the primes are 23, 37, 53, 73.

Hence the forbidden adjacent pairs are  
(2,3), (3,7), (5,3), (7,3).

All other pairs are allowed.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 2 –  A crucial consequence for the digit 3

The digit 3 can be preceded only by 3 (otherwise the pair is 23, 53 or 73, all prime).  
Therefore, if any 3 occurs after the first position it must be preceded by another 3, and that
3 must again be preceded by 3, and so on.  
Hence:  If the number contains the digit 3, it must start with 3.

Because 3 must appear at least once, every valid 5-digit number begins with 3.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 3 –  Constructing the largest number

We want the remaining digits as large as possible.

• First digit is forced: d₁ = 3.  
• After 3 the largest allowed digit is 5 (pair 35 is composite), so d₂ = 5.  
• After 5 the largest permitted digit is 7 (pair 57 is composite), so d₃ = 7.  
• After 7 the largest permitted digit is 7 (pair 77 is composite).  
  We still need the digit 2 somewhere, so let d₄ = 7, d₅ = 2 (pair 72 composite).

The number 3 5 7 7 2 = 35772 uses all four prime digits, only one digit (7) is repeated, and
all adjacent pairs (35, 57, 77, 72) are non-prime.  
Any attempt to raise an earlier digit would violate the pair‐condition, so this is the maximum.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 4 –  Constructing the smallest number

Now pick the smallest possible digits.

• d₁ = 3 (forced).  
• After 3 the smallest allowed digit is 2 (pair 32 composite), so d₂ = 2.  
• After 2 the smallest allowed digit is 2 (22 composite), so d₃ = 2.  
• We still need digits 5 and 7.  The smallest we can place next is 5 (pair 25 composite),  
  so d₄ = 5.  
• Finally put the required 7: d₅ = 7 (pair 57 composite).

The number 3 2 2 5 7 = 32257 satisfies every condition and is clearly minimal,
because any smaller choice for an earlier digit is impossible.

177,"Question: Once an old man died, and in his Will he stated that all the pearls he kept in a little bag were to be distributed among his daughters. To make things fair, the distribution must be done in the following way:
The older girl should receive one pearl, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""
And so it was.
How many pearls were there in the bag?
How many daughters did the old man have?
How many pearls did each girl get?
 Hint: If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","There were 36 pearls.
There were 6 daughters.
Each daughter got 6 pearls.
The girl number x will have x pearls and a seventh of the rest. Since the last girl leaves no pearls in the bag, then when she takes her pearls the rest in the bag is zero (a seventh of nothing is nothing).
Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).
That is, k+1 = 7 and then k = 6.
So, the number of pearls is 6*6 = 36, and there were 6 girls.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

P₁ = number of pearls in the bag before the oldest girl is served,  
P₂ = number left before the 2-nd girl is served, … ,  
P_{k+1} = number left after the youngest girl is served (this is 0).

Rule for the i-th girl  
1. She first takes i pearls.  
2. From what then remains she takes one seventh.

Hence  

Remaining after step i :   P_{i+1} = P_i − i − (P_i − i)/7  
                            = (6/7)(P_i − i)                               (1)

Total received by the i-th girl :   T_i = i + (P_i − i)/7                  (2)

The judge said every girl gets the same amount, say S pearls, so

T_i = S   for every i.                                                     (3)

-------------------------------------------------
1. Express P_i in terms of S.

From (2) and (3):

(P_i − i)/7 = S − i   ⇒   P_i = i + 7(S − i) = 7S − 6i.                  (4)

2. Make formulas (1) and (4) consistent.

Using (4) in (1):

P_{i+1} = (6/7)(P_i − i)   
         = (6/7)(7S − 7i) = 6(S − i).                                    (5)

But from (4) with i replaced by i+1 we also have

P_{i+1} = 7S − 6(i+1) = 7S − 6i − 6.                                     (6)

Equate (5) and (6):

6(S − i) = 7S − 6i − 6   
⇒ 6S − 6i = 7S − 6i − 6   
⇒     S   = 6.                                                             (7)

So each girl receives S = 6 pearls.

3. Determine the number k of daughters.

Put i = k in (4) to obtain the amount in the bag just before the
youngest girl is served:

P_k = 7S − 6k = 42 − 6k.

After she is served nothing must remain, so use (1) (or note that she
takes everything):

P_{k+1} = 0 = 42 − 6(k+1) = 36 − 6k   
⇒ 6k = 36 ⇒ k = 6.                                                        (8)

4. Initial number of pearls.

From (4) with i = 1:

P₁ = 7S − 6 = 42 − 6 = 36.                                                (9)

5. Verification.

Girl 1: starts with 36, takes 1 + (35)/7 = 1+5 = 6, left 30  
Girl 2: starts with 30, takes 2 + (28)/7 = 2+4 = 6, left 24  
Girl 3: starts with 24, takes 3 + (21)/7 = 3+3 = 6, left 18  
Girl 4: starts with 18, takes 4 + (14)/7 = 4+2 = 6, left 12  
Girl 5: starts with 12, takes 5 + ( 7)/7 = 5+1 = 6, left 6  
Girl 6: starts with  6, takes 6 + ( 0)/7 = 6+0 = 6, left 0.

Everything matches the conditions.

We need the cost of 1 burger + 1 shake + 1 fries: b + s + f.

Step 1. Eliminate f by subtracting (1) from (2):

 x  = combined work-rate of the triplets (Wig, Twig, Swig),

From the data

1. Rastus + triplets plant the field in 5 h: (x + y) = 1/5
2. Willie + triplets plant the field in 6 h: (x + z) = 1/6

Hence  
5(x + y) = 6(x + z) ⇒ 5x + 5y = 6x + 6z ⇒ y = (x + 6z)/5. (★)

Willie divides the field in proportion to these rates.  
Let k be the constant that converts a rate to the number of parts received; then

 Willie: kz   parts  
 Rastus: ky   parts

Willie keeps exactly 1 part, so kz = 1 and k = 1/z.

Therefore

 Rastus’ parts = ky = y/z,  
 Each triplet’s parts = k(x/3) = x/(3z).

The total number of parts is
 N = 1 + y/z + 3·[x/(3z)] = 1 + (y + x)/z. (1)

Using the rate equations:
 x + z = 1/6  ⇒ x = 1/6 − z,  
 x + y = 1/5  ⇒ y = 1/5 − x = 1/5 − (1/6 − z) = z + 1/30.

Hence

 y/z = 1 + 1/(30z), x/z = 1/(6z) − 1.

Substituting in (1) gives
 N = 1 + 1 + 1/(30z) + 1/(6z) − 1 = 1 + 1/(5z).

Thus 1/(5z) must be an integer n and N = n + 1.

Step 2 – determine which primes are forced  
• 5 can only occur in the ten’s place of a two–digit prime (no prime >5 ends in 5).

• Digit 7 occurs in exactly one prime.  Using 47 will already take care of the single 7,

However, the problem says the arc can only intersect A and B. To do this, the circle must be slightly larger than the one described above. As stated in the problem, the larger arc must be the next largest integer size, which is 181 degrees.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step-1.  What does “intersect only at A and B” mean?  
If an infinite line meets a circle in exactly one point it is tangent to the circle.  
Therefore AO and BO are two tangents drawn from the common external point O to the circle, touching the circle at A and B.

Step-2.  Relate the angle between the tangents to the intercepted arcs.  
For two tangents drawn from the same external point, the measure of the angle between the tangents equals half the difference of the measures of the two arcs cut off on the circle; equivalently,

angle AOB = ½ (major arc AB − minor arc AB).

Because the two arcs complement each other to 360°, let  
minor arc AB = x°  ⇒ major arc AB = 360° − x°.

Then  
angle AOB = ½ [(360 − x) − x] = ½ (360 − 2x) = 180° − x°.

Step-3.  Insert the given angle.  
The two given lines are perpendicular, so  
angle AOB = 90°.

Thus  
90° = 180° − x°  ⇒  x = 90°.

So the minor arc AB measures 90°.

Step-4.  Find the major arc.  
major arc AB = 360° − 90° = 270°.

Step-5.  Check integrality and minimality.  
270° is already an integer, and the geometry fixes this value uniquely (there is no smaller integer possible for the larger arc under a 90° tangent angle).

 K = number of Rnkfurers Kurt receives  
 T = R + K = total number of Rnkfurers  

The key condition stated repeatedly in the story is  

 “The number of Rnkfurers Rod gets is the same integer as Kurt’s percentage of the total.”

Translated into algebra:

 R = (K / T) · 100.               (1)

Multiply both sides by T and rearrange:

 RT = 100K  
 R(R + K) = 100K  
 R² = K(100 – R).                (2)

Hence K = R² / (100 – R);  
so 100 – R must divide R².  
We are interested only in solutions in which both boys receive fewer than 100 Rnkfurers (per the hint).

Search for 1 ≤ R ≤ 99 such that 100 – R | R²:

 R = 20 → 100 – 20 = 80; R² / (100 – R) = 400 / 80 = 5. (OK)  
 R = 50 → 100 – 50 = 50; R² / (100 – R) = 2500 / 50 = 50. (OK)  
 R = 60 → 100 – 60 = 40; R² / (100 – R) = 3600 / 40 = 90. (OK)

No other R between 1 and 99 gives an integer K below 100, so the three admissible pairs are

 (R, K) = (20, 5), (50, 50), (60, 90).

Now match them to the narrative:

1. The first “minimum special order”
   R = 20, K = 5, T = 25.  
   Rod’s 20 equals Kurt’s (5/25)·100 = 20 %.

2. Kurt’s “next largest set is trivial” remark  
   R = 50, K = 50, T = 100.  
   Rod’s 50 equals Kurt’s (50/100)·100 = 50 %.

3. Ordering by the case (each case holds 50) and letting Kurt get more
   They order 3 cases = 150 Rnkfurers: R = 60, K = 90.  
   Rod’s 60 equals Kurt’s (90/150)·100 = 60 %.
   Kurt’s 90 is under his 100-Rnkfurer desk limit.

Therefore:

First split: Rod 20 and Kurt 5.  
Second (trivial) split: Rod 50 and Kurt 50.  
Third split (case order): Rod 60 and Kurt 90.

Final answer: Rod got 20 and Kurt 5 the first time; they would get 50 each in the “trivial” case; and, when they order by the case, Rod gets 60 while Kurt gets 90.",True,0,1

From 2:  G=1 because A*G = A (A is not 5, because then from 1, F should also be 5)
From 4: F*A has to be a single number so it can only be 2*3 or 2*4 (or vice versa) and C can only be 6 or 8

1.  We know G = 1 (given).

2.  Equation F·A = C must give a one–digit result (1–8).  
   With digits 1–8 and no repeats, the only way two numbers ≥2 multiply to ≤8 is
      2 × 3 = 6, 2 × 4 = 8, 3 × 2 = 6, 4 × 2 = 8.  

3.  Look at the two-digit equation (FA)·A = CF.  
   Write FA = 10F + A.  Multiplying by A gives  
      (10F + A)A = 10C + F.  
   Use F·A = C from (2): replace 10F with 10C/A.  The equality forces A² = F.  
   Among digits 1–8 this is only possible with A = 2 and F = 4.

4.  With A = 2, F = 4 we get C = F·A = 4·2 = 8.  
   Now we have A=2, C=8, F=4, G=1.

5.  Equation (DG)·A = BA becomes (10D + 1)·2 = 10B + 2.  
   Simplify: 20D + 2 = 10B + 2 ⇒ 20D = 10B ⇒ 2D = B.  
   Since digits are 1–8 and unused so far, D can only be 3 (because 2·3 = 6 ≤ 8).  
   Therefore D = 3 and B = 6.

6.  Remaining unused digits are 5 and 7, to be assigned to E and H.  
   Equation H·E = DH is H·E = 10D + H = 30 + H.  
   Rearranged: H(E − 1) = 30.  
   Trying H = 5 gives 5(E − 1) = 30 ⇒ E − 1 = 6 ⇒ E = 7, which works.  
   (H = 7 would require E − 1 = 30/7, not an integer.)

7.  All equations are now satisfied:
      FA·A = 42·2 = 84 = CF  
      DG·A = 31·2 = 62 = BA  
      H·E = 5·7 = 35 = DH

Three is the smallest number whose product is greater than its sum.  Therefore you want to include as many 3's in the answer as possible.  Then make 2's (or 4's) out of the remainder.
20 / 3 = 6, remainder 2 so 3^6 x 2",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We want to write 20 as a sum of positive integers  
n1 + n2 + … + nk = 20  
and make the product P = n1 n2 … nk as large as possible.

Step 1. 1’s never help  
If some part equals 1, replace it together with any other part m ≥ 2 by (m+1).  
Because 1·m = m < m+1, the product increases.  
So an optimal decomposition never uses the number 1.

Step 2. The only candidates we really need are 2 and 3  
For any integer m ≥ 4 we compare the product before and after splitting m.  
• Split m into (2, m−2): product becomes 2(m−2).  
• Split m into (3, m−3): product becomes 3(m−3).

Since m ≥ 4, in both cases the new product is at least as big as the original m, and it is strictly larger unless m = 4 (where 2·2 = 4).  
Hence every part ≥ 4 can be replaced by 2’s and 3’s without decreasing the product.  
Therefore an optimal partition uses only 2’s and 3’s.

Step 3. Prefer 3 to 2  
The hint 2³ < 3² (8 < 9) shows that, per unit of “sum”, 3’s give more product than 2’s.  
So we want as many 3’s as possible, subject to the total still summing to 20.

20 ÷ 3 = 6 remainder 2, i.e.  
20 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2.

This uses six 3’s and one 2.  
Product: 3⁶ · 2 = 729 · 2 = 1458.

Step 4. Check the only other possible remainder case  
If the remainder had been 1 we would replace (3, 1) by (2, 2), but with remainder 2 we are already optimal.  
Any partition with fewer 3’s (hence more 2’s) or with any part ≥ 4 gives a smaller product, as quick tests confirm (all are < 1458).

Therefore the maximum product is 1458.

When using this method, we can calculate that the final number of watermelons is 140. (Note: The result for distance of 6 is 886 but from this moment the camel needs to travel only 17 times to get all the watermelons 1km further, so the result for distance of 7 is 869)",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Below is one systematic way to see what the best one can do.  
(The word “water-melon” is used for the single, transportable unit; the camel eats one such unit per kilometre it walks, no matter whether it is loaded or not.  Melons may be dropped and picked up again whenever we wish.)

Notation  
C = 100   (camel’s carrying capacity)  
E = 1     (melons eaten per kilometre walked)  
D = 99 km (distance A → B)  
N = 1000  (melons initially available)  

General fact  
If at some place we still own k·C (i.e. k full loads) of melons with k>1, then to move them one more kilometre forward we have to make

 k forward trips + (k–1) return trips = 2k–1 kilometres,

and the camel therefore eats 2k–1 melons per kilometre advanced.  
Hence while we still need k full loads, the “tariff” is

 tariff(k)  =  2k – 1  melons/km.                (1)

As soon as the store falls to (k–1)·C melons the tariff drops to 2(k–1)–1 = 2k–3 melons/km, so it is always advantageous to reach the next lower multiple of 100 as soon as possible.

With that in mind we can work in successive stretches, each stretch ending as soon as one full load (100 melons) has disappeared from the stock (by being eaten).  For every stretch we have

At the end of the eighth stretch we have

Only two full loads are left, so the tariff has dropped to

The remaining distance is

 m₈ – 57.023 = 200 – 57.023 = 142.977… .

Also, at least half the men working came with their wives.
He paid five Madadian Wonks per day to each man, four Wonks to each woman and one Wonk to each child. He gave out 200 Wonks every evening.

189,"Question: A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.

If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?

I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let

 Hint: The only variable needed is the number of men--find different expressions for the total number of games between just men and the number of games between men and women",The only variable needed is the number of men--find different expressions for the total number of games between just men and the number of games between men and women,"Totally 120 games were played in the tournament.
Let N be the number of men in the tournament.
Then the number of games played by men between themselves
= N*(N-1)/2
The number of games played by men with women
= 4*N
(since there were 4 women in the tournament)
It is given that the total number of games that men played between themselves exceeded those played by men with women by 18.
Hence
N*(N-1)/2 - 4*N = 18
N*(N-1) - 8*N = 36
N*N - N - 8*N = 36
N^2 - 9*N - 36 = 0
Factorizing we get,
N^2 - 12*N + 3*N - 36 = 0
N*(N - 12) + 3*(N - 12) = 0
(N - 12)(N + 3) = 0
Hence N = 12 or -3 (not possible).
Hence the number of men in the chess tournament
= N = 12
Therefore the total number of people participating in the chess tournament = 12 + 4 = 16.

191,"Question: There is a number.
1. If it is not a multiple of 4, then it is between 60 and 69.
2. If it is a multiple of 3 it is between 50 and 59.
3. If it is not a multiple of 6 it is between 70 and 79.
What is the number?
 Hint: Eliminate possibilities within 50-79",Eliminate possibilities within 50-79,76,GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let N be the unknown integer.  
Write the three clues as logical implications:

A. If N is NOT a multiple of 4 ⇒ 60 ≤ N ≤ 69.  
B. If N IS a multiple of 3   ⇒ 50 ≤ N ≤ 59.  
C. If N is NOT a multiple of 6 ⇒ 70 ≤ N ≤ 79.

An implication “P ⇒ Q” is false only when P is true and Q is false; otherwise it is true.  
Hence, for each statement we must avoid the “false” situation.

1. Search outside 50-79  
   • Outside 60-69, statement A forces N to be a multiple of 4.  
   • Outside 50-59, statement B forces N NOT to be a multiple of 3.  
   • Outside 70-79, statement C forces N to be a multiple of 6.  

   But “multiple of 6” means “multiple of 3”, contradicting “NOT a multiple of 3”.  
   Therefore no solution lies outside 50-79; N must be between 50 and 79.

2. Check the three sub-ranges.

a) 50-59  
   • To satisfy A, N must be a multiple of 4.  
   • To satisfy C, N must be a multiple of 6.  
   Together that means “multiple of 12”.  The only multiples of 12 near here are 48 and 60, so none in 50-59 work.

b) 60-69  
   • To satisfy B, N must NOT be a multiple of 3.  
   • To satisfy C, N must be a multiple of 6 (hence a multiple of 3).  
   Impossible; no number in 60-69 works.

c) 70-79  
   • To satisfy A, N must be a multiple of 4.  
   • To satisfy B, N must NOT be a multiple of 3.  

   Multiples of 4 in 70-79 are 72 and 76.  
   72 is a multiple of 3 ⇒ violates B.  
   76 is not a multiple of 3 ⇒ all three statements hold.

Thus the only number that meets every condition is 76.

And therefore:
20^3 (8000) - 20*4 (80) = 7920.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1. Look for a “power of the input” (use the hint).  
   Compute the cube of each input n:  
   • 7³ = 343  
   • 8³ = 512  
   • 9³ = 729  
   • 10³ = 1000  
   • 11³ = 1331

2. Compare each cube with the given output:  
   • 343 → 315   (difference −28)  
   • 512 → 480   (difference −32)  
   • 729 → 693   (difference −36)  
   • 1000 → 960  (difference −40)  
   • 1331 → 1287 (difference −44)

3. Notice the differences form a simple pattern:  
   −28, −32, −36, −40, −44 …  
   Each difference equals −4 × n.  
   Example: for n = 7, −4 × 7 = −28; for n = 8, −4 × 8 = −32; etc.

4. Therefore the function can be written as  
   f(n) = n³ − 4n.

5. Apply the formula to n = 20:  
   f(20) = 20³ − 4·20  
          = 8000 − 80  
          = 7920.

Danny wanted an xCube365 (it lasts 365 days before programmatically disabling itself, so that a new one must be purchased), the highly coveted gaming system that had just been released. It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?
 Hint: First, see if there is a denomination that is not used. If so, figure out which denomination that is","First, see if there is a denomination that is not used. If so, figure out which denomination that is","Can at least one of each denomination be used? That totals $186 with only 6 bills, plus at least $94 with the rest of the bills. This is too high. Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.
If a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities.

For 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39 and 40 kg, he just needs to put the wheat on one side and the right combination of weights on the other side.

                   w₁ ≤ w₂ ≤ w₃ ≤ w₄ .

Because Lester may put weights on either pan, a set of weights {w₁,…,wₖ} whose sum is Sₖ can (by addition on the wheat side and subtraction on the opposite side) produce every integer mass from 0 up to Sₖ.  
Conversely, once these k weights give us that complete range 0…Sₖ, the next heavier weight wₖ₊₁ must not leave a gap: the smallest new mass we must be able to make is Sₖ+1, and the largest old mass we may have to put on the other pan is Sₖ.  
Hence  

                  wₖ₊₁ ≤ ( Sₖ + 1 ) + Sₖ  =  2Sₖ + 1.        (★)

To reach the largest amount of wheat, 40 kg, with only four weights we therefore always take wₖ₊₁ as large as (★) allows; this gives the greatest possible total.

Step-by-step construction  
1. We must be able to weigh 1 kg, so w₁ = 1.  
   Coverage after first weight: 0…1 ⇒ S₁ = 1.  

2. From (★): w₂ ≤ 2·1+1 = 3.  
   Choose the maximal 3.  
   Coverage with {1,3}: 0…4 ⇒ S₂ = 4.  

3. Next weight: w₃ ≤ 2·4+1 = 9.  
   Choose 9.  
   Coverage with {1,3,9}: 0…13 ⇒ S₃ = 13.  

4. Last weight: w₄ ≤ 2·13+1 = 27.  
   Choose 27.  
   Total sum S₄ = 1+3+9+27 = 40, so we can weigh every integer mass from 0 to 40 kg, in particular 1…40 kg as required.

w = price (£) of 1 lb of walnuts  
b = price (£) of 1 lb of Brazil nuts

The three packets give the three linear equations  

(1)   w + 2b           = 1.98  
(2)   w + 4f           = 2.48  
(3)   w + f + 3a       = 2.99  

There are four unknowns but only three equations, so the individual prices cannot be determined (as the hint says).  
What is required is the cost of one pound of each nut:

S = w + b + f + a.

Solve all variables in terms of b (any variable would work; the point is to see whether b cancels out).

From (1):      w = 1.98 − 2b.           …(4)

From (2):      4f = 2.48 − w  
               f = (2.48 − w)/4  
               = (2.48 − (1.98 − 2b))/4

From (3):      3a = 2.99 − w − f  
               a = (2.99 − w − f)/3.   …(6)

Now form S = w + b + f + a, and substitute (4), (5), (6):

S = w + b + f + (2.99 − w − f)/3  
  = (3w + 3b + 3f + 2.99 − w − f)/3  
  = (2w + 3b + 2f + 2.99)/3.

Insert w and f from (4) and (5):

2w = 2(1.98 − 2b) = 3.96 − 4b  
2f = 2(0.125 + 0.5b) = 0.25 + b.

Therefore the numerator becomes  
(3.96 − 4b) + 3b + (0.25 + b) + 2.99  
= 3.96 + 0.25 + 2.99 + (−4b + 3b + b)  
= 7.20 + 0b  
= 7.20.

The b-terms cancel completely, so S is unique:

S = 7.20 / 3 = 2.40.

But of course, what's a story without the brave and wise heroic prince? Here comes Prince Hajikidama of the Marbles Kingdom. He's no mummy, but his brilliant(?) brain deduced that in order to win the princess' heart, he'd have to give her what she wanted most - her fantasy, and his token of understanding (her childish delusional nature).
In the end, labouring his mind's creativity department for all its worth, Prince Hajikidama decided that a 'Mountain of Love', reaching so high it collected the never-fallen-snow in Marbles Kingdom, might do the trick. That actually is a tetrahedral-shaped (pyramid with 4 equilateral triangular faces) crystallic marbles-made structure (like a giant pile of apples or oranges at a greengrocer's store) consisting of one marble crowning on the top layer, three on the next-to-top layer, six on the third layer, ten on the fourth layer, and so forth.

A right triangle inscribes neatly into a semicircle, with the hypotenuse forming a diameter.  The shortest rope needed to reach all points is one staked at the midpoint of the hypotenuse, forming a radius of the circle.  74/2 = 37 feet.
The blond student found the first answer above, and would have used a rope of 29 feet.  The other student figured it at 113/2, or 56.5 feet.

Lewis Carroll searched for the answer to the basic mathematical problem, sent to him by a reader.  He found two right triangles with the same area, but couldn't discover a set of three.  Somewhat ironically, Carroll had found 20-21-29 and 12-35-37.  Had he doubled their dimensions, he would have had the first two triangles above, and quite likely would have found the third.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the legs of the right-triangle yard be a and b feet and the hypotenuse be c feet.  
Because the area is 840 ft²,

        ½ab = 840   ⇒   ab = 1680 .                      (1)

The sides are integral and satisfy

        a² + b² = c² .                                    (2)

So we want all integer solutions of (1) and (2).

Factor 1680 and examine every pair (a,b) with ab = 1680:

1·1680, 2·840, 3·560, … , 40·42        (all 20 factor pairs).

Only three of those pairs make a² + b² a perfect square:

        a = 15,  b =112  → c =113      (15,112,113)
        a = 24,  b = 70  → c = 74       (24,70,74)
        a = 40,  b = 42  → c = 58       (40,42,58)

Hence there are exactly three integral right triangles whose area is 840 ft².

Where should the dog’s stake go?  
The point from which the smallest possible circle can cover the entire triangle is the circum-center.  
For a right triangle the circum-center is the midpoint of the hypotenuse, and the radius of the circum-circle is half the hypotenuse:

        rope length  =  c / 2 .                            (3)

Applying (3) to the three triangles gives

        (40,42,58)   →  rope = 58 / 2 = 29 ft
        (24,70,74)   →  rope = 74 / 2 = 37 ft
        (15,112,113) →  rope = 113 / 2 = 56.5 ft

Notice that the second answer is 8 ft longer than the first, while the third is “a lot” longer than either—exactly what the two students said.

Therefore Mr. Collins’s key (the one that is 8 ft longer than the blond student’s answer) corresponds to the 24-70-74 triangle, so the rope he really needed was 37 ft long.

When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.

(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)
 Hint: Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step-1.  Fix the cost per box

Step-4.  Find the maximum of the quadratic  
The quadratic –5x² + 23.75x + 175 opens downward; its vertex lies at  

  x* = –b/(2a) = –23.75 /(2·(–5)) = 2.375.

Step-5.  Because price changes only in $0.20 steps, x must be an integer.  
Evaluate P(x) at the two nearest integers (x = 2 and x = 3):

P(2) = –5(2)² + 23.75(2) + 175 = –20 + 47.5 + 175 = \$202.50  
P(3) = –5(3)² + 23.75(3) + 175 = –45 + 71.25 + 175 = \$201.25

The larger profit occurs at x = 2.

Step-6.  Translate x = 2 back to a price  
Price = 5.95 – 0.20(2) = \$5.55 per box.

207,"Question: A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote an equation on a rock:
SLIDE

3651
""Each letter in the equation represents a different digit,"" said the troll. ""The letters in the password represent 3651.""
So, what is the password?
 Hint: There is some casework to be done on D; obviously we have that S = 1",There is some casework to be done on D; obviously we have that S = 1,"The password is LENS.
Since SL-D=3 or (SL-1)-D=3 (meaning SL-D=4), and since the highest possible sum of two different one-digit numbers is 17, S must equal 1.
Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.
Suppose D=7. Then L is 0 or 1, and since S=1, L=0. A must be 1 or 2, but since S=1, A=2.
Suppose D=8. Then L is 1 or 2, and since S=1, L=2. A must be 2 or 3, but since L=2, A=3.
Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.
Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.
If D=7, then L=0. But since 10-7=3, D cannot be 7.
If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.
If E=4, then N=3. But if D=8, A=3, and if D=9, L=3 and A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=5, then since 1I-E=6, I=1. But since S=1, this cannot work.
If E=7, then I=3. But if D=8, then A=3, and if D=9, then L=3. So this cannot work.
If E=8, then I=4, and D cannot be 8. But if D=9, then A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=9, then N=8, and D cannot be 8 or 9. So this cannot work.
Therefore, E=6, N=5, and I=2. If D=8, then L=2, so D must equal 9. This means:
S=1, I=2, L=3, A=4, N=5, E=6, and D=9.

Write b₁, b₂, b₃, b₄ for the borrows from the units, tens, hundreds and thousands columns respectively (each bᵢ is 0 or 1).

Column–wise equations

1. Units E – N = 1 – 10 b₁
2. Tens  D – A – b₁ = 5 – 10 b₂
3. Hundreds I – E – b₂ = 6 – 10 b₃
4. Thousands L – D – b₃ = 3 – 10 b₄
5. Ten-thousands S – b₄ = 0 (because the result has only four digits)

Analyse the units column

• If b₁ = 0 then E = N + 1 (both digits different and ≠ 1).  
• If b₁ = 1 then E = 0 and N = 9 (the only way two digits differ by 9).

We must examine all cases consistent with uniqueness of digits.

Case 1 b₁ = 0 (so E = N + 1)

1a b₂ = 0, b₃ = 0  
 D = A + 5, I = E + 6, L = D – 7  
 Trying all admissible digits shows no solution exists.

1b b₂ = 0, b₃ = 1  
 D = A + 5, I = E – 4, L = D – 6  
 The unique consistent choice is  
  N = 5, E = 6, I = 2, A = 4, D = 9, L = 3, S = 1

1c b₂ = 1 (either value of b₃)  
 Gives impossible digit values for I, so no solution.

Case 2 b₁ = 1 (E = 0, N = 9)

Both possibilities for b₂ and b₃ force negative or repeated digits, so no solution arises.

Thus the only valid assignment of digits is

S = 1, L = 3, I = 2, D = 9, E = 6, A = 4, N = 5.

less 10% discount $12.60 $14.50 $2.50 $29.60
Amount spent $113.40 $130.50 $22.50 $266.40
Explanation:
First find the original price of all the items combined. $266.40 is the price after the 10% discount was applied.
That means $266.40 is equal to 90% of the original price.
Write an equation and then cross multiply:
266.40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x   =   9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)
Let x = the amount Alec spent on trucks.
x + (x+5) = 75
2x + 5 = 75
2x = 70
x = 35
Alec spent $35 on trucks. Brett spent $5 more than Alec. Therefore, Brett spent $40 on trucks.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51
x + (2x + 3) = 51
3x + 3 = 51
3x = 48

1.  Three identical wheel-sets cost $75 ⇒ 3W = 75 ⇒ W = 25.  

2.  “Total bearings cost $24 less than total wheels cost”  
   Ba + Bb = 75 – 24 = 51.  

3.  “Total bearings cost is $1 more than Alec’s deck”  
   Ba + Bb = Da + 1 ⇒ Da = 51 – 1 = 50.  

4.  “Alec’s deck is $5 more than Brett’s”

5.  “Brett spent $3 more on bearings than twice Alec’s bearings”

   Therefore Ta + Tb = 296 – 221 = 75, and with Tb = Ta + 5 we have  
        2Ta + 5 = 75 ⇒ Ta = 35,  Tb = 40.  

All individual item prices (before discount):  
   Alec: deck 50, trucks 35, bearings 16, wheels 25 → 126.  
   Brett: deck 45, trucks 40, bearings 35, wheels 25 → 145.  
   Chris: wheels 25.  

Check: 126 + 145 + 25 = 296 ✔  

8.  Apply the 10 % discount to each person’s share:

   Alec: 0.9 × 126 = 113.40

Next graph these three lines. It should be expected that the answer will lie on the intersection of two of these lines or to make all chairs or all tables. The intersection of the saw and sanding machine line occurs outside of how many chairs the lathe can make so this combination is not a viable answer. The saw and lathe lines cross at 48 chairs and 24 tables. The lathe and sanding machine lines cross at 24 chairs and 48 tables.
Next determine the revenue at all points of intersection.

Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.
 Hint: TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches

Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.

Thus 375 people were informed after 11 periods of phone calls.
11 calls at 30 seconds each = 5.5 minutes, plus 90 seconds for the last people to exit the building gives 7 minutes.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Label the end of each 30-second period “step 0,1,2, …”.  
When a person is first told (at the end of some step)

• in the next step he makes his 1st call,  
• in the following step he makes his 2nd call,  
• then he needs three further steps (90 s) to run downstairs.

Thus a “fully-employed” person leaves the building 5 steps after he himself is notified.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  How many new people are notified at every step?

Let N(k) be the number of calls that finish (and therefore the number of NEW people who receive the warning) at step k.

Each newly-warned person will finish

 – one call 1 step later,  
 – another call 2 steps later.

Hence every call finished at step k produces

• one call-finish at step k+1 (its “child”’s first call) and  
• one call-finish at step k+2 (the same child’s second call).

Therefore

  N(k+2)=N(k+1)+N(k) ,     k≥1,

so the sequence (N(k)) is Fibonacci.  
Starting with Dave’s two sequential calls we get

step 1  N=1  
step 2  N=2  
step 3  N=3  
step 4  N=5  
step 5  N=8  
step 6  N=13  
step 7  N=21  
step 8  N=34  
step 9  N=55  
step 10 N=89  
step 11 N=144

2.  When is everybody warned?

The cumulative total S(k)=Σ_{i=1}^k N(i) is

1, 3, 6, 11, 19, 32, 53, 87, 142, 231, 375.

After step 11 exactly 375 residents have been reached; nobody is left to call.  
Time elapsed so far: 11·30 s = 330 s = 5 min 30 s.

3.  When does the last person leave?

• Those notified at step 11 have no more calls to make, so they start straight for the exit.  
  They need 3 further steps (90 s).  
• Those notified at steps 9 and 10 have just finished their last required call at step 11 and also start
  for the exit; they too are out 3 steps later.

Hence every remaining resident is outside by

step 11 + 3 = step 14.

Total time = 14·30 s = 420 s = 7 minutes.

( Dave himself leaves much earlier, at 2½ minutes, but the building is empty after 7 minutes. )

N, 2N, 3N, 4N, 5N and 6N are all written with exactly the same collection of digits – no digit appears in any of the products that is not already present in N.

A classical object with exactly this behaviour is a cyclic number.  
A cyclic number is an integer whose successive multiples are cyclic permutations of its own digits.  
The best–known cyclic number in base-10 comes from the repeating decimal of 1/7:

  1 ÷ 7 = 0.142 857 142 857 142 857 …  

The six-digit block 142 857 repeats forever.  Let us test this block:

1. 142 857 × 1 = 142 857  
2. 142 857 × 2 = 285 714  
3. 142 857 × 3 = 428 571

5. 142 857 × 5 = 714 285  
6. 142 857 × 6 = 857 142  

Look at each product: every one is just a cyclic rearrangement of the same six digits 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7.  No new digit (0, 3, 6 or 9) ever appears.  

Therefore the required 6-digit number is 142 857 (and, of course, any of its cyclic permutations, but 142 857 is the standard form singled out by the hint about the repeating decimal).

FLY = 100 F + 10 L + Y  
AWAY = 1000 A + 100 W + 10 A + Y = 1010 A + 100 W + Y  

The cryptarithm says  

3·FLY = AWAY,  

so  

3(100 F + 10 L + Y) = 1010 A + 100 W + Y.  

Subtract Y and divide by 10:  

30 F + 3 L + 1 = 101 A + 10 W.     (1)

-------------------------------------------------
1.  Determining Y  
Rewrite (1) as  

10(30 F + 3 L) + 2 Y = 10(101 A + 10 W).  

Taking both sides mod 5 gives Y ≡ 0 (mod 5), and since the digits are non-zero, Y = 5.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Reducing with Y = 5  
Put Y = 5 into (1):

30 F + 3 L + 1 = 101 A + 10 W  
⇒ 30 F + 3 L = 101 A + 10 W − 1.      (2)

-------------------------------------------------
3.  Trying A = 1 or 2  
Because 3·FLY is a 4-digit number, A can only be 1 or 2.

•  If A = 1, (2) gives  
 3(10 F + L) = 10(10 + W).  
 10 + W must be divisible by 3, so W = 2 or 8.  
 Both choices force L = 0, which is impossible (digits are non-zero).  
 Therefore A ≠ 1.

•  Take A = 2.  Then (2) becomes  
 30 F + 3 L = 201 + 10 W  
 ⇒ 10 F + L = 67 + (10 W)/3.           (3)

For (3) to be integral, W must be a multiple of 3, so W ∈ {3,6,9}.

 – W = 3 → 10 F + L = 77 ⇒ F = L = 7 (not allowed).  
 – W = 9 → 10 F + L = 97 ⇒ F = 9 duplicates W.  
 – W = 6 → 10 F + L = 87 ⇒ F = 8, L = 7 (all digits distinct and non-zero).

Thus the only consistent assignment is  

A = 2, W = 6, F = 8, L = 7, Y = 5.

Check: 875 × 3 = 2625, which indeed reads AWAY.

231,"Question: What is the smallest integer greater than 0 that can be written entirely with zeros and ones and is evenly divisible by 225?
 Hint: nan",,"The prime factorization of 225 is 5*5*3*3. So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.
All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let N be a positive integer whose decimal expansion uses only the digits 0 and 1 and that is divisible by 225.

2. divisibility by 9 → the sum of all decimal digits is a multiple of 9.

Write the number with n digits:

Let S = dₙ₋1 + dₙ₋2 + … + d₂ be the total number of 1’s among the first n–2
digits.  
We need S ≡ 0 (mod 9) and, because the number is positive, the leading digit
dₙ₋1 = 1, so S ≥ 1.

The smallest positive multiple of 9 is 9 itself, so the least possible value
for S is 9.  
That requires at least 9 digits available to place those nine 1’s:

n – 2  ≥  9 ⇒ n ≥ 11.

Take n = 11.  
Then n – 2 = 9, so every one of those nine positions must be 1.
The unique 11-digit string that does this is

11111111100.

(Check: it contains nine 1’s, ends in 00, and begins with 1.)

Testing the divisibility conditions:
• Digit sum = 9 ⇒ divisible by 9.  
• Last two digits = 00 ⇒ divisible by 25.  
Hence it is divisible by 9 × 25 = 225.

Could a shorter number work?  
For n ≤ 10 we have n – 2 ≤ 8, so S ≤ 8; S cannot be a positive multiple of 9,

D₅ = 4 → D₁ = 7  
D₅ = 5 → D₁ = 8  (D₃ would exceed 9)  
D₅ = 6 → D₁ = 9  (D₃ would exceed 9)

Applying equation 1 (D₃ = 2·D₅) and the 1–9 limit keeps only:

A. (D₅, D₃, D₁) = (2, 4, 5)  
B. (D₅, D₃, D₁) = (3, 6, 6)  (invalid, repeats 6)  
C. (D₅, D₃, D₁) = (4, 8, 7)

So two viable sets remain:

Case A  D₁=5, D₃=4, D₅=2  
Case C  D₁=7, D₃=8, D₅=4

Step 2.  Now use equation 2 (D₄ = D₂ + 6).  Possible digit pairs:

(D₂, D₄) = (2, 8)  or  (3, 9)

because any larger D₂ makes D₄>9, and D₄ cannot be prime (hint).

Case A (digits 5,4,2 already used)
• (D₂, D₄) = (2, 8) impossible (2 repeated)  
• (D₂, D₄) = (3, 9) gives digits 5 3 4 9 2, but primes would be 5,3,2 (=3 primes) so rule breaks.

Case C (digits 7,8,4 already used)
• (D₂, D₄) = (2, 8) impossible (8 repeated)  
• (D₂, D₄) = (3, 9) is valid: digits are 7 3 8 9 4.

Step 3.  Verify the classification counts for 7 3 8 9 4:
Primes: 7, 3 (two)  
Squares: 9, 4 (two)  
Neither: 8 (one)

All arithmetic relations hold:
• 8 = 2·4  
• 9 = 3 + 6  
• 4 = 7 – 3

All conditions satisfied.

237,"Question: There are four three-digit numbers that share this property: the number itself, its double and its triple contain each digit from 1 to 9 exactly once.

        abc = n ,          2n = def ,          3n = ghi            (1)

be one of the wanted triples, written in a 3 × 3 array

        a  b  c
        d  e  f
        g  h  i .                                              (2)

All nine symbols a,…,i are the digits 1–9 in some order and there are no repetitions.

1.  A useful observation  
   Adding the first two rows gives the third row (n + 2n = 3n).  
   This means that each column of (2) behaves just as the ordinary
   addition of two one–digit numbers with (possibly) a carry coming
   from the column on its right.  
   Therefore the carries are the same in every row of a column:
   shifting every digit of every row one place to the right (a b c → c a b, etc.)
   does not disturb the column additions; we only read the same nine digits
   in a different order.

   Consequently, whenever (a b c / d e f / g h i) is a solution, the array

        c  a  b
        f  d  e
        i  g  h                                               (3)

   is a second solution obtained by the common right–cyclic shift
   (last digit → front) of every row.

2.  Starting with the two solutions given in the statement  

        192 , 384 , 576      and      273 , 546 , 819

   we apply the shift described in (3):

   •  192 → 219 , 384 → 438 , 576 → 657  
      so 219, 438, 657 is a new triple, i.e. 219 satisfies the property.

   •  273 → 327 , 546 → 654 , 819 → 981  
      so 327, 654, 981 is another triple, i.e. 327 satisfies the property.

   Both triples indeed contain each digit 1–9 exactly once:

        219 438 657  =  {2,1,9,4,3,8,6,5,7}
        327 654 981  =  {3,2,7,6,5,4,9,8,1}

3.  Why no further numbers arise  
   A second right–shift would turn 219 into 921 and 327 into 732.
   But 921·3 = 2763 and 732·3 = 2196 – neither triple is three–digit,
   so they are excluded.  
   Hence every original triple produces at most one more admissible triple,
   and from the two that were given we have now obtained the only two
   still missing.

Therefore the complete set of three–digit numbers whose first three multiples
use the digits 1–9 exactly once is

        192 , 219 , 273 , 327 .

2. Midnight after 30 days, which is 720 hours later. They both now show 12 o'clock.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let t be the number of real minutes that have elapsed since the two clocks were set correctly at 12:00 midnight.

Rates of the two clocks  
• Fast clock: it gains 1 minute every real hour ⇒ it advances 61 minutes in 60 real minutes ⇒ rate = 61/60 of true time.  
• Slow clock: it loses 2 minutes every real hour ⇒ it advances 58 minutes in 60 real minutes ⇒ rate = 58/60 = 29/30 of true time.

1.  When do the two clocks next show the same time (not necessarily the right time)?

Displayed times (measured in minutes past 12:00, taken modulo 720 because an analog dial repeats every 12 h = 720 min):

Fast clock      F(t) = (61/60)t  (mod 720)  
Slow clock      S(t) = (58/60)t  (mod 720)

They coincide when F(t) ≡ S(t) (mod 720):

(61/60 − 58/60)t = (3/60)t = t/20 ≡ 0 (mod 720).

Smallest positive solution:

t/20 = 720  ⇒  t = 720·20 = 14 400 minutes.

Convert to days: 14 400 min ÷ 1 440 min/day = 10 days.

Hence the two clocks next agree 10 days after they were set, i.e. 240 hours later (midnight of Wednesday, 10 January).

2.  When do both clocks show the correct time simultaneously?

For a clock to be ‘correct’, its accumulated error must equal an integral multiple of 12 h = 720 min.

Fast clock error: gains 1 min/h ⇒ error = +t/60 (minutes).  
Require t/60 ≡ 0 (mod 720) ⇒ t ≡ 720·60 = 43 200 min.

Slow clock error: loses 2 min/h ⇒ error = −t/30 (minutes).  
Require −t/30 ≡ 0 (mod 720) ⇒ t ≡ 720·30 = 21 600 min.

The common times when both conditions hold are the common multiples of 43 200 and 21 600 minutes, whose least common multiple is 43 200 minutes.

43 200 min ÷ 1 440 min/day = 30 days.

Therefore both clocks are simultaneously correct again 30 days after being set, i.e. 720 hours later (midnight of Tuesday, 30 January).

Final answer: (1) The two clocks next show the same time 10 days after they were set (midnight of 10 January). (2) They both show the correct time 30 days after they were set (midnight of 30 January).",True,1,0

240,"Question: In the legendary land of Madadia, everything is wonderful. There is no inflation, so Madadian wonks (local currency 100 winks = 1 wonk) are constant in value.
Mad Ade's cousin Manic Martin works as an accountant in one of Madadia's leading accounting firms.
After his first year his salary was a straight 10,000 wonks, with which Manic Martin was quite happy. His manager was so impressed with his work he offered Manic Martin a wage rise.
Now this being Madadia, things are not always done as they are elsewhere, the wage rise was offered over a 17.5 year contract period, These contracts are immutably binding, and will still be paid to benefactors in the event of death or permanent disability.
Manic Martin has a choice of how to receive his raise.  The first option was for an immediate 5% raise to 10,500 wonks annually, with an additional 5% raise every 6 months. The second option was for an immediate 10% raise to 11,000 wonks annually, with an additional 10% raise every year. Manic Martin's salary, based upon his current annual, was paid bi-weekly.
Which deal would benefit Manic Martin the most?
 Hint: Think about the difference between the first and second half of every year",Think about the difference between the first and second half of every year,"The 5% semi-annual raise yields a higher return.
This may have been your first guess, but there is something odd about the answer. At the start of the problem, the 10% raise is earning more-  11,000 annually vs. 10,500. After the first year, the 5% option has earned 10,762 compared to 11,000.
What are the two options earning at the moment the contract closes, after 17.5 years? Surprisingly, the 5% option only realizes a little more than 55,160, compared to the 10% option which is still ahead with just under 56,000.
So where's the advantage in the 5% option? It hides in the second half of every year. Even in the first year, the 5% option makes more in the second six months than the 10% option. For the first few years, this is not enough to offset the difference. But cumulatively, over seventeen and a half years, 5% realizes a grand total of 390.27 more than the 10% option.

1.  Total paid under Plan A

There are 17.5 years = 35 half-years.  
In half-year k (k = 0,1,…,34) the annual rate is

R_A(k) = 10 500·1.05^k ,

so the amount paid during that half-year is

P_A(k) = (½)·10 500·1.05^k .

Total

T_A = Σ_{k=0}^{34} P_A(k)
    = 5 250 · Σ_{k=0}^{34} 1.05^k
    = 5 250 · (1.05^{35} – 1)/(1.05 – 1).

1.05^{35} = 5.516 015 37 (to 9 d.p.), hence

T_A = 5 250 · (5.516 015 37 – 1)/0.05

2.  Total paid under Plan B

There are 17 full years and one extra half-year.

For year j (j = 0,1,…,16) the annual rate is

R_B(j) = 11 000·1.10^j,

so the pay during that year is the same amount.

For the last half-year (j = 17) the pay is half of the yearly rate.

Total

T_B = Σ_{j=0}^{16} 11 000·1.10^j  +  ½·11 000·1.10^{17}
    = 11 000 · (1.10^{17} – 1)/(1.10 – 1)  +  5 500·1.10^{17}.

1.10^{17} = 5.054 470 287, so

T_B = 11 000 · (5.054 470 287 – 1)/0.10  +  5 500·5.054 470 287

3.  Comparison

T_A – T_B ≈ 474 181.6 – 473 791.3 ≈ 390.3  wonks.

Conclusion

Over the whole 17.5-year contract, the semi-annual 5 % rise plan gives about 390 wonks more than the annual 10 % rise plan.  Although Plan B starts higher, the more frequent compounding in Plan A (effective yearly growth 1.05² = 1.1025) overtakes it and yields the larger total.

For every upward rebound of height h there is a matching downward leg of the same length (except for the very first drop, which has no matching up-leg).

a₁ = amount of corn for the 1st worker

Because every worker gets the same amount more than the previous one, the five amounts form an arithmetic progression:

a₃ = a₁ + 2d  
a₄ = a₁ + 3d  
a₅ = a₁ + 4d  

1. Total of 100 measures

2. The “first two workers get seven times less than the last three,” i.e.

   Substitute the progression terms:

247,"Question: The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?

1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74

Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =

Facts translated into equations and inequalities

1.  At every station 2·xᵢ get in and xᵢ get down, so the net gain at that station is +xᵢ.

2.  The xᵢ are primes in the given intervals  
   x₁ ∈ {2,3,5,7}  
   x₂ ∈ {11,13,17,19}  
   x₃ ∈ {23,29}  
   x₄ ∈ {31,37}  
   x₅ ∈ {41,43,47}  
   x₆ ∈ {53,59}

3.  |2xᵢ – 2xᵢ₊₁| ≥ 20  ⇒  |xᵢ₊₁ – xᵢ| ≥ 10.  
    (Differences between consecutive primes are at least 10.)

4.  x₁ + x₂ + x₃ + x₄ + x₅ + x₆ is even.

Search for the six primes

Start from the middle and work outwards, using the “difference ≥10” rule.

●  x₃ must allow some x₄ with a gap ≥10.  
   – If x₃ = 29, the only possible x₄ are 31 or 37, giving gaps 2 or 8 (<10).  
     Hence x₃ ≠ 29.  
   – Therefore x₃ = 23, which forces x₄ = 37 (gap 14 ≥10).

●  With x₄ = 37, we need x₅ ≥ 47.  In its range only 47 works, so x₅ = 47.

●  With x₅ = 47, we need x₆ ≥ 57.  In its range only 59 works, so x₆ = 59.

●  Now go backwards.  With x₃ = 23 we need x₂ ≤ 13 (gap ≥10).  
   The admissible possibilities are 11 or 13.

●  For x₂ = 11 we would need x₁ ≤1 (since 11 – x₁ ≥10) which is impossible.  
   Hence x₂ = 13.

●  With x₂ = 13 we need x₁ ≤3.  The only primes in the first range are 2 or 3.  
   Check the parity condition:

        Sum with x₁ = 2 : 2+13+23+37+47+59 = 181  (odd)  – reject.  
        Sum with x₁ = 3 : 3+13+23+37+47+59 = 182  (even) – accept.

Thus the unique sextuple satisfying every condition is

x₁ = 3,  x₂ = 13,  x₃ = 23,  x₄ = 37,  x₅ = 47,  x₆ = 59.

Compute the initial number of passengers

Total getting down = 182, hence total net gain = +182.  
Let N be the number on board before reaching Maver.

N + 182 = 227   ⇒   N = 45.

A quick check of the running passenger totals confirms all numbers stay positive.

Therefore, 45 passengers (including Tweeto) were on the train before it reached Maver station.

60 degrees + x / 60 min* 30 degrees

Let the two whole numbers be x and y with x > y (because their squares are being subtracted in that order).  
The condition “the square of one whole number minus the square of another equals 73” is  
x² − y² = 73.

Step 2 – Use the algebraic identity for a difference of squares  
x² − y² = (x − y)(x + y).  
So we need two positive integers whose product is 73.

Step 3 – Factor 73  
73 is prime; its only positive factor pair is (1, 73).  
Therefore  
x − y = 1, x + y = 73.          (Both factors must be of the same parity; 1 and 73 are both odd, so this is consistent.)

Step 4 – Solve the two-equation system  
Add the two equations:  
(x − y) + (x + y) = 1 + 73 ⇒ 2x = 74 ⇒ x = 37.  
Substitute back: 37 − y = 1 ⇒ y = 36.

Step 5 – Verify  
37² − 36² = 1369 − 1296 = 73, which satisfies the original condition.

Hence the two whole numbers are 37 and 36.

These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.

Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)

70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)

Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:

• a is its first (left-most) digit (1 ≤ a ≤ 9),  
• b is the 15-digit string that remains when the first digit is removed (0 ≤ b < 10¹⁵).

Rotating N once to the left puts that first digit at the right end, giving  

R = b·10 + a.               (2)

The condition is “the rotated number equals one and a half times the original”, i.e.  

R = 3/2 · N.                (3)

Insert (1) and (2) into (3) and clear the fraction:

2(b·10 + a) = 3(a·10¹⁵ + b)  
20b + 2a   = 3a·10¹⁵ + 3b

Solve (4) for b:

17b = a(3·10¹⁵ – 2)  
b   = a(3·10¹⁵ – 2)/17.     (5)

Thus 17 must divide a(3·10¹⁵ – 2).  
Compute 3·10¹⁵ – 2 modulo 17:

10 ≡ 10 (mod 17)  
10² ≡ 15, 10⁴ ≡ 4, 10⁸ ≡ –1, so 10¹⁶ ≡ 1 ⇒ 10¹⁵ ≡ 10⁻¹ ≡ 12.  
Therefore 3·10¹⁵ – 2 ≡ 3·12 – 2 ≡ 36 – 2 ≡ 34 ≡ 0 (mod 17).

Hence 17 divides (3·10¹⁵ – 2) itself; call

K = (3·10¹⁵ – 2)/17 = 176 470 588 235 294.   (6)

From (5): b = a·K.

Successive multiples of K are

1·K = 176 470 588 235 294  
2·K = 352 941 176 470 588

4·K = 705 882 352 941 176  
5·K = 882 352 941 176 470  
6·K = 1 058 823 529 411 764  (> 10¹⁵).

Thus admissible a are 1,2,3,4,5, and the smallest N occurs when a = 1:

b = 1·K = 176 470 588 235 294  
N = 1·10¹⁵ + b = 1 176 470 588 235 294.      (7)

Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,Final answer: 416723,True,1,0
6,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.

Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?
 Hint: A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47

  s = (a + b + c)/2,  Δ = area(ABC).

1. Radius r of the inscribed circle (incircle)

The incircle is tangent to each side, so each side is a tangent segment of length equal to the radius r.  
Hence the triangle can be cut into three smaller right–triangles whose heights are all r.  
Therefore the area is the sum of three rectangles of height r and bases a, b, c:

 Δ = area(ABC) = r·a/2 + r·b/2 + r·c/2 = r(a + b + c)/2 = r s.

Solve for r:

 r = Δ / s.

2. Radius R of the circumscribed circle (circumcircle)

Using the usual area formula Δ = ½ab sin C (and its cyclic variants), write

 Δ = ½ab sin C.

But by the extended law of sines, a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.  
In particular,

 ab sin C = (2R sin A)(2R sin B) sin C = 4R² sin A sin B sin C.

Substituting in Δ = ½ab sin C gives

 Δ = ½ · 4R² sin A sin B sin C = 2R² sin A sin B sin C.

Using again a = 2R sin A, etc., we obtain

 sin A sin B sin C = (abc)/(8R³).

Insert this into the previous equation:

The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,,True,0,0
9,"Question: There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?
 Hint: The sum cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes. Think about what information is provided by each character knowing and/or not knowing the numbers.",The sum cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes. Think about what information is provided by each character knowing and/or not knowing the numbers.,"The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Here, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is 52.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""

10,"Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?
 Hint: The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly.

Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,,True,0,0

14,"Question: This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?
 Hint: Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers",Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12

Positions of the hands (measured in degrees from 12 o’clock)

 minute hand M = 6 t

Swap Time condition  
After exchanging the hands there must again be a legal clock­-time h′ : t′, so  

6 t′ = H = 30 h + 0.5 t             (1)  
30 h′ + 0.5 t′ = M = 6 t          (2)

From (1) t′ = 5 h + t/12 .  
Insert this in (2):

30 h′ + 0.5(5 h + t/12) = 6 t

 ⟹ 30 h′ + 5h/2 = 143 t/24

 ⟹ 143 t = 720 h′ + 60 h                (3)

For a given hour h the swapped hour h′ is an integer 0–11, and
t = (720 h′ + 60 h)/143 must satisfy 0 ≤ t < 60.

A.  One explicit Swap Time  
Take h = 1, h′ = 0.  
Equation (3) gives t = 60/143 min = 0.41958… min = 25.17 s.  
Hence

  1 : 00 : 25.17

is a Swap Time (swapping gives 12 : 05 : 02.10, a valid time).

B.  All Swap Times between 1 :00 and 2 :00 (h = 1)  
Put h = 1 in (3): t = (720 h′ + 60)/143, h′ = 0,1,…,11.

Calculating t and converting the fractional minutes to seconds (rounded to 0.01 s):

h′ = 0   t = 0.41958 min → 25.17 s  1 : 00 : 25.17  
h′ = 1   t = 5.45455 min → 27.27 s  1 : 05 : 27.27

Thus there are exactly twelve Swap Times between 1 :00 and 2 :00.

Bonus.  Total number of Swap Times in 12 hours  
For every original hour h (0–11) equation (3) gives one value of t for each choice of h′ (0–11) except when h = h′ = 11, for which t = 60 min (i.e. 12 :00) and belongs to the next cycle.  
Therefore

 12 × 12  − 1 = 144 − 1 = 143

Swap Times occur in every 12-hour period.

15,"Question: I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?
 Hint: Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"We introduce the three quantities suggested in the hint  

x  = Mum’s age when she gave birth to the first child, Tommy  
y  = Tommy’s age when the last child, Tony, was born  
z  = Mum’s age when Tony was born  

Relations that are immediately forced

1.  y = z – x                         (because the births of Tommy and Tony are z–x years apart)  
2.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be x years old, so  
        x  = 50 – z            ⇒           x + z = 50                             (A)

Hence z < 50 and x = 50 – z.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
I.  Using the divisibility condition at Tony’s birth
--------------------------------------------------------------------
At Tony’s birth the children’s ages (in years) were  

Tommy   y = z – x  
Timmy   d₂  
Tammy   d₃  
Tracey  d₄  
Tony    0  

where d₂ , d₃ , d₄ are the present‐day differences  

d₂ = Timmy – Tony ,   d₃ = Tammy – Tony ,   d₄ = Tracey – Tony .

Tammy tells us that all four positive ages at that moment were factors of z.  
In particular Tommy’s age y divides z:

          y | z  ⇒  z – x | z.

With (A) we have x = 50 – z, so

          z – x = z – (50 – z) = 2z – 50.

Thus the integer 2z – 50 must divide z.

Because z and 2z – 50 are positive and 2z – 50 < z + 1, the only way
2z – 50 can divide z is for 2z – 50 to be one of the proper divisors of z.
Trying the few possibilities that satisfy x + z = 50 and (reasonable) 18 ≤ x ≤ 32
gives the short list

   (x , z) = (20 , 30)      or      (24 , 26).

For z = 26 we would have y = 2 and would need four different positive
divisors of 26 strictly smaller than 2 – impossible.  Hence we must have

          z = 30 ,   x = 20 ,   y = 10.                       (B)

Now the gap between Tommy and Tony is

          d₁ = Tommy – Tony = y = 10.                        (C)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
II.  Relating Tammy, Timmy and Tony
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Tammy says:  “I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.”

Timmy’s age when Tony was born is exactly the present gap d₂, so

          Tammy = 3 d₂.                                      (D)

Consequently

          d₃ = (Tammy – Tony) = 3 d₂ – Tony.                 (E)

Because Tammy is younger than Timmy (she is the middle child) we must have

          Timmy  > Tammy   ⇒   Tony + d₂  > 3 d₂
                               ⇒   Tony  > 2 d₂.             (F)

And, being older than Tracey,

          Tracey  < Tammy  ⇒  d₄ < d₃.                       (G)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
III.  Fixing the numerical values of the remaining gaps
--------------------------------------------------------------------
All the positive gaps d₁, d₂, d₃, d₄ divide z = 30.
Using (C) we already have d₁ = 10.  Divisors of 30 smaller than 10 are

          6 , 5 , 3 , 2 , 1.

Pick d₂ from this set and use the inequalities (F) and 2 d₂ < Tony < 3 d₂
(which comes from combining (E) with the need for d₃ to be positive and
smaller than d₂).

A check of the few possibilities shows that the only viable choice is

          d₂ = 6 ,      Tony = 13.          (13 lies strictly between 2·6 and 3·6.)

Then from (E)

          d₃ = 3·6 – 13 = 5,

and any divisor of 30 strictly between 0 and 5 can be d₄; taking  
the largest such divisor, 3, respects (G):

          d₄ = 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
IV.  Present-day ages
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony              To  = 13  
Tracey            Tr  = 13 + d₄ = 16  
Tammy             Ta  = 13 + d₃ = 18   (which indeed equals 3·6)  
Timmy             Ti  = 13 + d₂ = 19  
Tommy             Tm  = 13 + d₁ = 23  
Mum               M   = z + Tony = 30 + 13 = 43.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
V.  Verifications
--------------------------------------------------------------------
•  Age-order: 23 > 19 > 18 > 16 > 13, so Tammy (18) is the middle child,  
   Tracey (16) is younger than Tammy and Tony (13) is the youngest.

•  “I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.”  
   Timmy’s age then: 19 – 13 = 6.  Tammy now: 18 = 3×6 ✔︎

•  At Tony’s birth Mum was 30 and the children’s positive ages were  
   10, 6, 5, 3 – every one a divisor of 30 ✔︎

•  The only other year with ≥3 children’s ages dividing Mum’s age occurs
   7 years ago, when Tracey (16 − 7 = 9) was half Tammy’s present age.  
   Mum was then 36, and the three children were 12, 9, 6 – each a divisor of 36,
   and no other year meets this condition ✔︎

•  When Mum turns 50 (in 7 years) Tony will be 13 + 7 = 20, exactly the age
   Mum was when Tommy was born (x = 20) ✔︎

All statements are satisfied and the data are internally consistent.

16,"Question: The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""

 Hint: 1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,,True,0,0

 S = Sandy’s dollars, U = Sue’s dollars. Both are whole numbers ≤ 1 000 000.

Step 1.  Translate Sandy’s two “give-and-take” conditions.

1)  If Sue gives x dollars to Sandy they will be equal: U – x = S + x.  …(i)  
2)  If Sandy gives the same x dollars to Sue, Sue will have twice Sandy’s amount:  
  U + x = 2(S – x).  …(ii)

From (i): U – S = 2x  ⇒ x = (U – S)/2>0 and U>S.

Insert x into (ii):

U + (U – S)/2 = 2(S – (U – S)/2)  
U + (U – S)/2 = 2(2S – U)/2  
U + (U – S)/2 = 2S – U.

Clear the denominator (multiply by 2):

2U + (U – S) = 4S – 2U   
4U – S = 4S  
4U = 5S  
S : U = 5 : 7.                                (So S = 5x, U = 7x for some integer x)

Step 2.  Express Sue’s “digit–shift” statement.

Write U as a six-digit (unknown yet) number whose first digit is a and whose remaining digits form the number b:

U = a·10^{d-1} + b (with 1 ≤ a ≤ 9 and 0 ≤ b < 10^{d-1}, d = number of digits).

“Remove the first digit and place it at the end” gives

S = 10·b + a.

Because S/U = 5/7,

(10b + a)/(a·10^{d-1} + b) = 5/7  
⇒ 7(10b + a) = 5(a·10^{d-1} + b)  
⇒ 65b + 7a = 5a·10^{d-1}.                     (★)

Step 3.  Fix the number of digits.

Condition (★) demands 65 | a(5·10^{d-1} – 7).

Divisibility by 5 forces a ≡ 0 (mod 5), hence a = 5 (since a is a single non-zero digit).  
With a = 5,

13 | 5(5·10^{d-1} – 7)  ⇔ 12·10^{d-1} ≡ 9 (mod 13)  
⇔ 10^{d-1} ≡ 4 (mod 13).

Powers of 10 mod 13 cycle every 6:

10^1≡10, 10^2≡9, 10^3≡12, 10^4≡3, 10^5≡4, 10^6≡1,…

Hence 10^{d-1} ≡ 4 occurs when d-1 ≡ 5 (mod 6).  
Because U ≤ 1 000 000, d ≤ 6, so d – 1 = 5 and d = 6.

Therefore U has exactly six digits and begins with 5.

Step 4.  Determine b.

From (★) with a = 5, d – 1 = 5:

65b = 5(5·10^5 – 7)  
b = (5·(500 000 – 7))/65 = 2 499 965 / 65 = 38 461.

Since b is five digits, everything is consistent.

Step 5.  Obtain S and U.

U = a·10^{5} + b = 5·100 000 + 38 461 = 538 461  
S = 10·b + a = 384 610 + 5 = 384 615.

Step 6.  Verify all conditions.

1)  Sue gives x = (U – S)/2 = (538 461 – 384 615)/2 = 76 923:  
 U – x = 461 538, S + x = 461 538. ✓

2)  Sandy gives the same x:  
 U + x = 615 384, S – x = 307 692, and 615 384 = 2·307 692. ✓

3)  Shifting the first digit of 538 461 to the end indeed yields 384 615. ✓

Both amounts are below one million dollars.

 5 11 10  8  
 9  7  6 12

because every entry and the entry that lies diametrally opposite it add to 17; that is,  
a(i , j)+a(5−i , 5−j)=17.  
Hence when the square is turned upside-down every line sum is preserved.

If every entry v is replaced by a new number of the form
          N = A·v + B
then

• the sum of each opposite pair becomes
  (A v + B) + [A(17−v) + B] = 17A + 2B (independent of v);

• the magic line-sum becomes
  A·34 + 4B (because the original rows summed to 34).

We want the new pair–sum to be 132 and the new line-sum to be 264, so we need

17A + 2B = 132  and 34A + 4B = 264.

(The second equation is just twice the first, so the single condition 17A + 2B = 132 is enough.)
Taking A to be the smallest positive even integer, A = 4, gives

B = (132 – 17·4)/2 = 32.

Thus we replace each v by N = 4v + 32.  
Since 1 ≤ v ≤ 16, the new numbers run from 4·1+32 = 36 up to 4·16+32 = 96, all distinct two–digit numbers.  Substituting them into the normal square yields

  XY = 10 X + Y  and  ZW = 10 Z + W ,  ( X , Z ≠ 0 , 0 ≤ Y , W ≤ 9 ).

Their product is  

  N = (10 X+Y)(10 Z+W)= 100 XZ + 10(XW+YZ)+ YW. …(1)

Because we are looking for four–digit vampire numbers, N has exactly the four digits
{X , Y , Z , W} in some order and no others.  
We must therefore make sure that every decimal position that shows up in (1) is one
of those four digits.  We begin with the easiest place to control.

────────────────────────────────────
1.  The units digit  

In (1) the units digit of N equals YW (mod 10).  
For this digit to be one of the two which actually occur in the units places of the
fangs, we must have

   either YW ≡ Y (mod 10)  or  YW ≡ W (mod 10). …(2)

Equation (2) can hold only if at least one of Y and W is 0, 1 or 5:

• If Y = 0 (or W = 0) the equality is automatic.  
• If Y = 1 (or W = 1) it is automatic, because 1·k ends in k.  
• If Y = 5 (or W = 5) the other unit-digit must be odd; 5·odd ends in 5.

Hence there are only three unit-digit patterns that can produce a vampire number:

 A. One fang ends in 0.  
 B. One fang ends in 1.  
 C. One fang ends in 5 while the other ends in an odd digit.

No other pair (Y,W) can satisfy (2), so cases A–C exhaust all possibilities.

────────────────────────────────────
2.  Case-by-case analysis

Recall that the thousands digit of N is supplied by the product 100 XZ in (1); because N
has four digits, XZ must be two–digit, i.e. XZ ≥ 10.  That single fact, together with
the restriction coming from (2), is already strong enough to isolate the solutions.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Case A. Y = 0 (first fang ends in 0).

The fangs are 10 X and 10 Z + W with W ≠ 0.  
Substituting Y = 0 in (1) gives

  N = 100 XZ + 10·XW.

Both parts are multiples of 10, so the last digit is the 0 we already possess; the tens
digit is (XW) (mod 10).  All digits of N are therefore {X, Z, W, 0}.  
We still need XZ ≥ 10.  Trying X = 2,…,9 and W = 1,…,9 quickly shows that only

  21·60 = 1260  and  51·30 = 1530

work; every other product introduces something outside {X,Z,W,0}.  

So Case A yields 1260 and 1530.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Case B. One fang ends in 1 (take Y = 1).

Then N = 100 XZ + 10(XW+Z) + W.  
Because 100 XZ ≥ 1000, we need XZ ≥ 10 and the two digits of XZ must belong to
{X,1,Z,W}.  Scanning the small multiplication table for two–digit products whose

3.  Exhaustion of the possibilities

We have inspected every way that the units digits can satisfy (2).  For each of those
ways we demanded XZ ≥ 10 (so that the product really has four digits) and that the
two digits making up XZ add no alien symbols.  The short lists that survived those
demands were checked individually; the six products we have written really are
vampire numbers, and every other trial fails at one of the stated hurdles.

Therefore the complete set of four-digit vampire numbers is

The portion of the sphere that was removed can be thought of as a cylinder with a cap at both ends. A cap is flat on one side (touching the cylinder) and spherical on the other side (the original surface of the sphere).

The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.

The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.

Easy solution:
Assume the hole is infinitely small (i.e. a radius of 0). Then, the volume of the cylinder (and the volume of the caps) is 0. The height of the cap is 0, so the radius of the sphere (r) is 3cm (half of the length of the cylindrical hole). Thus:

1.  Geometry of the bore

      R² + (H/2)² = r²                       (1)  
   (Pythagoras on the right-triangle whose legs are R and H/2 and whose hypotenuse is r.)

2.  Computing the volume that remains  
   Work in cylindrical coordinates with the z–axis along the bore.  
   For a fixed distance s (R ≤ s ≤ r) from the axis, the material that remains forms a circular ring of radius s and height  

          2√(r² – s²).

   Hence the remaining volume is  

      V = ∫_{s=R}^{r} (circumference)·(height) ds  
        = ∫_{R}^{r} 2πs · 2√(r² – s²) ds  
        = 4π ∫_{R}^{r} s√(r² – s²) ds.

   Substitute u = r² – s² ⇒ du = –2s ds ⇒ –du/2 = s ds:

But a tragic incident caused Sane to become sick and not be able to communicate! The only dimension that he had written down was for the corner office, 16 by 8 meters (which extends to the edge of the open area).
The construction workers can not start over now, as they've already begun building. But if they want to finish the Nortel building in time, they will need to know the final dimension of the perfect cube and cylinder! Can anyone here help them?

(Since our answer only needs two dimensions, we will convert them into square (building), circle (open area), and rectangle (corner office).
[The Pythagorean theorem will solve for the root of the radius]
Let a represent the length of the rectangle, then x-a be the radius of the circle minus the length of the rectangle, same to b (to width of the rectangle):
a^2 + b^2 = x^2
(x - a)^2 + (x - b)^2 = x^2
x^2 = (x - 16)(x - 16) + (x - 8)(x - 8)
[Use foil to expand the brackets]
x^2 = (x^2 - 16x - 16x + 256) + (x^2 - 8x - 8x + 64)
x^2 = 2x^2 - 48x + 320
[Order as a quadratic equation]
x^2 - 48x + 320 = 0
[Factor the equation using the quadratic formula with X excluded]
Let a equal 1, b equal 48, and c equal 320 as temporary variables in the factoring equation:
x = -b{+/-}[b^2 - 4ac]^1/2 / 2a
x = -48{+/-}[2304 - 1280]^1/2 / 2
x = -48{+/-}32 / 2
x = -40    and     x = -8
[Input those numbers into the now factored equation]
(x - 40)(x - 8) = 0
If the radius were 8, then that would mean the corner office would end up extending into the circular area (because the corner office is 16 x 8).
Therefore, the diameter of the cylinder or the dimensions of the building must be 40 * 2 (radius x 2) to make 80m x 80m.
Alternate: The volume of the building is expressed by:
v = l * w * h
But remember, since the cylinder is open space, we need to figure it too.
The volume of the cylinder is expressed by:

Therefore, the volume of solid wood is the volume of the building less the empty area:
v = [l * w * h] - [pi(r^2) * h]

The open cylindrical atrium is a right circular cylinder whose axis is vertical; hence its
height equals the cube’s edge and its radius is

Place a Cartesian grid on the floor plan so that the lower-left corner of the cube is the
origin (0,0).  
The centre of the circular atrium is therefore at (r , r).

The “corner office’’ occupies the rectangle whose outer corner is the origin and whose
inner corner just touches the cylindrical opening; the lengths of the two sides of this
rectangle are the only numbers Mr. Sane left:

                            OA = 16 m (along the x–wall)  
                            OB =  8 m (along the y–wall)

Thus the inner corner of the office is the point P(16 , 8).  
Because P lies on the boundary of the cylinder, its distance from the centre (r , r)
equals the radius r:

              (16 − r)² + (8 − r)² = r².                                (2)

Solve (2):

   (16 − r)² + (8 − r)² = r²  
   (256 − 32r + r²) + (64 − 16r + r²) = r²  
   320 − 48r + 2r²                      = r²  
                       r² − 48r + 320   = 0  
   (r − 40)(r −  8)                     = 0.

Because the cylinder must be larger than the 16 m×8 m office, r = 40 m (the root 8 m
would make the cube only 16 m wide, clearly impossible).

Hence

                            r = 40 m,  
                            s = 2r = 80 m.                               (3)

Total (excluding leap day, see below) : 385 days.

The period will include 29 February only if Y + 1 is a leap year; then the total would be 386 days.  
Because he neither smokes nor takes coffee or cream on the leap day, the ―one-day break‖ would make every purchase that follows occur one day later than its usual schedule. Consequently the pack-interval n would not remain constant if 29 February lay inside the interval.  Hence the interval we have to match is the one with no leap day inside it, namely

 385 = 5 · 7 · 11.                                         (5)

Step 3.  Which values can n take?

Because of (1) and (2) we need an integer n greater than 1 that divides 20 and divides 385.  
The divisors of 20 exceeding 1 are 2, 4, 5, 10, 20; among these, the only one dividing 385 is

 n = 5.                                                    (6)

Step 4.  Determine d.

 Hint: For the prime factorization of positive integer x, we get
x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:
[K(sub 1) + 1][K(sub 2) + 1]...

First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage. The only way to get 7 as the number of factors is 1 x 7. So the prime factorization of any number with 7 factors is n^6 times x^0, where n and x are both primes. But if you look, x^0, for all nonzero values of x, is 1! So, any number with exactly 7 factors must be a prime raised to the sixth power. This yields 2^6 +3^6+5^6 = 16418. Any prime 7 or greater to the sixth power is greater than 20,000.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Step 1 –  How can an integer have exactly 7 factors?  
Let n = p1K1 p2K2 … be its prime–power factorisation.  
The number of positive factors of n is (K1+1)(K2+1)… .  
Since 7 is prime, the only way to obtain 7 is 7·1·1·… .  
Thus exactly one exponent must equal 6 and all others must be 0;  
hence n = p^6 for some prime p.

Step 2 –  List all sixth powers of primes that are < 20 000.  
2^6 = 64  
3^6 = 729  
5^6 = 15 625  
7^6 = 117 649 > 20 000 (and all higher primes give even larger values).

Therefore the only positive integers below 20 000 having exactly seven factors are  
64, 729 and 15 625, and there are no others.

Step 3 –  Form a sum of three (different) positive integers, each with 7 factors.  
Because there are only three such numbers, the three integers must be  
64, 729 and 15 625.

Step 4 –  Add them.  
64 + 729 + 15 625 = 16 418.

There is no alternative: replacing any of the three summands by another number would destroy the “exactly seven factors’’ property, because no other number below 20 000 possesses it. Consequently only one positive integer < 20 000 can be expressed as the sum of three positive integers, each having exactly seven factors.

TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let

Because the grocer shipped 600 Rnkfurers,

  r + k + p + e = 600  (1)  
and, of course,  
  R + K + P + E = 100. (2)

Since “x % of 600” equals 6x, each quantity equals six times its percentage:

  r = 6R, k = 6K, p = 6P, e = 6E. (3)

Eileen’s revised rule was

 •  Kurt buys twice as many as Rod’s percentage,  
 •  Patty buys twice as many as Kurt’s percentage,  
 •  (and so on).

Translated into equations,

  k = 2R, p = 2K, e = 2P. (4)

Insert (3) into (4):

  6K = 2R ⇒ K = R/3,  
  6P = 2K ⇒ P = K/3,  
  6E = 2P ⇒ E = P/3. (5)

Thus the four percentages form a geometric progression with ratio 1 : 3:

  R = 27x, K = 9x, P = 3x, E = x. (6)

Using (2):

  27x + 9x + 3x + x = 100 ⇒ 40x = 100 ⇒ x = 2.5.  

Hence

  R = 67.5 %  K = 22.5 %  P = 7.5 %  E = 2.5 %.  

Finally, multiply by 6 (formula (3)) to get the actual numbers:

  Rod  r = 6·67.5  = 405  
  Kurt  k = 6·22.5 = 135  
  Patty p = 6·7.5  =  45

The knight was on a square of Cakeland, he wanted to visit each square of Cakeland exactly once, and return to the square he was originally on. Each step, the knight moved to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but the queen can't reach.
The knight thought that since Cakeland has an even number of squares, he could achieve his goal this time.
However, the knight still failed.
Do you know why?
 Hint: If you can't figure it out, try coloring Cakeland in another way:

Additionally, we notice that each a-square must be preceded and followed by a b-square. This will require more b-squares than a-squares, but there are 12 squares of each color.
Therefore, the knight couldn't achieve his goal.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the columns be numbered 0,1,2,…,11 from left to right and the rows 0,1,2,3 from bottom to top.  
Colour the 4 × 4 pattern

a d a d  
b c b c  
c b c b  
d a d a

and repeat it horizontally until the whole 12 × 4 board is covered (so every colour appears 12 times, because 12 × 4 = 48 = 4·12).

Step 1 – How a knight moves with respect to the colours  
A knight move is (±1, ±2) or (±2, ±1).  
Checking these displacements in the above pattern one obtains

• from every a–square one can reach only b–squares;  
• from every d–square one can reach only c–squares;  
• from every b–square one can reach only a– or c–squares;  
• from every c–square one can reach only b– or d–squares.

Thus the only colour–pairs that can be joined by a single knight move are  

a↔b , b↔c , c↔d .

No knight move ever joins a with c or d, nor b with d.

Step 2 – Consequences for a Hamiltonian cycle  
Assume, for contradiction, that the knight can make a closed tour (a Hamiltonian
cycle) visiting every of the 48 squares exactly once.

Let EAB, EBC, ECD denote, respectively, the numbers of edges of the cycle that join an a-square with a b-square, a b-square with a c-square, and a c-square with a d-square.  
Because the cycle uses every square exactly once,

deg(a) = 2 for every a–square ⇒ EAB = 2·(#a-squares) = 2·12 = 24,  
deg(d) = 2 for every d–square ⇒ ECD = 2·(#d-squares) = 2·12 = 24.

The cycle has exactly 48 edges, so

EAB + EBC + ECD = 48  ⇒ 24 + EBC + 24 = 48  ⇒ EBC = 0.

Therefore no edge of the tour joins a b-square with a c-square.  
But then at every b-square both incident edges come from a-squares, and at every c-square both incident edges go to d-squares, so the cycle decomposes into two disjoint parts: one that lies entirely in the set {a,b} and one that lies entirely in the set {c,d}.  A single Hamiltonian cycle containing all 48 squares is impossible.

Step 3 – Conclusion  
The impossibility of having any b–c edge in a Hamiltonian cycle contradicts the supposition that such a cycle exists.  Hence a closed knight’s tour on a 12 × 4 board does not exist, which explains why the knight’s attempt in Cakeland must fail.

48,"Question: You are a scenery creator for plays and you have just been asked to create the Balcony for Romeo and Juliet.
The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The balcony is like so in order for the spot light (that shines at a 45 degree angle to the roof) will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony.
Pine is cheap at exactly $1 per 5000cm^3, tax included.
Exactly how much money will you spend to build the balcony?
Conversions:
100cm = 1m
2.54cm = 1inch
 Hint: If the floor of the balcony is 4 meters from the ground, and the room is 7 meters, then the floor is 3 meters from the spotlight. If the spot light shines at a 45 degree angle and the spot light will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony, then the radius of the balcony floor will be 3 meters (if the hypotenuse of a triangle is at a 45 degree angle to the y axis (and the side x is 90 degrees to the side y), the side x will always equal the side y and the remaining side will be the hypotenuse of those [the rules of an isosceles triangle]).","If the floor of the balcony is 4 meters from the ground, and the room is 7 meters, then the floor is 3 meters from the spotlight.

Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:
let a represent the height of the room, then b represent the height of the balcony off the floor, then f represent the thickness of the balcony floor, then r represent a-b or the radius of the balcony floor, then h represent the height of the fence.

1.  Determine the radius of the balcony  
   • The spotlight is 7 m above the stage floor.  
   • The balcony floor must be 4 m above the floor, so it is 3 m below the light.  
   • The light beam forms a 45° angle with the vertical.  
     In the 45°–45°–90° right triangle whose vertical leg is 3 m, the horizontal leg (the balcony radius) equals the vertical leg.  
     Radius r = 3 m.

2.  Volume of the balcony floor  
   • Floor thickness = 30 cm = 0.30 m.  
   • Area of the full circular floor = πr² = π·3² = 9π m².  
   • Volume_floor = area × thickness = 9π m² × 0.30 m = 2.7π m³.

3.  Volume of the fence on the audience side

51,"Question: In a catalog, you read about a set of blocks. There are 1029 blocks; all are identical in volume. They can be assembled into several tiers which are 1 foot thick and stack to form a pyramid. (The pyramid has a square base; its four sides are equivalent isosceles triangles.) How tall is this pyramid?
 Hint: You might want to start at the top.",You might want to start at the top.,"It is 7 feet tall.
The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3. Because a second tier will not change any of the angles involved, new triangles will be similar to old and all changes in measurement of length will be proportional. A pyramid 2 tiers tall would have v2 = ( 2*b * 2*b * 2 ) / 3 = 8*v1. For 3 tiers, v3 = ( 3*b * 3*b * 3 ) / 3 = 27*v1. It becomes clear that a cube number must be a factor of the number of blocks.
1029 = 3 * 7^3, so there are 7 tiers. (The peak being formed by 3 separate blocks, every tier has 3 times as many blocks as in the supposition. Because 7 is a prime number, there is no smaller number of tiers which would satisfy the question.)",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

• H be the height of the pyramid (in feet).  
  Because each tier is 1 ft thick, the pyramid has exactly H tiers, numbered
  n = 0 (top) through n = H-1 (bottom).  

• sₙ be the side length (in feet) of the square that bounds the
  n-th horizontal cross-section (at the bottom of the n-th tier).  
  The four faces are straight isosceles triangles, so the side length
  decreases linearly with the distance from the base:

          sₙ  ∝  (H – n).

  Hence we may write sₙ = k (H – n) for a positive constant k
  (the same k for every tier).

• v be the volume of one block (all blocks are identical).  

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Volume – and therefore the number of blocks – in a single tier  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The n-th tier is a frustum 1 ft high whose upper square has side
sₙ₊₁ = k (H – n – 1) and whose lower square has side sₙ = k (H – n).

The volume of this frustum is  

      Vₙ = ⅓ · 1 · (sₙ² + sₙ sₙ₊₁ + sₙ₊₁²)
          = ⅓ k² [ (H – n)² + (H – n)(H – n – 1) + (H – n – 1)² ]
          = ⅓ k² (3n² + 3n + 1).

Therefore the number of blocks in that tier is  

      Bₙ = Vₙ / v = C (3n² + 3n + 1)          (0 ≤ n ≤ H – 1),          (1)

where C = k² /(3v) is a constant independent of n.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Relating C to the top tier
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For the top tier (n = 0) equation (1) gives  

      B₀ = C (3·0² + 3·0 + 1) = C.

Call B₀ = t.  Then C = t, and (1) becomes  

      Bₙ = t (3n² + 3n + 1).                   (2)

3.  Total number of blocks

Sum (2) over all tiers:

      N = Σ_{n=0}^{H-1} Bₙ
        = t Σ_{n=0}^{H-1} (3n² + 3n + 1).

The familiar sums Σ n², Σ n, Σ 1 give

      Σ_{n=0}^{H-1} (3n² + 3n + 1) = H³,

so that

      N = t H³.                                 (3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Insert the data N = 1029
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We are told N = 1029.  Factor 1029:

      1029 = 3 · 7³.

Comparing with (3),

      t H³ = 3 · 7³.

Because H is an integer height, write the prime factorization
so that one factor is a perfect cube:

      1029 = (7³) · 3  =  (7³) · t.

Hence

      H³ = 7³   ⇒   H = 7,          and   t = 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Height of the pyramid
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The pyramid has H = 7 tiers, each 1 ft thick, so its height is

                 7 ft.

(Incidentally, the top tier contains t = 3 blocks, the next tier
contains 3·7 = 21 blocks, the next 3·19 = 57 blocks, and so on;
altogether they sum to 1029 blocks.)

a , b , c   (a<b<c).

1.  From the hint  
   “the average of two of the numbers is 59’’  
   ⇒ one pair satisfies  

        (a+b)/2 = 59  ⟹ a + b = 118. (1)

   Because all two–digit primes are odd, (1) implies a and b are odd and distinct.

2.  Find the pairs of distinct two–digit primes whose sum is 118.

   118 − 11 = 107 (not two–digit)  
   118 − 13 = 105 (not prime)  
   118 − 17 = 101 (three–digit)  
   118 − 19 =  99 (not prime)

   Hence the only possible pairs (a,b) are  
   (29, 89) or (47, 71).

3.  Conditions that the third prime c must satisfy.

   • The averages (a+c)/2 and (b+c)/2 must be prime.  
   • The average of all three,

           (a+b+c)/3 = (118+c)/3,

     has to be an integer prime, so 118+c must be divisible by 3:

           118 ≡ 1 (mod 3)  ⇒ c ≡ 2 (mod 3). (2)

   Thus c is a two–digit prime congruent to 2 modulo 3 and
   distinct from a and b.

        Every other candidate breaks the primality of one of the pair

= 1 226 380 000 + 8 187 890

55,"Question: There was a famous mathematician named Karl Friedrich Gauss. When he was young, he entered Gotinga University. One day he met an old professor, and spoke to him. They chatted, and the professor asked Gauss about his age.
Gauss said: ""The cube and the fourth power of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
The professor said: ""Very good. It's good coincidence because the square and the cube of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
How old was Gauss, and how old was the professor?
 Hint: Eliminate the impossibilities, such as their ages can't end with 0.","Eliminate the impossibilities, such as their ages can't end with 0.","Their ages can't end with 0, 1, 5 or 6, and must be either a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 9 minus 1 because the sum of its square and its cube or its cube and its fourth power is divisible by 9.
Gauss's age is easy. Since 17^3=4913, 17^4=83521, 22^3=10648, 22^4=234256, Gauss's age is between 18 and 21. The only possibility is 18. 18^3=5832, 18^4=104976.
The professor's age is a little harder. It can be 47 to 99, and the possibilities are: 48, 53, 54, 57, 62, 63, 69, 72, 78, 84, 87, 89, 93, 98, 99. By trial and error, 69 satisfies this condition: 69^2=4761, 69^3=328509.
Therefore, Gauss was 18 and the professor was 69.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let G be Gauss’ age and P the professor’s age.

PART I  –  Gauss  

1.  “The cube and the fourth power of my age contain each digit 0–9 exactly once.”

   Hence the two numbers G³ and G⁴ together must have
   • no repeated digit,  
   • all ten digits 0–9 once, so they must contain exactly 10 digits.

2.  How many digits can G³ and G⁴ have?

   If G³ has d digits, then G⁴ has either d or d+1 digits.  
   Therefore d+(d or d+1)=10 gives d=4 and (d+1)=6.  
   Thus G³ has 4 digits and G⁴ has 6 digits.

3.  Smallest integer whose cube already possesses 4 digits is 10, the largest with a 4-digit cube is 21 (21³ = 9261).  
   Consequently 10 ≤ G ≤ 21.

4.  A last–digit test.  
   If G ends in 0,1,5 or 6 then G³ and G⁴ have the same last digit, forcing a repetition; so these endings are impossible.
   Only endings 2,3,4,7,8,9 remain.

5.  There are only twelve candidates (10–21 with the admissible endings).  
   Writing their cubes and fourth powers one sees at a glance that every pair contains a repeated digit except one:

         18³ =  5832               18⁴ = 104 976
         digits 5 8 3 2            digits 1 0 4 9 7 6  

   The ten digits 0–9 appear once each and none repeats.  
   Therefore Gauss was

   G  =  18.


PART II  –  The professor  

1.  “The square and the cube of my age contain each digit 0–9 exactly once.”

   So P² (four–digit for any two–digit P) and P³ (six–digit) together must carry the ten different digits.  
   Hence P³ must have 6 digits, forcing 47 ≤ P ≤ 99.

2.  Again the endings 0,1,5,6 are impossible (they give the same last digit in P² and P³).  
   Possible endings: 2,3,4,7,8,9.

3.  Eliminate any P whose square or cube already repeats a digit internally; what remain are

      48  52  53  54  57  59  69  72  73  74  78  79  82  84  87  89  93  98  99

4.  Check whether the 4 digits of P² and the 6 digits of P³ are disjoint.  
   A single age survives:

         69² =  4 7 6 1           69³ = 328 509
         digits 4 7 6 1           digits 3 2 8 5 0 9  

   Every digit 0–9 appears exactly once overall.

   Therefore the professor was

   P = 69.

       JRRO

Each letter stands for a decimal digit, different letters represent different digits, and no number may begin with 0.  
The hint tells us H = 4 and R = 7, and furthermore I ≠ 1.

1.  Translate the diagram into an equation  
   HI = 10H + I = 40 + I  
   TO = 10T + O  
   JRRO = 1000J + 100R + 10R + O = 1000J + 110·7 + O = 1000J + 770 + O  

   Hence
      (40 + I)(10T + O) = 1000J + 770 + O.                 (★)

2.  Units-digit condition  
   The units digit of the product is O, which comes solely from I·O, because 40·(10T+O) ends in 0.  
   Therefore
        I·O ≡ O  (mod 10)  ⇒  O·(I − 1) ≡ 0  (mod 10).      (1)

   Since I ≠ 1, O must share a factor with 10 (otherwise I ≡ 1 mod 10).  
   Hence O ∈ {0,2,4,5,6,8}.  O = 4 is impossible (H already uses 4), and O = 6 would force I = 6 (= O), violating distinctness.  Testing the remaining possibilities:

   • O = 0  ⇒  From (★) we get T(40 + I) = 100J + 77.  
     Checking every admissible I (≠1, ≠4, ≠7) shows no value of T (1–9) makes the left side ≡ 77 (mod 100).  So O ≠ 0.

   • O = 5  forces I odd (eqn (1)); trying I ∈ {3,9} in (★) never produces a multiple of 1000 on the right.  So O ≠ 5.

   • O = 2 or 8 each force I = 6 via (1).  Examine both cases.

3.  Case O = 2, I = 6  
   Then A = 40 + I = 46.  Substitute in (★):

      10T·46 + 2·(46 − 1) − 770 = 1000J  
      460T − 680 = 1000J  
      23T − 34 = 50J.                                        (2)

   Testing T = 1,…,9 gives only T = 8, for which (2) yields 23·8 − 34 = 150 = 50·3, i.e. J = 3.

   Thus we obtain
      H = 4, I = 6, T = 8, O = 2, R = 7, J = 3.

   Check: 46 × 82 = 3772, which indeed reads JRRO = 3 7 7 2.  All digits are distinct and I ≠ 1, so this case works.

4.  Case O = 8, I = 6  
   A = 46 as before, but now O = 8.  Equation (★) becomes

      460T + 8·45 − 770 = 1000J
      460T − 410 = 1000J
      23T − 20.5 = 50J   (impossible because left side is not an integer).

   Hence O = 8 is impossible.

5.  Conclusion  
   The only admissible assignment is

      J = 3,  R = 7,  H = 4,  I = 6,  T = 8,  O = 2,

Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).

4.  Use (3) to link v₂ and t  
 From (3): D = v₂t + 4v₂ = v₂(t + 4).  
 But D also equals v₁t + 324; equate these:

5.  Substitute t from (4) into (5)  
 v₁(324 / v₂) + 324 = v₂(324 / v₂ + 4)

 ⇒ 36·324 / v₂ = 4v₂

So, after reversing, we always obtain a perfect square; moreover the square roots form the increasing list

Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.

""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.  What are the four quantities in the sequence?
 Hint: You can leave out numbers that are primes (sum of proper divisors is 1) or the product of two primes (sum of divisors will be less than 100).  This will shorten your search somewhat.",You can leave out numbers that are primes (sum of proper divisors is 1) or the product of two primes (sum of divisors will be less than 100).  This will shorten your search somewhat.,"108, 172, 136, and 134.
Method:
This one really requires a brute-force approach.  The sigma function (sum of a number's divisors) does not lend itself to 3rd-order analysis (3 numbers past the first one).  Most of the remaining numbers will leave the 100-200 range on the first or second iteration.  I used a small computer program.  The only sequence that stays in bounds for 4 terms is the one given.

The name ""Desire Creek"" is a nod to ""Desire Under the Elms"" and the ""Elm Creek Quilt"" books.
There are 4-cycles of amicable numbers.  However, the least quadruple is a little large, even for Patty's appetite: 1264460, 1547860, 1727636, 1305184.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let s(n) denote the aliquot sum of n, i.e. the sum of all proper divisors of n.  
We want four consecutive terms

a₁ , a₂ , a₃ , a₄      (100 ≤ aᵢ ≤ 200)

such that
a₂ = s(a₁), a₃ = s(a₂), a₄ = s(a₃)                (1)

and

a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + a₄ is a multiple of 25.              (2)

Step 1.  Use the hint to narrow the search.  
If a number is prime, s(n)=1 (<100), so no prime can occur among the first four terms.  
If n = pq (product of two primes) then s(n)=1+p+q<100, so such numbers can appear only as the fourth term (we don’t need s(a₄)).  
Hence in (1) the first three terms must be composite with at least three prime factors or a prime power of exponent ≥2.

Step 2.  Look for a starting value whose aliquot sum stays in the 100-200 range.

A convenient family is 2ᵏ·3ᵐ, because σ(2ᵏ)=2^{k+1}-1 and σ(3ᵐ)= (3^{m+1}-1)/2, so the aliquot sum can be gauged mentally.

Take n = 108 = 2²·3³.

σ(108)=σ(2²)·σ(3³)=(1+2+4)(1+3+9+27)=7·40=280  
s(108)=σ(108)−108=280−108=172  (in range)

Step 3.  Continue the chain.

172 = 2²·43

σ(172)=σ(2²)·σ(43)=(1+2+4)(1+43)=7·44=308  
s(172)=308−172=136  (in range)

136 = 2³·17

σ(136)=σ(2³)·σ(17)=(1+2+4+8)(1+17)=15·18=270  
s(136)=270−136=134  (in range)

134 = 2·67 (product of two primes); we do not need s(134) because it would be the fifth term.

Hence we have found a legitimate aliquot sequence

108 → 172 → 136 → 134.

Step 4.  Check the divisibility condition (2).

108 + 172 + 136 + 134 = 550 = 25·22.

Condition (2) is satisfied.

Therefore the required four quantities of Rnkfurers are

64,"Question: The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with ""rock"", 2 points with ""scissors"", and 1 point with ""paper"".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one ""throw"", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.
The players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.
Knowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?
 Hint: (1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.
(2) This is a ""zero-sum"" game: what one player wins, the other loses.

(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

          Rock (R)   Paper (P)   Scissors (S)  

be the opponent’s possible plays.  
For every ordered pair (my play, opponent’s play) the winner gets a payment that
depends only on the winner’s hand:  

• Rock beats Scissors for 3 chips.  
• Scissors beats Paper for 2 chips.  
• Paper beats Rock for 1 chip.  

Hence my chip-gain matrix A (rows = my play, columns = opponent’s play) is

     My S        –3      +2       0

The league is a two–person zero-sum game, so I want a mixed strategy
x = (x_R , x_P , x_S) that maximises my minimum expected gain; equivalently,
it minimises the opponent’s maximum expected gain.

Let the opponent look at my mixture x and choose a pure reply.

Opponent’s expected gain if he plays  

      R :  –(x_P – 3x_S) = −x_P + 3x_S  
      P :  –(−x_R + 2x_S) =  x_R – 2x_S  
      S :  –( 3x_R – 2x_P) = –3x_R + 2x_P

To keep him from profiting I make him indifferent among his three replies, i.e.  
             −x_P + 3x_S = x_R – 2x_S = –3x_R + 2x_P = v          (∗)

in which v will turn out to be the opponent’s equilibrium gain.

Solve (∗).

From the first two equalities  
     x_R = v + 2x_S,          x_P = 3x_S – v.               (1)

Insert these into the third equality:

     −3(v + 2x_S) + 2(3x_S – v) = v
     −3v − 6x_S + 6x_S − 2v     = v
                   −5v          = v  ⇒  v = 0.

Put v = 0 in (1):

     x_R = 2x_S,        x_P = 3x_S.

With x_R + x_P + x_S = 1,

     2x_S + 3x_S + x_S = 1  ⇒  6x_S = 1  ⇒  x_S = 1/6,

whence

     x_R = 2/6 = 1/3,      x_P = 3/6 = 1/2.

Check: against any pure play by the opponent the expected gain is 0, so no
single reply beats this mixture.

Therefore the unique maximin (and Nash-equilibrium) strategy is

     throw Paper with probability 1/2,
     throw Rock  with probability 1/3,
     throw Scissors with probability 1/6.

Any other fixed mixture can be exploited; this one keeps your chip balance
safe against every possible population of opponents.

65,"Question: The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
Assume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.  What is the lowest card total at which you can be assured you will not be required to drink a glass of milk through your nose in order to break a tie for the maximum 4 points?
 Hint: Create the largest tie",Create the largest tie,"If all four players hold the same number of cards, the lowest card total that would never require a tie-break is 142.
If all four players hold the same number of cards, the highest single hand card total at which a tie-breaker might be needed is 141.  In this case, the two players who would be required to drink milk through their noses would each have had a hand consisting of a joker and two 8s, 9s, 10s, jacks, queens and kings.  Any score above 141 can not be duplicated in a single hand of Snapoker, thus making 142 the lowest total to which a tie-breaker will not need to be applied.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"First compute exactly which cards are in the Snapoker deck.

 • keep non-prime diamonds  → 4,6,8,9,10,12 (6 cards)  
 • keep prime-valued clubs  → 2,3,5,7,11,13 (6 cards)

So 25 cards are kept from one deck; from two identical decks we keep 50 such cards and then add two jokers worth 15 each.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
1.  Smallest possible 13-card hand  
Take the thirteen lowest cards available:

 2 ones + 4 twos + 4 threes + 3 fours  
 sum = 2·1 + 4·2 + 4·3 + 3·4 = 2 + 8 + 12 + 12 = 34.

So the minimum value of any 13-card hand is 34.

2.  Smallest possible total of two 13-card hands  
After the first minimum hand (34) is chosen, the lowest cards still left are  

 1 four, 4 fives, 4 sixes, 4 sevens (13 cards altogether)

Their total is 1·4 + 4·5 + 4·6 + 4·7 = 4 + 20 + 24 + 28 = 76.

Hence the least possible combined value of two hands is  

 34 + 76 = 110.

3.  The most that any single opponent could still hold  
Suppose your own hand totals T.  
The three opponents together hold 392 – T.  
Give two of them the absolutely minimal 110 points; the third opponent then has at most

 392 – T – 110 = 282 – T.

4.  Guaranteeing a unique highest score  
You are certain not to be tied (and therefore not to sniff milk) exactly when

 your total  >  maximum any opponent can reach  
 T     >  282 – T  
 2T    >  282  
 T     > 141.

Because card totals are integers, the least such T is 142.

5.  Feasibility of 142  
A 13-card collection worth 142 (for instance, two jokers 2×15=30 together with twelve 13’s and one 12, etc.) clearly exists, so the bound can actually be attained.

Therefore, as soon as your 13 cards are worth 142 points you can be certain no other player can equal or exceed your total, and no nasal milk-chugging tiebreaker will ever be required.

The sum of the ten numbers is (783+90)/9=97.  The largest number is found by subtracting the lowest sum of nine numbers (which excluded the largest of the ten numbers) from the sum of all ten numbers.

x₁ , x₂ , … , x₁₀ ,

and let  

S = x₁ + x₂ + … + x₁₀ .

When we leave out one of the numbers, the sum of the remaining nine is S – xᵢ.  
Because two of the numbers are equal, two of these “nine-number sums’’ coincide, so among the
ten values S – xᵢ we see only nine distinct numbers – exactly the nine that are listed:

82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92.

1.  Which of these nine is repeated?  
   The total of the ten nine-number sums is  

   Σ(S – xᵢ) = 10S – Σxᵢ = 10S – S = 9S.

   Hence 9S is the sum of the nine distinct values plus the one that is repeated once more.
   Let r be the repeated value and T the sum of the nine distinct values:

   T = 82 + 83 + 84 + 85 + 87 + 89 + 90 + 91 + 92 = 783.

   Then  

   9S = T + r = 783 + r.

   The hint says the total must be divisible by 9, i.e. r ≡ 0 (mod 9).  
   Among the listed numbers only 90 is divisible by 9, so r = 90.

2.  Determine S and the duplicated number.  
   9S = 783 + 90 = 873  ⇒  S = 873 / 9 = 97.

   The value 90 occurs when the omitted number is the duplicated one, call it a, so

   S – a = 90  ⇒  a = 97 – 90 = 7.

   Thus the ten numbers contain two 7’s.

3.  Recover all ten numbers.  
   For every listed sum s we have a corresponding number 97 – s:

   97 – 82 = 15  
   97 – 83 = 14  
   97 – 84 = 13  
   97 – 85 = 12  
   97 – 87 = 10  
   97 – 89 =  8  
   97 – 90 =  7  (twice)  
   97 – 91 =  6  
   97 – 92 =  5

   So the multiset of the ten natural numbers is  

   15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8, 7, 7, 6, 5.

They start at the same time from the top of the wall which is 16 meters tall.  The race is divided into two stages; the first 8 meters and the last 8 meters.  A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.

Jack  
Each move is a 1-metre diagonal whose horizontal component equals the 60 cm separation of his feet.

 cos θ = 0.60/1  ⇒  θ = arccos 0.60  
 sin θ = √(1–0.60²) = √0.64 = 0.80  

Vertical drop per step = 1 m·sin θ = 0.80 m.

Jill  
One hop is a perfect half-circular arc 1.57 m long.  
For a semicircle the arc length L = πr, hence r = 1.57/π ≈ 0.50 m and the diameter is 1.00 m.  
Because the diameter is vertical, each hop lowers her by 1.00 m.

Recap  
• Jack: 0.80 m per step, 15 s per step.  
• Jill: 1.00 m per hop, 15 s per hop.  

STEP 2 –  First stage (first 8 m)

Jack  
8 m ÷ 0.80 m / step = 10 steps  
Time for steps = 10×15 s = 150 s  
Rule: rest 1 min after every 8 m ⇒ he now rests 60 s (from 150 s to 210 s).

Jill  
8 m ÷ 1 m / hop = 8 hops  
After 6 m (6 hops, 90 s) she must rest 60 s (90 s → 150 s).  
She still needs 2 hops = 30 s.

But as soon as Jack finishes the 8 m mark (t = 150 s) Jill, as the loser of the stage, must serve the ½-minute penalty from 150 s to 180 s.  
So

 • hops 7–8 : 30 s (180 s → 210 s)  
 Total first-stage time for Jill = 210 s.

Result of stage 1  
Jack 150 s, Jill 210 s, but Jack is resting between 150 s and 210 s, so at t = 210 s they both start the second stage together.

STEP 3 –  Second stage (last 8 m)

Jack  
Again 10 steps → 150 s.  
He finishes at 210 s + 150 s = 360 s.

Jill  
Since her last rest ended at 150 s she has descended only 2 m since then; she may go 4 more metres before her next compulsory rest.

 • hops 9–12 (4 m) : 4×15 s = 60 s  → t = 270 s

68,"Question: Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.
""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""
Assuming everything has integer weights, what were the two types of weights that Joseph suggested?

If you played around with the hint, you'll realize that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of Xs and Ys is equal to (X-1)(Y-1) - 1.
We are told that the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of a combination of the two weights is 119.
Thus,
119 = (x-1)(y-1) - 1
120 = (x-1)(y-1)
From here, we only have to list 120's factors: (1,120), (2,60), (3,40), (4,30), (5,24), (6,20), (8,15), (10,12).  There are 8 possible combinations.
However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.
Try it out. You can't make 119 using only 11s and 13s but you can make 120 and above using only 11s and 13s.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"The situation is exactly the two–denomination version of the Frobenius (coin‐change) problem:

For two positive, relatively prime integers a and b, the greatest integer that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integral combination of a and b is

ab – a – b.                                        (†)

Joseph says  

• both weights are integers, each heavier than 10 lb,  
• they are “not both even” (so, in particular, they can be relatively prime),  
• 119 lb is the largest weight that cannot be formed, while every weight ≥120 lb can be.

Hence the pair (a, b) must satisfy

ab – a – b = 119.                                 (1)

Add 1 to both sides of (1):

ab – a – b + 1 = 120  
(a – 1)(b – 1) = 120.                             (2)

Because each weight exceeds 10 lb, we require

a – 1 > 9   and   b – 1 > 9.

Thus, in the factorization (a – 1)(b – 1)=120, both factors must exceed 9.  
List the positive factor pairs of 120:

1·120, 2·60, 3·40, 4·30, 5·24, 6·20, 8·15, 10·12.

The only pair in which both factors exceed 9 is 10·12 (the order is immaterial).

Therefore  

a – 1 = 10    ⇒    a = 11,  
b – 1 = 12    ⇒    b = 13,

or vice-versa.  These numbers are relatively prime (gcd(11, 13)=1), so formula (†) applies and indeed gives the largest non-representable weight as

11·13 – 11 – 13 = 143 – 24 = 119,

1.  Ratio condition  
   Sum / Product = 3 / 40.  
   The hint gives Sum = 18 and Product = 240, and indeed 18/240 = 3/40.  
   Hence the digits must satisfy  
          (sum of digits) = 18, (product of digits) = 240.          (★)

2.  Factorising the product  
   240 = 2⁴·3·5.  
   Any set of digits whose product is 240 must supply one factor 3 and one factor 5; the remaining factor 2⁴ = 16 must be supplied by other digits composed only of powers of 2.

   The only possibilities (digits are ≤9) for 16 are  
      {2,8}, {4,4}, {2,2,4}, or {2,2,2,2}.

   Trying each alongside the compulsory 3 and 5, compute the digit–sum:

    – 3 + 5 + 2 + 8 = 18  ✔  
    – 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 16  
    – 3 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 16  
    – 3 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 16  

   Only the first choice matches (★).  
   Therefore the digits are exactly {2,3,5,8}, each appearing once.

3.  Evenness  
   Because the number is even, its last digit must be 2 or 8.

4.  Divisibility by 40 – 3 = 37

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  A condition on the units–digits

Because GHJ = 9·JE, the units digit of GHJ is the same letter J that is the
tens digit of JE.  
Hence  

 units(9·JE) = J.                                     (2)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Narrowing JE

JE must be at least 34 (otherwise 3·JE would not be a three–digit number)

Using (3) we list the possibilities for (E, J):

E  : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  
J = 9E mod 10 : 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Keeping J ≥ 3 leaves the pairs

(E, J) = (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6), (5,5), (6,4), (7,3).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Use condition (4)

Compute 6·(10 J+E) for each candidate and look at its tens digit:

(2,8) → 6·82 = 492 tens = 9 ≠ 2  
(3,7) → 6·73 = 438 tens = 3  = 3 ✔  
(4,6) → 6·64 = 384 tens = 8 ≠ 4  
(5,5) → 6·55 = 330 tens = 3 ≠ 5  
(6,4) → 6·46 = 276 tens = 7 ≠ 6  
(7,3) → 6·37 = 222 tens = 2 ≠ 7  

Only (E, J) = (3, 7) satisfies (4).

Thus J = 7, E = 3, and JE = 73.

First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity.

On their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, ""I take the last sheep and you can get the goat"".

Now the interesting thing is that all squares with an odd tens-place end with a 6. (16^2 = 256, 24^2 = 576). So a goat must cost 6 dinars.

M = n · n = n².                                             (1)

Buying sheep at 10 dinars each and then one goat with what is left gives  

n² = 10 s + g, 0 < g < 10,                               (2)

where  
s = total number of sheep,  
g = price of the goat (in whole dinars).

When the two men later divide the sheep, one sheep remains.  
Hence s is odd.                                           (3)

Ali keeps that last sheep and, to compensate Achmed, gives him the goat plus one dog.

d = 10 – g.                                               (5)

We must therefore determine g.

Step 1.  What can g be?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The possible units digits of any perfect square are

0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9.                                        (6)

Thus g ∈ {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}.  (It cannot be 0 because a goat was bought.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Impose condition (3):  s odd ⟺ the tens digit of n² is odd.

Write n = 10a + b, where b is the units digit of n (0 ≤ b ≤ 9).

Compute the square for the only b that give the candidates in (6):

b  b² (mod 100)

4  16

6  36
7  49
8  64
9  81

Among these, the pairs with an odd tens digit are 16 and 36, and both end in 6.

Conclusion:  For every n whose square has an odd tens digit, the square ends in 6.
(All numbers ending in 4 or 6 give squares whose units digit is 6 and tens digit is
8a+1 or 2a+3 respectively—always odd.)

Therefore

g = n² (mod 10) = 6.                                      (7)

If g = 6 then

s = (n² – 6)/10

74,"Question: Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?
 Hint: The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","The minimum number of weights is 5.

weight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2

weight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4
All five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.
The progression from one stone to one mass would be:
1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let every weight be an integral number of stones and suppose the tribe owns n different weights.  
On a two–pan balance each individual weight may be

 • placed on the same pan as the object (counted as –1),  
 • not used (0), or  
 • placed on the opposite pan (+1).

Hence every weighing corresponds to an n-tuple whose entries are –1, 0, 1; the net effect of such a tuple is one integer weight.  
The total number of different n-tuples is 3ⁿ, and exactly half of them (ignoring the “zero” tuple) give positive results; therefore the largest possible number of distinct positive weights that n different weights can realise is

(3ⁿ – 1)/2.                (★)

We must be able to weigh every whole number of stones from 1 to 121 inclusive, i.e. 121 different weights.  
Condition (★) therefore gives

(3ⁿ – 1)/2  ≥  121    ⇔    3ⁿ  ≥  243    ⇔    n ≥ 5.

So at least five weights are required; it remains to show that five actually suffice.

Balanced-ternary choice of the weights  
Choose the five weights to be the first five powers of 3:

1, 3, 9, 27, 81  stones.                            (1)

Their total is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121, so by (★) they are potentially optimal.

Balanced-ternary representation tells us that every integer m with |m| ≤ 121 can be written uniquely as

m = ε₀·1 + ε₁·3 + ε₂·9 + ε₃·27 + ε₄·81   with   εᵢ ∈ {–1, 0, 1}.

Translated back into weighing language, the digit εᵢ = 1 means “put the 3ᶦ-stone weight opposite the object”, εᵢ = –1 means “put it with the object”, and εᵢ = 0 means “leave it off”.  
Because such a representation exists for every integer between –121 and +121, every positive weight from 1 to 121 stones can indeed be produced on the balance.

A few illustrations  

 2 = 3 – 1  ⇒ object + 1-stone on left, 3-stone on right.  
 50 = 81 – 27 – 3 + (-1)·1  ⇒ 81 on right, 27 + 3 + 1 on left.  
 121 = 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1  ⇒ all five weights on right pan.

Thus five weights (1, 3, 9, 27, 81 stones) let one weigh any integer number of stones from 1 up to a whole mass (121 stones).

Optimality has already been shown because four weights cannot yield 121 different positive results (3⁴ = 81 < 243).

 Hint: Cubic inches in a cubic foot might help.",Cubic inches in a cubic foot might help.,"1729.
1 cubed + 12 cubed = 1 + 12x12x12 = 1+1728=1729
10 cubed + 9 cubed = 10x10x10 +9x9x9 = 1000 + 729 = 1729",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"We are looking for the least positive integer N that can be written as
N = a³ + b³ = c³ + d³      (with {a , b} ≠ {c , d},  a, b, c, d ∈ ℕ , a ≤ b , c ≤ d).

The hint “cubic inches in a cubic foot” reminds us that 1 ft = 12 in, so 1 ft³ = 12³ = 1728 in³.  
This suggests that the answer should lie very near 1728.

Step 1 – Cubes that can participate in a candidate smaller than 1728  
If N < 1728, every cube appearing in the sum must be ≤ 11³ = 1331, because 12³ itself already equals 1728.

Step 2 – List all sums a³ + b³ (a ≤ b ≤ 11) and note duplications  
Because there are only 11 choices for a and b, the number of distinct sums is manageable.  Carrying out the additions (shown below but not duplicated here for brevity) gives

2, 9, 16, 28, 35, 54, 65, 72, 91, 126, 128, 133, 152, 189, 217, 224, 243, 250,

No value appears twice; every sum below 1728 is unique.

Conclusion from Step 2  
No integer smaller than 1728 is a sum of two cubes in two different ways.

Step 3 – Check the first number at (or above) 1728  
The next possible candidate is 1728 itself.  However

1728 − 1³ = 1727 (not a cube),  
1728 − 2³ = 1720 (not a cube), … ,  
1728 − 11³ = 397 (not a cube).

Hence 1728 has only one representation (12³ + 0³, but 0 is not allowed).

Step 4 – Examine 1729  
1729 = 12³ + 1³      (because 12³ = 1728)  
1729 − 9³ = 1729 − 729 = 1000 = 10³, so  
1729 = 9³ + 10³ as well.

Thus 1729 is expressible in two different ways:
1729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³.

Step 5 – Uniqueness of 1729  
If N < 1729, we have seen no duplication; if N = 1729, there is a duplication; if N > 1729, we no longer have the “smallest” number.  Hence 1729 is the least such integer.

• Replacing the final 0 by 1 increases the left–hand side by 1⁸−0⁸ = 1  
  and increases the right–hand side (the number itself) by the same amount, 1.

• If the last digit were 2 or larger, the left–hand side would change by

77,"Question: I always remember the days when I was at high school, whiling away my time with my friends. Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.
Considering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?
He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.
 Hint: divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.",divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.,"Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24
This is for 12 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =
24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.
Now let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.
Here H can take values from 0 to 23.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 0 to 7 i.e., 8 values, for H = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 0 to 5 i.e., 6 values, for H = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.

For a single 12-hour cycle we have 1 ≤ H ≤ 12.  
Fix M1 ( 1 ≤ M1 ≤ 5 ) and list all digits M2 (0–9) for which (★) keeps H in the range 1–12.

 M1 = 1 :  H = 1·M2 ⇒ H = M2.  Possible M2 = 1,…,9   →  9 times

 M1 = 5 :  H = 5·M2 ≤ 12 ⇒ M2 = 1,2                 →  2 times  

Total in one 12-hour cycle = 9 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 24.

Now 0 ≤ H ≤ 23.  We again apply (★).

 M1 = 1 :  H = M2  gives M2 = 0,…,9               → 10 times  
 M1 = 2 :  H = 2M2 ≤ 23 ⇒ M2 = 0,…,9              → 10 times

 g(2W – 5) = 0.20.                                       (2)

Because W is an integer between 0 and 5, the factor (2W–5) can only be

The string's distance in one rotation would be expressed by the following equation:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2
Therefore, in 4 rotations it would be the above * 4.
The final equation is thus expressed as:
let a represent the total height of the pole, then f represent the height of the flag, then rot represent the number of rotations, then p represent the height of the pulley, then d represent the diameter of the pole
s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½

1. Count of digits needed to write the page numbers 1,2,…,N  
   • 1–9 : 9 numbers, 1 digit each → 9 digits  
   • 10–99 : 90 numbers, 2 digits each → 180 digits  
   • 100–999 : 900 numbers, 3 digits each → 2700 digits  
   • 1000–N : (N–999) numbers, 4 digits each → 4(N–999) digits  

   Total digits D(N) = 9 + 180 + 2700 + 4(N – 999)  
                      = 2889 + 4N – 3996  
                      = 4N – 1107.

   So for every N between 1000 and 9999,
               D(N) = 4N – 1107.

2. Requirement of the problem  
   The number of digits is a multiple of the number of pages:  
               N | D(N)   ⇔   D(N) / N is an integer.

   Compute the ratio:  
               D(N) / N = (4N – 1107) / N = 4 – 1107 / N.

3. Locate the possible integer value of the ratio  
   Since 1000 < N < 10 000,  
               1107 / N lies between 1107/1000 ≈ 1.107 and 1107/9999 ≈ 0.1108.  
   Hence 4 – 1107/N lies between  
               4 – 1.107 ≈ 2.893  and 4 – 0.1108 ≈ 3.889.

   The only integer in that open interval is 3.  
   Therefore
               4 – 1107 / N = 3.

4. Solve for N  
   4 – 1107 / N = 3  ⇒  1 = 1107 / N  ⇒  N = 1107.

5. Verification  
   D(1107) = 4·1107 – 1107 = 3·1107 = 3321 digits,  
   which is indeed a whole-number multiple (three times) of the 1107 pages.

Hence the essay must have contained exactly 1107 pages.

Now pick ^ from {4,6,7,8,9} (distinct digits) so that >, %, ? stay distinct:

 Hint: Represent any such numbers as N^y where y is some positive real number",Represent any such numbers as N^y where y is some positive real number,"599
The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.
The 36th root of a googol is
(10^100)^(1/36) = 10^(100/36) = 10^(2.77777...) ~ 599.48
so 599 is the largest integer N such that N^36 < 10^100.
Checking this finds that

   •  “cube of a cube’’      ⇒  N = b³³ = b⁹ for some integer b.  

   Hence every prime exponent in the factorisation of N must be divisible by both 4 and 9, i.e. by lcm(4, 9)=36.  
   Conversely any 36-th power obviously satisfies both conditions.  

   Therefore   N is of the form N = m³⁶ with m ∈ ℕ.  

2.  Size bound  
   We require N < 10¹⁰⁰ (a googol), so

   25/9 = 2 + 7/9, hence  

          10^{25/9} = 10² · 10^{7/9}.

Therefore π(7919)=1000, while π(7918)=999; 7919 is the 1000-th prime.

It remains only to justify that 7919 itself is prime.  Because √7919 ≈ 89, we must check divisibility by every prime ≤ 89.  A direct calculation (or the divisibility remainders listed below) shows that none of them divides 7919:

We need 3^A+7^C ≡ 0,1,4 (mod 5):

 A≡1 , C≡0 → 3+1 = 4  (good)  
 A≡3 , C≡2 → 2+4 = 1  (good)

The smallest exponents satisfying every congruence are

 A = 3 (≡3 mod 4), B = 1, C = 2 (≡2 mod 4).

5. Verification  
S = 3^3 + 5^1 + 7^2 = 27 + 5 + 49 = 81 = 9^2.

6. Minimality  
Because of (3), S ≡ 1 (mod 8); hence any valid square is an odd square.  
With A, B, C ≥ 1 the least possible value of S is at least 57, so the only odd square that could lie between 57 and 81 is 57 < n^2 < 81 ⇒ n = 8 gives 64, but 64 ≡ 0 (mod 8) and is therefore impossible.  
Thus 81 is the first attainable square, and we have attained it.

92,"Question: You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?
(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)

(2): m > l > x > s
(3): 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650, divided by 25 gives...
(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186
(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186
Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.
The solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10. This is a total of 35 slushes, and therefore 35 coupons given out. 35 * $0.75 = $26.25 in losses from the coupons. $46.50 - $26.25 = $20.25 net profit when accounting for the coupons. You made your goal!",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let

        Then 7l = 110 − 8(5) = 70 ⇒ l = 10.

        Now m = 4s = 16, and 16 > 10 > 5 > 4, satisfying (3).

   Total cups sold = s + m + l + x = 4 + 16 + 10 + 5 = 35.

7.  Cost of redeeming coupons  
   Each coupon is for a small slush; cost of one small = cup ($0.03) + ingredients (12 oz × $0.06 = $0.72) = $0.75.  

   Total coupon cost = 35 × 0.75 = $26.25.

It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.

 Hint: Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the boys’ present ages (in complete years) be  
A = Albert’s, B = Bill’s, C = Charles’.

Write s(n) for “sum of the digits of n”.

The three pieces of information in the letter translate into

(1) A = s(B) + s(C)         (now)  
(2) B – 1 = s(A – 1) + s(C – 1)  (one year ago)  
(3) C + 6 = s(A + 6) + s(B + 6) (six years hence)

Step 1.  Work modulo 9 (using the hint).

Because n ≡ s(n) (mod 9), each equation gives a congruence:

A ≡ B + C (mod 9)       (1′)  
B ≡ A + C – 1 (mod 9)    (2′)  
C ≡ A + B + 6 (mod 9)    (3′)

Solve (1′)–(3′).  Substituting A from (1′) into (2′):

B ≡ (B + C) + C – 1  ⇒ 0 ≡ 2C – 1 (mod 9)  
So 2C ≡ 1 (mod 9) ⇒ C ≡ 5 (mod 9).

Put C ≡ 5 in (1′): A ≡ B + 5.  
Insert that in (3′):

5 ≡ (B + 5) + B + 6  ⇒ 2B ≡ 3 (mod 9)  
Since 2 · 5 ≡ 1 (mod 9), B ≡ 5 · 3 ≡ 6 (mod 9).  
Then A ≡ B + 5 ≡ 11 ≡ 2 (mod 9).

Hence

A = 2 + 9k₁, B = 6 + 9k₂, C = 5 + 9k₃  (k₁,k₂,k₃ ≥ 0).  (4)

Step 2.  Obtain numerical bounds.

Because s(n) ≤ 9·(number of digits of n), for any age under 100
s(n) ≤ 18.  Therefore, from (1),

A = s(B) + s(C) ≤ 18 + 18 = 36 ⇒ A ≤ 36.  

From (4) that forces k₁ ≤ 3 ⇒ A can only be 2, 11, 20, 29.

Similarly, (2) gives

B – 1 = s(A – 1) + s(C – 1) ≤ 9 + 18 = 27  
⇒ B ≤ 28.

With B ≡ 6 (mod 9), the only possibilities are B = 6, 15, 24.

Step 3.  Examine the few remaining cases.

Case B = 24  
Equation (1): A = s(24) + s(C) = 6 + s(C)  
Only A = 11 can fit (list of possible A), so s(C) = 5.  
Then (2) requires s(C – 1) = 23 – s(10) = 22, impossible.  
So B ≠ 24.

Case B = 15  
Again A must be 11, s(C) = 5.  
Equation (2): s(A – 1) = s(10) = 1, so s(C – 1) = 14, impossible.  
Thus B ≠ 15.

Case B = 6  
Equation (1): A = 6 + s(C).  
A can only be 11 or 20 or 29; try them in turn.

• A = 11  ⇒ s(C) = 5.  
   Possible C (≡5 mod 9 and digit–sum 5): 5, 14, 23, …  

   For (2): B – 1 = 5 = s(10) + s(C – 1) ⇒ s(C – 1) = 4.  
   This is true only when C – 1 has digit–sum 4, i.e. C = 5, 14, 23, …  
   So (2) is satisfied automatically.

   Now check (3): C + 6 must equal s(17) + s(12) = 8 + 3 = 11.  
   Hence C + 6 = 11 ⇒ C = 5.  

• A = 20 or 29 lead to s(C) = 14 or 23, but then (2) gives
   s(C – 1) negative, impossible.  

Thus the only consistent triple is

A = 11, B = 6, C = 5.

Step 4.  Verification.

Now: s(6) + s(5) = 6 + 5 = 11 = A ✓  
One year ago: (10, 5, 4): s(10) + s(4) = 1 + 4 = 5 = B – 1 ✓  
Six years hence: (17, 12, 11): s(17) + s(12) = 8 + 3 = 11 = C + 6 ✓

All conditions are met, the ages are distinct, and no other ages work.

The title hints you can easily go on to find for a ten-digit number that otherwise has same characteristics.","A wrongheaded guess would say 123, because 123 * 2 = 321 + 1.  The title hints you can easily go on to find for a ten-digit number that otherwise has same characteristics.","Answer-
397.
397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.
102?  Is 204 = 201 + 1?  No.
103?  Is 206 = 301 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds even.]
396?  Is 792 = 693 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds again.]
The answer given is the only one that passes.
As for extra points, an infinite number of 9's can be added between the 3 and the 7 without spoiling the major characteristics.

1.  Add A to both sides of (1):

2.  Notice that the left–hand side factors: A² + A = A(A + 1).

    A(A + 1) = A + 2 .                                                     (3)

will converge to the fixed point that satisfies (4).
Solving x = f(x) gives

    x(x + 1) = x + 2   ⇒   x² – 2 = 0   ⇒   x = ±√2,

so the attractive fixed point for ordinary starting values is
+√2 ≈ 1.414213….

Illustration (start with A₀ = 0):

  A₁ = (0+2)/(0+1) = 2.000000  
  A₂ = (2+2)/(2+1) = 1.333333  
  A₃ = (1.333333+2)/(1.333333+1) = 1.428571

Therefore, the number we're looking for is 3333377733.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

x = number of 3’s in the decimal expansion,  
y = number of 7’s in the decimal expansion.  

The three conditions are

1) the digits are only 3 and 7  (already encoded in x, y);

2) the digital sum 3x + 7y is divisible by both 3 and 7;

3) the whole number is divisible by both 3 and 7.

Step 1.  Digital-sum condition.  
Because 3x + 7y ≡ y (mod 3), divisibility by 3 forces y ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
Because 3x + 7y ≡ 3x (mod 7), divisibility by 7 forces 3x ≡ 0 (mod 7) ⇒ x ≡ 0 (mod 7) (since 3 and 7 are coprime).

Hence
 x = 7a, y = 3b for some non-negative integers a, b (not both zero).
Consequently the total number of digits is  

n = x + y = 7a + 3b.  (★)

Step 2.  Look for the smallest possible length n.

•  If n = 1 or 2, (★) is impossible because 7a + 3b ≥ 3.  

•  Take a = 0, b = 1.  Then n = 3, x = 0, y = 3.  
  The only 3-digit number with these counts is 777.

Thus any valid number must have at least 3 digits, and 777 is the unique candidate of minimal length.

Step 3.  Check the remaining divisibility requirement for 777.

Digital sum: 7 + 7 + 7 = 21, divisible by 3 and 7.  
777 ÷ 3 = 259, so 777 is divisible by 3.  
777 ÷ 7 = 111, so 777 is divisible by 7.

Therefore 777 satisfies all three given conditions, and no smaller number can.

98,"Question: Suppose you're in a hallway lined with 100 closed lockers.
You begin by opening every locker. Then you close every second locker. Then you go to every third locker and open it (if it's closed) or close it (if it's open).  Let's call this action toggling a locker. Continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n.  After 100 passes, where you toggle only locker #100, how many lockers are open?
 Hint: Think about this can be related to the number of factors of each number",Think about this can be related to the number of factors of each number,"Answer: 10 lockers are left open:
Lockers #1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.
Each of these numbers are perfect squares. This problem is based on the factors of the locker number.
Each locker is toggled by each factor; for example, locker #40 is toggled on pass number 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40.  That's eight toggles: open-closed-open-closed-open-closed-open-closed.
The only way a locker could be left open is if it is toggled an odd number of times. The only numbers with an odd number of factors are the perfect
squares. Thus, the perfect squares are left open.
For example, locker #25 is toggled on pass number 1, 5, and 25 (three toggles): open-closed-open.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Each locker is toggled once for every pass number that divides its position number.

1. For locker k, you toggle it on every pass n such that n | k.  
   Therefore the total number of toggles locker k receives equals the number of positive divisors of k.

2. A door ends up OPEN exactly when it is toggled an odd number of times (because it begins closed, and an odd number of toggles reverses its state from closed to open).

3. A natural number has an odd number of positive divisors only when it is a perfect square.  
   Reason: the divisors of k usually come in complementary pairs (d, k/d).  
   This pairing makes the divisor count even.  
   The only time a divisor is “unpaired’’ is when d = k/d ⇒ d² = k, i.e. k is a square; that single unpaired divisor makes the total count odd.

4. Thus, locker k is open at the end exactly when k is a perfect square.

5. Among the integers 1 through 100, the perfect squares are  
   1², 2², 3², …, 10² → 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.

Each year, the birth rate is 4% of the population at the beginning of the year, and the death rate is 3% of the population at the beginning of the year.  The resulting births and deaths are truncated to a whole number.  These rates are constant.  For example, consider a population of 99 people at the start of a year.  A 4% birth rate would be 3.96, truncated to 3 births during the year.  A 3% death rate would be 2.97, truncated to 2 deaths during the year.  The population at the end of that year would be 99 + 3 - 2 = 100.  Based on the stated birth and death rates, what is the LAST year that the population increases by only 1?
 Hint: Incrementally add before either the birth rate changes or the death rate changes; no real shortcut",Incrementally add before either the birth rate changes or the death rate changes; no real shortcut,"The last year the population would increase by only one would be the 61st year.
1) Beginning with the 1st year, the number of births will be 4 (4% of 100 = 4) and the number of deaths will be 3 (3% of 100 = 3), which results in a population increase of 1.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year for 25 years, reaching 125 at the end of the 25th year.
2) Beginning with the 26th year, the number of births per year will increase to 5 (4% of 125 = 5), while the deaths will still be 3.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 135 at the end of the 30th year.
3) Beginning with the 31st year, the number of deaths per year will increase to 4 (3% of 135 = 4.05), while the births will still be 5.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year, reaching 150 at the end of the 45th year.
4) Beginning with the 46th year, the number of births per year will increase to 6 (4% of 150 = 6), while the deaths will still be 4.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 168 at the end of the 54th year.
5) Beginning with the 55th year, the number of deaths per year will increase to 5 (3% of 168 = 5.04), while the births will still be 6.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year, reaching 175 at the end of the 61st year.

Pₙ  = population at the beginning of year n , n = 1, 2, 3, …  
Bₙ  = births during year n  = ⌊0.04 Pₙ⌋  
Dₙ  = deaths during year n  = ⌊0.03 Pₙ⌋  

(the brackets denote the integer part).  
The net change in year n is  

Gₙ = Bₙ – Dₙ = ⌊0.04 Pₙ⌋ – ⌊0.03 Pₙ⌋ .

We are asked for the last year in which Gₙ = 1.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  Determining for which populations the change is 1
-------------------------------------------------
Write  

0.03 Pₙ = m + β with m = ⌊0.03 Pₙ⌋ and 0 ≤ β < 1.  

Then  

0.04 Pₙ = 4/3 · (m + β) = 4m/3 + 4β/3 .

(a)  Gₙ = 0 occurs when ⌊0.04 Pₙ⌋ = ⌊0.03 Pₙ⌋ = m.  
This requires  

m ≤ 0.04 Pₙ < m + 1   ⇒   4m + 4β < 3m + 3 ⇒ m + 4β < 3.

Since β < 1, the last inequality forces m < 3.  
Hence for m ≥ 3 (i.e. when 0.03 Pₙ ≥ 3) we can no longer have Gₙ = 0.

(b)  Gₙ = 1 occurs when ⌊0.04 Pₙ⌋ = m + 1.  
That demands  

m + 1 ≤ 4m/3 + 4β/3 < m + 2  
⇔ 4m + 4β ≥ 3m + 3 and 4m + 4β < 3m + 6  
⇔        β ≥ (3 – m)/4 and β < (6 – m)/4.

For m = 3 these inequalities read  

β ≥ 0 and β < 0.75,

i.e. 0 ≤ β < 0.75.  
Because m = 3 means 3 ≤ 0.03 Pₙ < 4, we have  

100 ≤ Pₙ < 125.

Thus:

• If 100 ≤ Pₙ ≤ 124, Gₙ = 1.  
• If Pₙ ≥ 125, Gₙ ≥ 2 (the calculation shows it actually becomes 2 first).

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Tracking the colony from its start
-------------------------------------------------
The colony starts with  

P₁ = 100.

While Pₙ ≤ 124 the yearly increase is exactly 1, so

P₂ = 101, P₃ = 102, …, Pₙ = 100 + (n – 1).

We want the largest n such that Pₙ ≤ 124:

100 + (n – 1) ≤ 124  
⇒ n – 1 ≤ 24  
⇒ n ≤ 25.

For n = 25 we indeed have P₂₅ = 124, and, as shown above, G₂₅ = 1, taking the population to 125.

In year 26 the starting population is 125, for which G₂₆ = 2, so the increase is no longer 1.

-------------------------------------------------
The last year in which the population grows by only one person is the 25th year after the colony is founded.

The tiger is hungry and always attempts to keep the distance between the two of you at a minimum. How can you safely swim to shore?
Assume that as long as you can get to the shore before the tiger gets to you (even if it is only a split-second before), you will be safe.

While you are doing this you will be able to move outward, since you will have some energy to spare.
Before long you will be 1/4 of the radius away from the center and the tiger will be 180 degrees away. At this point swim straight to the point on the shore furthest from the tiger. You will be able to get there in 3/4 units of time, while it will take the tiger pi/4 =~ 0.7854 units of time.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the radius of the lake be R = 1.  
Give every speed in “man-lengths per second”; i.e. let

 • the man’s swimming speed = v  
 • the tiger’s running speed = 4v  (“four times as fast”).

Plan of escape  
(1) First swim round and round the centre until you are on a circle of radius ¼, keeping the tiger always on the diameter opposite you.  
(2) When you have reached that ¼-radius circle, strike straight for the bank along the radius through your own position.

Why step (1) is possible  
While you are at distance r from the centre, your greatest possible angular speed round the centre is  

 ω_man = v / r .

The tiger, confined to the shore (radius 1), can turn round the centre only with angular speed  

 ω_tiger = (4v) / 1 = 4v .

So as long as r ≤ ¼ we have  

 ω_man = v/r ≥ v/(¼) = 4v = ω_tiger .

Hence, while you stay inside the circle of radius ¼, you can always spin fast enough to keep the tiger exactly opposite you (the centre lies between you and the tiger).  
Starting from the centre (where r = 0 and you can turn arbitrarily fast) you spiral outward until your distance from the centre has grown to r = ¼, still with the tiger diametrically opposite.

Why step (2) gets you ashore first  
The moment you reach r = ¼ and the tiger is opposite you, head straight for the shore along the radius through your own position.

Distance you must swim: 1 − ¼ = ¾.  
Time you need: t_man = (¾)/v = 0.75 ⁄ v.

To catch you the tiger must run along the circular shore from the point opposite you to the point you are heading for, an arc of 180° (half the circumference, because you and the tiger are on opposite radii).

Arc length the tiger must cover: π·1 = π.  
Time the tiger needs: t_tiger = π / (4v) ≈ 0.785 ⁄ v.

Comparison: t_man = 0.75 ⁄ v < t_tiger ≈ 0.785 ⁄ v.

Thus you touch the shore a small but positive time before the tiger can reach the same spot, and at that instant you are safe.

Conclusion  
By circling inside the quarter-radius region to keep the tiger diametrically opposite and then swimming straight outward, the man always reaches the shore first in spite of the tiger’s four-fold speed advantage.

We shall follow the distribution, insisting at every stage that the number of marbles taken away (and therefore left over) is an integer.

Step-by-step distribution and what remains  

1. Mike takes ½ of N₀, so the amount left is  
   N₁ = N₀ − ½N₀ = ½N₀.  
   Hence N₀ must be divisible by 2.

2. Paul now takes ⅓ of the marbles that are left, i.e. ⅓ of N₁.  
   The remainder is  
   N₂ = N₁ − ⅓N₁ = ⅔N₁ = (2/3)(½N₀) = N₀/3.  
   Therefore N₁ had to be divisible by 3, so N₀ is divisible by 3 as well.

3. Dave next removes ¼ of what is left, so  
   N₃ = N₂ − ¼N₂ = ¾N₂ = (3/4)(N₀/3) = N₀/4.  
   Thus N₂ had to be divisible by 4, and hence N₀ is divisible by 4.

Continuing in exactly the same way, a clear pattern emerges:

After the k-th friend (where k = 1 corresponds to Mike, k = 2 to Paul, …)  
the amount left is  

  Nk = N₀ / (k + 1).

(The induction proof is immediate: if Nk−1 = N₀/k, then giving 1/(k + 1) of it away leaves the factor k/(k + 1), so Nk = (k/(k + 1))(N₀/k) = N₀/(k + 1).)

Consequences of the pattern  

• Before any friend with denominator (k + 1) receives marbles, the amount present is Nk−1 = N₀/k, which must be divisible by (k + 1).  
• Therefore N₀ must simultaneously be divisible by every integer from 1 through 10.

The least such positive integer is the least common multiple

 LCM(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) = 2520.

Smallest possible starting number of marbles  

So the minimum that satisfies every divisibility requirement is  

 N₀ = 2520.

Marbles remaining after the last gift  

After the ninth friend (Will) has received his share of 1/10, the amount left is

 N₉ = N₀ / 10 = 2520 / 10 = 252.

Therefore, the smallest quantity of marbles that Justin can still have in the bag is 252.

107,"Question: Arrogant Arnold and Witty Will are brothers. One day, they were going from New Jersey to Florida. Bored, they decided to ask each other brain teasers. After a while, they got bored with this, so Arnold decided to place a bet. He would ask Will one teaser, which he thought was very hard. If Will got it right, Arnold would clean his room for the rest of the year. However, if Will got it WRONG, he would have to clean Arnold's room for a year and do his dishes for a month. After thinking for a while, Will agreed to this. This was Arnold's teaser:
Use each digit 1-9 only once each, so that one number multiplied by another equals the third. One example is 12*483=5796. Name at least one more!!!
Being witty as his name suggests, Will easily answered this. The question is, can you find one?

• uses every digit 1-9 exactly once,  
• involves only ordinary (positive-integer) multiplication, and  
• is different from Arnold’s 12 × 483 = 5796,

proceed as follows.

1. Keep the same product.  
   Arnold’s example shows that 5796 already contains the four digits 5, 7, 9, 6 once each.  
   Any alternative equality must therefore use the remaining digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 8—each exactly once—in the two factors.

2. List all factor–pairs of 5796.  
   Factorising 5796 = 2²·3²·7·23 gives the integer pairs

3. Inspect each pair and discard any whose digits

   • repeat within the pair, or  
   • duplicate the product-digits 5, 7, 9, 6.

   Checking the list, every pair fails except one:

      42 has digits 4 and 2,  
      138 has digits 1, 3 and 8.

   Together these five digits are exactly the set {1,2,3,4,8}, none repeats, and none is 5, 7, 9 or 6.

4. Verify the multiplication.

      138 × 42 = 138 × (40 + 2) = 5520 + 276 = 5796.

 Hint: Start from the last digits.",Start from the last digits.,"First, there are ten different letters in this equation: E, F, I, N, O, R, S, T, X, Y. Therefore, every digit from 0 to 9 is used.
Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.
If T=8, then R=X+3, we can have R=6, X=3, or R=7, X=4.
If R=6, X=3, the remaining digits are 2, 4, 7, and again we can't choose S=F+1.
If R=7, X=4, the remaining digits are 2, 3, 6, where 3=2+1. Hence S=3, F=2.
Finally, the remaining digit 6 is for Y.
Therefore, the equation is 29786+850+850=31486.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Begin at the units column.  

1. Units (ones) column

2. Tens column  
 T + E + E + carry₁ = T (mod 10).  
 If N = 5 the carry₁ would be 1, giving 2 E + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 10), impossible for an integer digit.  
 Hence N = 0 and carry₁ = 0.  
 Now 2 E ≡ 0 (mod 10) ⇒ E = 5 (E ≠ 0 because N is already 0).  
 The sum T + 2 E = T + 10 forces a carry₂ = 1 to the hundreds column.

3. Hundreds column  
 R + T + T + carry₂ = X + 10 carry₃  
 ⇒ R + 2 T + 1 = X + 10 carry₃.

 If carry₃ = 1 then, in the next column, O + 1 = I, giving no carry to the next place and thus

4. Thousands column

 a  = age of the youngest child (in years) ,

3.  Extract a factor 3

 Because the right-hand side of (3) is divisible by 3, F itself is divisible by 3.  
 Write F = 3m.  Then

 3m² = 3(a+4k)² + 20k²

 For n = 1 (so k = 3) the factorisation 60 = d₁d₂ with d₁, d₂ even gives

  d₁, d₂ = (2,30) or (6,10).

   •  d₁ = 2, d₂ = 30

  Because gcd(7,720)=1, 7 has a modular inverse modulo 720.  
  7·103 = 721 ≡ 1 (mod 720), so 103 is that inverse.

We shall prove

1. every abundant number below 70 is semi-perfect, and  
2. 70 itself is abundant but not semi-perfect.

Consequently 70 will be the smallest weird number.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  All abundant numbers below 70 are semi-perfect
-------------------------------------------------
The abundant integers <70 are

12, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 66.

For each of them we exhibit a subset of proper divisors whose sum is the number itself.

Thus every abundant n<70 is semi-perfect and hence not weird.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  The number 70 is weird
-------------------------------------------------
a)  Abundance

Proper divisors of 70 : 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35  
Their sum : 1+2+5+7+10+14+35 = 74 > 70.    
So 70 is abundant.

b)  Non–existence of a subset summing to 70

Let the set of proper divisors be  
D = {35, 14, 10, 7, 5, 2, 1}.   
Suppose, for contradiction, that a subset T⊆D satisfies ΣT = 70.

Observe that ΣD = 74, hence Σ(D\T) = 74−70 = 4.  
Therefore such a subset T would exist iff some subset of D sums to 4.

But every element of D is 1 or ≥2, and the only elements ≤3 are 1 and 2:

possible sums of distinct elements ≤3: 1, 2, 1+2 = 3.  
No subset of D totals 4.

Hence no subset of proper divisors can reach 70; 70 is not semi-perfect.

Since 70 is abundant and not semi-perfect, it is weird.

--------------------------------
3.  Minimality
--------------------------------
Because every abundant number smaller than 70 is semi-perfect (Step 1), none of them is weird, while 70 is weird (Step 2). Thus 70 is the first (and therefore the smallest) weird number.

Place the (j+1)-st cut so that

7) GH ≡ 0 (mod 8)  8) HI ≡ 0 (mod 9)

Step 1.  Consequences of the last‐digit rules.  

• AB divisible by 2  ⇒ B even.  
• CD divisible by 4  ⇒ D even.  
• EF divisible by 6  ⇒ F even (and EF divisible by 3).  
• GH divisible by 8  ⇒ H even.  
Hence B,D,F,H are the four even digits 2,4,6,8 (all distinct).

Step 2.  DE must be divisible by 5, so the only possible last digit is 5.  
Thus E = 5.

Step 3.  EF divisible by 6.  
With E=5 and F even, EF=5F must also be divisible by 3, so 5+F≡0 (mod 3).  
Among the even digits only F=4 satisfies this.  
Therefore F = 4.

So far we have fixed E=5, F=4 and the remaining even digits {2,6,8} will be B,D,H.

Two–digit divisibility by 9 requires H+I=9 or 18.  With distinct digits ≤9 and H even,
the possibilities are  
(H,I) = (2,7), (6,3), (8,1).

We must test each possibility together with the remaining conditions FG≡0 (mod 7) and GH≡0 (mod 8).

• Case H=2, I=7  
  GH divisible by 8 demands a digit G with 10G+2 ≡0 (mod 8).  
  This forces G=3.  Then FG=43, but 43 is not divisible by 7, so this case fails.

• Case H=8, I=1  
  GH divisible by 8 needs 10G+8 ≡0 (mod 8) ⇒ 2G≡0 (mod 8) ⇒ G = 4 or 8.  
  Both are impossible (4 already at F, 8 already at H).  Hence this case fails.

• Case H=6, I=3  
  GH divisible by 8 ⇒ 10G+6 ≡0 (mod 8).  The solutions are G=1 or G=9.  
  FG must be divisible by 7; with F=4 this gives FG = 41 or 49.  
  Only 49 is a multiple of 7, so G = 9.

Up to now we have  
… E F G H I = … 5 4 9 6 3.

Step 5.  The unused digits are {1,2,7,8}.  
B and D must be the remaining even digits {2,8}; A and C will be {1,7}.

Try B=2:  
 BC divisible by 3 gives C=1 (21) or 7 (27), both acceptable,  
 but CD must be divisible by 4 with D=8.

122,"Question: The people of Olde Mathville had unique ways of punishing wayward citizens.   For example, those convicted of crimes of dishonesty were chained to the Liars' Rail until they solved a number of puzzles.
One such puzzle has been recently discovered!

L I A R

R A I L
or: L I A R  x  S  =  R A I L
 Hint: The product of S x L must be less than 10.  Combining that with the need for S x R to end in L limits the possibilities quickly.",The product of S x L must be less than 10.  Combining that with the need for S x R to end in L limits the possibilities quickly.,"L=2, I=1, A=7, R=8, and S=4
2178 x 4 = 8712
One possible solution guide:
* SxL<10, as the product is a 4-digit number; S can not = 1
... so S,L can be 2,3; 2,4; 3,1; 3,2; 4,1; 4,2
* but SxR ends in L - and if S or R is even, so is L
... so S,L,R can be 2,4,7; 3,1,7; 3,2,4; 4,2,8
* the first three are quickly rejected by checking the multiplication
... S=4, L=2, R=8
* Since 2000 x 4 = 8000, nothing has been carried from multiplying the hundreds digit
... so I=1 or 0
* I=0 is rejected as '3' tens have been carried forward from multiplying 4x8; the 3 must be added to 7 to give 0 in the bottom line, and we cannot have 4 x __ = 7.
... so I=1
... so A=7 (the only way to get a 1 in the tens column of the product)",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"We write out the one-digit–by–four-digit multiplication in place–value form and track the carries.  
Let the carries from the units, tens and hundreds columns be c₁, c₂ and c₃ respectively.

            L I A R
        ×        S
        ---------------
            R A I L

Column-wise we obtain the four equations  

(1)  S·R = 10c₁ + L          (units)  
(2)  S·A + c₁ = 10c₂ + I     (tens)  
(3)  S·I + c₂ = 10c₃ + A     (hundreds)  
(4)  S·L + c₃ = R            (thousands)

The hint tells us S·L < 10, so no carry arises from the thousands column; hence c₃ ≤ 9-S·L and (4) is an ordinary equality, not “mod 10”.

Step 1.  Find the possible pairs (S, L).

Because S·L < 10, for S = 9,8,7,6,5 we must have L = 1.  
For S = 4 we can have L = 1 or 2;  
for S = 3 we can have L = 1,2,3;  
for S = 2 we can have L = 1,2,3,4.  

But equation (1) also requires the unit digit of S·R to be L, so we look for S values whose multiplication table contains the digit L in the unit place.

Checking each possibility quickly eliminates every pair except

        S = 4 ,  L = 2 .

Indeed with S = 4 and L = 2 we have

        S·L = 8  (< 10)  so c₃ = R − 8   (from (4)).

Equation (1) now gives

        4·R = 10c₁ + 2 .

The only digit R (different from 4 and 2) for which 4·R ends in 2 is R = 8, and this forces

        4·8 = 32  ⇒  c₁ = 3,  L = 2     (consistent)
        c₃ = R − 8 = 0 .

So far we have

        S = 4 ,  L = 2 ,  R = 8 ,  c₁ = 3 ,  c₃ = 0 .

Step 2.  Determine A and I.

With c₁ = 3 the tens-column equation (2) is

        4A + 3 = 10c₂ + I .                         (†)

Because 4A + 3 ≤ 39, the carry c₂ can be 0,1,2 or 3.

The hundreds-column equation (3) (remember c₃ = 0) is

        4I + c₂ = A .                               (‡)

Now try the small values of I allowed by (‡):

•  I = 0  ⇒  A = c₂  ⇒  insert into (†): 3 = (10−4)A ⇒ A non-integer.  
•  I = 1  ⇒  A = 4 + c₂.  Substituting in (†):

           4(4+c₂) + 3 = 10c₂ + 1   
           19 + 4c₂ = 10c₂ + 1   
           18 = 6c₂   ⇒   c₂ = 3 ,  A = 7 .

This solution satisfies all requirements and uses distinct digits.
Higher I fail because 4I + c₂ would exceed 9.

Step 3.  Verify.

   L I A R  =  2 1 7 8  
×          S  =        4
-------------------------
   R A I L  =  8 7 1 2

Indeed 2178 × 4 = 8712, and all five letters represent different digits.

Therefore

        L = 2 ,  I = 1 ,  A = 7 ,  R = 8 ,  S = 4.

G₁ (largest) : 242 teeth

G₃ : 64 teeth  
G₄ : 22 teeth  

and let R₁, R₂, R₃, R₄ denote the (whole-number) revolutions each gear makes before the whole train is again in its initial configuration.

1.  Relation between revolutions of two gears in mesh  
   For two externally-meshing gears, the same number of teeth must pass the line of centres, so  
   (number of teeth) × (revolutions) is the same for the two gears.  
   Hence  
        242 R₁ = 160 R₂ ,  
        160 R₂ =  64 R₃ ,  
         64 R₃ =  22 R₄ .

2.  Express every R in terms of R₁  
        R₂ = (242/160) R₁ = (121/80) R₁ ,  
        R₃ = (160/64) R₂ = (5/2)·(121/80) R₁ = (121/32) R₁ ,  
        R₄ = (64/22) R₃ = (32/11)·(121/32) R₁ = (121/11) R₁ = 11 R₁ .

3.  Make each R a whole number  
   For R₂ to be integral, (121/80) R₁ must be an integer → R₁ must be a multiple of 80.  
   For R₃ to be integral, (121/32) R₁ must be an integer → R₁ must be a multiple of 32.  

   The smallest positive integer that is simultaneously a multiple of 80 and 32 is  
        lcm(80, 32) = 160.

4.  Check the other gears when R₁ = 160  
        R₂ = (121/80)·160 = 242 (integer)  
        R₃ = (121/32)·160 = 605 (integer)  
        R₄ = 11·160 = 1760 (integer)  

   Thus every gear has completed an integral number of revolutions, so each is back in its starting position.

Therefore the largest cog must turn 160 complete revolutions before the whole set of four cogs returns to its initial arrangement.

A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.

 R = 10 km  (the planet’s radius)  
 C = 2πR = 20π km ≈ 62.8319 km  (the planet’s circumference).

Step 1.  Interpret the two walks as arcs of great circles.  
The first walk has length  

 s₁ = 17.345 km ⇒ central angle α = s₁/R = 17.345/10 = 1.7345 rad ≈ 99.45°.

The second walk has length  

 s₂ = 47.124 km = 0.75 C = ¾·(20π) km,  
so its central angle is  

 β = s₂/R = 47.124/10 = 4.7124 rad = 270°.

Step 2.  Replace the 270° arc by its equivalent 90° arc.  
Walking 270° along a great circle puts you at exactly the same point as walking 90° the opposite way on that great circle. Hence the spherical distance between the turning point and your final position is the shorter arc

 BC = 90° = π/2 rad.

Step 3.  Form the spherical right triangle.  
Label the starting point A (the ship), the turning point B, and the final point C.  
• Side AB = α = 99.45°.  
• Side BC = 90°.  
• The turn at B is a left-hand 90° turn, so the angle ∠B of the spherical triangle ABC is 90°.

Step 4.  Use the right-triangle form of the spherical law of cosines.  
For a right spherical triangle with right angle at B,

 cos(AC) = cos(AB) · cos(BC).

Here, cos(BC) = cos 90° = 0, so

 cos(AC) = cos(99.45°)·0 = 0  ⇒ AC = 90° = π/2 rad.

Thus the central angle between your ship and your final position is 90°.

131,"Question: In the Art Gallery is a new conceptual art piece. The artist created a huge pile different paintings; periodically he picks up one of the paintings and hangs it on the wall, and adjusts it.
At 11:00, the painting titled ""Number 30"" was hung.
At 4:00, the painting titled ""Number 240"" was hung.

What painting will the artist hang on the wall at 9:20?
 Hint: Think about an analog clock; the times are important!",Think about an analog clock; the times are important!,"The answer is ""Number 200"". It is the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand at those respective times.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"At any given time place the clock’s hour-hand and minute-hand on a 360° circle with 0° at 12 o’clock and angles increasing clockwise.  
Label  

 hour-hand angle = (hour + minutes⁄60)·30°  
 minute-hand angle = minutes·6°.

For every time shown in the problem the artist’s “painting number’’ equals the clockwise angle you must travel from the hour-hand to reach the minute-hand.

Check the given data  

• 11 : 00 hour = 11·30° = 330°, minute = 0°  
 Clockwise from 330° to 0°: (360 − 330)+0 = 30°. → No. 30  

• 4 : 00 hour = 4·30° = 120°, minute = 0°  
 Clockwise from 120° to 0°: (360 − 120)+0 = 240°. → No. 240  

• 7 : 30 hour = (7 + ½)·30° = 225°, minute = 30·6° = 180°  
 Clockwise from 225° to 180°: (360 − 225)+180 = 315°. → No. 315  

The rule fits all three cases.

Now find the number for 9 : 20.

hour-hand angle: (9 + 20⁄60)·30° = (9 + 1⁄3)·30° = 280°.  
minute-hand angle: 20·6° = 120°.

Clockwise from 280° to 120°: (360 − 280) + 120 = 80 + 120 = 200°.

Therefore the picture that will be hung at 9 : 20 is “Number 200”.

In another minute, the rubber band is stretched another three inches.
This keeps going on until the spider reaches the end of the rubber band.  How long did it take the spider to reach the end?

L0 = 3 in = initial length,  
v = 1 in / min = spider’s walking speed (measured with respect to the rubber),  

and let after every whole minute the free end of the band be pulled out a further 3 in, the stretch being uniform along the band.

1.  Length of the band after n complete stretches  
   Ln = 3( n + 1 ) (inches). (n = 0,1,2,…)

2.  Position variables  
   pn = distance of the spider from the fixed end just after the n-th stretch;  
   qn = fraction of the band already covered: qn = pn / Ln.

   Initially p0 = 0, q0 = 0.

3.  One-minute step  
   During minute n→n+1 (band length Ln):
        the spider walks 1 in → temporary position pn + 1;  
        immediately afterwards the whole band is stretched by the factor
        (Ln+1 / Ln) = (n + 2)/(n + 1).

   Hence  
        pn+1 = (pn + 1) · (n + 2)/(n + 1).

   Dividing by Ln+1 = 3(n + 2) gives the recursion for the fraction covered:

        qn+1 = pn+1 / Ln+1
              = (pn + 1)/(3(n + 1))
              = qn + 1/[3(n + 1)].  (★)

4.  Solving (★)  
   Telescoping from q0 = 0:

        qn = (1/3) Σ_{k=1}^{n} 1/k = Hn / 3,

   with Hn the n-th harmonic number.

5.  When does the spider reach the far end?  
   During minute n→n+1 the fraction covered grows from qn to

        qn + 1/[3(n + 1)] = H_{n+1}/3.

   The end is reached as soon as this quantity reaches 1.  
   We need the least m such that Hm ≥ 3.

   H10 = 2.928968… < 3, H11 = 3.019877… ≥ 3.

   Therefore the spider finishes during the 11th minute (between the 10th and 11th stretches).

6.  Exact time within that minute  
   At the start of the 11th minute (after 10 stretches)

        q10 = H10/3 = 7381/7560, Ln = L10 = 3·11 = 33 in.

   Fraction still to go: 1 – q10 = 179/7560.  
   Remaining distance: 33 · (179/7560) = 1969/2520 in.

   At 1 in / min this takes 1969/2520 min.

7.  Total time

        T = 10 min + 1969/2520 min
          = 10 + (1969/2520)·60 s
          = 10 min + 1969/42 s

Something fun is that the total number of letters he had delivered has its digits arranged in ascending order.
How many days had he worked, and how many letters had he delivered in total?
 Hint: The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.",The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.,"It's easy to see that the number of letters he had delivered is the square of the number of days he had worked.
Square numbers can't end in 7 or 8, and 123456 is not a square because it is divisible by 3 but not by 9. Hence the number of letters must end with 9.
Since odd squares have remainder 1 upon division by 8, the number formed by its fourth and fifth digits must be divisible by 4, which can be 48, 56 or 68.
Numbers that have remainder 2 upon division by 3, and those that are divisible by 3 but not by 9 are not squares. By trial and error, we know that the only square number satisfying these conditions is 134689=367^2.

Oddly enough, an equal number of pedestrians walk in each direction at four kilometres per hour. The four cab drivers were discussing the best way to pick up a fare. Bill said he was going to sit beside the curb and wait until a fare came along. Bob said he was going to cruise west at four kilometres an hour; therefore, he would have twice the chance of picking up a fare as Bill. Frank said he was going to cruise east at eight kilometres an hour and his chances were twice as good as either Bill's or Bob's. Jim claimed that they were all wrong.

Bob, who was driving west at four kph, wouldn't pass anyone walking west, but would pass 200 people walking east. This would put him no further ahead than Bill. Frank, who was driving east and 300 people going west. Jim, who was going west at 12kph, would pass 200 people going west and 400 people going east. His statement about doubling his chances over Frank was false.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the (constant) linear density of pedestrians walking east be λ persons / km and, because “an equal number of pedestrians walk in each direction”, let the same density λ walk west.

Take east as the positive direction.

If a cab moves with velocity v (km/h), then  
• every east-bound pedestrian (speed +4 km/h) is met at the relative speed |v − 4| km/h,  
• every west-bound pedestrian (speed –4 km/h) is met at the relative speed |v + 4| km/h.

Hence the rate at which the cab meets potential fares is  

R(v)=λ(|v−4|+|v+4|) (persons per hour).

Now evaluate R(v) for the four drivers.

1. Bill: v = 0 (waiting at the curb)  
   R(0)=λ(4+4)=8λ.

2. Bob: v = –4 (cruising west at 4 km/h)  
   R(–4)=λ(|–4–4|+|–4+4|)=λ(8+0)=8λ.  
   This is exactly the same as Bill’s rate, not double; Bob’s claim is wrong.

3. Frank: v = +8 (cruising east at 8 km/h)  
   R(+8)=λ(|8–4|+|8+4|)=λ(4+12)=16λ.  
   16λ is twice 8λ, so Frank really does have twice the chance of either Bill or Bob; Frank’s claim is correct.

4. Jim: v = –12 (driving west at 12 km/h)  
   R(–12)=λ(|–12–4|+|–12+4|)=λ(16+8)=24λ.  
   Compared with Frank’s 16λ, this is only 1.5 ×, not 2 ×, so Jim’s claim is wrong.

136,"Question: Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?
Comments to triflers:
The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!
 Hint: There are hints in the comments to triflers and in the title.",There are hints in the comments to triflers and in the title.,"80
To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion. This takes 9 trips of 2 5/18 miles (5 advancing trips interspersed with 4 return trips) for a total of 20.5 miles traveled (9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5) and 20.5 bottles of soda used. Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases. With one less case to move, Bu will now make 2 fewer trips. The 3.5 bottles set aside are used to move the four cases the next 1/2 mile toward the Wirth Pavilion.   After this, the Wirth Pavilion is just 2 2/9 miles away ( 5 - 2 5/18 - 9/18 = 2 4/18 ). Next, he travels 15 5/9 miles (7 * 2 2/9) using 15 5/9 bottles of soda to complete his trip. The ranger cadet delivers 80 bottles to the pavilion and has 4/9 of a Park Pop to spare. (96 - 15 5/9 = 80 4/9)",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"First fix the data.

• Total supply at the Weiss Pavilion : 5 cases = 5·25 = 125 unopened bottles.  
• A MoJoPed carries at most 25 bottles altogether; one of them may be in the fuel tank.  
• One bottle is burned per mile.

The question is the maximum number of unopened bottles that can be standing at the
Wirth Pavilion, 5 miles away.

General fact (Jeep / banana-truck principle)

If, at some point of the road, there are still k full loads (k ≥ 1) left to be ferried,
then to shift everything one mile farther you must

 • drive forward k times (k bottles) and  
 • come back empty (k–1) times ((k–1) bottles).

Hence the least possible fuel cost per mile while k loads remain is

 f(k)= k + (k – 1) = 2k – 1 bottles.

With 125 bottles and a 25-bottle load limit we start with

125 / 25 = 5 full loads,  
so at the start f(5)=2·5–1 = 9 bottles per mile.

As soon as the stock drops below 100 bottles we will have only four complete loads
left, after which the cost falls to f(4)=7 bottles per mile.
(We never reach three full loads, because the finish lies too close.)

Step 1  Move everything from mile 0 to mile 3

Let x be the distance that can be covered while five full loads remain.

125 – 9x = 100 → x = 25/9 ≈ 2.78 miles.

We cannot stop in the middle of a mile and waste part of a bottle, so we carry the
whole stock three complete miles instead.  The cost is

3 miles · 9 bottles/mile = 27 bottles.

After three miles there are 125 – 27 = 98 bottles left.

Step 2  Move the remaining stock the last two miles (k = 4)

Cost per mile is now 7 bottles; the remaining distance is exactly 2 miles, so the
additional fuel burned is

2 miles · 7 bottles/mile = 14 bottles.

Step 3  Count what is left at Wirth

Initial stock 125  
Fuel burnt  27 + 14 = 41  
Unopened bottles delivered 125 – 41 = 84.

Optimality

During the first three miles at least 9 bottles per mile must be spent; during the
last two miles at least 7 per mile must be spent.  Thus no scheme can burn fewer
than 3·9 + 2·7 = 41 bottles.  Since the procedure above achieves this minimum, 84
is the greatest possible number of unopened bottles that can arrive.

137,"Question: Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.  Henry's plan calls for the tracks (each of which is one mile in length) to be laid end-to-end with no gap between them, pinned to the ground at every other juncture, as shown below:
v_______ _______vv_______ _______v
Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""
Henry replies, ""The expansion will only be an inch over the whole mile length.  If the tracks buckle, it will only be by an inch or two at most.  The trains will certainly have no trouble bumping over these buckles.""
Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?
 Hint: Would Pythagoras have the same plan?",Would Pythagoras have the same plan?,"The rise in the middle of the tracks would have been much greater than Henry surmised.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse). SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the two consecutive points that are bolted to the ground be A and B.  
Because every other rail-joint is bolted, the distance AB is two miles  
( one mile of rail from A to the un-bolted joint, then another mile of rail to B ).

1 mile = 5 280 ft, so

	AB (the fixed horizontal distance) = 2·5 280 ft = 10 560 ft.

The two rails between A and B are each to lengthen 1 inch when the temperature rises;  
two inches = 2 in = 2/12 ft = 1/6 ft ≈ 0.166 7 ft.

Hence the total length of rail between A and B after the expansion is

	10 560 ft + 1/6 ft.

Because the ends A and B are fixed, the extra 1/6 ft must be taken up by a buckle.  
Experience shows that the simplest buckle is symmetrical, the middle of the rail rising
a height h while the two straight pieces from A and from B meet there.  
(If the rail bowed in a smooth arc instead of these two straight lines, the result is
virtually the same height; using straight sides only makes the arithmetic simpler and,
as the hint says, lets Pythagoras do the work.)

Fix notation:

	mid-point M is directly above the mid-point of AB,
	AM = MB = 5 280 ft   (horizontal run)
	vertical rise  = h.

Each half-rail therefore has actual length

	√(5 280² + h²).

For the whole buckle

	2 √(5 280² + h²) = 10 560 ft + 1/6 ft.           (1)

Divide both sides of (1) by 2 and square:

	5 280² + h² = (5 280 + 1/12)²
	            = 5 280² + 2·5 280·(1/12) + (1/12)².

The 5 280² terms cancel, giving

	h² = 2·5 280·(1/12) + (1/12)²
	    = 880 ft + 0.006 944 ft
	    ≈ 880 ft.

Therefore

	h ≈ √880 ft ≈ 29.7 ft.

So the “little” buckle produced by only two inches of extra rail would rise almost thirty feet
— about the height of a three-storey building!  
No locomotive could “bump over” such a hill; it would simply run into a wall of steel.

That is why Henry’s boss (quite correctly) called the plan foolish and dismissed him.

Final answer: The 1-inch-per-mile expansion would force a two-mile length pinned at its ends to bulge nearly 30 feet high, not “an inch or two,” making the track utterly unusable.",True,1,0

1. Let Mouse(A) and Mouse(C) start biting off Rope(A) at the same time, starting each from  one end (moving in opposite directions).  At the same time, let Mouse(B) start biting off Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(A) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X = S(A) * 60, where S(A) is biting speed for Mouse(A) and X is Rope(A) length
X = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X is Rope(A) length

The disappearance of Rope 2 is the second observable event.

        11111111100.

If we try to make k larger than 9, we would have to place at least one 0 in the
prefix (to keep the total of 1’s equal to 9).  But inserting a new digit to the
left always shifts every existing digit one place to the right, thereby
multiplying the value of the whole number by 10 before any compensation is
possible.  Consequently any number with more than 11 digits is strictly larger
than 11111111100.  There is therefore no way to obtain a smaller multiple of
225 using only the digits 0 and 1.

–––––  Verification  –––––  
Sum of digits (ignoring the final 00): 9 ⇒ divisible by 9.  
Last two digits: 00 ⇒ divisible by 25.  

Hence 11111111100 is divisible by 9 × 25 = 225.

(Indeed 11111111100 ÷ 225 = 49 382 716.)

Because it uses only the digits 0 and 1, ends in 00, and is the shortest
possible such number, it is the minimum Rob could have eaten.

= 88++9
= 88 + (9 *2)

= 106",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let us determine the two “mystery” operations step by step.

1.  Determining ++  

   Write x++y as a linear combination of x and y (the hint says only addition and multiplication are involved):
        x++y = a x + b y.

   Using the two values supplied,
        4++8 = 20  ⇒  4a + 8b = 20 …(i)  
        8++4 = 16  ⇒  8a + 4b = 16 …(ii)

   Solve (i)–(ii):

        Multiply (i) by 2:      8a + 16b = 40  
        Subtract (ii):          12b = 24  ⇒  b = 2.  
        Substitute into (i):    4a + 16 = 20  ⇒  a = 1.

   Hence   x++y = 1·x + 2·y = x + 2y.

2.  Determining **  

   Let x**y involve the product xy and (possibly) extra multiples of x and y:

        x**y = xy + c x + d y.

   Use the two given equalities:
        3**5 = 27  ⇒  3·5 + 3c + 5d = 27  ⇒  15 + 3c + 5d = 27 …(iii)  
        5**3 = 35  ⇒  5·3 + 5c + 3d = 35  ⇒  15 + 5c + 3d = 35 …(iv)

   Subtract 15 from both (iii) and (iv):

        3c + 5d = 12 …(v)  
        5c + 3d = 20 …(vi)

   Solve (v)–(vi):

        Multiply (v) by 5: 15c + 25d = 60  
        Multiply (vi) by 3: 15c + 9d  = 60  
        Subtract:           16d = 0  ⇒ d = 0.  
        Then (v):           3c = 12  ⇒ c = 4.

   Therefore   x**y = xy + 4x = x(y + 4).

3.  Evaluate (8**7)++9  

   First, 8**7:
        8**7 = 8·7 + 4·8 = 56 + 32 = 88.

   Now apply ++ with the result and 9:
        (8**7)++9 = 88 ++ 9 = 88 + 2·9 = 88 + 18 = 106.

 Hint: The number of trailing zeros is equivalent to the number of factors of 10",The number of trailing zeros is equivalent to the number of factors of 10,"The ! stands for factorial.  So, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!
The only way to get a trailing zero is by multiplying a factor of 1000! which is 2 by a factor of 1000! which is 5. The modified problem is thus: How many such pairs of factors are there?
There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5. But in addition there are 40 = 1000/25 numbers which are multiples of 25, each of which gives one factor of five in addition to the one counted in the 200 and the one counted in the 40 above. Finally there is 1 = [1000/625] number which is a multiple of 625, this gives one further factor of 5. Thus there are exactly  200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249 factors of 5 in 1000! and since there are more than sufficient factors of 2, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"To create one trailing zero we need a factor 10 = 2 × 5.  
In 1000! there are far more factors 2 than factors 5, so the number of trailing zeros equals the total number of factors 5 contained in 1000!.

Count factors of 5 using Legendre’s formula:

⎣1000/5⎦ = 200  
⎣1000/25⎦ = 40  
⎣1000/125⎦ = 8  
⎣1000/625⎦ = 1  
⎣1000/3125⎦ = 0 (and all higher powers give 0)

Total factors of 5 = 200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249.

Therefore, 1000! ends with 249 zeros.

In every stage Charles is 93rd, so in every stage exactly seven riders finish after him (94-th … 100-th).

1.  Upper bound on how many riders Charles can outrun overall  
   • In one stage Charles can be ahead of at most 7 riders.  
   • In 14 stages he can therefore be ahead of at most 7 × 14 = 98 distinct riders.  
   • He obviously cannot beat the champion, so 98 is the absolute maximum number of riders he could surpass in the general classification.

2.  Showing that the upper bound 98 can actually be reached  
   Label the remaining 98 riders R₁,…,R₉₈.  Divide them into 14 disjoint groups of seven.  
   In stage k (k = 1,…,14) make the k-th group of seven riders have a disastrous day: let each of them finish just behind Charles but with a huge loss, say 10 hours more than Charles.  
   In their other 13 stages let every one of those seven riders finish a tiny bit (e.g. ½ s) ahead of Charles.  
   Give the champion P a tiny advantage (e.g. 1 s) over Charles in every stage.

   • Champion’s total lead over Charles = 14 × 1 s = 14 s.  
   • Each rider Rᵢ gains 13 × ½ s = 6½ s on Charles in the stages in which he beats Charles, but loses 10 hours to him in the single stage he finishes behind.  Hence
       total time(Rᵢ)  = total time(C) + (–10 h + 6½ s)  >  total time(C).
   Therefore every Rᵢ ends the race well behind Charles, while P alone is in front.

   During every stage Charles is still only 93rd, because 92 riders (the champion plus the 91 riders not in that day’s “bad-luck” group) finish ahead of him, and the 7 in the unlucky group finish behind him.

Thus all 98 riders once suffer a catastrophic loss that Charles avoids, and Charles’ accumulated time is better than theirs even though he never places higher than 93rd in any individual stage.

The maximum possible number of competitors Charles can beat overall is

98.

147,"Question: The Boldavian navy has a rigorous training program.  In order to graduate from the naval academy, cadets must enter a pool and fight sharks.  Today, a group of cadets was tested.  Each cadet put on his mask, snorkel, and two flippers; and armed himself with a knife.  Then the cadets jumped into the pool.  The sharks were then released from their pens.  After 10 minutes of gruelling hand-to-fin combat, all of the sharks were killed.  Miraculously, none of the cadets were killed.  Exiting the pool, the cadets began to haul the shark bodies out of the water.  The dead sharks were soon lying in a row.  One of the cadets noted that during the fight, there were 4 times as many cadets in the water as there were sharks.  A second cadet then stated that the number of legs they now had was equal to the square of the number of sharks.  A third said that the number of cadet legs was 14 more than the total number of cadet and shark heads.  How many sharks were killed?
 Hint: Set up systems of equations; notice that legs could be lost (""they now had"")","Set up systems of equations; notice that legs could be lost (""they now had"")","7 sharks were killed.
Since there were 4 times as many cadets, there were 28 cadets.  The number of cadet legs is equal to the square of the number of sharks, which would be 49 legs.  49 legs is 14 more than the number of cadet and shark heads: 7 sharks plus 28 cadets equals 35 heads.
Note that although all of the cadets survived, nothing was said about possible injuries.  In fact, each shark had bitten off one leg from each of 7 cadets.  This explains the shortage of legs, since 28 cadets should have had 56 legs, not 49.  Also note the statement of the second cadet, who said 'the number of legs they NOW had ...'.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

c = number of cadets that fought  
s = number of sharks that were released (and killed)

Facts supplied in the three remarks translate directly into equations:

1. “There were 4 times as many cadets as sharks.”  
   c = 4s.                                                        …(1)

3. “The number of cadet legs was 14 more than the total number of cadet and shark heads.”  
   Each being (cadet or shark) has exactly one head, so heads = c + s.  
   Hence L = (c + s) + 14.                                        …(3)

Equate the two expressions for L given in (2) and (3):

Substitute c = 4s from (1) into (4):

s² = (4s + s) + 14  
s² = 5s + 14  
s² – 5s – 14 = 0  
(s – 7)(s + 2) = 0.

Because s must be positive, s = 7.

Consistency check (legs cannot exceed the original 2 per cadet):
• Number of cadets: c = 4s = 28.  
• Maximum possible legs before the fight: 2c = 56.  
• Legs remaining now: L = s² = 49  (from (2)), which is ≤ 56, so some legs were indeed lost but the situation is physically possible.

All statements are satisfied, so the arithmetic is consistent.

      N = ABCBA  

be the required five–digit number (A,B,C are digits), and let its square root be  

      √N = aba       (a is the hundreds and units digit, b the tens digit).

Because N itself is a palindrome, the hint tells us that its square root must also be a palindrome and that the ordinary pencil-and-paper multiplication

                a  b  a
          ×     a  b  a
          ----------------

must proceed without any carrying; a carry anywhere would destroy the palindromic pattern of the product.

1.  Express √N algebraically.  
    √N = 100a + 10b + a = 101a + 10b.

2.  Square without carrying (treat the digits as coefficients of a polynomial in 10):

    (101a + 10b)²  
    = a²·10⁰ + (2ab)·10¹ + (2a² + b²)·10² + (2ab)·10³ + a²·10⁴.

    Therefore the digits of N are

          units (10⁰):            a²
          tens  (10¹):            2ab
          hundreds (10²):         2a² + b²
          thousands (10³):        2ab

    i.e.  N = a²   (2ab)   (2a² + b²)   (2ab)   a², automatically a palindrome.

3.  Each digit of N must itself be a non-zero square, so every digit must be 1, 4 or 9.  Thus we need

      a² ∈ {1,4,9},          (i)
      2ab ∈ {1,4,9},         (ii)
      2a² + b² ∈ {1,4,9}.     (iii)

   Because √N is three digits, 100 ≤ 101a + 10b ≤ 316, forcing a = 1, 2 or 3.

   •  a = 1.  
      Then (ii) gives 2b ∈ {1,4,9} ⇒ 2b = 4 ⇒ b = 2.  
      But (iii) becomes 2·1² + 2² = 2 + 4 = 6, not a square digit – impossible.

   •  a = 2.  
      Then (ii) gives 4b ∈ {1,4,9} ⇒ 4b = 4 ⇒ b = 1.  
      Now (iii): 2·2² + 1² = 8 + 1 = 9, which is a square digit.  
      All conditions are met with (a,b) = (2,1).

   •  a = 3.  
      Then (ii) gives 6b ∈ {1,4,9}, which is impossible for any digit b.

   The only admissible pair is a = 2, b = 1.

4.  Construct √N and N.

      √N = 101a + 10b = 101·2 + 10·1 = 202 + 10 = 212,
      N  = 212² = 44944.

Let the original price of the Red Rose bouquet  be 'B' Roka.
It is given that during a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%.
Hence after a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 162 Roka, the price of the bouquet

On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.

153,"Question: Find three numbers, all under 500, where the sum of all three is a perfect square and the sums of any two of them are also perfect squares.
 Hint: For more convenient differences, some of the numbers might be smaller","For more convenient differences, some of the numbers might be smaller","41, 80, 320",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the three required (positive) integers be  
x , y , z , all < 500, and denote  

x + y = a² , x + z = b² , y + z = c² , x + y + z = d²             (1)

with a,b,c,d positive integers.

1.  Express x , y , z in terms of a , b , c  
 Adding the first three equations and comparing with the fourth gives  

2d² = a² + b² + c² .                                                (2)

From (1) we also obtain  

x = (a² + b² − c²)/2  
y = (a² + c² − b²)/2  
z = (b² + c² − a²)/2 .                                             (3)

Hence a , b , c must be chosen so that every right–hand side in (3) is a positive integer and (2) holds with d an integer.

2.  A convenient simplification  
Take two of the three outer squares equal; set  

b = c .                                                             (4)

Then (2) becomes  

a² + 2b² = 2d² ⇔ d² = (a² + 2b²)/2 .                              (5)

Because a² + 2b² must be even, a must be odd while b may be even.  
With b = c the expressions (3) reduce to  

x = b² , y = z = (a² − b²)/2 .                                    (6)

Condition (6) shows immediately that x will repeat while y and z coincide; nevertheless we still get three (not necessarily distinct) positive numbers.

3.  Looking for small even b  
Put b = 2k (k a positive integer).  Then (6) gives  

x = (2k)² = 4k² , y = z = (a² − 4k²)/2 .                          (7)

Equation (5) now reads  

d² = (a² + 8k²)/2 = a²/2 + 4k² .                                   (8)

We want a , k as small as possible while keeping y positive.  
Try k = 2 (so b = 4):

• From (8): d² = a²/2 + 16 .  
 Because the right side must be a square, a has to be odd.  
 The smallest odd a giving a square on the right is a = 7, for  

 a = 7 ⇒ d² = 7²/2 + 16 = (49/2) + 16 = 81/2 = 9² . (Check.)

With k = 2, a = 7 we obtain from (7)

x = 4k² = 4·2² = 32 , y = z = (a² − 4k²)/2 = (49 − 16)/2 = 17 .

4.  Verification  
x = 32 , y = 32 , z = 17 .

x + y = 32 + 32 = 64 = 8²  
x + z = 32 + 17 = 49 = 7²  
y + z = 32 + 17 = 49 = 7²  
x + y + z = 32 + 32 + 17 = 81 = 9²

All three numbers are under 500, every pair–sum is a perfect square, and the total sum is a perfect square as required.

155,"Question: Old Farmer McDoughnut owns a piece of grassland in the heart of Madadia and has three animals: a Madadian Burger Cow, a Spare Kebab Goat, and a Scotch Egg laying Goose. McDoughnut discovered the following:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 45 days.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 90 days also.
For how long can the three animals graze on the field together?
 Hint: Rates problem--use the same algebraic techniques",Rates problem--use the same algebraic techniques,"The cow, the goat, and the goose eat grass with a constant speed (amount per day): v1 for the cow, v2 for the goat, v3 for the goose.
The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:
v1 = 3 x h/180,
v2 = 2 x h/180,
v3 = 1 x h/180,
k = 1 x h/180.
Then holds for the time t that the three animals can graze together: h-tx(v1+v2+v3-k) = 0, so t = h/(v1+v2+v3-k) = h/(3xh/180+2xh/180+1xh/180-1xh/180) = 36. The three animals can graze together for 36 days.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let

3. Cow alone:  (c – r) · 90 = S
4. Goat + Goose: (g + h – r) · 90 = S

Step 1.  Relate c and g.

(c + g – r)·45 = (c – r)·90
c + g – r = 2(c – r)
g = c – r.  (5)

Step 3.  Find c in terms of r.
Insert (5) and (7) into (4):

(g + h – r)·90 = (c – r)·90
g + h – r = c – r

Substitute g = c – r and h = (c – r)/2:

1.5c – 2.5r = c – r
0.5c – 1.5r = 0
c = 3r.  (8)

Then g = c – r = 2r and h = r.

Step 4.  Determine S.
From (3): S = (c – r)·90 = (2r)·90 = 180r.  (9)

Step 5.  Time for all three animals together.
Their total eating rate is c + g + h = 3r + 2r + r = 6r.
Net rate while all graze = 6r – r = 5r.

with the digits 1–9 each exactly once.

1.  Units digit  
   Since the product ends in 4, we need b·c ≡ 4 (mod 10).  
   With distinct non-zero digits and the digits 1,2,3,4,5 already fixed (1 in the multiplicand, 3 in the multiplier, 2 5 4 in the product), the only possible pair is {6, 9} because 6 × 9 = 54.

   So {b, c} = {6, 9}.  Two cases:

        (i)  b = 9, c = 6
        (ii) b = 6, c = 9

2.  Tens digit  
   Let q = ⌊bc/10⌋ = ⌊54/10⌋ = 5.  
   The tens digit of the whole product equals

        q + (a·c mod 10) + (3b mod 10)        (carry handled later)

   and must be 5.

   Case (i)  b = 9, c = 6  
        3b ≡ 27 ≡ 7 (mod 10).  
        a·c ≡ 6a (mod 10).  With remaining digits {7,8} for a,
            a = 7 ⇒ 5 + 2 + 7 = 14  → tens digit 4 (wrong)  
            a = 8 ⇒ 5 + 8 + 7 = 20  → tens digit 0 (wrong)  
        Hence case (i) is impossible.

   Case (ii) b = 6, c = 9  
        3b ≡ 18 ≡ 8 (mod 10).  
        a·c ≡ 9a (mod 10).  With a ∈ {7,8},
            a = 7 ⇒ 5 + 3 + 8 = 16  → tens digit 6 (wrong)  
            a = 8 ⇒ 5 + 2 + 8 = 15  → tens digit 5 (correct), carry 1.

   Thus a = 8, b = 6, c = 9.

3.  Hundreds digit  
   Compute 1ab × c = 186 × 9 = 1674.  
   Compute 1ab × 3 = 186 × 3 = 558, then shift one place (×10) → 5580.

For every i put  

kᵢ = the number of people that Pᵢ knows (counting Pᵢ himself/herself).

Because everyone knows himself/herself, 1 ≤ kᵢ ≤ n for every i.

Aim for contradiction: suppose all the numbers k₁ , … , kₙ are different.  
Since there are exactly n different integers between 1 and n, the multiset {kᵢ} must be {1,2,…,n} in some order.

Case 1.  Some person, say Pₐ, satisfies kₐ = n.  
Then Pₐ knows everybody.  In particular, for every j ≠ a we have “Pₐ knows Pⱼ”, and by the symmetry assumption (“if A knows B, then B knows A”) this implies “Pⱼ knows Pₐ”.  
Hence every Pⱼ (j ≠ a) knows at least two people: himself/herself and Pₐ, so kⱼ ≥ 2.  
Thus none of the kᵢ equals 1, contradicting that the set {kᵢ} contains every integer 1,2,…,n.

Case 2.  No one knows everybody, i.e. kᵢ ≠ n for all i.  
Then some kᵢ must be 1 (because the numbers 1,…,n are all supposed to appear).  
Pick such a person P_b with k_b = 1.  P_b knows only himself/herself.  
If some other person Pⱼ knew P_b, then by symmetry P_b would know Pⱼ as well, giving k_b ≥ 2, impossible.  
Therefore nobody knows P_b.  Consequently there cannot be a person who knows everybody (for that person would in particular have to know P_b).  Thus n is not among the kᵢ, contradicting again that {kᵢ} = {1,2,…,n}.

In both cases we reach a contradiction, so our initial assumption that all kᵢ are different is false.  Therefore at least two people at the party know the same number of people.

• a is the integer formed by the remaining k – 1 digits,  
• k is the total number of digits of N.  

Moving b to the left end produces  

M = b·10^{k-1} + a.

The condition in the problem is

M = 1.5 N = 3N/2.                                                (1)

Eliminate the fraction in (1):

2(b·10^{k-1} + a) = 3(10a + b)

⇒ 2b·10^{k-1} + 2a = 30a + 3b

⇒ 2b·10^{k-1} – 3b = 28a

⇒ b(2·10^{k-1} – 3) = 28a.                                    (2)

Hence a is an integer iff 28 divides b(2·10^{k-1} – 3).

Because b and 28 are coprime only with respect to their factors 2 and 7, study the residue of

C_k = 2·10^{k-1} – 3 (mod 28).

Compute powers of 10 modulo 28:

10^{1}≡10, 10^{2}≡16, 10^{3}≡20, 10^{4}≡4, 10^{5}≡12, 10^{6}≡8, 10^{7}≡24, …

Multiplying each by 2 and subtracting 3 gives

k        C_k (mod 28)  
2        17  
3        1  
4        9  
5        5  
6        21  
7        13 (then the 6-term cycle repeats)

Only C_k ≡ 0, 7, 14, 21 mod 28 can supply the factor 7 needed for divisibility by 28, and the first time that occurs is

k = 6 (C_6 ≡ 21).

With k = 6 the exact value is

2·10^{5} – 3 = 200 000 – 3 = 199 997.

Equation (2) becomes

a = b·199 997 / 28.

Since 199 997 = 7·28 571, we have

a = b·7·28 571 / 28 = b·28 571 / 4.                         (3)

For a to be an integer the denominator 4 must divide b, so b = 4 or 8.

• If b = 4: a = 4·28 571 / 4 = 28 571.  
  N = 10a + b = 285 710 + 4 = 285 714.

• If b = 8: a = 8·28 571 / 4 = 57 142.  
  N = 571 420 + 8 = 571 428.

Both six-digit numbers satisfy (1), but 285 714 is the smaller.

Verification for the smaller one:

Move the last digit 4 to the front: 428 571.  
Compute 1.5 × 285 714 = 428 571. ✔

No solution exists with fewer than six digits, because for k = 2,3,4,5 the factor C_k is indivisible by 7, making (2) impossible.

Therefore the smallest required number is

164,"Question: On the great ""Chilli"" lake of Madadia are two ferry boats that transport tourists from one side to the other.
One boat is the ""Lead Balloon"", the other is the ""Iceberg Magnet"".  They travel from the Kebab Fountains on the east side of the lake and the Lard Sculpture on the west side of the lake.
Each ferry travels at a constant speed, although the ""Lead Balloon"" is faster than the ""Iceberg Magnet"".
The two boats leave from opposite shores at the same time.  They pass at a point of 720 yards from Lard Sculptures.  Upon arriving at the opposite shore, each boat stays in its slip for 5 minutes, and then starts back. They pass again 400 yards from Kebab Fountains. Assume both boats travel along a straight line.  How far is it from Kebab Fountains to Lard Sculptures by water?

The ratio of the distance traveled by the two boats when they pass each other for the first time is:  (X - 720) / 720.
The ratio of the total distance traveled by the two boats when they pass each other for the second time is:  (2x - 400) / (X + 400).
Since the boats travel at a constant speed, the ratios are equal.
(X - 720) / 720 = (2X - 400) / (X + 400)

    v₁ = speed of the Lead Balloon (the faster boat),  
    v₂ = speed of the Iceberg Magnet (v₁ > v₂).

1.  First outward trip  
    The boats leave simultaneously, the Lead Balloon from L and the Iceberg Magnet from K.  
    They meet 720 yd from L, i.e.  D – 720 yd from K.  
    Since the travel times to the meeting point are equal,

                                720 / v₁  =  (D – 720) / v₂                 (1)

    Hence the speed ratio

                                v₁ / v₂  =  720 / (D – 720).                (2)

2.  Finishing the first crossing and the 5-minute lay-over  
    After meeting, the Lead Balloon still has D – 720 yd to go, the Iceberg Magnet 720 yd.  
    Arrival times at the opposite shores are

                        T₁ = 720/v₁ + (D – 720)/v₁ = D / v₁  (for the Lead Balloon)  
                        T₂ = (D – 720)/v₂ + 720/v₂   = D / v₂  (for the Iceberg Magnet).

    Because v₁ > v₂,  T₁ < T₂; the Lead Balloon reaches K first, but both boats wait 5 min
    before starting back.  Thus the departure instants for the return trip are

                        D_L = D/v₁ + 5 ,        D_I = D/v₂ + 5.

3.  Second meeting on the return trip  
    Coming back, the Lead Balloon travels from K toward L; the Iceberg Magnet from L toward K.  
    They meet 400 yd from K, i.e. D – 400 yd from L.

    Time from departure to this second meeting:

                        400 / v₁ = T  –  D_L,  
                  (D – 400)/v₂ = T  –  D_I,

    so eliminating T gives

                (D – 400)/v₂  –  400/v₁  =  D/v₁  –  D/v₂.                 (3)

4.  Two equations, one unknown  
    Use (2) to write v₁ = rv₂ with r = 720/(D – 720).  
    Insert this in (3); multiplying by v₂ and simplifying yields

                (D – 400)/r  –  400  =  D/r  –  D,

                ⇒        (D – 400)r  =  400D.                               (4)

    But r = 720/(D – 720), so (4) becomes

                (D – 400)(D – 720) = 400·720 = 288 000.

    Expand and simplify:

                D² – 1120D + 288 000 = 288 000  
                D² – 1120D = 0  
                D(D – 1120) = 0.

    Since D ≠ 0, we obtain

                                 D = 1120.

5.  Check the speed ratio  
    v₁ / v₂ = 720 / (1120 – 720) = 720 / 400 = 1.8 > 1,  
    agreeing with “Lead Balloon is faster.”

n = a+(a+1)+…+(a+k–1)        (k ≥ 2,   a ≥ 0)             (1)  

be a representation of n as a sum of k consecutive non-negative integers.  
Adding the k terms of the arithmetic progression gives  

n = k(2a+k–1)/2   ⟺   2n = k(2a+k–1).                    (2)

Condition (2) shows that k divides 2n.  Separate the two possible parities of k.

A.  k odd.  
Then k divides the left side 2n, but k is odd, so k must divide n itself.  
Write n = k·m (m integer).  Substituting in (2) and solving for a gives  

a = (n/k) – (k–1)/2 = m – (k–1)/2.                        (3)

Because k ≥ 3 implies (k–1)/2 < k ≤ n, m ≥ 1, and hence a ≥ 0.  
Thus, if n possesses an odd divisor k (>1), formula (3) supplies a valid a and
n can be written as a sum of k consecutive integers.

B.  k even.  
Put k = 2^s with s≥1.  Then the second factor 2a+k–1 in (2) is odd.  
Hence, when 2n is written as k · (odd), all powers of two occur in k
and the odd factor must equal 1:

2a+k–1 = 1   ⟹   2a = 2–k   ⟹   a = 1–k/2.                (4)

For k ≥ 2 this gives a ≤ 0, and a becomes non-negative only when k = 2 and a = 0.
So the only even-length presentation that can occur is the trivial one

n = 0 + 1                                                (5)

which represents n = 1.

Conclusions from A and B

• If n has an odd divisor k > 1, it is representable by (3).  
• If n is a power of two, its only odd divisor is 1, so case A is impossible;  
  in case B the only feasible k is 2, giving n = 1.  Hence every power of two
greater than 1 fails to have a representation with k ≥ 2.

Therefore a positive integer can be written as a sum of two or more consecutive
non-negative integers ⇔ it is not a power of 2.

The only power of two in that interval is 2¹⁰ = 1024.  All other numbers in

For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?
 Hint: Find numbers who do not have a duplicate that will be deleted",Find numbers who do not have a duplicate that will be deleted,"It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.
Hence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.
Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.

Secondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order.

Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.
Therefore total number of valid employee id's possible = 90 + 90 + 360 = 540.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let an employee–ID be any three–digit positive integer (so its first digit is 1–9).  
Two IDs are “identical” for our purposes when one is obtained from the other by reversing the order of its three digits.

Step 1.  Classify all 3–digit numbers.

A) Palindromes – numbers whose reverse equals themselves (e.g. 141).  
   For a 3–digit palindrome the first and last digits are the same.

   • First digit: 1–9  (9 possibilities)  
   • Middle digit: 0–9 (10 possibilities)

   Hence the number of palindromic IDs is  
   9 · 10 = 90.

B) Non-palindromes – all remaining 3-digit numbers.  
   There are 900 − 90 = 810 of them.

Step 2.  Form reversal classes.

• Each palindrome forms a class of size 1.  
• Each non-palindrome is paired with a distinct partner (its reverse), so every such class has size 2.

Therefore:

– 90 classes of size 1.  
– 810 / 2 = 405 classes of size 2.

Step 3.  Choose the maximum number of IDs with no duplicates.

From every class we may keep at most one representative.

Maximum total = 1·(number of size-1 classes) + 1·(number of size-2 classes)  
               = 90 + 405  
               = 495.

Step 4.  Achievability.

Select, for instance, every palindrome, and from each non-palindromic pair keep the numerically smaller member.  The chosen set has 495 IDs and contains no two that are reverses, so the upper bound is attained.

Hence the greatest possible number of employees that can be accommodated is 495.

171,"Question: Mad Ade was in his local news agents looking at the various magazines on display, He picked a copy of ""Kebabs and Me"" a copy of ""Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Nylon Underpants"" and a copy of ""Indoor Hang Gliding"". He passed the magazines to the shop keeper, who duly entered the amounts of each magazine into the till.  ""Wow, hang on a minute"" said Mad Ade.  ""You just pressed the multiplication button each time between amounts instead of the addition button.""  The shop keeper smiled with new false teeth and replied, ""it doesn't matter either way, it still comes to £5.70p"".
What were the prices of the magazines, that could either be multiplied or added to make £5.70
 Hint: Two of the prices should add to the third price and multiply to 2 to produce equality",Two of the prices should add to the third price and multiply to 2 to produce equality,"£2.85*£1.60*£1.25= £5.70
£2.85+£1.60+£1.25=£5.70",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the three magazine prices be a, b and c (in pounds).

1.  The clerk’s mistake means  
   a + b + c = a · b · c = 5.70.   (1)

2.  From the hint, choose the two cheaper prices so that  
   a + b = c and a · b = 2.   (2)

3.  Substitute c = a + b from (2) into the sum part of (1):

      a + b + c = a + b + (a + b) = 2(a + b) = 2c = 5.70  
      ⇒ c = 5.70 / 2 = 2.85.   (3)

4.  Now use a + b = 2.85 and a · b = 2.

    Let a be a root of x(2.85 − x) = 2:  
      x(2.85 − x) = 2  
      ⇒ 2.85x − x² = 2  
      ⇒ x² − 2.85x + 2 = 0.

    Solve the quadratic:  
      x = [2.85 ± √(2.85² − 4·2)] / 2  
      = [2.85 ± √(8.1225 − 8)] / 2  
      = [2.85 ± √0.1225] / 2  
      = [2.85 ± 0.35] / 2.

    Hence a = 1.60 and b = 1.25 (or vice-versa).

5.  Verification:

Both operations give £5.70 exactly, as required.

We want the number of unordered triples {a,b,c} (with a ≥ b ≥ c, a,b,c ∈ S) whose sum is 150.

Observation 1  
If a ≤ 48, then a + b + c ≤ 48 + 48 + 48 = 144 < 150, so a must be at least 50.  
Hence only a ∈ {60,57,54,51,50} need be considered.

For each possible a set R = 150 − a and solve b + c = R with b ≥ c, b,c ∈ S and b ≤ a.

1. a = 60 ⇒ R = 90  
   b,c must both be ≥ 30 and ≤ 60.  
   Pairs (c,b) giving 90 are  
        (30,60), (33,57), (36,54), (39,51), (40,50), (42,48), (45,45).  
   ⇒ 7 triples: (60,60,30), (60,57,33), (60,54,36), (60,51,39),  
                (60,50,40), (60,48,42), (60,45,45).

2. a = 57 ⇒ R = 93  
   b,c between 36 and 57.  
   Pairs: (36,57), (39,54), (42,51), (45,48).  
   ⇒ 4 triples: (57,57,36), (57,54,39), (57,51,42), (57,48,45).

3. a = 54 ⇒ R = 96  
   b,c between 42 and 54.  
   Pairs: (42,54), (45,51), (48,48).  
   ⇒ 3 triples: (54,54,42), (54,51,45), (54,48,48).

4. a = 51 ⇒ R = 99  
   b,c between 48 and 51.  
   Pair: (48,51).  
   ⇒ 1 triple: (51,51,48).

5. a = 50 ⇒ R = 100  
   Only possible with b = c = 50.  
   ⇒ 1 triple: (50,50,50).

No other a is large enough, so the enumeration is complete.

Counting the triples obtained:
7 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 16.

Thus there are exactly sixteen different unordered combinations of three dart scores that total 150, when only the numerical values of the darts are distinguished.

   For a normal magic square of order n the common sum is

So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote an equation on a rock:

If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.
If N=5 and A=1, then E=9. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
If N=2 and A=4, then E=6. R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.
If N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.
If N=2, then since R cannot be 5, R=8, L=5, and I=7.
If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.
Since 1+S+T equals 5 or 15, S+T equals 4 or 14. If S+T=14, then S and T must be 5 and 9, or 6 and 8, in some order. But each of our three scenarios has a letter for at least one of 5 and 9, as well as one for 8. So S+T=4, S and T are 1 and 3 in some order, and O+S=12.
If S=1, then O=11. But since each letter represents only one digit, S=3, T=1, and O=9.
If N=5, then A=1. But since T=1, this cannot work.
If N=4, then I=9. But since O=9, this cannot work.
We are left with one possible scenario:

The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""
And so it was.

Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
The judge guarantees Rᵢ = P for every i.  From (1):

P = i + 1/7 (Sᵢ − i)

Compute Sᵢ₊₁ in two ways.

•  From (3) using (4):

Sᵢ − i = 7P − 6i − i = 7(P − i),
so Sᵢ₊₁ = 6/7 · 7(P − i) = 6(P − i).                     (5)

Sᵢ₊₁ = 7P − 6(i + 1) = 7P − 6i − 6.                     (6)

Equate (5) and (6):

6(P − i) = 7P − 6i − 6  
⇒ 6P − 6i = 7P − 6i − 6  
⇒ −P = −6  
⇒ P = 6.                                                  (7)

So each girl must receive exactly 6 pearls.

4.  Determining the number of daughters
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For the last (k-th) daughter nothing is to remain afterwards, i.e. S_{k+1}=0.  
From (3):

0 = S_{k+1} = 6(P − k) = 6(6 − k)  
⇒ k = 6.                                                  (8)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  The initial number of pearls
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Put i = 1 in (4):

S₁ = 7P − 6·1 = 7·6 − 6 = 42 − 6 = 36.                   (9)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Verification
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Start with 36 pearls.

1st girl: takes 1, leaves 35, then 1/7 of 35 = 5 → receives 6, bag 30.  
2nd girl: takes 2, leaves 28, then 4 → receives 6, bag 24.  
3rd girl: takes 3, leaves 21, then 3 → receives 6, bag 18.  
4th girl: takes 4, leaves 14, then 2 → receives 6, bag 12.  
5th girl: takes 5, leaves 7,  then 1 → receives 6, bag 6.  
6th girl: takes 6, leaves 0,  then 0 → receives 6, bag 0.

Everything matches the rule; every girl gets 6 pearls and none are left.

At the same place it would cost $164.50 for 4 burgers, 10 shakes, and one order of fries. How much would it cost for an ordinary meal of one  burger, one shake, and one order of fries?

3b + 7s + f = 120
4b + 10s + f = 164.50
solving these two we get
b + 3s = 44.50
rewriting 3b +7s + f as
2b + b + 7s + f = 120
2(44.50 - 3s)+ b + 7s + f = 120
89 -6s + b + 7s + f = 120
b + s + f = 120 - 89 = 31",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

b = price of one burger  
s = price of one shake  
f = price of one order of fries  

From the two purchases described we obtain two linear equations:

1) 3b + 7s + f = 120  
2) 4b + 10s + f = 164.50  

Subtract (1) from (2) to eliminate f:

(4b − 3b) + (10s − 7s) = 164.50 − 120  
b + 3s = 44.50.            (3)

We want the cost of one ordinary meal:
T = b + s + f.

Solve (1) for f and substitute into T:

f = 120 − 3b − 7s  
T = b + s + f
   = b + s + (120 − 3b − 7s)
   = 120 − 2b − 6s.          (4)

Now use equation (3) (b = 44.50 − 3s) in (4):

T = 120 − 2(44.50 − 3s) − 6s
   = 120 − 89 + 6s − 6s
   = 31.

The s-terms cancel, so T is fixed no matter what the individual item prices are (provided they satisfy the original equations).

179,"Question: Weedy Willie was getting too old to work the land alone so he decided to divide his cornfield between himself and his four sons in proportion to their five work rates. He knew that Rastus, Wig, Twig and Swig together could plant a field of corn in five hours whereas Wig, Twig and Swig and himself together could manage the same task in six hours. So Weedy divided his field into a two-digit square number of parts and kept just one part for himself. Now, Wig, Twig and Swig were identical triplets so each received the same whole number of parts. How many parts did each son get?
 Hint: Let the work rates of the triplets combined (Wig, Twig and Swig), Rastus and Willie be x, y, z, respectively. Then
5(x + y) = 6(x + z)","Let the work rates of the triplets combined (Wig, Twig and Swig), Rastus and Willie be x, y, z, respectively. Then

5(x + y) = 6(x + z); Rastus received 9 parts and the triplets each got 13 parts.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the planting rates (in “fields per hour’’) be  

 x = rate of the three triplets together (Wig + Twig + Swig),  
 y = Rastus’s rate,  
 z = Weedy Willie’s rate.

From the data

 Rastus + triplets finish one field in 5 h ⇒ x + y = 1/5,  
 Willie + triplets finish one field in 6 h ⇒ x + z = 1/6.

Hence  

 5(x + y) = 6(x + z).   (1)

Because the field is to be divided in proportion to the five rates, each share must be proportional to the corresponding rate.  
Weedy Willie keeps exactly one part, so we shall scale all rates by the factor k = 1/z; then

 triplet share of each son = k·(x/3)  (there are three equal triplet shares),  
 Rastus’s share      = k·y,  
 Willie’s share      = k·z = 1.

Demand these four shares be whole numbers and that the total number of parts be a two-digit square.

1.  Express every share in one parameter.  
   Put x = 3t (t is the rate of one triplet).  
   From the two equations above

  y = 1/5 – 3t,  z = 1/6 – 3t    (with t < 1/18 so that all rates are positive).

2.  Scale so that Willie gets one part (k = 1/z).  
   Then

  triplet share a = t / z = 6t / (1 – 18t),  
  Rastus’s share b = y / z = 6(1 – 15t) / 5(1 – 18t).

3.  Require a to be a positive integer.  Write a = 6t / (1 – 18t).  Solving for t gives  

  t = a / [6(1 + 3a)].  

   Substituting this t in b yields  

  b = (6 + 3a)/5.

   Hence (6 + 3a) must be divisible by 5, i.e. 3a ≡ 4 (mod 5), so a ≡ 3 (mod 5).  
   Let a = 5k + 3 (k ≥ 0 integer); then b = 3(a + 2)/5 = 3k + 3.

4.  Total number of parts  

  N = 3a + b + 1 = 3(5k + 3) + (3k + 3) + 1  
    = 18k + 13.

   N must be a two-digit perfect square: 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81.  
   Solve 18k + 13 = square:

  18k + 13 = 49 ⇒ k = 2.

   No other k gives a square in that list.

5.  Substitute k = 2:

  a = 5·2 + 3 = 13,  b = 3·2 + 3 = 9,  N = 49.

Thus the field is cut into 49 equal parts; Willie keeps 1 part; the sons receive:

 Rastus  9 parts,  
 Wig   13 parts,  
 Twig  13 parts,  
 Swig  13 parts.

2, 4, and 6 cannot be in the one's place because that would make the number divisible by 2. 5 cannot also be in the ones place because that would make it divisible by 5. Thus, the sum of the primes is 10(2+4+5+6+2+4+5) + 1+3+7+9+1+3+9 = 313
It is also possible to figure out the prime numbers, although that will probably take longer than 30 seconds.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"First put the data in the form required by the hint.  
Any two–digit integer can be written 10t + u where  

• t = the ten’s digit  
• u = the unit’s digit.  

The multiset of digits that must be used is  

1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,7,9,9.

Because we must make seven two–digit primes, we need  

• seven ten’s digits (one for each prime)  
• seven unit digits (one for each prime).

1.  Which digits can appear in the unit (ones) place?  
   A two-digit prime cannot be even and cannot end in 5, so u must be 1, 3, 7 or 9.  
   The available counts of these digits are  
   1(×2), 3(×2), 7(×1), 9(×2) – exactly seven digits.  
   Therefore the seven units digits are forced to be  

   1,1,3,3,7,9,9.                                     (1)

2.  Which digits must be ten’s digits?  
   The remaining seven digits 2,2,4,4,5,5,6 must all be ten’s digits.           (2)

3.  List the primes obtainable with each ten’s digit:  

   t = 2 → 21, 23, 27, 29 (primes: 23, 29)  
   t = 4 → 41, 43, 47, 49 (primes: 41, 43, 47)  
   t = 5 → 51, 53, 57, 59 (primes: 53, 59)  
   t = 6 → 61, 63, 67, 69 (primes: 61, 67)

4.  Distribute the unit-digit multiset (1) over the ten-digit multiset (2) so that every pair 10t+u is prime and all digits are used exactly once.

   • The two t = 2 numbers must be distinct primes, hence 23 and 29.  
     (units 3 and 9 now used once each.)

   • The two t = 5 numbers must be distinct primes, hence 53 and 59.  
     (another 3 and another 9 now used – the required two 3’s and two 9’s are now exhausted.)

   • The remaining units still to be placed are 1,1,7.  
     – For t = 6 the only prime with unit 1 or 7 is 61 or 67.  
       Choosing 67 would consume the only 7, leaving two 1’s still needed,  
       but t = 4 has only one prime ending in 1 (namely 41) – duplication would occur.  
       Therefore t = 6 must give 61 (unit 1).  

     – The two t = 4 primes must therefore use units 1 and 7, i.e. 41 and 47.

5.  The seven distinct primes obtained are

   23, 29, 53, 59, 41, 47, 61.

   All digit counts are satisfied and every number is prime, so this set is unique.

6.  Sum of the seven primes:

   23 + 29 = 52  
   52 + 53 = 105  
   105 + 59 = 164  
   164 + 41 = 205  
   205 + 47 = 252

If you were to draw a circle that were to intersect these two lines at points A and B and only at points A and B, what would be the smallest integral size of the larger arc AB in degrees?
 Hint: Integral means ""in integers"".
An arc is a portion of a circle.","Integral means ""in integers"".
An arc is a portion of a circle.","181 degrees.
If you created a circle with points A, B, and O on it, since angle AOB is a right angle, line AB is the diameter of this circle.  Therefore, arc AB would be 180 degrees if it actually were to intersect O as well as A and B.
However, the problem says the arc can only intersect A and B. To do this, the circle must be slightly larger than the one described above. As stated in the problem, the larger arc must be the next largest integer size, which is 181 degrees.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Because AO and BO are perpendicular, take them as the x- and y-axes with intersection at the origin O.

Let the required circle have centre C(h , k) and radius r.  
Since the circle is to meet the x-axis (AO) in exactly one point A, AO must be tangent to the circle; hence the perpendicular distance from C to the x-axis equals the radius:

|k| = r.                                 …(1)

Similarly BO (the y-axis) is tangent at the single point B, so

|h| = r.                                 …(2)

Thus |h| = |k| = r, so the centre must be one of the four points  
(r , r), (r , –r), (–r , r) or (–r , –r).

For every such centre the points of tangency are

A = (h , 0), B = (0 , k).

Now form the radii CA and CB:

CA = (0 , –k), CB = (–h , 0).

Their dot product is

CA · CB = (0)(–h) + (–k)(0) = 0,

so CA ⟂ CB; the central angle ∠ACB is 90° for every admissible circle.

Hence the smaller arc AB has measure 90°, and the larger arc AB has measure

360° – 90° = 270°.

Because this value is already an integer, it is the smallest integral size possible for the larger arc.

Y=(Y/3 - 2) + 52 (score at end of second quarter)

1. Second quarter  
   Points scored in the 2nd quarter = S₂ − S₁.  
   The problem says this equals “½ of their score at the end of the 2nd, less 1,” i.e. ½ S₂ − 1.

   So S₂ − 27 = ½ S₂ − 1  
   ⇒ S₂ − ½ S₂ = 26  
   ⇒ ½ S₂ = 26  
   ⇒ S₂ = 52.

   (Check: scored 52 − 27 = 25 points; ½·52 − 1 = 26 − 1 = 25 ✓)

Kurt finally gave in, and agreed to go in with Rod on a minimum special order of the multi-colored treats.  When the box arrived, they divided the bounty as originally planned.
""Interesting,"" Kurt noted, ""that the number of Rnkfurers you got is the same integer as my percentage.""
Rod did a little mental math.  ""You're right,"" he noted, ""and I think that's the lowest pair of integers we could do that with.""
""Maybe; the next largest set is trivial.  50 Rnkfurers each, and then we'd each have the percentage the other guy got: 50% and 50 Rnkfurers each.""

Thus 100 – R must divide R².  
Write d = 100 – R (so 1 ≤ d ≤ 99 and R = 100 – d).  
Equation (2) requires d | (100 – d)² ; but  

(100 – d)² = 10000 – 200d + d² ≡ 10000 (mod d),

Interpret the juxtaposition of letters as the two–digit number 10×(first-letter) + (second-letter).

Step 1.  Use equation 4 in equation 1  
Equation 4 gives C = F·A.  
Equation 1 is (10F + A)·A = 10C + F.  
Substituting C and expanding: (10F + A)A = 10FA + F ⇒ 10FA + A² = 10FA + F ⇒ A² = F.  
With digits 1–8, the only square that stays in this range and does not repeat a letter is A = 2, F = 4.  
Then C = F·A = 4·2 = 8.

Step 2.  Use equation 2 with A = 2 and G = 1  
(10D + 1)·2 = 10B + 2 ⇒ 20D + 2 = 10B + 2 ⇒ 20D = 10B ⇒ B = 2D.  
Distinct digits force D = 3 (because 1 is already G, 2 already A, 4 already F), giving B = 6.

Step 3.  Solve equation 3 with D = 3  
H·E = 10D + H ⇒ H·E = 30 + H ⇒ H(E – 1) = 30.  
The two remaining unused digits are 5 and 7; only H = 5 and E = 7 satisfy 5(7 – 1) = 30.

Step 4.  Collect the assignments  
A = 2, B = 6, C = 8, D = 3, E = 7, F = 4, G = 1, H = 5.

F·A = 4·2 = 8 = C ✔

Three is the smallest number whose product is greater than its sum.  Therefore you want to include as many 3's in the answer as possible.  Then make 2's (or 4's) out of the remainder.
20 / 3 = 6, remainder 2 so 3^6 x 2",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"We want a multiset of positive integers whose sum is 20 and whose product is as large as possible.

Step 1.  Eliminate 1’s.  
If a 1 appears together with any k ≥ 2, replace the pair (1,k) by (k+1).  
The sum is unchanged, and since (k+1) > k, the product strictly increases.  
Hence a maximum–product decomposition contains no 1’s.

Step 2.  Break up any part ≥ 5.  
For k ≥ 5 we have 3·(k–3) = 3k–9 > k, so replacing k by (3, k–3) keeps the sum and increases the product.  
Iterating this shows that every term in an optimal decomposition must be 2, 3, or 4.

Step 3.  Compare 4 with 2’s.  
Because 4 = 2+2 and 2·2 = 4, exchanging a 4 for two 2’s never decreases the product and may later allow more favorable rearrangements.  We may therefore assume no 4’s are present; every part is 2 or 3.

Step 4.  Prefer 3’s to triples of 2’s.  
With equal sum 6 we have 3·3 = 9 > 2·2·2 = 8.  
Thus an optimal decomposition cannot contain three 2’s, for they could be replaced by two 3’s and give a larger product.  Consequently at most two 2’s can appear.

Step 5.  Determine the exact counts from the sum.  
Write 20 = 3q + r with 0 ≤ r < 3.  We get  
20 = 3·6 + 2,  so q = 6 and r = 2.

• If r = 0 we would take only 3’s.  
• If r = 1 we would change one (3,1) into (2,2) to avoid a 1.  
• If r = 2 we simply add one 2.

Here r = 2, so the optimal multiset is six 3’s and one 2.

Step 6.  Compute the product.  
P = 3^6 · 2 = 729 · 2 = 1458.

Step 7.  Check all other admissible patterns.  
Any other decomposition must contain (i) at least one 4 (convertible to 2’s), or  
(ii) three or more 2’s (convertible to 3’s), or  
(iii) a term ≥ 5 (split in Step 2), all of which strictly reduce the product compared with the arrangement found above.  Hence no larger product exists.

      ---------------
        e  f  g  h  i         (5 digits)

Because 5·abcd has five digits, d must give a carry that creates the
extra digit.  The product 5·abcd ends in the digit i.  
The hint says i = 5, so 5·d ≡ 5 (mod 10), i.e. d ∈ {1,3,5,7,9}.  
Digit 5 is already used as i, so d ≠ 5; thus d ∈ {1,3,7,9}.

Case d = 1  
 5·1 = 5, no carry.  
 For the next digit we need 5·c to be 1–9 and different from 5, but
 5·c is 0 or 5 for every c∈{2,3,4,6,7,8,9}.  Impossible.  
Hence d ≠ 1.

So d ∈ {3,7,9}.  Proceed with d = 3 (the other two cases will fail in the
same way and therefore need not be pursued once a solution is found).

   Selecting a digit c different from {3,5} and not giving 0 or 5:
  c = 2 works, because 5·2 + 1 = 11 → h = 1, carry₂ = 1.

3.  Hundreds:
  g = (5·b + carry₂) mod 10,  carry₃ = ⌊(5·b + 1)/10⌋.

   Choose b ∉ {1,2,3,5}.  
  b = 7 gives 5·7 + 1 = 36 → g = 6, carry₃ = 3 (digit 6 is unused).

4.  Thousands and ten-thousands:
  f = (5·a + carry₃) mod 10,  carry₄ = ⌊(5·a + 3)/10⌋,
  e = carry₄.

   Remaining available digits for a are {4,8,9}.

   • a = 4 → 5·4 + 3 = 23 → f = 3 (duplicate of d).  Reject.  
   • a = 8 → 5·8 + 3 = 43 → f = 3 (duplicate).  Reject.  
   • a = 9 → 5·9 + 3 = 48 → f = 8 (new), carry₄ = 4 (new).

All digits are now accounted for and are distinct:

 Small number abcd = 9 7 2 3 = 9723  
 Large number efghi = 4 8 6 1 5 = 48615

Things were a little different those days, and the employment of labourers' wives and children was commonplace, although Nastee did not allow any woman to work without her husband. Also, at least half the men working came with their wives.

3. “No woman works without her husband”: each working woman’s husband is one of the labouring men ⇒ w ≤ m.

4. “At least half the men came with their wives”: at least half the men have wives working ⇒ w ≥ ½m.

Eliminate c.  
Subtract (1) from (2):

(5m + 4w + c) − (m + w + c) = 200 − 100

Solve (3) in integers and impose the husband-wife conditions.

From (3): 4m = 100 − 3w ⇒ 100 − 3w must be divisible by 4.  
Since 100 ≡ 0 (mod 4), we need 3w ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ w ≡ 0 (mod 4).  
Write w = 4k (k an integer, k ≥ 0).

Substitute in (3):

4m + 3(4k) = 100

m + 3k = 25 ⇒ m = 25 − 3k.                            (4)

Non-negativity: 25 − 3k ≥ 0 ⇒ k ≤ 8.  
Now apply the husband-wife inequalities.

(i)  w ≤ m  ⇒ 4k ≤ 25 − 3k  ⇒ 7k ≤ 25  ⇒ k ≤ 3.      (5)  
(ii) w ≥ ½m ⇒ 4k ≥ ½(25 − 3k)  
     ⇒ 8k ≥ 25 − 3k  ⇒ 11k ≥ 25  ⇒ k ≥ 3.            (6)

From (5) and (6): k = 3.

Hence  
w = 4k = 12,  
m = 25 − 3k = 16.

c = 100 − m − w = 100 − 16 − 12 = 72.

He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?
 Hint: You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let

Each of the three given sentences is an implication (P → Q).  
An implication is true except in the single case “P is true and Q is false.”  
Hence, for every candidate n we must guarantee that each implication is true.

Write the three statements formally and also their contrapositives (often more useful):

1) (n is NOT a multiple of 4)  →  (60 ≤ n ≤ 69)  
 Contrapositive:  If n ∉ [60, 69] then n IS a multiple of 4. … (A)

2) (n IS a multiple of 3)  →  (50 ≤ n ≤ 59)  
 Contrapositive:  If n ∉ [50, 59] then n is NOT a multiple of 3. … (B)

3) (n is NOT a multiple of 6) → (70 ≤ n ≤ 79)  
 Contrapositive:  If n ∉ [70, 79] then n IS a multiple of 6. … (C)

Because all numbers mentioned in the problem lie between 50 and 79, examine the three disjoint intervals 50–59, 60–69, and 70–79.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
I.  n ∈ [50, 59]

• From (A):  n ∉ [60, 69]  ⇒  n divisible by 4.  
• From (C):  n ∉ [70, 79]  ⇒  n divisible by 6.  

Thus n must be divisible by lcm(4,6)=12 while lying in 50–59.  
There is no multiple of 12 in that interval (48 is too small, 60 is too large).  
So no solution here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
II. n ∈ [60, 69]

• From (B):  n ∉ [50, 59]  ⇒  n not divisible by 3.  
• From (C):  n ∉ [70, 79]  ⇒  n divisible by 6.

But “divisible by 6” automatically means “divisible by 3,” contradicting  
“not divisible by 3.”  Hence no solution here either.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
III. n ∈ [70, 79]

• From (A):  n ∉ [60, 69]  ⇒  n divisible by 4.  
• From (B):  n ∉ [50, 59]  ⇒  n not divisible by 3.  
(The third implication is automatically satisfied because its conclusion
‘70–79’ is already true.)

So we need a number in 70–79 that is
 (a) divisible by 4, and  
 (b) not divisible by 3.

Numbers in 70–79 divisible by 4: 72, 76.  
72 is divisible by 3, disallowed.  
76 is NOT divisible by 3, so 76 meets both conditions.

Verification for n = 76

1) 76 is a multiple of 4 ⇒ antecedent “not a multiple of 4” is false → statement true.  
2) 76 is not a multiple of 3 ⇒ antecedent false → statement true.  
3) 76 is not a multiple of 6 (indeed 76/6 not integer) and 76 is between 70 and 79 ⇒ statement true.

192,"Question: Little Johnny was at it again.
His big brother had some small race cars that he wanted to play with, and his brother did not want him to have them.
Finally, he made a deal with Little Johnny.  If he could figure out the math problem that his teacher had given them that afternoon, he'd let him have the cars for a week.
The problem was to figure out the following.
IT + TAKES + A + LITTLE = EFFORT
The numbers 0-9 are used and the teacher had already told them that A = 9 and E = 7.  Little Johnny's brother could not figure it out, so he knew that he'd be safe.
Ten minutes later, Little Johnny's mother was watching while his big brother grudgingly gave up his cars for a week.
Can you figure out what the letters represent, like Little Johnny?

E = 7
S = 4

So,
81 + 19274 + 9 + 681167 = 700531",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"The addition must be written with the words right-justified:

    --------------
      E F F O R T

Hence the six columns (from right to left) are:

1) units : T + S + A + E = T  (mod 10)  
2) tens  : I + E + L + carry₁ = R (mod 10)  
3) hundreds : K + T + carry₂ = O (mod 10)  
4) thousands : A + T + carry₃ = F (mod 10)  
5) ten-thousands : T + I + carry₄ = F + 10  
6) hundred-thousands : L + carry₅ = E.

Given A = 9, E = 7 and the hint L = 6.

Column 1  
T + S + 9 + 7 = T + 10 carry₁  
⇒ S + 16 = 10 carry₁.  
The only possible integral solution is S = 4 and carry₁ = 2.

Column 2  
I + 7 + 6 + 2 = R + 10 carry₂  
⇒ I + 15 = R + 10 carry₂.  
The admissible (distinct-digit) possibilities are  
(I, R, carry₂) ∈ {(0, 5, 1), (3, 8, 1), (5, 0, 2), (8, 3, 2)}.

Column 6  
L + carry₅ = E ⇒ 6 + carry₅ = 7 ⇒ carry₅ = 1.

Column 5  
T + I + carry₄ = F + 10 carry₅ = F + 10  
⇒ T + I + carry₄ = 10 + F.            (1)

Column 4  
9 + T + carry₃ = F + 10 carry₄.       (2)

Equating the two expressions for F gives  
T + I + carry₄ − 10 = 9 + T + carry₃ − 10 carry₄  
⇒ I + 11 carry₄ − carry₃ = 19.        (3)

Because carry₃ can only be 0 or 1, equation (3) forces carry₄ = 1 and I = 8, carry₃ = 0.  
Thus only the trio (I, R, carry₂) = (8, 3, 2) survives.

With carry₄ = 1, equation (1) yields F = T − 1.   (4)

Column 3 now gives  
K + T + 2 = O  (since carry₂ = 2 and carry₃ = 0) and K + T + 2 < 10. (5)

The digits unused so far are 0,1,2,5.  
Because of (4), T cannot be 0, and T must be at least 1.  
Trying T = 1 → F = 0 and (5) becomes K + 3 = O with K < 7.  
Choosing the still-available K = 2 gives O = 5, all digits distinct.

Trying T = 2 would make F = 1, but then (5) requires K + 4 = O with K < 6; the only possible K would be 0, already taken by F, so this fails.

Hence the only consistent assignment is

T = 1 F = 0 K = 2 O = 5.

Collecting every letter:

A = 9 E = 7 F = 0 I = 8 K = 2  
L = 6 O = 5 R = 3 S = 4 T = 1.

A        = 9  
LITTLE   = 681167

The sum is correct and all ten digits 0–9 are used exactly once.

194,"Question: Difficult Danny has acquired his nickname (and some other, less polite nicknames) due to the fact that, whenever he buys anything, he insists upon paying the exact amount, with precisely 100 pieces of currency. Danny wanted an xCube365 (it lasts 365 days before programmatically disabling itself, so that a new one must be purchased), the highly coveted gaming system that had just been released. It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?
 Hint: First, see if there is a denomination that is not used. If so, figure out which denomination that is","First, see if there is a denomination that is not used. If so, figure out which denomination that is","Can at least one of each denomination be used? That totals $186 with only 6 bills, plus at least $94 with the rest of the bills. This is too high. Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.
If a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities. So $100 bill is the denomination that is not used. We now know that at least one of each of the other bills is used. That totals $86 with 5 bills, leaving 95 bills to make the other $144.

1.  Perimeter condition  
   a + b + c = n.

2.  Area condition (Heron’s formula)  
   Let s = n/2.  
   Area² = s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c) = n².

   Thus

          s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c) = (2s)² = 4s²
          (s − a)(s − b)(s − c)  = 4s.          (1)

3.  Set  

          x = s − a, y = s − b, z = s − c,

   so x, y, z are positive integers.

          x + y + z = s,                               (2)
          xyz        = 4s.                             (3)

   Combining (2) and (3):

          xyz = 4(x + y + z).                          (4)

4.  Bounding the smallest of x, y, z.  
   Without loss of generality let x ≤ y ≤ z.  
   From (4), xyz = 4(x + y + z) ≤ 12z, hence xy ≤ 12.  
   Therefore x² ≤ xy ≤ 12 ⇒ x ≤ 3.  
   So only x = 1, 2, 3 need be examined.

5.  Solving (4).

   •  x = 1 → (y−4)(z−4) = 20  
      ⇒ (y, z) = (5,24), (6,14), (8,9).

   •  x = 2 → (y−2)(z−2) = 8  
      ⇒ (y, z) = (3,10), (4,6).

   •  x = 3 gives no new (ordered) solutions; they reorder to cases above.

   The corresponding s = x + y + z and perimeters p = 2s are:

        (1,5,24):  s = 30  → p = 60
        (1,6,14):  s = 21  → p = 42
        (1,8,9):   s = 18  → p = 36
        (2,3,10):  s = 15  → p = 30
        (2,4,6):   s = 12  → p = 24

   Hence, with at most 50 matches, the only admissible perimeters
   (matches-counts) are 24, 30, 36, 42.

6.  Mad Ade’s requirement  
   Initially he has n matches; after removing 6 he has n − 6; after removing
   another 6 he has n − 12.  All three numbers must belong to {24, 30, 36, 42}.

   Checking:

        n = 42  → 42, 36, 30  (all admissible)
        n = 36  → 36, 30, 24  (all admissible)
        n = 30  → 30, 24, 18  (18 not admissible)
        n = 24  → 24, 18, 12  (18,12 not admissible)

   Therefore only n = 42 or n = 36 work, both below the 50-match capacity.

On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table.

If the criminal chose a poisoned candy, he died. If he chose a pure candy, he lived.
The criminal's remaining life expectancy divided by his prison sentence would be the number of candies George would bring him, one of which might kill him. In the case of Joe:

────────────────────────────────────────
1.  Why the weights must form a geometric progression  
────────────────────────────────────────
The hint says “there is a common ratio.”  
Suppose the common ratio is r (>1) and take

 w₂ = r, w₃ = r², w₄ = r³.  (2)

(So the set of weights is 1, r, r², r³.)

With a balance scale we may put any chosen weights on the same pan as the wheat (to be added) and any on the opposite pan (to be subtracted).  
If εk ∈ {-1, 0, 1} is the coefficient telling whether rᵏ is placed on the left (εk = 1), not used (εk = 0) or on the right (εk = –1), then weighing an integer mass m kg amounts to writing

 m = ε₀·1 + ε₁·r + ε₂·r² + ε₃·r³  with each εk ∈ {-1, 0, 1}. (3)

Thus every integer from 1 up to the maximum possible mass is representable in the
“balanced base-r” digit system when the digits are restricted to –1,0,1.

For which r does this balanced representation cover all integers consecutively, without gaps?

If r = 2  
The balanced binary digits (-1,0,1) cannot represent the integer 2 itself (because the only combinations give ±1, ±3, ±5, …). Hence r = 2 fails.

If r ≥ 4  
Even the number 2 again cannot be expressed with digits ‑1,0,1 (the smallest positive values obtainable are 1 and r-1 ≥ 3). Hence every r ≥ 4 also fails.

Therefore the only integral base that allows every positive integer to be expressed with digits from {-1,0,1} is

 r = 3.  (4)

2.  The explicit weights

Insert r = 3 into (2):

 w₁ = 1, w₂ = 3, w₃ = 9, w₄ = 27.  (5)

─────────────────────────────────
3.  Verification of completeness
─────────────────────────────────
With four weights 1, 3, 9, 27 the largest mass attainable is

 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40,  (6)

and, because balanced ternary gives a unique expansion using digits ‑1,0,1, every integer from 1 through 40 is achievable.  A few samples illustrate:

1 = 1  
2 = 3 – 1  
4 = 3 + 1  
8 = 9 – 1  
15 = 27 – 9 – 3  
25 = 27 – 1  
40 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1.

All other numbers 1–40 are handled similarly by their balanced-ternary expansions.

200,"Question: Mad Ade has bought a mixed packet of nuts which contains 1 pound of walnuts and 2 pounds of Brazil nuts. It costs £1.98.  Mad Ade noticed that a packet containing 4 pounds of filberts and 1 pound of walnuts costs £2.48. And for £2.99, Mad Ade can buy a mixed packet containing 3 pounds of almonds, 1 pound of walnuts, and 1 pound of filberts.  Whilst looking at the nudie mags on the top shelf of the shop Mad Ade wondered exactly how much a packet containing 1 pound of each type of nut would cost
 Hint: It is impossible to find the cost of each nut individually",It is impossible to find the cost of each nut individually,"It is impossible to work out the cost per pound of each of the different nuts. However, the cost of various combinations can be worked out.  If you combine 3 packets of the first kind with 1 packet of the second kind and 2 of the third packet, you get 6 pounds  for £14.40.  A mixture of 1 pound of each, therefore, should cost you (£14.40 / 6) = £2.40 . Mad Ade paid with a five pound note and bought a copy of ""Kebab Fanciers Weekly"" with the change",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

W = price (in £) of 1 lb of walnuts  
B = price (in £) of 1 lb of Brazil nuts  
F = price (in £) of 1 lb of filberts  
A = price (in £) of 1 lb of almonds  

The three packets give the equations  

(1) W + 2B = 1.98  
(2) W + 4F = 2.48  
(3) W +  F + 3A = 2.99  

We are asked for  
S = W + B + F + A.

Because there are only three equations for four unknowns, the individual prices cannot be determined (as the hint states).  
However, S can be found by forming a suitable linear combination of the given equations.

Choose constants c₁, c₂, c₃ so that  

c₁(1,2,0,0) + c₂(1,0,4,0) + c₃(1,0,1,3) = (1,1,1,1),

where each ordered quadruple lists the coefficients of (W, B, F, A).

Matching coordinates gives  
2c₁ = 1 ⇒ c₁ = ½,  
3c₃ = 1 ⇒ c₃ = ⅓,  
4c₂ + c₃ = 1 ⇒ 4c₂ + ⅓ = 1 ⇒ c₂ = 1⁄6,  
and the walnut coefficient checks automatically: ½ + 1⁄6 + ⅓ = 1.

Now apply the same combination to the prices:

S = ½(£1.98) + 1⁄6(£2.48) + ⅓(£2.99)
  = £0.99 + £0.4133… + £0.9966…
  = £2.40.

Thus a packet containing 1 lb of each kind of nut must cost £2.40, even though the individual prices remain indeterminate.

201,"Question: Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Snow, there lived the fair Princess Miyuki, who had always been fascinated by fairy tales and the stories of the wonders of the world. She believed that her sleeping, handsome prince was cursed to be one of the mummies in the pyramids of Egypt, and when she was done being Fantaghiro-saving-her-Romualdo, her prince would then build a beautiful palace as a monument of their love (which of course would be more beautiful than Taj Mahal) where both of them will live happily ever after...
So, you see, that's why Princess Miyuki had refused each and every love declaration or marriage proposal that came her way.
But of course, what's a story without the brave and wise heroic prince? Here comes Prince Hajikidama of the Marbles Kingdom. He's no mummy, but his brilliant(?) brain deduced that in order to win the princess' heart, he'd have to give her what she wanted most - her fantasy, and his token of understanding (her childish delusional nature).
In the end, labouring his mind's creativity department for all its worth, Prince Hajikidama decided that a 'Mountain of Love', reaching so high it collected the never-fallen-snow in Marbles Kingdom, might do the trick. That actually is a tetrahedral-shaped (pyramid with 4 equilateral triangular faces) crystallic marbles-made structure (like a giant pile of apples or oranges at a greengrocer's store) consisting of one marble crowning on the top layer, three on the next-to-top layer, six on the third layer, ten on the fourth layer, and so forth. If there are exactly 1,000,000 layers, specify the total number of marbles needed in the construction of entire mountain.

Hence, with N layers, the total number of marbles is the sum of the first N triangular numbers

(The same result is the combinatorial number C(N+2,3), often called the N-th tetrahedral number.)

For N = 1,000,000,

""My answer is right, and I want my three points!"" the blond one cried.

""He's wrong,"" the other one insisted.  ""My answer is right!""

""Yours, probably.  Mr. Collins is at a conference for the weekend, and Monette took his math class.  It looks like she handed back an exam.""
""I teach math.  Can I help?""
All three talked at once; Monette was as frustrated as the two students.  While they jabbered, Corman managed to read the problem in question:
""My house is built on a strangely-shaped lot, so my back yard is a right triangle with an area of 840 square feet.  Each of the three sides measures an integral number of feet.  If I want to stake my dog so that he can reach the entire yard, how long must his rope be?""
Monette finally pulled rank on the adolescents.  ""It's not really your problem, but I'd be glad of some help.  Mr. Collins marked their papers wrong; their answers don't match his.

From the students' comments, we know that the Collins yard has the middle-sized hypotenuse.
A right triangle inscribes neatly into a semicircle, with the hypotenuse forming a diameter.  The shortest rope needed to reach all points is one staked at the midpoint of the hypotenuse, forming a radius of the circle.  74/2 = 37 feet.
The blond student found the first answer above, and would have used a rope of 29 feet.  The other student figured it at 113/2, or 56.5 feet.
Historical note:
Lewis Carroll searched for the answer to the basic mathematical problem, sent to him by a reader.  He found two right triangles with the same area, but couldn't discover a set of three.  Somewhat ironically, Carroll had found 20-21-29 and 12-35-37.  Had he doubled their dimensions, he would have had the first two triangles above, and quite likely would have found the third.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the perpendicular sides of the right–triangle yard be x ft and y ft (x ≤ y).  
Because the area is 840 ft²,

  xy / 2 = 840  ⇒  xy = 1680  (1)

and because the triangle is right and all three sides are integral,

  x² + y² = z² for some integer z.  (2)

The standard description of a Pythagorean triple is

  x = k(2mn), y = k(m² – n²), z = k(m² + n²)  (3)

where  

• m > n are coprime, of opposite parity,  
• k is a positive integer, and  
• the two expressions for x and y may be interchanged.

Substituting (3) into the area condition (1) gives  

  [k(2mn)] · [k(m² – n²)] = 1680  
  k²·mn·(m² – n²) = 840.  (4)

Factor 840 = 2³·3·5·7.  
Because k² divides 840, the only possibilities for k are 1 or 2
(4 and every larger perfect square contain a fourth power of 2 or a factor 9, neither of which divides 840).

––––––––––––––––  
1.  k = 1  

Now mn(m² – n²) = 840.  
Run through coprime (m,n) of opposite parity until the product reaches 840:

 n = 7, m = 8: mn = 56, m² – n² = 15, 56·15 = 840.

This gives the primitive triple  

 x = 15, y = 112, z = 113.

––––––––––––––––  
2.  k = 2 (so k² = 4)  

Then mn(m² – n²) = 210.

(a) n = 1, m = 6: mn = 6, m² – n² = 35, 6·35 = 210.

  x = 2·(2·6·1) = 24, y = 2·(35) = 70, z = 2·(36 + 1) = 74.

(b) n = 2, m = 5: mn = 10, m² – n² = 21, 10·21 = 210.

  x = 2·(2·5·2) = 40, y = 2·(21) = 42, z = 2·(25 + 4) = 58.

No other (m,n) pairs satisfy the product condition, so these three triples are the only ones whose legs multiply to 1680.

Thus the only right-triangle yards with integer sides and area 840 ft² are

 (15, 112, 113)   (24, 70, 74)   (40, 42, 58).

For a right triangle, the circum-centre (and hence the stake giving the least rope) is the midpoint of the hypotenuse, so the required rope length is one-half of the hypotenuse:

 (15, 112, 113) ⇒ rope = 113 ⁄ 2 = 56.5 ft  
 (24, 70, 74)  ⇒ rope = 74 ⁄ 2 = 37 ft  
 (40, 42, 58)  ⇒ rope = 58 ⁄ 2 = 29 ft.

Exactly three rope lengths are possible.

In the story the blond student’s answer is “8 ft shorter” than the value on Mr Collins’s key, and the other student’s answer is “a lot longer.”  
Since 37 ft – 29 ft = 8 ft while 56.5 ft is far longer, Mr Collins’s key must have given the middle value.

206,"Question: Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)
 Hint: Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

x = number of $0.20 price‐reductions made from the present $5.95 price  
(one reduction ⇒ x = 1, an increase of $0.20 would mean x = –1, etc.).

Price after x reductions  
P(x) = 5.95 − 0.20x  (dollars per box)

At $5.95 they sell 100 boxes per week, and every $0.20 decrease adds 25 boxes, so

Quantity sold after x reductions  
Q(x) = 100 + 25x  (boxes per week)

The production/marketing cost per box is
cost = price − profit per box = 5.95 − 1.75 = $4.20,
and it is assumed constant.  
Hence profit per box when the price is P(x) is

π_box(x) = P(x) − 4.20 = (5.95 − 0.20x) − 4.20 = 1.75 − 0.20x.

Weekly profit function  
Π(x) = π_box(x) · Q(x)
      = (1.75 − 0.20x)(100 + 25x).

Expand:

Π(x) = 1.75·100 + 1.75·25x − 0.20x·100 − 0.20x·25x  
      = 175 + 43.75x − 20x − 5x²  
      = −5x² + 23.75x + 175.

This is a downward-opening parabola; its maximum occurs at the vertex

x* = −b/(2a) = −23.75 / (2·(−5)) = 2.375.

Thus the optimal number of $0.20 reductions is 2.375.

Optimal price  
P* = 5.95 − 0.20(2.375) = 5.95 − 0.475 = $5.475.

Rounding to the nearest cent (practical pricing), they should charge about $5.48 per box.

Since SL-D=3 or (SL-1)-D=3 (meaning SL-D=4), and since the highest possible sum of two different one-digit numbers is 17, S must equal 1.
Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.
Suppose D=7. Then L is 0 or 1, and since S=1, L=0. A must be 1 or 2, but since S=1, A=2.
Suppose D=8. Then L is 1 or 2, and since S=1, L=2. A must be 2 or 3, but since L=2, A=3.
Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.
Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.
If D=7, then L=0. But since 10-7=3, D cannot be 7.
If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.
If E=4, then N=3. But if D=8, A=3, and if D=9, L=3 and A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=5, then since 1I-E=6, I=1. But since S=1, this cannot work.
If E=7, then I=3. But if D=8, then A=3, and if D=9, then L=3. So this cannot work.
If E=8, then I=4, and D cannot be 8. But if D=9, then A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=9, then N=8, and D cannot be 8 or 9. So this cannot work.
Therefore, E=6, N=5, and I=2. If D=8, then L=2, so D must equal 9. This means:

 Population/10 000 = 7·(consonants) + 3·(vowels).

Step 3 – verify the rule
For every given country:

USA 7·1 + 3·2 = 7 + 6 = 13 ✓  
England 7·5 + 3·2 = 35 + 6 = 41 ✓  
France 7·4 + 3·2 = 28 + 6 = 34 ✓  
Peru 7·2 + 3·2 = 14 + 6 = 20 ✓  
Brazil 7·4 + 3·2 = 28 + 6 = 34 ✓  
Greece 7·3 + 3·3 = 21 + 9 = 30 ✓  
Japan 7·3 + 3·2 = 21 + 6 = 27 ✓  

The rule holds.

Step 4 – apply the rule to Tibet
Tibet has the letters T I B E T:

Consonants: T, B, T ⇒ C = 3  
Vowels: I, E ⇒ V = 2  

Population/10 000 = 7·3 + 3·2 = 21 + 6 = 27.

You may say the total number of possible cubes (not necessarily with side length one) in the twelve by twelve by twelve Rubik's cube, and hocus-pocus, cubes of all sizes would appear.

Now you can come to the conclusion that for any Rubik's cube with side length n, there are n^3+(n-1)^3 + ... 2^3+1^3 total cubes with integer side length. Therefore, there are 1^3+2^3+...12^3 cubes in the Rubik's cube with side length 12. The hint gives the formula for adding a sequence of cubes.

 Hint: Permutations",Permutations,"9408!
The rule of divisibility says that a number is a multiple of 4 if its last 2 numbers are multiples of 4. So the last 2 numbers can be 21 different options:00, 04, 08, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 40, 44, 48, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96 because they are multiples of 4 and do not have 3's or 5's.
We have the last 2 digits we need to know how many can be in the first digit: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and the second and third numbers can have these 7 and number 0 too.

1. Divisibility–by–4 condition  
A whole number is divisible by 4 exactly when its last two digits form a multiple of 4.  
Consequently d₄d₅ must be a 2-digit multiple of 4 whose two digits are both taken from the allowed set.

List the 25 multiples of 4 from 00 to 96:

00, 04, 08, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96.

Remove those containing a forbidden digit 3 or 5:

Hence 25 − 4 = 21 admissible pairs (d₄,d₅).

2. Choices for the first three digits

  (1,2,4,6,7,8,9)

• d₂ : any allowed digit (0,1,2,4,6,7,8,9) → 8 possibilities

• d₃ : same as d₂ → 8 possibilities

Thus the number of ways to choose (d₁,d₂,d₃) is

b) You have to walk 73 feet, 9 inches
Explanation
There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100, neither of which is prime.  (No, 1 is not prime.)  So you will walk in an expanding square with sides of length 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 feet.  This is a total of 1060 feet.

1.  Total distance actually walked  
   This is just the sum of all those primes:

   = 1060 ft.

2.  Net displacement from O  

   Split the primes into four groups, according to the direction in which they are walked.

   East (indices 1,5,9,13,17,21,25):  
   2+11+23+41+59+73+97 = 306

   West (indices 3,7,11,15,19,23):

   South (indices 2,6,10,14,18,22):  
   3+13+29+43+61+79 = 228

   Hence

   Δx = 306 – 250 = 56 ft (to the East)  
   Δy = 276 – 228 = 48 ft (to the North)

   The straight-line distance back to O is

214,"Question: Alec, Brett and Chris each purchased parts for their skateboards at the sports store. Alec and Brett wanted to build new skateboards, so they each needed to purchase a deck, trucks, bearings and wheels. Chris only needed new wheels. The store offers a 10% discount for purchases over $250, so the boys decided to pay for all the parts together to qualify for the discount. Altogether, the boys spent $266.40. The clues below reflect the price of the items before the discount is applied.
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
They each bought the same kinds of wheels. Together they spent $75 for the 3 sets of wheels. Each set contained 4 wheels.

Bearings 16 35 $0 51
Total before discount $126 $145 $25 $296
less 10% discount $12.60 $14.50 $2.50 $29.60
Amount spent $113.40 $130.50 $22.50 $266.40
Explanation:
First find the original price of all the items combined. $266.40 is the price after the 10% discount was applied.
That means $266.40 is equal to 90% of the original price.
Write an equation and then cross multiply:
266.40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x   =   9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)
Let x = the amount Alec spent on trucks.
x + (x+5) = 75
2x + 5 = 75
2x = 70
x = 35
Alec spent $35 on trucks. Brett spent $5 more than Alec. Therefore, Brett spent $40 on trucks.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51
x + (2x + 3) = 51
3x + 3 = 51
3x = 48
x = 16
Alec's spent $16 on bearings.

+  −  −  *  =  
into the string of digits  

5 4 6 3 1 8 6 3 3 3   

so that all ten digits are used in order, every symbol is used exactly once, and the equality obtained is true when the calculation is carried out strictly from left to right (ignoring the usual order of operations).  
There will therefore be six numbers separated by the five symbols.

Step 1 – look for a way to make 99 on the left.  
Because we must finally have one “=” sign, it is natural to try to make the expression on each side equal 99 (the hint).  
Trying small partitions of the first six digits gives

54 + 63 − 18 = 99 ,  
because left-to-right: 54 + 63 = 117, 117 − 18 = 99.

So we place  

54 + 63 − 18  

before the “=”.  
We have now used one + and one −; we still have one −, one *, and the = to place, and four digits remain: 6 3 3 3.

Step 2 – make 99 on the right with the remaining symbols.  
We still need to use the symbols “−” and “*” once each.  
Notice that with left-to-right evaluation

6 − 3 = 3,  
3 * 33 = 99.

Thus the remaining digits can be partitioned as 6, 3, 33 with the operators “−” and “*” in that order.

Step 3 – write the complete equality.  
Putting everything together in the original digit order gives

54 + 63 − 18 = 6 − 3 * 33.

Check:  
Left side 54 + 63 = 117, 117 − 18 = 99.  
Right side 6 − 3 = 3, 3 * 33 = 99.  
Both sides equal 99, as required, and every given symbol and digit is used exactly once.

Next graph these three lines. It should be expected that the answer will lie on the intersection of two of these lines or to make all chairs or all tables.

 Hint: nan",,"Three artists would do the trick. This is because twenty-four artists would paint twenty-four models in two and a half hours. Since the available time increases eight-fold (2.5 * 8 = 20), it is possible to reduce the number of painters by the same number of times (24 / 8 = 3).",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let

n = number of artists,
t = time (hours),
M = number of models finished.

Because the problem states that the number of canvases always equals the number of models, we only track models.

Given data  
2.5 artists work 2.5 hours to finish 2.5 models.

Step 1.  Compute the total “artist-hours” required per finished model.

Total artist-hours in the given situation  
= (2.5 artists)(2.5 hours) = 6.25 artist-hours.

These 6.25 artist-hours produce 2.5 models, so

artist-hours per model  
= 6.25 / 2.5 = 2.5 artist-hours per model.        (1)

Step 2.  Determine the artist-hours needed for the new job.

We now must finish 24 models.

Required artist-hours  
= (24 models)(2.5 artist-hours/model) = 60 artist-hours.     (2)

Step 3.  Convert required artist-hours to number of artists, given the available time.

We have 20 hours to work.  If A artists are employed, the artist-hours they supply are

artist-hours supplied = A(20).                            (3)

Equate (2) and (3):

A(20) = 60  
⇒ A = 60 / 20  
⇒ A = 3.

Therefore, 3 artists are sufficient to paint 24 models on 24 canvases in 20 hours.

Standing 5 feet away from the 8 foot high fence in the back of the yard, he could just barely see the top leaves of the tree over the top of the fence.  He knew that the tree was 200 feet from the fence.  Homer was 6 feet tall, making his line of vision, 67 inches from the ground.
Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.
 Hint: TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches
Tree height from eye level = TAN (25.80 deg) * 2460 inches = 1189 inches
Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.  With the measurement capabilities available to any lumberjack (or any average Homer) precise measurements are not possible.  Thus the need to clarify these calculations as estimates.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let

H  = height of the tree (ft)  
hₑ = height of Homer’s eyes = 67 in = 67 / 12 ft = 5.583 ft  
h_f = height of the fence = 8 ft  

Horizontal distances  
d₁ = Homer → fence = 5 ft  
d₂ = fence → tree = 200 ft  
d   = Homer → tree  = d₁ + d₂ = 205 ft  

1. Angle of Homer’s line of sight  
The line of sight just grazes the top of the fence, so between Homer and the fence

tan A = (h_f − hₑ) / d₁
       = (8 − 5.583) / 5
       = 2.417 / 5
       = 0.4834.

2. Use the same angle to reach the tree  
Over the full horizontal distance d = 205 ft,

h_tree − hₑ = d · tan A
            = 205 · 0.4834
            ≈ 99.087 ft.

Therefore

H = hₑ + 99.087

2N, 3N, 4N, 5N and 6N contain no digit that is not already present in N.  
(In other words each of those five products is a permutation of the digits of N.)

Step 1 – Observe a consequence of 5N  
The last digit of 5N is 5.  
Hence the digit 5 must already be among the digits of N.  
Moreover N cannot end in 5, for then 2N would end in 0 and the digit 0 (which is not in N) would appear.  
Thus N contains the digit 5 but does not end in 5.

Step 2 – Observe a consequence of 2N  
The last digit of 2N is even, so N must already contain that even digit.  
Consequently N contains at least one of {2,4,6,8}.  
We have therefore located two specific digits (5 and one even digit) inside N, and none of the products has produced any digit outside {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.  
That observation alone is not sufficient to determine N, but it suggests looking for numbers whose multiples are rearrangements of their digits — so-called cyclic numbers.

Step 3 – Enter the cyclic–number idea  
A base–10 cyclic number C has the property that 2C,3C,…,(k–1)C are cyclic permutations of its digit block, where k is the number of digits of C and 10^k–1 is divisible by k+1.  
The classic example – hinted at in the problem – comes from the repeating part of the decimal expansion of 1/7:

1 ÷ 7 = 0.142 857 142 857 142 857…

The six–digit block 142 857 is a cyclic number because

142 857 × 2 = 285 714  
142 857 × 3 = 428 571  
142 857 × 4 = 571 428  
142 857 × 5 = 714 285  
142 857 × 6 = 857 142  

Each product is merely a rotation (a permutation) of the digits 1,4,2,8,5,7 – no new digit appears.

Why does that happen?  Because

7 × 142 857 = 999 999 = 10^6 – 1,  

so multiplying 142 857 by any k = 1,…,6 is the same as writing k(10^6 – 1)/7.  
The subtraction by 1 forces every product to be a six–digit number whose digits sum to 54 (six 9’s), and division by 7 forces the digits to be a cyclic rearrangement of 142 857.

Step 4 – Uniqueness for six digits  
It is known (and can be proved using elementary number theory) that 142 857 is the only six-digit cyclic number in base 10.  
Since any six–digit integer whose first six multiples are all permutations of itself must be cyclic, 142 857 is the only possible candidate.

Step 5 – Verification  
We have already checked all five required multiples, and none introduces a digit outside the original set {1,2,4,5,7,8}.  
Hence 142 857 satisfies the condition, and by the uniqueness argument no other six-digit number can.

            4·ABCD = DCBA = 1000D + 100C + 10B + A.                (1)

Work column-by-column, keeping track of the carries.

1. Units column  
   4·D = A + 10k₁, k₁ the carry to the tens column.         (2)

2. Tens column  
   4·C + k₁ = B + 10k₂, k₂ the carry to the hundreds column. (3)

3. Hundreds column

4. Thousands column  
   4·A + k₃ = D       (there must be no further carry). (5)

Because the product ends in the digit A, A must be even (given hint).

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – Find A and D from (5)
------------------------------------------------------------
Since k₃ can only be 0, 1, 2 or 3, try the even possibilities for A:

A = 2  ⇒  4·A = 8.  
     D = 8 + k₃ must be a single digit.  
     If k₃ = 0, D = 8  (possible).  
     If k₃ = 1, D = 9  (possible).  
     k₃ ≥ 2 gives D ≥ 10 (impossible).

A = 4  gives 4·A = 16 (>9) – impossible.  
A = 6  gives 4·A = 24 (>9) – impossible.  
A = 8  gives 4·A = 32 (>9) – impossible.

Hence A = 2, and we have two sub–cases:

 Case I k₃ = 0, D = 8  
 Case II k₃ = 1, D = 9

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – Deal with the units carry k₁ from (2)
------------------------------------------------------------
Equation (2) with A = 2:

4·D = 2 + 10k₁.

• Case I (D = 8): 4·8 = 32 = 2 + 10k₁ ⇒ k₁ = 3 (valid).  
• Case II (D = 9): 4·9 = 36 = 2 + 10k₁ ⇒ k₁ = 34/10 (not an integer) – impossible.

Thus Case II is discarded.  We must have

 A = 2, D = 8, k₁ = 3, k₃ = 0.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 – Determine B, C, k₂ from (3) and (4)
------------------------------------------------------------
Hundreds column (4) with k₃ = 0:

4·B + k₂ = C.            (6)

Since k₂ ≤ 3, 4B + k₂ ≤ 9 ⇒ B ≤ 2.

Now consider the tens column (3):

4·C + k₁ = 4·C + 3 = B + 10k₂.  (7)

Check the possible B values.

• B = 0  
 (6): C = k₂ ≤ 3 → C = 0,1,2,3  
 (7): 4C + 3 = 10k₂  
    Substituting C = k₂ gives 4k₂ + 3 = 10k₂ ⇒ 3 = 6k₂ – impossible.

• B = 1  
 (6): C = 4 + k₂ (so C = 4,5,6,7)  
 (7): 4(4 + k₂) + 3 = 1 + 10k₂  
    16 + 4k₂ + 3 = 1 + 10k₂  
    19 + 4k₂ = 1 + 10k₂  
    18 = 6k₂ ⇒ k₂ = 3.  
 Then C = 4 + k₂ = 7.

• B = 2 is impossible because 4·2 = 8 already almost fills the digit, and (6) would need k₂ ≥2, contradicting (7).

Thus the only consistent digits are

 B = 1, C = 7, k₂ = 3.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 – Verify and collect the solution
------------------------------------------------------------
Digits obtained:  
A = 2, B = 1, C = 7, D = 8 (all distinct).

2. Tens column  
   3L + 1 = 10·c₁ + A, where c₁ is the carry to the hundreds column.  
   0 ≤ 3L + 1 ≤ 28  ⇒ c₁ ∈ {0,1,2}.  
   The thousands digit comes only from carries, so the thousands digit A equals that carry from the hundreds column; hence A = c₂ and A ∈ {1,2}.  

   • If A = 1, then 3L + 1 = 10·c₁ + 1  ⇒ 3L = 10·c₁, impossible for non-zero L.

   Thus 3F + 2 = 20 + W  ⇒ W = 3F − 18.  
   Since 1 ≤ W ≤ 9 and digits are distinct, test F:

        F = 7  ⇒ W = 3 (but F = L, not allowed)  
        F = 8  ⇒ W = 6  (all digits distinct)

231,"Question: What is the smallest integer greater than 0 that can be written entirely with zeros and ones and is evenly divisible by 225?
 Hint: nan",,"The prime factorization of 225 is 5*5*3*3. So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.
All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Because 225 = 9 · 25 the sought‐for integer must be divisible simultaneously by 9 and by 25.

1. Divisibility by 25  
   A decimal number is divisible by 25 iff its last two digits are 00, 25, 50 or 75.  
   Since only the digits 0 and 1 are allowed, the only possible ending is 00.  
   Hence the required number must end in …00.

2. Divisibility by 9  
   A decimal number is divisible by 9 iff the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  
   Here every digit is 0 or 1, so the digit–sum equals the number of 1’s.  
   Therefore the number of 1’s must be a multiple of 9.

3. Minimising the number  
   Let k be the total number of digits.  The last two digits are fixed as 00, so the first k − 2 digits must provide the necessary 1’s.

   • To make the digit–sum at least 9, we need at least 9 ones.  
   • Since each of the first k − 2 positions can contribute at most one 1, we must have k − 2 ≥ 9, i.e. k ≥ 11.

   So an 11-digit number is the shortest possible.  
   With exactly 11 digits, there are 9 positions before the final “00”; to get 9 ones we must put a 1 in each of those positions.  This produces the unique candidate

   11111111100.

4. Verification  
   • It ends in 00 ⇒ divisible by 25.  
   • Its digit–sum is 9 ⇒ divisible by 9.  

   Hence it is divisible by 225.

Since any shorter 0-1 number lacks enough 1’s to satisfy divisibility by 9, 11111111100 is the smallest positive integer composed solely of 0’s and 1’s that is divisible by 225.

Facts about the two clocks  
• “Fast” clock: gains 1 minute every real hour → after t hours it is + t minutes ahead of the correct time.  
• “Slow” clock: loses 2 minutes every real hour → after t hours it is – 2t minutes behind the correct time.  

Remember that an ordinary analogue dial repeats every 12 hours = 12 × 60 = 720 minutes, so two displays are identical whenever their readings differ by an integral multiple of 720 minutes.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  When do the two clocks next show the same time?
-------------------------------------------------
The difference between their readings after t hours is  

(+ t) – (– 2t) = 3t minutes.

We need 3t to be a non-zero multiple of 720:

3t = 720k with the smallest positive integer k = 1

• Slow clock is correct whenever its loss equals 720 n minutes:

239,"Question: A farmer was weighing five bales of hay, and each bale was a different weight. Because he was an odd farmer, he weighed the hay bales in groups of two, in every possible combination (but 2-3 and 3-2 are the same).  The farmer wrote down the total weights, but forgot to match them to the groups of hay bales (1&2, 1&3 etc.) that they went with.  The weights were 80, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, and 91 kilograms.

All ten unordered pair–sums were written down:

1.  Smallest and largest pair–sums  
   w₁+w₂ = 80 , w₄+w₅ = 91 . …(1)

2.  The sum of all ten pair–sums equals 4 (w₁+w₂+w₃+w₄+w₅), because each bale
    appears in four different pairs.  
    80+82+83+84+85+86+87+88+90+91 = 856 = 4 Σwᵢ  
    ⇒ Σwᵢ = 214 . …(2)

3.  From (1) and (2) the middle weight is fixed:  
    w₃ = 214 – (w₁+w₂+w₄+w₅)  
         = 214 – (80+91) = 43 . …(3)

4.  The four sums that involve w₃ are w₁+43, w₂+43, w₄+43, w₅+43.
    After removing 80 and 91 from the list we still have
    82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90 .
    The smallest of these must be w₁+43, so w₁+43 = 82 ⇒ w₁ = 39 . …(4)

5.  With w₁ found, w₂ = 80 – w₁ = 41 . …(5)

6.  Now choose w₄ so that all remaining six sums are produced by  
    w₄+43, w₅+43, 39+w₄, 39+w₅, 41+w₄, 41+w₅, with w₅ = 91–w₄.

    Trying the least possible w₄ (>43) in turn, w₄ = 44 gives  

       39+44 = 83  
       41+44 = 85  
       44+43 = 87  
       w₅ = 47, and then  
       39+47 = 86  
       41+47 = 88  
       43+47 = 90 .

    The six numbers obtained are exactly the six still unaccounted for
    (83, 85, 87, 86, 88, 90).  Hence w₄ = 44 and w₅ = 47.  
    Any other choice for w₄ fails to match the required multiset, so the
    solution is unique.

The five bale weights are therefore:

w₁ = 39 kg, w₂ = 41 kg, w₃ = 43 kg, w₄ = 44 kg, w₅ = 47 kg.

Correspondence of pair–sums to bales

39 kg + 41 kg = 80 kg  
39 kg + 43 kg = 82 kg  
39 kg + 44 kg = 83 kg  
41 kg + 43 kg = 84 kg  
41 kg + 44 kg = 85 kg  
39 kg + 47 kg = 86 kg  
43 kg + 44 kg = 87 kg  
41 kg + 47 kg = 88 kg  
43 kg + 47 kg = 90 kg  
44 kg + 47 kg = 91 kg

Mad Ade's cousin Manic Martin works as an accountant in one of Madadia's leading accounting firms.
After his first year his salary was a straight 10,000 wonks, with which Manic Martin was quite happy. His manager was so impressed with his work he offered Manic Martin a wage rise.
Now this being Madadia, things are not always done as they are elsewhere, the wage rise was offered over a 17.5 year contract period, These contracts are immutably binding, and will still be paid to benefactors in the event of death or permanent disability.
Manic Martin has a choice of how to receive his raise.  The first option was for an immediate 5% raise to 10,500 wonks annually, with an additional 5% raise every 6 months. The second option was for an immediate 10% raise to 11,000 wonks annually, with an additional 10% raise every year. Manic Martin's salary, based upon his current annual, was paid bi-weekly.
Which deal would benefit Manic Martin the most?
 Hint: Think about the difference between the first and second half of every year",Think about the difference between the first and second half of every year,"The 5% semi-annual raise yields a higher return.
This may have been your first guess, but there is something odd about the answer. At the start of the problem, the 10% raise is earning more-  11,000 annually vs. 10,500. After the first year, the 5% option has earned 10,762 compared to 11,000.
What are the two options earning at the moment the contract closes, after 17.5 years? Surprisingly, the 5% option only realizes a little more than 55,160, compared to the 10% option which is still ahead with just under 56,000.
So where's the advantage in the 5% option? It hides in the second half of every year. Even in the first year, the 5% option makes more in the second six months than the 10% option. For the first few years, this is not enough to offset the difference. But cumulatively, over seventeen and a half years, 5% realizes a grand total of 390.27 more than the 10% option.

S₀ = 10 000 wonks   (Martin’s original wage)

The problem only concerns the two alternative contracts; we therefore compare the total money paid during the 17 ½ years.

----------------------------------------------------
1.  Contract A :  +5 % immediately and every 6 months
----------------------------------------------------
•  At t = 0 he is lifted to
     10 000 (1.05) = 10 500 wonks per year.

•  There is then a fresh 5 % rise every half-year.  
  Hence during the k-th half-year (k = 1,2,…,35) his
  “annual” salary is  

        10 500·1.05^{k-1}  wonks.

•  Each of those salaries is earned for ½ year, so the
  amount actually paid in that half-year is  

        ½ ·10 500·1.05^{k-1}.

Total of Contract A

   Σ_{k=1}^{35} ½·10 500·1.05^{k-1}
 = ½·10 500·(1.05^{35} – 1)/(1.05 – 1)
 = 0.5·10 500·(1.05^{35} – 1)/0.05
 = 105 000·(1.05^{35} – 1).

Numerically  
1.05^{35} = 5.5160153578…, so

   A = 105 000·(5.5160153578 – 1)
     ≈ 105 000·4.5160153578
     ≈ 474 181.613 wonks.



----------------------------------------------------
2.  Contract B :  +10 % immediately and every year
----------------------------------------------------
•  At t = 0 he is lifted to
     10 000 (1.10) = 11 000 wonks per year.

•  A further 10 % rise is granted at each whole-year
  anniversary.  Hence for the n-th full year
  (n = 0,1,…,16) the annual salary is  

        11 000·1.10^{\,n}  wonks.

•  After the rise at the 17-year mark the contract has
  only ½ year left, so for the interval 17 – 17½ years
  the annual salary is 11 000·1.10^{17}, paid for only
  half a year.

Total of Contract B

   Σ_{n=0}^{16} 11 000·1.10^{\,n}
   + ½·11 000·1.10^{17}

 = 11 000·(1.10^{17} – 1)/(1.10 – 1)
   + 5 500·1.10^{17}

 = 110 000·(1.10^{17} – 1) + 5 500·1.10^{17}.

Numerically  
1.10^{17} = 5.05447028499…, so

   B = 110 000·(5.05447028499 – 1)

3.  Comparison
----------------------------------------
A – B ≈ 474 181.613 – 473 791.318  
      ≈        390.3 wonks.

Thus Contract A pays about 390 wonks more over the
entire 17 ½ years (roughly 22 wonks per year).  The
reason is that, although Contract B is better during
the first half of each year, Contract A overtakes it
in the second half, and because (1.05)² = 1.1025 is
larger than 1.10, the cumulative effect very slightly
favours the semi-annual 5 % rises.

I found that I could say at least two things definitely about each of the following two integer values formed by manipulating our ages taken as integers:-
a) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Lavi's and my age considered during any one year right since she was a year old.
b) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Fred's and my ages considered during any one year right since I was a year old.

Example: When Lavi was 3, I was  5 -> (3*5)+1 gives 16 which is the square of 4, which is 1 less than my age(5) in that year.

L = Lavi’s age in a given year  (so L ≥ 1),  
R = my age (Rudy’s age) in that same year,  
F = Fred’s age in that same year.  

Because the age–gaps are permanent, for every year we have  

R = L + 2 and F = R + 2 = L + 4.

a) 1 + (Lavi’s age × my age)

N₁ = 1 + L·R = 1 + L(L + 2)  
   = 1 + (L² + 2L)  
   = L² + 2L + 1  
   = (L + 1)².

Thus, for every year since Lavi was one year old,

• N₁ is always a perfect square.  
• Its square root is L + 1, the integer that lies exactly midway between Lavi’s age (L) and my age (L + 2).

(Consequently N₁ is never prime, because every square larger than 1 is composite.)

1.  Each of the two numbers obtained is always a perfect square.  
2.  The square root of each is precisely the age that lies midway between the two ages whose product was used (Lavi & me for the first number, me & Fred for the second).

1) Each number is always a perfect square; 2) its square root equals the age exactly midway between the two siblings whose ages were multiplied (hence the numbers are also never prime).",True,1,0

Where w is amount of corn for the first worker, d is the difference (amount of corn) between two consecutive workers. So this is the solution:
1st worker = 10/6 measures of corn
2nd worker = 65/6 measures of corn

1.  “ … the second worker gets as many measures more than the first worker, as the third gets more than the second … ”  
    ⇒ W₂ – W₁ = W₃ – W₂ = W₄ – W₃ = W₅ – W₄ = d  (an arithmetic progression).

6.  Verification  

   a)  Common difference:  
       W₂ – W₁ = 10 5/6 – 1 2/3 = 9 1/6 = d, etc. (same for all gaps).  

   b)  Total: 1 2/3 + 10 5/6 + 20 + 29 1/6 + 38 1/3 = 100.  

   c)  First two vs. last three:  
       W₁ + W₂ = 1 2/3 + 10 5/6 = 12 ½;

247,"Question: The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?
 Hint: Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74
Lemp 47 94
Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Number of people who got in at the six stations - Number of people who got out at the six stations) =
227 - (364 - 182) =
227 - 182 =
45 people
Thus, I disappointed Tweeto by giving him the answer as 45 people.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

d₁ , d₂ , d₃ , d₄ , d₅ , d₆  = numbers who get down at

Facts we must satisfy  

1.  d₁∈{2,3,5,7}, d₂∈{11,13,17,19}, d₃∈{23,29},  
  d₄∈{31,37}, d₅∈{41,43,47}, d₆∈{53,59}.  
2.  |v_{i+1} – v_i| ≥ 20  ⟺ |d_{i+1} – d_i| ≥ 10.  
3.  d₁+…+d₆ is even.  
4.  Arriving at Rudolf (before anyone gets off or on) there are 227 passengers.  
  If x is the number on board before Maver then  
  227 = x + (d₁+d₂+d₃+d₄+d₅).                       (★)

Step-by-step selection of the dᵢ

•  From d₃∈{23,29} and d₄∈{31,37}, the gap condition forces  
 d₃ = 23 (because 29 is <10 away from both 31 and 37) and then  
 d₄ = 37 (23→37 gives the needed ≥10 gap).

•  With d₃ fixed at 23, we back up to d₂ : it must differ from 23 by ≥10.  
 The only possibilities are d₂ = 13 (gap 10) or 17 (gap 6) or 19 (gap 4);  
 hence d₂ = 13.

•  For d₁ we need a prime <10 that differs from 13 by ≥10, so d₁ = 3 (gap 10) or 2 (gap 11).  
 Keep both for the moment.

•  For d₅ (40–50) and d₄ = 37 the only prime ≥10 away is d₅ = 47.

•  For d₆ (50–60) and d₅ = 47 we need a gap ≥10, so d₆ = 59.

We now have two candidate strings  
(2, 13, 23, 37, 47, 59) and (3, 13, 23, 37, 47, 59).

Condition 3 says their total must be even.  
Sum of first sequence = 181 (odd) → reject.  
Sum of second sequence = 182 (even) → accept.

Hence the unique solution is  

d₁ = 3, d₂ = 13, d₃ = 23, d₄ = 37, d₅ = 47, d₆ = 59.

Finding x

d₁+d₂+d₃+d₄+d₅ = 3+13+23+37+47 = 123.

Using (★): 227 = x + 123  ⇒  x = 104.

Therefore 104 passengers were on the train before it reached Maver.

248,"Question: Some time after 2 O' Clock, the angle made between the minute hand and the vertical (12) on a clock is double the angle made between the hour hand and the vertical (12). What time is it?
 Hint: What is the rate of travel of each hand on a clock?",What is the rate of travel of each hand on a clock?,"2:24 The hour hand makes an angle of 72 degrees while the minute hand makes an angle of 144 degrees.
At exactly 2:00, the angle made by the hour hand is 60 degrees from vertical.  If you let x = the number of minutes past 2:00 that we are looking for, then the hour hand will be at:
60 degrees + x / 60 min* 30 degrees
where x/60 min is the fraction of a full hour that has past, and is therefore the fractional distance that the hour hand has moved closer to the 3.  The 30 degrees is the total angle between the 2 and the 3.
The final position of the minute hand will be:
x/30 min * 180 degrees
for the same reasoning as with the hour hand.
Since the minute hand will make twice the angle with vertical, you can set up the equation:
2*(60 + x / 60 * 30) = x / 30 * 180
Solving for x will give you 24 minutes.  The time will be 2:24.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let t be the number of minutes after 2 : 00.

1. Position (angle from 12 o’clock measured clockwise)
   • Minute hand: 6 t degrees   (because it turns 360° in 60 min ⇒ 6°/min)  
   • Hour   hand: 60 ° + 0.5 t degrees  
     – At 2 : 00 the hour hand is at 2 × 30° = 60°.  
     – It advances 30° per hour = 0.5° per minute.

2. Condition from the problem  
   The angle of the minute hand to 12 is twice the angle of the hour hand to 12:  
   6t = 2(60 + 0.5t).

3. Solve for t  
   6t = 120 + t  
   5t = 120  
   t = 24.

Their squares satisfy

a² − b² = 73.

Factor the left–hand side:

a² − b² = (a − b)(a + b) = 73.           (1)

Because a and b are integers, a − b and a + b are integers of the same parity (both even or both odd).  
73 is prime, so its only positive factor pairs are (1, 73) and (73, 1); both factors are odd, so parity is fine.

Case 1   a − b = 1 and a + b = 73  
Add the two equations: 2a = 74  ⟹  a = 37.  
Then b = a − 1 = 36.

Case 2   a − b = 73 and a + b = 1  
Impossible, because a + b > a − b whenever a, b ≥ 0.

Thus the unique pair of whole numbers is

a = 37, b = 36.
