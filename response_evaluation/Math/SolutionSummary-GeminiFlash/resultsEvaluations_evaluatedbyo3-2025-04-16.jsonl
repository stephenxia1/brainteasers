{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.\nThe island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.\nOn April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.\nIf the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?\nBonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?\n Solution: The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.\nBonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.\nAll villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:\n1) First set the starting point to one.\n2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.\n3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)\n4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.\nWhich points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.\nNote that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.\nThe routes:\nThis is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.

Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.\nRoutes to an adjacent village (A to B):\nTo determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.\nThe farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.\nThe next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.\nThe next farthest point is Bi.

The wedding date is determined by the day the last unique route is traveled. The longest route length is calculated using the geometry of the island and a specific identified path.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n**Part 1: Wedding Dates**\n\n1.  **Identify the travel destinations:** The three sons travel from their village (let's call it A) to the first three villages clockwise (B, C, and D), which are an adjacent village (B), the second village along the coast (C), and the opposite village (D).\n2.  **Determine the valid travel paths:** The sons can only travel along straight paths connecting villages or visiting intermediate crossings, with the constraint that they must *always* be getting closer to their final destination village.\n3.  **Count the number of valid routes for each destination:** Using a method that involves identifying all possible nodes (villages and crossings) and counting paths by moving step-by-step from the start village to the destination village, ensuring each step moves closer to the destination and summing the counts of paths leading to intermediate nodes. The solution calculates the number of valid routes:\n    *   From A to B (adjacent village): 5 routes.\n    *   From A to C (second village): 41 routes.\n    *   From A to D (opposite village): 121 routes.\n4.  **Determine the last travel day:** Each route corresponds to a day of travel, starting on April 1st. The total number of valid routes equals the total number of trips the son must make. The last trip occurs on the day number corresponding to the total number of routes.\n    *   For 5 routes, the last trip is on the 5th day (April 1st + 4 days = April 5th).\n    *   For 41 routes, the last trip is on the 41st day (April 1st + 40 days = May 11th, as April has 30 days).\n    *   For 121 routes, the last trip is on the 121st day (April 1st + 120 days = July 30th, counting 30 days in April, 31 in May, 30 in June, and 29 into July).\n5.  **Determine the wedding dates:** The wedding takes place on the day *following* the last trip.\n    *   After the last trip on April 5th, the wedding is on April 6th.\n    *   After the last trip on May 11th, the wedding is on May 12th.\n    *   After the last trip on July 30th, the wedding is on July 31st. (Note: The provided solution states August 1st for the last wedding date, which suggests a potential one-day discrepancy in the problem's date counting or the solution's calculation). Based on the calculation above, the dates are April 6th, May 12th, and July 31st. *Following the provided solution's dates*, the weddings are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.\n\n**Part 2: Bonus Question (Longest Route Length)**\n\n1.  **Identify the geometry:** The island is a circle with a 10-mile circumference and 6 evenly spaced villages forming a regular hexagon inscribed within the circle. The radius (r) of the circle (and the length of a hexagon side between adjacent villages) is Circumference / (2 * Pi) = 10 / (2 * Pi) = 5/Pi miles.\n2.  **Identify the longest route:** The solution identifies a specific path from village A to village D (the opposite village) as one of the longest valid routes, for example, the path A to B to ABi to C to Ci to CDi to Di to D (where ABi, Ci, CDi, Di are intermediate crossings).\n3.  **Break down the longest route into segments:** This specific path is broken down into segments: A-B, B-ABi, ABi-C, C-Ci, Ci-CDi, CDi-Di, and Di-D.\n4.  **Determine the length of each segment:** Using the geometry of the hexagon and the implied structure of the interior crossings, the segments are assigned lengths relative to the radius:\n    *   A-B is a hexagon side: length = r = 5/Pi.\n    *   C-Ci and Di-D are segments on paths towards the center or opposite village: length = r/2 = (5/Pi)/2.\n    *   The remaining four segments (B-ABi, ABi-C, Ci-CDi, CDi-Di) are determined to have lengths equal to the side of smaller internal equilateral triangles, which is r/sqrt(3) = (5/Pi)/sqrt(3).\n5.  **Calculate the total length:** Sum the lengths of the segments: (A-B) + (B-ABi) + (ABi-C) + (C-Ci) + (Ci-CDi) + (CDi-Di) + (Di-D) = r + r/sqrt(3) + r/sqrt(3) + r/2 + r/sqrt(3) + r/sqrt(3) + r/2 = r + r + 4*(r/sqrt(3)) = 2r + 4r/sqrt(3).\n6.  **Substitute the value of r and calculate:** Plug in r = 5/Pi: 2*(5/Pi) + 4*(5/Pi)/sqrt(3) = 10/Pi + 20/(Pi*sqrt(3)).\n7.  **Compute the numerical value:** Calculate 10/Pi + 20/(Pi*sqrt(3)) which is approximately 3.183 + 3.676 = 6.859 miles.\n8.  **State the longest route length:** The longest route length is approximately 6.86 miles.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "0"}

Let it have k digits. Let the first digit be d (where d is an integer from 1 to 9). The number can be written as N = d * 10^(k-1) + R, where R is the number formed by the remaining k-1 digits.\n\n2.  **Represent the Rotated Number:** Rotating N to the left means taking the first digit 'd' and moving it to the end. The resulting number, N_rotated, is formed by taking R and appending 'd' as the last digit. This can be written as N_rotated = R * 10 + d.\n\n3.  **Set up the Equation:** The problem states that the rotated number is exactly 1.5 times the original number: N_rotated = 1.5 * N. Substitute the expressions from steps 1 and 2 into this equation: R * 10 + d = 1.5 * (d * 10^(k-1) + R).\n\n4.  **Solve the Equation for R:** Expand and rearrange the equation to express R in terms of d and k:\n    *   10R + d = 1.5 * d * 10^(k-1) + 1.5R\n    *   10R - 1.5R = 1.5 * d * 10^(k-1) - d\n    *   8.5R = d * (1.5 * 10^(k-1) - 1)\n    *   Multiply by 2 to get integer coefficients: 17R = d * (3 * 10^(k-1) - 2)\n    *   R = d * (3 * 10^(k-1) - 2) / 17\n\n5.  **Relate N back to d and k:** Substitute the expression for R back into the original equation for N (N = d * 10^(k-1) + R):\n    *   N = d * 10^(k-1) + d * (3 * 10^(k-1) - 2) / 17\n    *   Combine the terms by finding a common denominator: N = d * [17 * 10^(k-1) + (3 * 10^(k-1) - 2)] / 17\n    *   Simplify: N = d * [20 * 10^(k-1) - 2] / 17\n    *   Factor out 2: N = 2 * d * [10 * 10^(k-1) - 1] / 17\n    *   N = 2 * d * (10^k - 1) / 17\n\n6.  **Identify the Condition for N to be an Integer:** For N to be an integer, since 17 is a prime number and does not divide 2 or any single digit d (from 1 to 9), the number 17 must divide the term (10^k - 1).

Analyze the sum of the six numbers formed by rotating and swapping the digits of the original 6-digit number. Observe that each column in the summation contains all six distinct digits of the number. This means the sum of the digits in each column is equal to the digital sum of the original number.\n2.  Recognize that if the digital sum is represented as a two-digit number `XY`, the sum of the six configurations will have a structure related to summing `XXXXXX` and `YYYYYY`. The condition that the first and last digits of this total sum match the digits X and Y (in some order) implies that the sum of X and Y must be less than 10 (i.e., X + Y < 10), preventing a carry-over to the leftmost column from the second column.\n3.  Determine the possible values for the digital sum (`XY`). It must be between the minimum (0+1+2+3+4+5=15) and maximum (9+8+7+6+5+4=39) possible digital sums for a 6-digit number with distinct digits. Furthermore, the digital sum `XY` must be a prime number in this range and its digits X and Y must satisfy the condition X + Y < 10 (from Step 2). Identify the prime numbers between 15 and 39 (17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37) and filter them based on X + Y < 10 (eliminating 19, 29, 37). This leaves 17, 23, and 31 as possible digital sums.\n4.  Use the clue that the digital sum (`XY`) matches the number formed by the last two digits of the number. So the last two digits must be 17, 23, or 31. Also use the clue that the sum of the first two digits equals the sum of the last two digits (which is X + Y from the digital sum `XY`). Test the possible last two digits (17, 23, 31) against the remaining conditions:\n    *   If the last two digits are 31 (digital sum 31, X+Y=4), the first two digits must sum to 4. The only remaining digits that sum to 4 are 0 and 4. Neither 04 nor 40 is a two-digit prime, eliminating 31.\n    *   If the last two digits are 17 (digital sum 17, X+Y=8), the first two digits must sum to 8. Possible remaining digit pairs summing to 8 are (0,8), (2,6), (3,5). Only 53 is a prime number formed by these pairs. If the first two digits are 53 and last two are 17, the sum of these four digits is 5+3+1+7=16. Since the total digital sum must be 17, the middle two digits must sum to 1. The only pair of distinct digits summing to 1 is 0 and 1, but 1 is already used. This eliminates 17.\n    *   If the last two digits are 23 (digital sum 23, X+Y=5), the first two digits must sum to 5. Possible remaining digit pairs summing to 5 are (0,5), (1,4). Only 41 is a prime number formed by these pairs (05 is not a 6-digit number start). This confirms the digital sum is 23, the last two digits are 23, and the first two digits are 41.\n5.  Determine the middle two digits. The total digital sum is 23. The sum of the first two digits (4+1=5) and the last two digits (2+3=5) is 10.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?\n Solution: 2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.

The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Hint": "A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.

The property is a similar regular polygon circumscribed around a larger circle. The distance from the foundation edge to the property edge is equal to the foundation diameter, meaning the radius of the circle circumscribing the property is three times the radius of the circle inscribing the house (the foundation). The pipe length, which bisects the area of the house polygon from edge to edge, is equal to the length of one side of the property polygon.\n2.  **Recognize the Constraint on the Number of Sides:** The core challenge is finding the number of sides ('n') of the regular polygons. The fact that a line segment (the pipe) equal to the property's side length *also* bisects the area of the house polygon provides a crucial constraint. For a given number of sides 'n', there is a range of possible lengths for area-bisecting chords within the inscribed house polygon. The property side length must fall within this range when scaled correctly based on the radius relationship (property radius = 3 * house radius).\n3.  **Find the Number of Sides (n):** By setting up an inequality using the geometric relationships from steps 1 and 2, expressing the property's side length and the house polygon's bisector lengths in terms of 'n' and the radii, it is determined that only one integer value for 'n' satisfies the condition. The calculation shows that n must be 10. Rex knew this information was sufficient because 'n' could be uniquely determined.\n4.  **Calculate the Actual Side Length:** Ralph fenced 400 feet. Since the property is a 10-sided polygon (decagon) and one side is the gate (made of the pipe), the fence covers the remaining 9 sides. Therefore, the length of one side of the property (and the pipe) is 400 feet / 9 sides.\n5.  **Determine House Dimensions:** Using the actual side length of the property (from step 4) and the fact that it's a decagon (n=10) circumscribed around a circle, the radius of that circle can be calculated. The radius of the house foundation (the circle inscribing the house decagon) is one-third of this value (from step 1). With the house's radius and n=10, the apothem and side length of the house decagon can be calculated using standard regular polygon formulas.\n6.  **Calculate the House Polygon Area:** The area of the 10-sided house polygon (decagon) is calculated using its apothem and side length (or radius), for instance, by summing the areas of the 10 triangles formed by connecting vertices to the center.\n7.  **Calculate the Atrium Area:** The atrium's diameter is one-tenth of the property's longest measurement. The property's longest measurement is the diameter of the circle it is circumscribed around. Calculate this diameter (twice the property's circumscribing circle's radius). The atrium radius is one-tenth of this value divided by 2. Calculate the area of the circular atrium using its radius.\n8.  **Calculate Total Square Footage:** The usable area on each floor is the area of the house polygon (step 6) minus the area of the atrium (step 7). Since the house has two stories, the total square footage is this usable area per floor multiplied by 2. This final calculation results in 2730 square feet.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "0"}

Sachin's statement implies that for *every* pair (a, b) summing to S, the product a*b must have *multiple* factor pairs (c, d > 1) whose sums (c+d) are *also* plausible initial sums (sums for which Sachin could make his first statement). The provided solution simplifies this: Sachin's confidence implies that the sum S *cannot* be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Let's call this property \"Property S1\".\n\n3.  **Prashant's Deduction:** Prashant, knowing P and having heard Sachin's statement (thus knowing the true sum S must have Property S1), states that he *now* knows the numbers. This means that among all pairs of integers (c, d) > 1 whose product is P, exactly *one* pair (x, y) has a sum (x+y) that satisfies Property S1 (i.e., is on the \"Possible Sum List\" derived from Step 2). This uniqueness allows Prashant to identify the correct pair (x, y) from the product P. Let's call this property \"Property P1\" for the product P.\n\n4.  **Sachin's Second Deduction:** Sachin, knowing S and having heard Prashant's statement (thus knowing the true product P must have Property P1), states that he *now* also knows the numbers. This means that among all the pairs of integers (a, b) > 1 that sum to S, exactly *one* pair (x, y) has a product (x*y) that satisfies Property P1 (the product property from Step 3). Sachin can find this unique pair (x, y) by checking which of the products resulting from pairs summing to S is the one that would have allowed Prashant to deduce the numbers.\n\n5.  **Nakul's Deduction:** Nakul hears the entire conversation and understands the logical sequence of deductions made by Sachin and Prashant based on Properties S1 and P1. By following the same logic, he can also uniquely identify the pair of numbers.\n\n6.  **Finding the Numbers:** The solution demonstrates that the unique pair of integers greater than 1 that satisfies all these conditions is (4, 13).\n    *   Their sum is 17, which satisfies Property S1 (17 is not the sum of two primes, allowing Sachin's first statement).\n    *   Their product is 52. The pairs >1 multiplying to 52 are (2, 26) and (4, 13). 2+26=28, and 28 can be written as 5+23 (sum of two primes), so 28 does *not* satisfy Property S1. 4+13=17, which *does* satisfy Property S1. Since only (4,13) among the factor pairs of 52 has a sum satisfying Property S1, the product 52 satisfies Property P1, allowing Prashant to deduce the numbers.\n    *   Sachin, knowing S=17, considers pairs (a,b) summing to 17: (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10), (8,9). Their products are 30, 42, 52, 60, 66, 70, 72. By checking which of these products satisfies Property P1 (Prashant's unique identification), Sachin finds that only the product 52 does (as shown above). Since S=17 leads to P=52 uniquely satisfying Property P1, Sachin knows the numbers must be the pair summing to 17 that yields a product of 52, which is (4, 13).\n\nThus, the numbers are 4 and 13, deduced through the specific logical properties implied by each step of the conversation.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

Define the variables: Let L be the length of the train, V be the speed of the train, and v be the walking speed of Al and Ben.\n2.  Recognize that Al walks 30 feet *away* from the train's direction in the time it takes the train's back to pass him. Ben walks 45 feet *in the same direction* as the train in the time it takes the train's back to pass him.\n3.  Formulate equations based on relative speed and time. When Al walks away, the relative speed of the train's back approaching him is V + v. The time Al walks is 30/v. The distance the train's back covers relative to Al is L. So, L = (V + v) * (30/v). When Ben walks in the same direction, the relative speed of the train's back approaching him is V - v. The time Ben walks is 45/v. The distance the train's back covers relative to Ben is L. So, L = (V - v) * (45/v).\n4.  Equate the two expressions for L: (V + v) * (30/v) = (V - v) * (45/v). Simplify this equation by multiplying by v and dividing by 15: 2(V + v) = 3(V - v).\n5.  Solve the simplified equation for the relationship between V and v: 2V + 2v = 3V - 3v. This gives V = 5v, meaning the train is 5 times faster than Al and Ben. This matches the conclusion in the provided solution.\n6.  Consider Al's motion again. Al walks 30 feet. The time he walks is t = 30/v. In this same time t, the front of the train (which started at the same point as Al) travels a distance D = V * t.\n7.  Substitute the relationship V = 5v and the time t = 30/v into the distance formula for the train: D = (5v) * (30/v) = 5 * 30 = 150 feet. This means the front of the train has moved 150 feet from the starting point by the time Al stops.\n8.  Visualize the situation when Al stops: Al is 30 feet from the starting point (walking away from the train's initial direction), and the back of the train is exactly where Al is. The front of the train is 150 feet from the starting point. The length of the train (L) is the distance between its front and its back.\n9.  Since the front of the train is 150 feet from the start, and the back of the train is at Al's position (-30 feet from the start in the opposite direction, or 30 feet from the start in Al's walking direction), the length of the train is the distance the front moved plus the distance Al moved: L = 150 feet + 30 feet.\n10. Calculate the train's length: L = 150 + 30 = 180 feet. This matches the final calculation in the provided solution.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

This gives the relationship: `z = x + y`.\n\n2.  **Derive Equations from Clues:**\n    *   The clue about Mum turning 50 states that when Mum is 50, Tony's age will be `x`.\n    *   The number of years until Mum turns 50 is `50 - Mum_now`.\n    *   Tony's age then will be `Tony_now + (50 - Mum_now)`.\n    *   We know `Tony_now = Mum_now - z`. Substituting this gives Tony's future age as `(Mum_now - z) + (50 - Mum_now) = 50 - z`.\n    *   Setting this equal to `x` (from the clue) gives the equation: `50 - z = x`, or `x + z = 50`.\n    *   Combine this with the relationship `z = x + y` (or `x = z - y`) from Step 1. Substituting `x = z - y` into `x + z = 50` gives `(z - y) + z = 50`, which simplifies to `2z - y = 50`, or `2z = 50 + y`.\n\n3.  **Find Possible Ages when Tony was Born:**\n    *   From the clue about when Tony was born, Mum's age was `z`, and Tommy's age was `y`.\n    *   Also, `y` must be a factor of `z` (since Tommy's age was a factor of Mum's age).\n    *   We use the equation `2z = 50 + y` and the condition that `y` is a factor of `z` to find possible pairs of `(z, y)`. Testing possible values, the only integer solutions where `y` is a positive factor of `z` are `(z=26, y=2)` and `(z=30, y=10)`.\n\n4.  **Use the \"Factors of Mum's Age\" Clue to Select the Correct Pair:**\n    *   The clue states that when Tony was born, the ages of Timmy, Tracey, Tommy, and Tammy were *all* factors of Mum's age (`z`). This was one of only two times when *more than two* children's ages were factors of Mum's age.\n    *   In case 1: `z=26` (Mum was 26), `y=2` (Tommy was 2). The factors of 26 less than 2 are just 1. The ages of Timmy, Tammy, and Tracey must be distinct factors of 26 less than Tommy's age (2), which is impossible as only age 1 fits, and they need three distinct ages.\n    *   In case 2: `z=30` (Mum was 30), `y=10` (Tommy was 10). The factors of 30 less than 10 are {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}. We need three distinct ages for Timmy, Tammy, and Tracey from this set such that Timmy > Tammy > Tracey, which is possible (e.g., 6, 5, 3). This case fits the criteria of having four children's ages (10, plus three from {1,2,3,5,6}) being factors of Mum's age (30).\n    *   Therefore, Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born (`z=30`, `y=10`). The ages of Timmy, Tammy, and Tracey when Tony was born must be three distinct numbers from {1, 2, 3, 5, 6} in decreasing order.\n\n5.  **Use Tammy's Current Age Clue to Determine Timmy's Age When Tony was Born:**\n    *   Tammy's current age is three times Timmy's age when Tony was born.\n    *   The possible ages for Timmy when Tony was born are the largest of the possible sets of three distinct ages from {1, 2, 3, 5, 6} ordered decreasingly. Possible Timmy ages are 6, 5, or 3.\n    *   This means Tammy's current age must be 3 * 6 = 18, 3 * 5 = 15, or 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n6.  **Use the \"Second Special Year\" Clue to Find Tammy's Current Age:**\n    *   The other year where more than two children's ages were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as Tammy is *now*.\n    *   Test the possible current ages for Tammy from Step 5:\n        *   If Tammy is 15 or 9, Tracey's age in the second year would be 7.5 or 4.5 respectively, which are not whole years.

Since Tracey was 3 when Tony was born, this was 9 - 3 = 6 years after Tony was born.\n    *   In that year (6 years after Tony was born): Mum was 30+6=36.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "Question: The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.\n\"That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?\"\nBill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?\n Solution: Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.

This rule must hold for four different weddings occurring in consecutive years.\n2.  **Utilize the modulo 9 property:** A key mathematical property is that any positive integer is congruent to the sum of its digits modulo 9 (i.e., `n \u2261 sum_of_digits(n) (mod 9)`). This means the wedding condition `Bride's Age = Sum of Sisters' Digit Sums` implies `Bride's Age \u2261 Sum of Sisters' Ages (mod 9)`.\n3.  **Formulate a system of congruences:** Let the current ages of the four sisters be a, b, c, and d. Based on the wedding timeline (Alice 3 years ago, Barbara 2 years ago, Cheryl 1 year ago, Denise now) and the modulo 9 property from Step 2, set up a system of four linear congruences. For example, for Denise's wedding now: `d \u2261 a + b + c (mod 9)`. For Alice's wedding 3 years ago (ages a-3, b-3, c-3, d-3): `a-3 \u2261 (b-3) + (c-3) + (d-3) (mod 9)`.\n4.  **Solve the modular system:** Solve the system of linear congruences derived in Step 3. This yields the value of each sister's age modulo 9: a \u2261 0, b \u2261 1, c \u2261 2, d \u2261 3 (all modulo 9). This significantly narrows down the possible integer values for their ages.\n5.  **Determine the specific ages:** Use the modular constraints from Step 4, the original digit sum rule, and the fact that the weddings occurred in consecutive years (which gives the relative ages of the sisters at each wedding) to find the specific integer ages. By checking possible ages that fit the modular results and satisfy the digit-sum condition for each of the four wedding years, the unique set of ages is found through logical deduction and checking consistency across the years.\n6.  **State the final ages:** The ages that satisfy all the given conditions are Alice 27, Barbara 28, Cheryl 20, and Denise 21.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "0"}

Translate Sue's statement about the digits. Let Y be represented as A * 10^(n-1) + B, where A is the first digit, B is the number formed by the remaining n-1 digits, and n is the total number of digits in Y. Sandy's wealth X is then formed by taking the digits of B and placing A at the end, which means X = 10B + A.\n6.  Substitute the expressions for X and Y from step 5 into the relationship 7X = 5Y found in step 4: 7(10B + A) = 5(A * 10^(n-1) + B).\n7.

Since 65 is divisible by 5, the left side (65B) is divisible by 5. The term (5 * 10^(n-1) - 7) on the right side ends in digit 3 (5 * 10^(n-1) is a number ending in 0, so subtracting 7 results in a number ending in 3), and thus is not divisible by 5 for n > 1 (if n=1, Y=A, X=A, 7A=5A, A=0, impossible). Therefore, the other factor on the right side, A, must be divisible by 5. Since A is a single digit from 1 to 9 (it's the first digit of a positive number), A must be 5.\n9.  Substitute A = 5 back into the equation: 65B = (5 * 10^(n-1) - 7) * 5.\n10. Divide both sides by 5: 13B = 5 * 10^(n-1) - 7.\n11.

To do this, find the highest power of each prime factor present in these numbers:\n    *   Primes involved: 2, 3, 5, 7\n    *   Highest power of 2: from 8 = 2\u00b3, so 2\u00b3 = 8\n    *   Highest power of 3: from 9 = 3\u00b2, so 3\u00b2 = 9\n    *   Highest power of 5: from 5 or 10, so 5\u00b9 = 5\n    *   Highest power of 7: from 7, so 7\u00b9 = 7\n    *   LCM = 2\u00b3 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b9 \u00d7 7\u00b9 = 8 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 = 72 \u00d7 35 = 2520.\n    So, N - 1 is a multiple of 2520.\n\n4.  **Express N in terms of the LCM:** Since N - 1 is a multiple of 2520, we can write N - 1 = 2520 * m, where 'm' is a non-negative integer (since the number of eggs must be positive). Rearranging this, we get N = 2520 * m + 1.\n\n5.  **Use the divisibility condition for 11:** We know N must be divisible by 11 (N \u2261 0 (mod 11)). Substitute the expression for N from the previous step into this congruence:\n    2520 * m + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 11)\n\n6.  **Solve the congruence for m:** Find the remainder of 2520 when divided by 11:\n    2520 = 11 * 229 + 1. So, 2520 \u2261 1 (mod 11).\n    Substitute this back into the congruence from Step 5:\n    1 * m + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 11)\n    m + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 11)\n    m \u2261 -1 (mod 11)\n    m \u2261 10 (mod 11)\n    This means 'm' must be of the form 11k + 10 for some integer k. Since N must be a positive number of eggs, 2520*m + 1 > 0. If m=0, N=1, which doesn't satisfy the divisibility by 11. So, m must be a positive integer. The smallest positive integer 'm' satisfying m \u2261 10 (mod 11) is when k=0, which gives m = 10.\n\n7.  **Calculate the minimum number of eggs:** Substitute the smallest positive value of m (which is 10) back into the expression for N from Step 4:\n    N = 2520 * m + 1\n    N = 2520 * 10 + 1\n    N = 25200 + 1\n    N = 25201\n    This is the smallest number that satisfies all the given conditions.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "0"}

The goal is to measure exactly 61 minutes.\n2.  **Start the process:** To create a measurable time interval and adjust stick lengths, have the slow termite begin eating the longer (16-inch) stick.\n3.  **Equalize stick lengths:** Allow the slow termite to eat from the 16-inch stick until its length is reduced to equal the shorter stick's length (12 inches). This means the slow termite eats 16 - 12 = 4 inches.\n4.  **Calculate the time for the first phase:** Eating 4 inches at a rate of 1 inch per 4 minutes takes 4 inches * 4 minutes/inch = 16 minutes. At this point, both sticks are 12 inches long, and 16 minutes have passed.\n5.  **Introduce the second termite:** At exactly the 16-minute mark (when both sticks are 12 inches), start the fast termite eating the *other* stick (the one that was originally 12 inches, now also 12 inches).\n6.  **Simultaneous eating phase:** Allow the fast termite to eat its 12-inch stick completely. This takes 12 inches * 3 minutes/inch = 36 minutes. During this same 36-minute period, the slow termite continues eating its stick.\n7.  **Calculate progress during the second phase:** While the fast termite eats for 36 minutes, the slow termite eats an additional 36 minutes / (4 minutes/inch) = 9 inches from its stick.\n8.  **Determine the state after the second phase:** After 36 minutes (total elapsed time: 16 + 36 = 52 minutes), the fast termite has finished its stick.

Also, calculate the cost to fill the non-open space with wood at $10/m\u00b3.\n\n**Summary of the Solution:**\n\nThe solution uses geometry and algebra to determine the dimensions of the building (which are equal to the diameter and height of the inscribed cylinder). It models the problem in 2D by considering the base of the cube and the inscribed circle representing the cylinder's base. The dimensions of the corner office relate a point on this circle to the corner of the square base.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1.  **Define Variables and Geometric Setup:** Let the side length of the perfect cube building be `D`. Since the cylinder is inscribed in the cube and is open, its diameter and height are also `D`. The radius of the cylinder's base is `R = D/2`. The base of the building is a square with side `D`. The base of the cylinder is a circle with radius `R` centered in the square.\n2.  **Translate the Corner Office Information into Coordinates:** Assume the corner of the building where the office is located is at the origin (0,0) of a 2D coordinate system representing the building's base. The corner office is described as 16m by 8m and extends to the edge of the open area. This implies that the point (16, 8), measured from the building corner (0,0), lies exactly on the circumference of the circle representing the cylinder's base.\n3.  **Formulate an Equation using the Distance Formula:** The center of the circle (the cylinder's base) is at the center of the square base, which is at (D/2, D/2), or (R, R) using the radius variable. The distance from the center of the circle (R, R) to any point on its circumference (like the point (16, 8)) must be equal to the radius R. Using the distance formula (derived from the Pythagorean theorem), this gives the equation: `sqrt((16 - R)^2 + (8 - R)^2) = R`.\n4.  **Solve the Equation for the Radius:** Square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root: `(16 - R)^2 + (8 - R)^2 = R^2`. Expand the squared terms: `(R^2 - 32R + 256) + (R^2 - 16R + 64) = R^2`. Combine like terms: `2R^2 - 48R + 320 = R^2`. Rearrange into a quadratic equation: `R^2 - 48R + 320 = 0`.\n5.  **Find the Possible Radii by Solving the Quadratic Equation:** Solve the quadratic equation (e.g., using the quadratic formula `R = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a`). The coefficients are a=1, b=-48, c=320. The solutions are `R = [48 \u00b1 sqrt((-48)^2 - 4*1*320)] / 2`. This simplifies to `R = [48 \u00b1 sqrt(2304 - 1280)] / 2 = [48 \u00b1 sqrt(1024)] / 2 = [48 \u00b1 32] / 2`. This yields two possible values for the radius: `R1 = (48 + 32) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40` and `R2 = (48 - 32) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8`.\n6.  **Select the Valid Radius:** Evaluate the two possible radii in the context of the problem. If R=8, the diameter D=16. A 16x8 corner office in a 16x16 building with a 16m diameter cylinder would mean the open area essentially covers the entire base, and the office would be entirely within this open area, which contradicts the idea of a solid office space *around* the open cylinder. If R=40, the diameter D=80. A 16x8 corner office in an 80x80 building base, where the point (16,8) touches the edge of the 80m diameter open cylinder, is a much more plausible scenario for a \"corner office\" adjacent to a large central open space. Therefore, R=40 is the valid radius.\n7.  **Determine the Building Dimensions:** Since the radius is R=40m, the diameter D = 2 * R = 2 * 40m = 80m. The building is a perfect cube, so its dimensions are 80m x 80m x 80m. The cylinder's dimensions are 80m diameter and 80m height.\n8.  **Calculate the Volume of Solid Wood:** The volume of solid wood required is the volume of the cube minus the volume of the open cylinder. The volume of the cube is `V_cube = side^3 = 80m * 80m * 80m = 512,000 m\u00b3`. The volume of the cylinder is `V_cylinder = pi * radius^2 * height = pi * (40m)^2 * 80m = pi * 1600 m\u00b2 * 80m = 128,000 * pi m\u00b3`. Using the approximation `pi \u2248 3.14159`, `V_cylinder \u2248 128,000 * 3.14159 m\u00b3 \u2248 402,124 m\u00b3`. The volume of solid wood is `V_solid = V_cube - V_cylinder \u2248 512,000 m\u00b3 - 402,124 m\u00b3 = 109,876 m\u00b3`.\n9.  **Calculate the Total Cost:** The cost of the wood is the volume of solid wood multiplied by the price per cubic meter ($10/m\u00b3). `Cost = V_solid * $10/m\u00b3 \u2248 109,876 m\u00b3 * $10/m\u00b3 = $1,098,760`.\n\nThus, the building dimensions are 80m x 80m x 80m (cube) and 80m diameter x 80m high (cylinder), and the approximate cost for the wood is $1,098,760.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

This interval is 385 days.\n2.  **Identify cycle lengths:** Recognize that the purchase cycle length for each item (newspaper, cigarettes, cream, coffee) must be an integer divisor (factor) of this 385-day interval, because all cycles must align at the beginning and end of this period.\n3.  **List possible cycle lengths:** Find all the integer factors of 385.

Represent the four daughter's ages as positive integers, say A, B, C, and D.\n2.  Translate Rex's first set of instructions for *each* daughter into an algebraic expression. For daughter A, the numbers are A*B, A*C, and A*D. The product of these three is (AB)(AC)(AD) = A\u00b3BCD. Similarly, the products for daughters B, C, and D are B\u00b3ACD, C\u00b3ABD, and D\u00b3ABC, respectively.\n3.  Calculate the product of these four results: (A\u00b3BCD)(B\u00b3ACD)(C\u00b3ABD)(D\u00b3ABC).

Follow Rex's next instruction to divide this total by the product of the four ages (ABCD). This gives (ABCD)\u2076 / (ABCD) = (ABCD)\u2075. Since A, B, C, and D are integers, ABCD is an integer. As long as ABCD is not zero (which is true since ages are positive), (ABCD)\u2076 is perfectly divisible by ABCD, resulting in the integer (ABCD)\u2075. There is no fractional portion to discard.\n5.  Follow Rex's next instruction to subtract the product of the four ages (ABCD) from the current value ((ABCD)\u2075). The value before the final step is (ABCD)\u2075 - (ABCD).\n6.  Recognize that the problem asks for the remainder when this value ((ABCD)\u2075 - (ABCD)) is divided by 10.

This property means that x\u2075 - x is always divisible by 10 for any integer x.\n8.  Substitute x = ABCD into the property. Since A, B, C, and D are integers, ABCD is also an integer. Therefore, (ABCD)\u2075 \u2261 ABCD (mod 10), which implies (ABCD)\u2075 - ABCD \u2261 0 (mod 10).\n9.

Analyze the provided examples to understand the pattern and the rule for the Quocorrian numbering system. The solution hint \"multiply the rightmost number by 1, the second rightmost number by 10, the third by 100, and so on... Solve the problem like that, and divide by two\" suggests a process involving place values and a final division.\n2.  Determine the specific application of the rule: Each number (operand) in the original expression is assigned a place value based on its position when read from right to left (the rightmost number gets 10^0=1, the second rightmost gets 10^1=10, etc.).\n3.  Form a new calculation: Replace the original numbers in the expression with their place-valued equivalents (e.g., the first number on the left is multiplied by 10^k, the second by 10^(k-1), ..., the last by 10^0) while keeping the original operators (+, -, *, /) in their original positions.\n4.  Perform the calculation: Evaluate the new expression formed in step 3 using standard order of operations.\n5.  Apply the final step of the rule: Divide the result obtained from the calculation in step 4 by 2.\n6.  Apply these steps to the problem 3*6: The numbers are 3 and 6. Reading right to left, 6 is the rightmost (place value 1), and 3 is the second rightmost (place value 10). This converts 6 to 6*1=6 and 3 to 3*10=30. The original expression was 3 * 6. The new expression is 30 * 6. Evaluating this gives 180. Finally, divide by 2: 180 / 2 = 90.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

For a number to have exactly 7 factors, the product of (exponent + 1) values must equal 7. Since 7 is a prime number, the only way to achieve a product of 7 is by having a single term equal to 7. This means the number must have only one prime factor, and its exponent must be 6 (because $6+1=7$). Thus, any positive integer with exactly 7 factors must be of the form $p^6$, where $p$ is a prime number.\n\n2.  **Identify the smallest integers with exactly 7 factors:** We find these integers by taking the smallest prime numbers and raising them to the power of 6.

Since $7^6$ is already much larger than 20,000, any integer $p^6$ where $p \\ge 7$ will be too large to be one of the three numbers in the sum. Therefore, the only possible integers with 7 factors that can contribute to the sum less than 20,000 are $2^6=64$, $3^6=729$, and $5^6=15625$.\n\n4.  **Formulate the sum:** The problem asks for a positive integer less than 20,000 that is the sum of three positive integers, each containing exactly 7 factors. The phrasing \"the only positive integer number less than 20,000 that is also a sum...\" implies a unique result for the sum. To obtain a unique sum less than 20,000 using the numbers available ($64, 729, 15625$), we must select the three smallest distinct integers from this list. Any other combination of three integers from this list (allowing for repetition) or including larger $p^6$ values would either result in sums greater than 20,000 or multiple possible sums less than 20,000, contradicting the \"only\" requirement. Thus, the three integers must be the distinct values 64, 729, and 15625.\n\n5.  **Calculate the sum:** Add the three identified integers: $64 + 729 + 15625$.\n\n6.  **Verify the sum:** $64 + 729 = 793$.

This sum, 16418, is a positive integer less than 20,000.\n\n7.  **Confirm uniqueness:** Any other sum of three distinct positive integers with exactly 7 factors would have to include $7^6$ or a larger power, resulting in a sum greater than 20,000 (e.g., $64 + 729 + 7^6 > 20000$). Therefore, 16418 is the only possible sum of three distinct positive integers with exactly 7 factors that is less than 20,000.\n\n8.  **State the answer:** The unique positive integer less than 20,000 that fits the criteria is 16418.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

For each attribute's reported initial rating and total voter count `[N]`, it searches for fractions `4 * p / v` that produce a decimal value close to the reported initial rating. The denominator `v` is chosen to be close to the reported `[N]`, and the numerator is chosen to be a multiple of 4 (representing `4*p`). The estimated number of positive votes (`p`) is then calculated by dividing the numerator by 4, and the estimated total previous votes (`v`) is the denominator.\n\n3.  **Apply the Method and Calculate Expected Results:** This estimation method is applied to the initial ratings and voter counts provided for four example teasers (M, N, O, P) for both their \"fun\" and \"hard\" attributes. Based on the estimated initial `p` and `v` for each attribute, the solution then calculates the *expected* rating *after* the user's vote (which adds 1 to `v` and, if the vote was positive for that attribute, adds 1 to `p`, resulting in the new fraction `4*(p+1)/(v+1)` or `4*p/(v+1)`).\n\n4.  **Compare Expected Results to Reported Results and Note Discrepancies:** The decimal values of the calculated initial and post-vote ratings (based on the estimated `p` and `v`) are compared to the actual reported initial and post-vote ratings for each teaser. While Teaser N shows an exact match, the other teasers exhibit small but consistent differences (e.g., \u00b10.01 or more) between the calculated and reported ratings.\n\n5.  **Propose a Source for \"Experimental Error\":** The solution suggests that the likely reason for these discrepancies is not an error in the `4*p/v` formula itself, but in how the website internally manages the count of positive votes (`p`). Instead of maintaining a direct integer count of `p`, the site might be recalculating `p` for each attribute by reverse-engineering it from the *previously displayed (and potentially rounded) rating)* and the total vote count (`v`). This reverse calculation would likely involve rounding (`p \u2248 round(Previous_Rating * v / 4)`), and these rounding errors could accumulate over multiple votes, leading to deviations from the exact `4*p/v` value.\n\n6.  **Suggest Potential Solutions:** Based on the proposed source of error, the solution suggests fixes. The most robust fix would be for the website to store and use the direct integer count of positive votes (`p`) for each attribute. A less ideal, temporary fix could be to ensure that any recalculation of `p` derived from a rating is rounded to the nearest integer.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

The vertical distance from the spotlight (at roof height) to the balcony floor is 700cm - 400cm = 300cm. Because the spotlight angle is 45 degrees, this vertical distance is equal to the horizontal distance from the center to the edge of the circular balcony. This horizontal distance is the radius (r) of the balcony, so r = 300cm. The floor thickness is given as 30cm. The fence height is 1m (100cm) and its thickness is 10cm.\n\n2.  **Calculate the volume of the balcony floor:** The balcony floor is a full circle with radius 300cm and thickness 30cm.

The solution calculates this volume by summing the volumes of 10 thin cylindrical half-shells, each 1cm thick, from the outer radius (300cm) inwards to a radius of 291cm. The volume of a thin cylindrical half-shell is approximately (1/2) * (2\u03c0 * radius) * thickness * height = \u03c0 * radius * thickness * height.

The question about the largest score that *cannot* be achieved relates to a known mathematical result called the Frobenius Coin Problem for two variables.\n2.  **State the formula for the largest unobtainable score:** For two positive integers, `p` and `q`, that are relatively prime (having no common factors other than 1), the largest integer that cannot be expressed in the form `ap + bq` for non-negative integers `a` and `b` is given by the formula `pq - p - q`.\n3.  **Relate the formula to the given information:** The problem states that the largest score that can never be achieved is 95 points. Let `p` be the points for the bungee and `q` be the points for the wedgie. So, we have the equation `pq - p - q = 95`.\n4.  **Rewrite the formula:** The expression `pq - p - q` can be algebraically rewritten as `(p-1)(q-1) - 1`.\n5.  **Substitute and simplify the equation:** Using the rewritten formula, the equation becomes `(p-1)(q-1) - 1 = 95`. Adding 1 to both sides gives `(p-1)(q-1) = 96`.\n6.  **Establish properties of the point values (p and q):** The problem states that both the bungee and wedgie are worth an *odd prime* number of points, and the bungee is worth more than the wedgie. Let `p` be the bungee points and `q` be the wedgie points, so `p` and `q` are odd primes and `p > q`. Since `p` and `q` are distinct odd primes, they are relatively prime, which satisfies the condition for using the formula from step 2.\n7.  **Deduce properties of (p-1) and (q-1):** Since `p` and `q` are odd primes, `p-1` and `q-1` must both be even numbers (an odd number minus 1 is always even). Also, since `p > q`, it follows that `p-1 > q-1`.\n8.  **Find factor pairs of 96 that fit the properties:** We need to find pairs of even factors of 96, let's call them `A` and `B`, such that `A * B = 96`, `A` and `B` are even, and `A > B` (where `A = p-1` and `B = q-1`). The factor pairs of 96 where both factors are even and the first is greater than the second are (48, 2), (24, 4), (16, 6), and (12, 8).\n9.  **Test each factor pair to find the prime scores:** For each pair (A, B), we check if `A+1` (potential `p`) and `B+1` (potential `q`) are both odd prime numbers, with `A+1 > B+1`:\n    *   Pair (48, 2): `p = 48+1 = 49`, `q = 2+1 = 3`. `q=3` is an odd prime, but `p=49` is not (49 = 7 * 7). This pair does not work.\n    *   Pair (24, 4): `p = 24+1 = 25`, `q = 4+1 = 5`. `q=5` is an odd prime, but `p=25` is not (25 = 5 * 5). This pair does not work.\n    *   Pair (16, 6): `p = 16+1 = 17`, `q = 6+1 = 7`. `p=17` is an odd prime, and `q=7` is an odd prime. Also, 17 > 7. This pair fits all the conditions.\n    *   Pair (12, 8): `p = 12+1 = 13`, `q = 8+1 = 9`. `p=13` is an odd prime, but `q=9` is not (9 = 3 * 3). This pair does not work.\n10. **Identify the unique solution:** The only pair of factors of 96 that satisfies all the conditions derived from the problem is (16, 6), which leads to the point values `p=17` and `q=7`.\n11. **Assign the point values to the moves:** Since `p` is the bungee score and `q` is the wedgie score, and the bungee is worth more than the wedgie (`17 > 7`), the bungee is worth 17 points and the wedgie is worth 7 points.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.\nEileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.\nNow, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.

Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.\n2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.\nWho will reach the ground first and how many additional minutes will it take the loser to finish the race?\n Solution: Jack will win the race and it will take an additional half minute to catch up with him.\nJacks moves 0.8 meters vertically in each step movement:\nAccording to Pythagoras theorem for right angled triangle:\nA^2 = B^2+C^2 (where A is the hypotenuse)\nReplacing A by the diagonally crossed distance, B by the distance between Jack's feet and C by the vertically climbed distance:\n1^2 = 0.6^2+C^2\nC = 0.8 m\nJill moves 1 meter vertically in each hop.\nAccording to the circle circumference calculation:\nCircumference = Diameter * Pi\n(where Pi = 3.14 and Diameter is the vertically climbed down distance)\n2 * 1.57 = D * 3.14\nDiameter = 1 meter\n1.Time: 1.5 minutes elapsing\nJack: Finished 4.8 meters\nJill: Finished 6.0 meters and starting her 1 minute rest\n2.Time: 2.5 minutes elapsing\nJack: Finished 8.0 meters (crossed an additional 3.2 meters in 1 minute while Jill is resting)\nJill: Finished 6.0 meters and ending her 1 minute rest\nNote: Losing the first stage (8 meters), Jill has to wait for half minute penalty time and at the same time Jack starts his 1 minute rest having crossed 8.0 meters.\n3.

What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?\"\nJoseph smiled and replied, \"Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.\"\n\"Really? But then why did the company like it?\" wondered Martin, \"What use does it have then?

The goal is to find these two weights, given that there's a maximum weight that *cannot* be measured, and all integer weights above that maximum *can* be measured. This is a variation of the Frobenius Coin Problem for two denominations.\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for the largest unmeasurable weight:** For two relatively prime positive integer weights, let's call them `w1` and `w2`, the largest integer weight that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of `w1` and `w2` is given by the formula `(w1 * w2) - w1 - w2`. This formula can be rewritten as `(w1 - 1)(w2 - 1) - 1`. The fact that all weights *above* 119 can be measured implies that the two weights must be relatively prime.\n\n3.  **Use the given information about the largest unmeasurable weight:** The problem states that the system cannot measure 119 pounds, but can measure any weight above 119 pounds. This means 119 is the largest unmeasurable weight. Set the formula from Step 2 equal to 119: `(w1 - 1)(w2 - 1) - 1 = 119`.\n\n4.  **Solve the equation for the product of (w1-1) and (w2-1):** Add 1 to both sides of the equation from Step 3: `(w1 - 1)(w2 - 1) = 119 + 1 = 120`.\n\n5.  **Introduce variables for simplified expression:** Let `x = w1 - 1` and `y = w2 - 1`. The equation from Step 4 becomes `x * y = 120`. We are looking for two integers `x` and `y` whose product is 120.\n\n6.  **Use the given constraint about the weights:** The problem states that both weights are heavier than 10 pounds. This means `w1 > 10` and `w2 > 10`.\n\n7.  **Translate the weight constraint into a constraint on the new variables:** If `w1 > 10`, then `w1 - 1 > 9`, so `x > 9`. Similarly, if `w2 > 10`, then `w2 - 1 > 9`, so `y > 9`. We are looking for two integer factors `x` and `y` of 120 where both `x` and `y` are greater than 9.\n\n8.  **Find the factors of 120 and identify pairs meeting the constraint:** List pairs of integer factors `(x, y)` whose product is 120: (1, 120), (2, 60), (3, 40), (4, 30), (5, 24), (6, 20), (8, 15), (10, 12), and their reverses. Check which pairs have both factors greater than 9. The only pair satisfying this condition is (10, 12).\n\n9.  **Calculate the original weights from the identified factors:** Since `x = w1 - 1` and `y = w2 - 1`, we have `w1 = x + 1` and `w2 = y + 1`. Using the pair (10, 12), we get `w1 = 10 + 1 = 11` and `w2 = 12 + 1 = 13`.\n\n10. **State the answer:** The two types of weights suggested were 11 pounds and 13 pounds.

This means $40S = 3P$. Since $S$ and $P$ are integers, the sum of the digits ($S$) must be a multiple of 3, and the product of the digits ($P$) must be a multiple of 40. We can represent this relationship as $S=3k$ and $P=40k$ for some positive integer $k$.

Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?\"\n\"No, you could not.\"\n\"Aha!

Now, what was the number of the bus?\nThe bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.\n Solution: The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N.

The second mathematician knows B and, after the conversation, deduces A.\n\n2.  **Identify the Condition for Non-Uniqueness:** The first mathematician's statement, \"No, you could not\" (work out the individual ages from A and N), implies that for the *specific* values of A and N that the first mathematician provides (corresponding to the unknown bus number B), there must be *at least two distinct sets* of positive integer ages that sum to B and have a product equal to A.\n\n3.  **Identify the Condition for Uniqueness of the Ambiguous Case:** The second mathematician's final statement, \"Aha! At last, I know how old you are!\" (deducing A from the situation), implies that among all possible ways to partition the bus number B into ages, there must be *only one* possible value of A (product of ages) that satisfies the condition in Step 2 (i.e., that corresponds to multiple sets of ages summing to B). If there were two or more such values of A, the second mathematician wouldn't know which one the first mathematician had.\n\n4.  **Determine the Goal for Finding B:** Therefore, the bus number (B) must be the smallest positive integer such that there is exactly one possible value for the product of ages (A) where multiple different sets of positive integer ages sum to B and have that product A.\n\n5.  **Apply Trial and Error (as described in the solution):** The solution states that testing different bus numbers (B) is required. For small values of B, there are no cases with multiple age sets for the same product A. As B increases, cases with non-unique age sets for a given product A appear. The bus number B must be the *first* number for which exactly one such product A exists.\n\n6.  **State the Result from Trial:** The solution finds through this process (testing numbers and identifying when a single ambiguous product A emerges) that the bus number B = 12 is the smallest integer satisfying the condition from Step 4.

{"ID": 73, "Question": "Question: Achmed and Ali were camel-drivers and on one day they decided to quit their job. They wanted to become shepherds. So they went to the market and sold all their camels. The amount of money (dinars) they received for each camel was the same as the total number of camels they owned. With that money they bought as many sheep as possible at 10 dinars a sheep. With the money that was left they bought a goat.\nOn their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, \"I take the last sheep and you can get the goat\". \"That's not fair,\" said Achmed, \"a goat costs less than a sheep\". \"OK,\" Ali said, \"then I will give you one of my dogs and then we are even\".

This translates to the equation: Cost of Sheep - Cost of Goat = 2 * Cost of Dog.\n2.  **Identify the known cost and the unknown needed:** The cost of a sheep is known (10 dinars). Substituting this into the equation from Step 1 gives: 10 - Cost of Goat = 2 * Cost of Dog. To find the cost of a dog, we first need to find the cost of the goat.\n3.  **Relate total money to goat cost:** The total money received from selling the camels was a perfect square (number of camels squared). This money was used to buy sheep at 10 dinars each, and the *remaining* money was used to buy the goat. This means the cost of the goat is the remainder when the total money is divided by 10, which is the units digit of the total money.\n4.  **Determine a property of the total money's digits:** The total number of sheep bought was the total money divided by 10 (integer part). When they divided the sheep among themselves, there was one sheep left over. This indicates the total number of sheep was odd. An odd number of tens implies the tens digit of the total money is odd.\n5.  **Recall/Apply a property of perfect squares:** There is a mathematical property stating that any perfect square with an odd digit in its tens place must have a 6 in its units place.\n6.  **Deduce the goat's cost:** Since the total money is a perfect square with an odd tens digit (from Step 4), its units digit must be 6 (from Step 5). As established in Step 3, the units digit of the total money is the cost of the goat. Therefore, the goat costs 6 dinars.\n7.  **Calculate the dog's cost:** Substitute the goat's cost (6 dinars) into the equation from Step 2: 10 - 6 = 2 * Cost of Dog. This simplifies to 4 = 2 * Cost of Dog. Solving for the cost of the dog gives 2 dinars.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}
{"ID": 74, "Question": "Question: Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.\nThe system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.\nSo: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.\nThe problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?\n Solution: The minimum number of weights is 5.\nweight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0\nweight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1\nweight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2\nweight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3\nweight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4\nAll five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.\nThe progression from one stone to one mass would be:\n1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....", "Hint": "The title has a slight hint.\nThe number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.", "Human Solution": "The minimum number of weights is 5.\nweight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0\nweight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1\nweight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2\nweight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3\nweight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4\nAll five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.\nThe progression from one stone to one mass would be:\n1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": "Here is a summary of the solution to the problem, broken down into simple steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem and Units:** The goal is to find the minimum number of weights needed to measure any integer weight from 1 stone up to 1 mass using a balance scale. The units are defined as 1 lump = 11 stone, and 1 mass = 11 lumps = 121 stone. Thus, we need to measure weights from 1 to 121 stones.\n\n2.  **Analyze Measurement with a Balance Scale:** With a balance scale, weights can be placed on either pan. To measure a target weight, we place the unknown object on one pan. We can then achieve balance by placing our known weights on either the *same* pan as the object (adding to its weight) or on the *opposite* pan (effectively subtracting from the known weights on the other side). This means any measurable weight can be represented as a sum `c1*w1 + c2*w2 + ... + cn*wn`, where `wi` are the available weights and `ci` can be -1, 0, or +1 (representing placing the weight on the opposite pan, not using it, or placing it on the same pan as the object/to balance the object directly).\n\n3.  **Relate to a Number System:** The ability to represent any integer as a sum/difference of coefficients {-1, 0, 1} times weight values is characteristic of balanced ternary representation. In this system, numbers are represented in base 3 using digits -1, 0, and 1. Using weights that are powers of 3 (1, 3, 9, 27, etc.) allows us to represent numbers in this form.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Weights:** With weights that are powers of 3 (1, 3, 9, ..., 3^(n-1)), the largest integer weight that can be measured is the sum `1 + 3 + ... + 3^(n-1)` where all coefficients are +1, which is `(3^n - 1) / 2`. Using the coefficients {-1, 0, 1} for each weight allows us to measure any integer weight from `-(3^n - 1) / 2` up to `(3^n - 1) / 2`. Since we only need positive weights (from 1 to 121), we need to find the smallest `n` such that `(3^n - 1) / 2` is at least 121.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum Number:**\n    *   If n=4, the maximum weight measurable is (3^4 - 1) / 2 = (81 - 1) / 2 = 40. This is not enough to measure up to 121.\n    *   If n=5, the maximum weight measurable is (3^5 - 1) / 2 = (243 - 1) / 2 = 121. This is sufficient to measure any weight from 1 to 121.\n    Therefore, 5 is the minimum number of weights required.\n\n6.  **Identify the Weights:** The 5 minimum weights are the first five powers of 3: 3^0, 3^1, 3^2, 3^3, and 3^4. These correspond to 1, 3, 9, 27, and 81 stones. (As noted in the solution, 27 stones is 2 lump 5 stone, and 81 stones is 7 lump 4 stone in the native units).\n\n7.  **Verify the Total Weight (Optional but noted in solution):** The sum of these weights (1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81) is 121 stones, which is equal to one mass, confirming that the set of weights can measure up to the required maximum.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

The constraints are that cuts must be straight and perpendicular to the plate, and each person gets a single piece.\n\n**Solution Summary:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Cake and Goal:** The cake is an 8x8 square, totaling 64 portions or units of area. We need to divide this area equally among a specific number of people (3 in the main problem, 7 in the extra) using only straight cuts perpendicular to the plate, with each person receiving one piece.\n\n2.  **Calculate Required Piece Area:** To divide the 64 units of area equally among 3 people, each piece must have an area of 64 / 3 square units. To divide among 7 people, each piece must have an area of 64 / 7 square units.\n\n3.  **Identify the Cut Method:** Since 64 is not divisible by 3 or 7, the required area per piece (64/3 or 64/7) is not a whole number. This means the pieces cannot simply be formed by cutting along the grid lines of the 8x8 cake to create rectangular pieces of integer unit dimensions. Straight cuts perpendicular to the plate can, however, be radial cuts originating from the center of the cake. These cuts divide the cake into sectors.\n\n4.  **Apply Radial Cuts for 3 Pieces:** To divide the cake into 3 equal pieces, make 3 straight cuts that start precisely at the center of the 8x8 square cake and extend outwards to its perimeter. These three cuts must be positioned such that they divide the full 360 degrees around the center into 3 equal angles. Each angle will be 360 degrees / 3 = 120 degrees. This results in three identical sector-shaped pieces, each containing exactly 1/3 of the total cake area (64/3 units). These cuts are straight and perpendicular to the plate.\n\n5.  **Apply Radial Cuts for 7 Pieces (Extra):** Similarly, to divide the cake into 7 equal pieces, make 7 straight cuts that start at the center of the cake and extend outwards to the perimeter. These seven cuts must divide the full 360 degrees around the center into 7 equal angles. Each angle will be 360 degrees / 7. This results in seven identical sector-shaped pieces, each containing exactly 1/7 of the total cake area (64/7 units). These cuts are straight and perpendicular to the plate.\n\n6.  **Verify Constraints:** In both cases (3 pieces and 7 pieces), the method uses only straight cuts that are perpendicular to the plate.

Therefore, the flag is 1 meter high, and the pulley is at a height of 1 meter.\n\n2.  **Determine the total height of the flag pole:** The problem states the pole was built to be exactly 14 times the height of the flag. Since the flag is 1 meter high, the pole is 14 * 1 meter = 14 meters high.\n\n3.  **Calculate the vertical distance the string wraps around:** The string goes up from the pulley (at 1 meter) to the bottom of the flag. Assuming the flag is at the top of the pole, the bottom of the flag is at the pole's total height minus the flag's height (14m - 1m = 13m). The vertical distance the string covers by wrapping is the distance from the pulley (1m) up to the bottom of the flag (13m), which is 13m - 1m = 12 meters. Convert this vertical distance to centimeters: 12 meters * 100 cm/meter = 1200 cm.\n\n4.  **Visualize the string's path by \"unwrapping\" the pole:** Imagine the section of the pole the string wraps around is unrolled into a flat rectangle. The height of this rectangle is the vertical distance the string covers (1200 cm). The string's path on the pole becomes the diagonal (hypotenuse) of this unwrapped rectangle.\n\n5.  **Determine the dimensions of the unwrapped path *per rotation*:** The string wraps evenly 4 times around the pole over the 1200 cm vertical distance. This means each rotation covers an equal vertical distance: 1200 cm / 4 rotations = 300 cm per rotation. The horizontal distance covered in one full rotation around the pole is the pole's circumference. The circumference is calculated as \u03c0 * diameter = \u03c0 * 10 cm.\n\n6.  **Model the string per rotation using the Pythagorean Theorem:** For each rotation, the string follows a path that, when unwrapped, forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The sides of this triangle are the vertical distance covered in one rotation (300 cm) and the horizontal distance covered in one rotation (10\u03c0 cm). The length of the string for one rotation (c) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: c\u00b2 = (vertical distance per rotation)\u00b2 + (horizontal distance per rotation)\u00b2.\n    So, c\u00b2 = (300 cm)\u00b2 + (10\u03c0 cm)\u00b2.\n\n7.  **Calculate the length of the string for one rotation:** c = \u221a[(300)\u00b2 + (10\u03c0)\u00b2] cm.\n\n8.  **Calculate the total length of the string:** Since the string makes 4 identical rotations, the total length of the string is 4 times the length of the string per rotation.

The average marks of girls are given as equal to the number of boys (Y), and the average marks of boys are given as equal to the number of girls (X).\n\n2.  **Calculate the class average:** The total marks in the class are the sum of the total marks for girls (number of girls * average marks of girls = X * Y) and the total marks for boys (number of boys * average marks of boys = Y * X). The total number of students is X + Y. Therefore, the class average is (XY + YX) / (X + Y) = 2XY / (X + Y).\n\n3.  **Calculate the average of the boys' average and girls' average:** This average is simply (average marks of boys + average marks of girls) / 2 = (X + Y) / 2.\n\n4.  **Set up an equation based on the given condition:** The problem states that the class average is 4 less than the average of the boys' and girls' averages. This translates to the equation: (X + Y) / 2 - 4 = 2XY / (X + Y).\n\n5.  **Rearrange the equation to find a relationship between X and Y:** Multiply both sides of the equation by 2(X+Y) to clear the denominators. This results in (X+Y)\u00b2 - 8(X+Y) = 4XY. Expanding and rearranging terms leads to X\u00b2 + 2XY + Y\u00b2 - 8(X+Y) - 4XY = 0, which simplifies to X\u00b2 - 2XY + Y\u00b2 = 8(X+Y). The left side is a perfect square, so the equation becomes (X-Y)\u00b2 = 8(X+Y).\n\n6.  **Analyze the relationship (X-Y)\u00b2 = 8(X+Y):** Since the left side, (X-Y)\u00b2, is a perfect square, the right side, 8(X+Y), must also be a perfect square. For 8(X+Y) to be a perfect square, (X+Y) must contain a factor of 2 (since 8 = 2\u00b3) and any other prime factors must be raised to an even power. This means (X+Y) must be of the form 2k\u00b2 for some integer k.\n\n7.  **Identify possible values for the total number of students (X+Y):** The possible values for X+Y of the form 2k\u00b2 are 2(1\u00b2) = 2, 2(2\u00b2) = 8, 2(3\u00b2) = 18, 2(4\u00b2) = 32, 2(5\u00b2) = 50, 2(6\u00b2) = 72, and so on. Since X and Y represent the number of students, they must be non-negative integers. We can verify that for each of these values of X+Y, (X-Y)\u00b2 is a perfect square, and X and Y can be solved as integers (e.g., for X+Y=18, (X-Y)\u00b2 = 8*18 = 144, so X-Y = \u00b112, leading to integer solutions for X and Y).\n\n8.  **Determine the minimum double-digit value for the total number of students:** The problem asks for the minimum double-digit number of students in the class.

Based on the formula from Step 1 (`Rating = 4 * p / v`), these fractions represent `(4 * p) / v`. This means the denominator of the fraction is the total number of votes (`v`) for that attribute, and the numerator is 4 times the number of positive votes (`4 * p`).\n\n3.  **Determine Votes Before the User:** For each teaser and each attribute (fun and difficulty), the solution gives the rating as a fraction *before* the user's vote (the first fraction in the pair). Using the understanding from Step 2, the denominator of this \"before\" fraction is the total number of votes cast for that attribute *before* the user voted (`v_before`).\n\n4.  **Determine Positive Votes Before the User:** For each teaser and attribute, take the numerator of the \"before\" fraction. Since this numerator equals `4 * p_before`, divide the numerator by 4 to find the number of positive votes cast for that attribute *before* the user voted (`p_before`).\n\n5.  **Verify the Impact of the User's Vote:** The solution also provides the fractional rating *after* the user's vote. This \"after\" fraction should reflect the addition of one more vote. The denominator (`v_after`) should be `v_before + 1`. If the user voted positively (+) for that attribute, the number of positive votes (`p_after`) should be `p_before + 1`, meaning the numerator (`4 * p_after`) should be `4 * p_before + 4`. If the user voted negatively (-) for that attribute, the number of positive votes (`p_after`) remains `p_before`, meaning the numerator (`4 * p_after`) remains `4 * p_before`. The provided \"after\" fractions in the solution are consistent with these rules, confirming the logic.\n\n6.  **Extract and Present the Results:** By applying Steps 3 and 4 to the \"before\" fractions provided for each teaser's fun and difficulty ratings, we can list the specific number of votes cast (`v_before`) and positive votes cast (`p_before`) for each attribute prior to the user's vote, which answers the second part of the problem.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

This yields profit values of $0.75 (75 cents) for small, $1.00 (100 cents) for medium, $1.75 (175 cents) for large, and $2.00 (200 cents) for x-large.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Total Sales Profit Equation:** Create an equation representing the total profit from sales using the profit per slush for each size and the unknown number of slushes sold for each size (s, m, l, x). This gives the equation: 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650 (since $46.50 is 4650 cents).\n\n4.  **Incorporate Sales Quantity Relationships:** Substitute the given relationship m = 4s into the total sales profit equation. Also, note the inequality constraint m > l > x > s, where s, m, l, and x must be positive integers representing the number of slushes sold.\n\n5.  **Simplify and Solve the Equation System:** Simplify the profit equation (e.g., by dividing by 25) and substitute m=4s to get an equation involving only s, l, and x: 19s + 7l + 8x = 186.\n\n6.  **Use Inequalities to Narrow Down Possibilities:** Use the inequality m > l > x > s (with m=4s) and the simplified equation to test possible integer values for 's'. By setting upper and lower bounds based on the inequalities, determine the range of possible values for 's'. This process reveals that 's' must be either 3 or 4.\n\n7.  **Test Possible Values for 's':**\n    *   Assume s=3. Substitute s=3 into the equation 19s + 7l + 8x = 186, which simplifies to 7l + 8x = 129. Using the inequality 12 > l > x > 3 (since m=4*3=12), test integer values for x starting from 4 to find corresponding integer values for l. It is found that no integer solutions for l exist that satisfy the inequalities when s=3.\n    *   Assume s=4. Substitute s=4 into the equation 19s + 7l + 8x = 186, which simplifies to 7l + 8x = 110. Using the inequality 16 > l > x > 4 (since m=4*4=16), test integer values for x starting from 5 to find corresponding integer values for l. The first test with x=5 yields l=10, which satisfies the inequality 16 > 10 > 5 > 4. Checking further values for x shows that this is the only integer solution satisfying all conditions.\n\n8.  **Determine the Number of Slushes Sold:** The unique solution for the number of slushes sold of each size is s=4, m=16, l=10, and x=5. Calculate the total number of slushes sold by summing these quantities: 4 + 16 + 10 + 5 = 35 slushes.\n\n9.  **Calculate Total Coupon Cost:** Since each slush purchase gives one coupon for a free small slush, 35 coupons were given out. The cost of providing a free small slush is its manufacturing cost, which is the price minus the profit: $1.50 - $0.75 = $0.75. The total cost of the coupons is 35 coupons * $0.75/coupon = $26.25.\n\n10. **Calculate Net Profit:** Subtract the total coupon cost from the total sales profit: $46.50 - $26.25 = $20.25.\n\n11. **Compare Net Profit to Goal:** The calculated net profit ($20.25) is greater than the $20 goal.\n\n12. **State the Conclusion:** Based on the net profit calculation, the goal of making at least $20 in net profit was achieved.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

For example, on pass 3, lockers #3, #6, #9, #12, and so on are toggled.\n4.  **Number of Toggles per Locker:** A specific locker, say locker #*L*, is toggled on pass number *n* if and only if *n* is a factor of *L*. Therefore, locker #*L* is toggled exactly as many times as the number of factors *L* has.\n5.  **Final State Depends on Toggle Count:** A locker starts closed. It will be open at the end if it has been toggled an odd number of times (Closed -> Open -> Closed -> Open...). It will be closed if it has been toggled an even number of times (Closed -> Open -> Closed...).\n6.  **Condition for Remaining Open:** A locker is left open at the end if and only if its locker number has an odd number of factors.\n7.  **Identifying Numbers with an Odd Number of Factors:** The only positive integers that have an odd number of factors are the perfect squares (e.g., 1 has factors 1 (1 factor); 4 has factors 1, 2, 4 (3 factors); 9 has factors 1, 3, 9 (3 factors); 16 has factors 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 (5 factors)). Non-perfect squares always have an even number of factors because their factors can be paired up (e.g., for 6, factors are 1 & 6, 2 & 3).\n8.  **Finding the Open Lockers:** Therefore, the lockers that remain open are those whose numbers are perfect squares between 1 and 100.\n9.  **Listing the Perfect Squares:** The perfect squares between 1 and 100 are 1\u00b2, 2\u00b2, 3\u00b2, 4\u00b2, 5\u00b2, 6\u00b2, 7\u00b2, 8\u00b2, 9\u00b2, and 10\u00b2.

What is that number?\n Solution: 2519", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "2519", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": "SUMMARY:\n\n1.  **Identify the relationship between the number and the divisors:** The problem states that when the number is divided by any integer from 2 through 9, the remainder is always one less than the divisor. This means the number, let's call it N, satisfies the condition N \u2261 (divisor - 1) (mod divisor) for each divisor.\n2.  **Reformulate the condition:** The condition N \u2261 (divisor - 1) (mod divisor) is equivalent to N + 1 \u2261 (divisor - 1) + 1 (mod divisor), which simplifies to N + 1 \u2261 0 (mod divisor). This means that if you add 1 to the number N, the result (N+1) is perfectly divisible by each of the divisors (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9).\n3.  **Determine the property of N+1:** Since N+1 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, it must be a common multiple of all these numbers. The smallest such number is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of this set of integers.\n4.  **Calculate the LCM:** Find the LCM of {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. This is done by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of these numbers. The prime factors involved are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The highest power of 2 is 2\u00b3 (from 8), the highest power of 3 is 3\u00b2 (from 9), the highest power of 5 is 5\u00b9 (from 5), and the highest power of 7 is 7\u00b9 (from 7). The LCM is 2\u00b3 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b9 \u00d7 7\u00b9 = 8 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 = 72 \u00d7 35 = 2520.\n5.  **Find possible values for N+1:** N+1 must be a multiple of the LCM, 2520. So, N+1 can be 2520, 5040, 7560, etc. (i.e., 2520 * k, where k is a positive integer).\n6.  **Apply the constraint on N:** The problem states that the number N is less than 3000. This means N + 1 must be less than 3001. Among the possible values for N+1 (multiples of 2520), the only one less than 3001 is 2520 itself.\n7.  **Calculate N:** Since N + 1 = 2520, the number N is 2520 - 1 = 2519.\n8.  **Verify the result:** The number 2519 is less than 3000 and satisfies all the remainder conditions:\n    - 2519 \u00f7 2 = 1259 R 1\n    - 2519 \u00f7 3 = 839 R 2\n    - 2519 \u00f7 4 = 629 R 3\n    - 2519 \u00f7 5 = 503 R 4\n    - 2519 \u00f7 6 = 419 R 5\n    - 2519 \u00f7 7 = 359 R 6\n    - 2519 \u00f7 8 = 314 R 7\n    - 2519 \u00f7 9 = 279 R 8\n    All conditions are met.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

It also states that the square of the sum of their ages when they met ((A+C)\u00b2) splits into two 2-digit numbers: Cal's age when they met (C) and Al's current age.\n\n2.  **Deduce a Maximum Age:** Theo reasoned that since Al's age squared (A\u00b2) was a three-digit number, Al's age (A) when they met could not be very large. The largest three-digit number is 999, and the square root of 999 is slightly over 31. Thus, Al's age (A) when they met must have been 31 or less.\n\n3.  **List Possible Age Pairs:** Based on the constraint that A \u2264 31 and A\u00b2 and C\u00b2 must be three-digit numbers with the same digits, Theo listed the possible pairs of ages (A, C) they could have been when they met. He found the pairs (14, 31), (13, 31), (16, 25), (12, 21), and (13, 14) fit this criterion. (Note: He listed the pairs and their squares to verify the digit condition).\n\n4.  **Test the Second Constraint:** For each valid pair (A, C), Theo calculated the square of their sum, (A+C)\u00b2. He then checked if this squared sum was a four-digit number that, when split into two 2-digit numbers, produced Cal's age when they met (C) and another 2-digit number representing Al's current age.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Results:**\n    *   For (14, 31): (14+31)\u00b2 = 45\u00b2 = 2025. Split: 20 and 25. Neither is Cal's age (31).\n    *   For (13, 31): (13+31)\u00b2 = 44\u00b2 = 1936. Split: 19 and 36.

The first number, 16, matches Cal's age when they met (C=25 was listed in the original problem, but Theo's calculation uses C=16 from the 16, 25 pair. Checking the squares 16\u00b2=256 and 25\u00b2=625 shows these digits are *not* the same. Let's correct based on the pairs listed in the solution which *do* have same digits in their squares: (14, 31 -> 196, 961), (13, 31 -> 169, 961), (16, 25 -> 256, 625), (12, 21 -> 144, 441), (13, 14 -> 169, 196). Now re-evaluate step 4 with the correct interpretation of the listed pairs: Al's age first, then Cal's age. A, C.\n    *   For (14, 31): (14+31)\u00b2 = 45\u00b2 = 2025. Split: 20 and 25. Cal's age was 31. No match.\n    *   For (13, 31): (13+31)\u00b2 = 44\u00b2 = 1936. Split: 19 and 36. Cal's age was 31. No match.\n    *   For (16, 25): (16+25)\u00b2 = 41\u00b2 = 1681.

No match.\n    *   For (13, 14): (13+14)\u00b2 = 27\u00b2 = 729. This is not a four-digit number that splits into two 2-digit numbers. No match.\n\n    *Correction needed based on Theo's conclusion:* Theo *concluded* that Cal must have been 16 when they met. This implies the pair was (25, 16) since A\u00b2=625, C\u00b2=16\u00b2=256, which share the digits 2, 5, 6. Let's assume the list of pairs was presented with A first, then C, but the correct pair matching the digits criteria AND the (A+C)\u00b2 criteria was missed or implicitly derived. Let's follow Theo's final stated logic backwards: If Cal was 16 when they met (C=16), then Theo must have found a pair (A, 16) such that A\u00b2 and 16\u00b2 (256) have the same digits and (A+16)\u00b2 splits into 16 and Al's current age. 16\u00b2=256. A\u00b2 must also have digits 2, 5, 6. The only three-digit square with these digits is 625, which is 25\u00b2. So, A must have been 25. The pair is (25, 16). Let's check this pair: A=25, C=16. A\u00b2=625, C\u00b2=256. Same digits (2, 5, 6). Check the second constraint: (A+C)\u00b2 = (25+16)\u00b2 = 41\u00b2 = 1681. Split: 16 and 81. The first number, 16, is Cal's age when they met (C=16). The second number, 81, must be Al's current age. This pair (A=25, C=16) is the correct one that fits all the rules and Theo's conclusion. It seems the list provided in the original text was incomplete or contained pairs that didn't fully meet the initial digit criteria (e.g., 16 & 25, where 16\u00b2=256, 25\u00b2=625 - same digits). Let's rephrase Theo's steps assuming he correctly found (25, 16).\n\n6.  **Refined Step 3 & 4:** Theo systematically searched for pairs of ages (A, C) where A\u00b2 and C\u00b2 were three-digit numbers with the same digits, and where A \u2264 31. By checking potential values for A and C, he found that the pair (A=25, C=16) satisfied the first condition (25\u00b2=625, 16\u00b2=256, both use digits 2, 5, 6).\n\n7.  **Refined Step 5:** He then tested this specific pair using the second constraint. He calculated (A+C)\u00b2 = (25+16)\u00b2 = 41\u00b2 = 1681. He split the result, 1681, into two 2-digit numbers: 16 and 81. He observed that the first number, 16, matched Cal's age when they met (C=16). This meant the second number, 81, must be Al's current age.\n\n8.  **State the Conclusion:** Based on satisfying both conditions with the pair (A=25, C=16), Theo concluded that Al's current age must be 81.\n\n9.  **Verify the Answer:** Professor Gebra confirmed that 81 was indeed his current age, validating Theo's conclusion.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "0"}

Define variables for the quantities of Rnkfurters each person (Kurt, Patty, Rod) received (K, P, R) and for the total quantity (T), establishing that the sum of individual quantities equals the total (T = K + P + R).\n2.  State the main conditions given in the problem regarding the relationships between the quantities and percentages: Kurt's percentage of the total equals Patty's quantity (`100 * K / T = P`) and Patty's percentage of the total is related to Rod's quantity plus a fraction (`100 * P / T = R + fraction`).\n3.  Interpret the \"phonograph speeds\" clue as indicating that Patty's percentage of the total is 33 1/3%, which simplifies to 1/3 of the total (`100 * P / T = 33 1/3`, leading to `P / T = 1/3`, or `P = T / 3`).\n4.  Use Rod's proposed number of Rnkfurters mentioned in the problem (R=33) as one of the fixed values for Rod's quantity in the final solution.\n5.  Substitute the derived relationship for P (`P = T/3`) and the value for R (`R = 33`) into the equation for the total (`T = K + P + R`) to express K in terms of T (`K = T - P - R = T - T/3 - 33 = 2T/3 - 33`).\n6.  Substitute the relationship for P (`P = T/3`) into the condition regarding Kurt's percentage (`100 * K / T = P`) to get `100 * K / T = T / 3`, which simplifies to `300K = T^2`.\n7.  Substitute the expression for K from Step 5 (`K = 2T/3 - 33`) into the equation derived in Step 6 (`300K = T^2`) to obtain a quadratic equation involving only T: `300 * (2T/3 - 33) = T^2`, which simplifies to `200T - 9900 = T^2`, or `T^2 - 200T + 9900 = 0`.\n8.  Solve the quadratic equation for T. The possible integer solutions for T are found to be 90 and 110.\n9.  Check each possible value of T to see which one results in integer values for K, P, and R using the relationships derived in Steps 3 and 5 (`P = T/3`, `K = 2T/3 - 33`, `R = 33`). T=110 results in P=110/3, which is not an integer. T=90 results in P=90/3=30 (integer), K=2(90)/3 - 33 = 60 - 33 = 27 (integer), and R=33 (integer). This confirms T=90 is the correct total.\n10. Verify that the total quantity (T=90) satisfies the problem's condition that the total ordered was 10 less than a multiple of 25. Since `90 + 10 = 100` and 100 is a multiple of 25, this condition is met.\n11.

This forces the tiger to run along the shore to try and match the man's angular movement.\n3.  **Why Phase 1 Works:** As long as the man is close enough to the center, his swimming speed allows him to move outwards *and* also match the tiger's maximum angular speed around the lake center. The provided solution states this is possible as long as the man's distance from the center is less than 1/4 of the lake's radius (R=1).\n4.  **End of Phase 1:** The man continues this strategy, swimming outwards and staying opposite the tiger, until he reaches a distance of 1/4 R from the center (1/4 since R=1). At this point, due to the strategy, the tiger will be exactly on the opposite side of the shore (180 degrees away from the man's radial line from the center).\n5.  **Phase 2 Strategy (Sprint to Shore):** Once the man is at 1/4 R distance from the center and opposite the tiger, he changes strategy. He stops trying to stay opposite and instead swims directly in a straight line towards the point on the shore that is farthest away from the tiger. Since the man is opposite the tiger, this target point on the shore is also directly opposite the tiger's current position on the shore.\n6.  **Calculate Man's Time in Phase 2:** The man starts at a distance of 1/4 R from the center and swims straight to the shore at R. The distance he swims is R - 1/4 R = 3/4 R. Since R=1, this distance is 3/4. The time taken is (Distance) / (Man's Swim Speed). If we assume the man's speed is 'v', his time is (3/4) / v.\n7.  **Calculate Tiger's Time in Phase 2:** While the man swims the distance of 3/4 towards the opposite shore point, the tiger must run along the shore to reach that same point. The tiger is initially at its position on the shore and the target point is the one directly opposite it along the shore. The shortest distance along the shore between two diametrically opposite points is half the circumference of the lake, which is (1/2) * (2 * pi * R) = pi * R. Since R=1, this distance is pi. The tiger's speed is 4v. The time taken is (Distance) / (Tiger's Run Speed) = pi / (4v).\n8.  **Compare Times and Confirm Safety:** The man reaches the shore in time (3/4) / v. The tiger reaches the man's landing spot in time pi / (4v). Comparing the times (assuming v is a positive value): (3/4) = 0.75 and pi/4 \u2248 0.7854. Since 0.75 < 0.7854, the man reaches the shore before the tiger does.\n9.  **Conclusion:** By using this two-phase strategy \u2013 first moving outwards while staying opposite the tiger until reaching 1/4 R from the center, then swimming directly to the opposite shore point \u2013 the man can safely reach the shore.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

This gives the equation: (x + y) * 30 = 1800.\n3.  Set up an equation based on the scenario where the cars move in the same direction: the difference in their speeds is the relative speed at which the faster car gains a full track circumference (1800m) on the slower car in 120 seconds. Assuming y > x, this gives the equation: (y - x) * 120 = 1800.\n4.  Simplify the two equations: x + y = 60 and y - x = 15. (The provided solution uses equivalent manipulations of these equations, leading to the same system).\n5.  Solve the system of linear equations for x and y. One method is to add the two simplified equations together (x + y = 60) + (y - x = 15) which eliminates x: 2y = 75, yielding y = 37.5 m/s.\n6.  Substitute the value of y (37.5 m/s) back into either of the simplified equations (e.g., x + y = 60) to solve for x: x + 37.5 = 60, yielding x = 22.5 m/s.\n7.  Convert the speeds from meters per second to kilometers per hour by multiplying by the conversion factor (3600 seconds/hour) / (1000 meters/km) = 3.6.\n8.  Calculate the speed of the first car in km/hr: 22.5 m/s * 3.6 km/hr per m/s = 81 km/hr.\n9.

The solution sets up and solves an equation that represents the weighted average temperature of the mixed water based on the flow rates from each faucet.\n\n**REASONING STEPS:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Principle of Mixing Temperatures:** The final temperature of a mixture of fluids at different temperatures is a weighted average of those temperatures. The \"weights\" in this average are the amounts (or flow rates, assuming a constant time) of each fluid being mixed.\n\n2.  **Relate Faucet Rotation to Flow Rate:** The problem implies that the flow rate from a faucet is proportional to its rotation angle, up to a maximum (360 degrees). Since the hot water faucet is fully open (360 degrees), its flow rate can be represented by 360 (or a value proportional to it). If the cold water faucet is rotated by `x` degrees, its flow rate can be represented by `x` (using the same proportionality constant, which cancels out in the weighted average calculation).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Weighted Average Equation:** Based on the principle from Step 1 and the flow representation from Step 2, the equation for the final mixed temperature is:\n    (Temperature of Hot * Flow Rate of Hot) + (Temperature of Cold * Flow Rate of Cold)\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- = Target Temperature\n    Total Flow Rate (Flow Rate of Hot + Flow Rate of Cold)\n\n4.  **Substitute Known Values into the Equation:** Plug the given temperatures (Hot = 105\u00b0F, Cold = 45\u00b0F, Target = 98.6\u00b0F) and the flow representations (Hot Flow = 360, Cold Flow = `x`) into the equation from Step 3.

In the ritual, each arm of a male links with an arm of a female, no male-female pair of robots linking more than once. The minimum number of robots required to link all arms once only is the number belonging to that tribe.

Based on the problem's description (although the initial definition is slightly ambiguous, the solution's calculations imply this structure), a tribe with `n` arms per robot has `2n` members, consisting of `n` males and `n` females. So, there are `2x` Creakies (`x` male, `x` female) and `2y` Rusties (`y` male, `y` female) initially. The maximum number of links possible between one male arm and one female arm in a tribe with `n` males and `n` females, each with `n` arms, is `n*n`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Maximum Links for Remaining Rusties:** Half the Rusty tribe (`y` members) were cornered. Assuming these `y` members consist of `y/2` male and `y/2` female Rusties, and one arm is removed from each, the remaining `y` Rusties now consist of `y/2` males (each with `y` arms) and `y/2` males (each with `y-1` arms), and `y/2` females (each with `y` arms) and `y/2` females (each with `y-1` arms). The total number of male arms among the remaining `y` Rusties is `(y/2)*y + (y/2)*(y-1) = y(2y-1)/2`. The total number of female arms is the same. The maximum number of links they can make is the number of available male or female arms, which is `y(2y-1)/2`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Maximum Links for Boosted Creakies:** The Creaky tribe (initially `x` male, `x` female, each with `x` arms) needs `24` times the `y` arms actually taken, for a total of `24y` spare arms. These extra arms are added such that each of the `2x` Creaky members receives the same number of extra arms, say `E`. The total extra arms added are `2x * E = 24y`, so each Creaky adds `E = 12y/x` arms. After adding these arms, each of the `x` male Creakies has `x + 12y/x` arms, and each of the `x` female Creakies has `x + 12y/x` arms. The total male Creaky arms are `x * (x + 12y/x) = x^2 + 12y`. The maximum number of links they can make is the number of male or female arms, which is `x^2 + 12y`.\n\n4.  **Set Up the Main Equation:** The problem states that the maximum links the boosted Creakies can make is half the maximum links the remaining Rusties can make. Using the expressions from steps 2 and 3, this translates to the equation:\n    `x^2 + 12y = (1/2) * [y(2y-1)/2]`\n    Simplifying this equation:\n    `x^2 + 12y = y(2y-1)/4`\n    `4(x^2 + 12y) = 2y^2 - y`\n    `4x^2 + 48y = 2y^2 - y`\n    Rearranging to match the solution's form:\n    `2y^2 - 49y - 4x^2 = 0`\n\n5.  **Solve the Equation for Integer Values:** The equation `2y^2 - 49y - 4x^2 = 0` must be solved for positive integers `x` and `y`. The solution suggests looking for a relationship like `y=4x` (which can be found by analyzing the equation or trying potential integer relationships). Substituting `y=4x` into the equation:\n    `2(4x)^2 - 49(4x) - 4x^2 = 0`\n    `2(16x^2) - 196x - 4x^2 = 0`\n    `32x^2 - 196x - 4x^2 = 0`\n    `28x^2 - 196x = 0`\n    `28x(x - 7) = 0`\n    Since `x` must be a positive number of arms, `x > 0`.

The total area of the lawn is then `s * s = s^2` square metres.\n\n2.  **Determine the Dimensions and Area of the Uncut Section:** Junior cut a 2-metre wide border all the way around. This means the remaining uncut area in the centre is also a square, but its side length is reduced by 2 metres from *each* side of the original square (top and bottom, and left and right). The side length of the inner, uncut square is `s - 2 - 2 = s - 4` metres.

Since `sqrt(2)` is about 1.414, `4 * sqrt(2)` is about 5.656. So `8 + 5.656 = 13.656`. This is greater than 4, so `s = 8 + 4 * sqrt(2)` is a valid side length.\n    *   Calculate `8 - 4 * sqrt(2)`. This is about `8 - 5.656 = 2.344`. This is less than 4. If `s` were 2.344, `s - 4` would be negative, which is not physically possible for a side length.

We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.\nNext we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x. If we add 10x on both sides, we get 22x=60, and dividing 22 from both sides yields x=60/22=30/11.", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": "SUMMARY:\nThe problem asks for the radius of a right cylinder inscribed in a right cone, where the cylinder's diameter equals its height, their axes coincide, the cone height is 12, and the cone radius is 5. The solution finds the radius by using similar triangles formed by a cross-section of the cone and cylinder.\n\nReasoning Steps:\n\n1.  **Visualize the geometry:** Imagine a vertical cross-section of the cone and the inscribed cylinder passing through their common axis. This cross-section shows an isosceles triangle (the cone) and a rectangle (the cylinder) centered within it.\n2.  **Form a right triangle from the cone's cross-section:** Consider one half of the cone's triangular cross-section along the axis. This forms a right triangle with the cone's height as one leg (12 units), the cone's radius as the other leg (5 units), and the cone's slant height as the hypotenuse.\n3.  **Relate cylinder dimensions to the cross-section:** Let the radius of the cylinder be `r`. The height of the cylinder is given as being congruent to its diameter, so the height is `2r`. In the cross-section, the cylinder's radius `r` is a horizontal distance from the axis, and its height `2r` is a vertical distance along the axis.\n4.  **Identify similar triangles:** Draw a horizontal line segment representing the radius `r` of the cylinder at its top surface in the cross-section. This segment extends from the central axis to the cone's slant height. A smaller right triangle is formed above this segment, with the cylinder's height `2r` occupying the lower part of the cone's total height. The height of this smaller triangle is the cone's height minus the cylinder's height, which is `12 - 2r`. The base of this smaller triangle is the cylinder's radius `r`. This smaller triangle is similar to the larger right triangle formed by the cone's full height (12) and radius (5), because they share an angle (at the cone's apex) and both have a right angle.\n5.  **Set up a proportion based on similar triangles:** Since the two right triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal. We can set up a proportion relating the height and base of the large cone triangle to the height and base of the smaller triangle above the cylinder. The proportion is (Cone Height / Cone Radius) = (Height of Small Triangle / Base of Small Triangle), which is 12 / 5 = (12 - 2r) / r.\n6.  **Solve the proportion for the cylinder radius `r`:** Cross-multiply the proportion: 12 * r = 5 * (12 - 2r).\n7.  **Simplify and solve for `r`:** This gives 12r = 60 - 10r. Add 10r to both sides: 22r = 60. Divide by 22: r = 60 / 22.\n8.  **Reduce the fraction:** Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 2. This results in r = 30 / 11.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

So H must be an even digit.\n    *   Since positions B, D, F, and H must be filled by the four even digits {2, 4, 6, 8}, the remaining five positions A, C, E, G, and I must be filled by the five odd digits {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\n2.  **Fix the Digit E:** The rule DE must be divisible by 5. For a number to be divisible by 5, its last digit (E) must be 0 or 5. Since the available digits are {1-9}, E must be 5. This confirms E is in an odd position as required by the parity constraint.\n\n3.  **Determine Digits F, G, H, and I (Last Five Digits):** Now that E is fixed as 5, use the subsequent divisibility rules (EF % 6, FG % 7, GH % 8, HI % 9) and the remaining available digits to deduce the values of F, G, H, and I in order.\n    *   EF must be divisible by 6.

With F=4, 4G must be divisible by 7. G must be an odd digit from the unused odds ({1, 3, 7, 9}). Checking possibilities (41, 43, 47, 49), only 49 is divisible by 7.

The letters must represent distinct digits. Since LIAR and RAIL are 4-digit numbers, L and R must be non-zero.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Thousands Digit:** In the multiplication LIAR * S = RAIL, the leftmost digit L multiplied by S contributes to the leftmost digit R of the product. Since both numbers are 4-digits, the product of the thousands digit (L) and S, plus any carry from the hundreds place, determines the thousands digit (R) of the result. Because R is a single digit and L is non-zero, S must be a relatively small number. Also, S cannot be 1 (LIAR * 1 = LIAR, meaning L=R, I=A, which violates the distinct digit rule).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Units Digit:** The units digit of the product RAIL is L. This means that the units digit of S multiplied by R must be L (S * R ends in L).\n\n4.  **Narrow Down Possibilities for S, L, and R:** Using the constraints from steps 2 and 3, and the fact that all digits must be distinct and non-zero for L and R, we can systematically test combinations. For example, if S=2, R must be a digit such that 2*R ends in some digit L which is different from S and R. If R=7, 2*7=14, so L=4. (S,R,L) = (2,7,4). If S=3, R=4 gives 3*4=12, so L=2. (S,R,L) = (3,4,2). If S=4, R=8 gives 4*8=32, so L=2. (S,R,L) = (4,8,2). (Note: The provided guide uses the S*L constraint slightly differently initially, but testing combinations of S, R, L based on S*R ending in L is effective).\n\n5.  **Test Candidate Combinations (S, R, L):** We test the possible (S, R, L) combinations derived in step 4 by considering the overall multiplication. For example, if (S, R, L) = (2, 7, 4), the multiplication is 4IA7 * 2 = 7AI4. Calculating 2*7=14 gives the correct last digit L=4, with a carry of 1. But the first digit 4*2=8 (plus any carry from I) must equal the product's first digit R=7. 8 + carry cannot equal 7 (carry must be non-negative). So this combination is rejected. Similarly, other combinations are tested and rejected until the combination (S, R, L) = (4, 8, 2) is found. This gives 2IA8 * 4 = 8AI2. Checking the first digits: 4*2=8, which is R, requiring a carry of 0 from the hundreds column.\n\n6.  **Deduce Digits I and A:** With S=4, L=2, R=8, and knowing the carry from the hundreds is 0, we look at the hundreds and tens columns. The multiplication is 2IA8 * 4 = 8AI2.\n    *   Units: 4 * 8 = 32. Ends in 2 (L), carry 3 to tens.\n    *   Tens: (4 * A) + 3 must end in I, with a carry to the hundreds.\n    *   Hundreds: (4 * I) + carry_from_tens must end in A, with a carry of 0 to thousands. So, 4*I + carry_from_tens = A.\n    *   Thousands: (4 * L) + carry_from_hundreds = R. (4 * 2) + 0 = 8 (R). This confirms carry_from_hundreds = 0.\n\n7.  **Solve for I and A using System of Equations/Constraints:** From 4*I + carry_from_tens = A (and carry out 0), I must be relatively small. If I=0, carry_from_tens = A. From (4*A) + 3 ends in I=0, 4*A ends in 7, which is impossible for a single digit A. So I cannot be 0. If I=1, then 4*1 + carry_from_tens = A, so 4 + carry_from_tens = A. This means A is at least 4 more than the carry. Also, (4*A) + 3 must end in I=1, meaning 4*A must end in 8. Possible A values are 2 or 7. Since L=2, A cannot be 2. So A must be 7. If A=7, then 4 + carry_from_tens = 7, so carry_from_tens = 3. Let's check this: (4*A) + 3 = (4*7) + 3 = 28 + 3 = 31. This ends in 1 (I=1 - correct) and has a carry of 3 to the hundreds (carry_from_tens = 3 - correct).\n\n8.  **Verify the Solution:** The found digits are L=2, I=1, A=7, R=8, S=4.

{"ID": 126, "Question": "Question: The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nIn a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).

This means all ten given digits must be used exactly once in total across the digits that make up the number N and the number D.\n2.  **Translate the Fraction Condition:** The requirement that the fraction N/D equals 1/2 is mathematically equivalent to stating that the denominator D must be exactly twice the numerator N (i.e., D = 2 * N).\n3.  **Deduce Properties of D:** Since D must be equal to 2 times an integer N, the number D must be an even number. This implies that the last digit of D must be an even digit (0, 2, 4, or 6). We check our available digits and confirm that 0, 2, 4, and 6 are indeed among them.\n4.  **Consider the Scale of the Numbers:** We have 10 digits to distribute between the numerator N and the denominator D.

For example, Xavier's first roll (1, 3, 3, 4, 6 = 177) can be written as an equation: (Value of 1) + 2*(Value of 3) + (Value of 4) + (Value of 6) = 177. This applies to all four given rolls, creating a system of equations.\n\n3.  **Analyze the System of Equations:** We have 6 unknown point values (for faces 1 to 6) but only 4 independent equations derived from the given rolls. Such a system is underdetermined, meaning there isn't a single unique mathematical solution based solely on the equations unless further constraints are applied (like requiring the values to be integers).\n\n4.  **Make Deductions from the Equations:** By comparing or manipulating certain equations, specific relationships between the point values can be deduced. For instance, comparing Rex's second roll (1, 2, 3, 4, 6 = 216) and Xavier's first roll (1, 3, 3, 4, 6 = 177), where the difference is one '2' replacing one '3', the difference in scores (216 - 177 = 39) reveals that the value of a '2' is 39 points more than the value of a '3'. Similarly, examining Xavier's second roll (1, 1, 1, 4, 4 = 203) shows that 3 times the value of a '1' plus 2 times the value of a '4' must equal 203. Since 2 times any integer value is even, 3 times the value of a '1' must be odd (203 is odd), which implies the value of a '1' must be an odd integer.\n\n5.  **Find Integer Solutions:** Because the system is underdetermined from the equations alone, finding the specific point values requires an additional method, which the original solution states was \"trial and error.\" This involves trying different integer values for the point values until a set is found that satisfies all four original equations and any deduced constraints (like P2 > P3 and P1 is odd).\n\n6.  **Verify the Found Point Values:** Once potential point values are found (as provided in the solution: 1=25, 2=77, 3=38, 4=64, 5=51, 6=12), they must be checked by plugging them back into the original four equations to ensure they produce the correct total scores.

On a sphere, walking straight means following a great circle path (like the equator or a line of longitude). Turning left (or right) implies changing to a new great circle path that intersects the previous one. The solution interprets the \"turn left\" as making the two great circle paths perpendicular to each other at the turning point.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Second Distance:** The second distance walked (47.124 km) is approximately three-quarters of the planet's circumference (Circumference = 2 * pi * radius = 2 * pi * 10 km \u2248 62.83 km; 3/4 * 62.83 km \u2248 47.12 km). This means the path covers an arc of about 270 degrees (3/4 of 360 degrees) along the second great circle.\n\n3.  **Determine the Relative Position of Start and End Points:** When you turn 90 degrees onto a new great circle path at a point T, and walk 270 degrees along this new path to reach point E, the endpoint E is positioned such that the line segment from the center of the planet (O) to the starting point (S) is perpendicular to the line segment from the center (O) to the ending point (E). This means the angle \u2220SOE at the center of the sphere is 90 degrees. The first distance (17.345 km) becomes irrelevant because this 90-degree relative positioning of S and E is a consequence of the perpendicular turn followed by the 270-degree arc, regardless of how far along the first path you traveled before turning.\n\n4.  **Form a Right Triangle:** Since the angle at the center O between the vectors pointing to the start point S and the end point E is 90 degrees, the points O, S, and E form a right-angled triangle in space, with the right angle at O. The two sides OS and OE are both equal to the radius of the planet, which is 10 km.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance Using the Pythagorean Theorem:** The distance between the ship (start point S) and the final position (end point E) is the straight-line distance through the planet's interior, which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle OSE.

{"ID": 134, "Question": "Question: Bill, Bob, Frank, and Jim, who all drive cabs, work a particularly busy street that runs east and west. The street has no traffic lights. Oddly enough, an equal number of pedestrians walk in each direction at four kilometres per hour. The four cab drivers were discussing the best way to pick up a fare. Bill said he was going to sit beside the curb and wait until a fare came along. Bob said he was going to cruise west at four kilometres an hour; therefore, he would have twice the chance of picking up a fare as Bill. Frank said he was going to cruise east at eight kilometres an hour and his chances were twice as good as either Bill's or Bob's. Jim claimed that they were all wrong.

Since an equal number of pedestrians walk in each direction at the same speed (4 km/h), we can calculate an \"encounter rate\" proportional to the sum of the relative speeds towards the cab.\n2.  **Analyze Bill's situation (Baseline):** Bill waits at the curb, meaning his speed is 0 km/h. The relative speed with pedestrians walking East towards him is 4 km/h. The relative speed with pedestrians walking West towards him is also 4 km/h. Bill's total \"encounter rate\" is proportional to the sum of these relative speeds: 4 km/h + 4 km/h = 8 km/h. This represents a baseline chance.\n3.  **Analyze Bob's claim:** Bob drives West at 4 km/h.\n    *   Relative speed with West-walking pedestrians (also 4 km/h West): 4 km/h (Bob West) - 4 km/h (Pedestrian West) = 0 km/h. Bob does not encounter new West-walking pedestrians relative to his starting point.\n    *   Relative speed with East-walking pedestrians (4 km/h East): 4 km/h (Bob West) + 4 km/h (Pedestrian East) = 8 km/h. Bob encounters East-walking pedestrians at a high rate.\n    *   Bob's total \"encounter rate\" is proportional to the sum: 0 km/h + 8 km/h = 8 km/h.\n    *   Compare Bob's rate (proportional to 8) to Bill's rate (proportional to 8). They are the same. Bob's claim that he would have twice the chance of Bill is false.\n4.  **Analyze Frank's claim:** Frank drives East at 8 km/h.\n    *   Relative speed with West-walking pedestrians (4 km/h West): 8 km/h (Frank East) + 4 km/h (Pedestrian West) = 12 km/h.\n    *   Relative speed with East-walking pedestrians (4 km/h East): 8 km/h (Frank East) - 4 km/h (Pedestrian East) = 4 km/h. Frank overtakes East-walking pedestrians.\n    *   Frank's total \"encounter rate\" is proportional to the sum: 12 km/h + 4 km/h = 16 km/h.\n    *   Compare Frank's rate (proportional to 16) to Bill's rate (proportional to 8) and Bob's rate (proportional to 8). Frank's rate is 16/8 = 2 times their rate. Frank's claim that his chances were twice as good as either Bill's or Bob's is true.\n5.  **Analyze Jim's claim:** Jim drives West at 12 km/h.\n    *   Relative speed with West-walking pedestrians (4 km/h West): 12 km/h (Jim West) - 4 km/h (Pedestrian West) = 8 km/h. Jim overtakes West-walking pedestrians.\n    *   Relative speed with East-walking pedestrians (4 km/h East): 12 km/h (Jim West) + 4 km/h (Pedestrian East) = 16 km/h.\n    *   Jim's total \"encounter rate\" is proportional to the sum: 8 km/h + 16 km/h = 24 km/h.\n    *   Compare Jim's rate (proportional to 24) to Frank's rate (proportional to 16). Jim's rate is 24/16 = 1.5 times Frank's rate. Jim's claim that his chances were twice as good as Frank's (which would require a rate proportional to 2 * 16 = 32) is false.\n6.  **State the correct and incorrect claims:** Based on the comparisons of encounter rates, Bob's claim was false, Frank's claim was true, and Jim's claim was false.

{"ID": 136, "Question": "Question: Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?\nComments to triflers:\nThe bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!\n Solution: 80\nTo achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion. This takes 9 trips of 2 5/18 miles (5 advancing trips interspersed with 4 return trips) for a total of 20.5 miles traveled (9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5) and 20.5 bottles of soda used. Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases. With one less case to move, Bu will now make 2 fewer trips. The 3.5 bottles set aside are used to move the four cases the next 1/2 mile toward the Wirth Pavilion.

This minimizes fuel loss on return trips by consolidating the cargo before moving it further.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Initial State:** Start with 5 cases (120 bottles) at Pavilion A. The destination (Pavilion B) is 5 miles away. The MoJoPed can carry 1 case (24 bottles) plus fuel, and gets 1 mile per bottle.\n2.  **Phase 1: Move 5 Cases to a First Depot:** To efficiently move all 5 cases forward, establish a first depot at a specific distance (2 5/18 miles) from Pavilion A. This involves a series of trips: taking a case forward, dropping some bottles, returning to pick up the next case, and so on, until all 5 cases are at the depot. The solution states this phase requires 9 trips total (5 forward with a case, 4 returning empty) covering 9 * (2 5/18) = 20.5 miles. This consumes 20.5 bottles of fuel from the initial supply.\n3.  **Bottles After Phase 1:** After moving the 5 cases to the first depot (2 5/18 miles out) and using 20.5 bottles as fuel, there are 120 - 20.5 = 99.5 bottles remaining at this location. These are then consolidated into 4 full cases (4 * 24 = 96 bottles) plus 3.5 loose bottles.\n4.  **Phase 2: Move 4 Cases to a Second Point:** Using the consolidated pile, move the 4 cases further down the road. The solution indicates moving the pile an additional 1/2 mile from the first depot. Using the strategy for moving 4 items this distance requires 7 trips covering 7 * 1/2 = 3.5 miles. This conveniently uses exactly the 3.5 loose bottles as fuel.\n5.  **Bottles After Phase 2:** After moving the 4 cases the additional 1/2 mile (reaching a point 2 5/18 + 1/2 = 2 7/9 miles from A) and using the 3.5 loose bottles as fuel, there are 96 bottles remaining (in the 4 cases) at this second point. The remaining distance to Pavilion B is 5 - 2 7/9 = 2 2/9 miles.\n6.  **Phase 3: Move 4 Cases to Destination B:** Move the remaining 4 cases the final distance (2 2/9 miles) to Pavilion B. Using the strategy for moving 4 items this distance requires 7 trips covering 7 * (2 2/9) = 15 5/9 miles. This consumes 15 5/9 bottles of fuel from the 96 bottles.\n7.  **Final Delivery:** Upon reaching Pavilion B, the number of bottles remaining from the 96 bottles is 96 - 15 5/9 = 80 4/9 bottles. Since only whole bottles can be delivered and counted towards the total, the cadet delivers 80 whole bottles.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

The reversed number is then `edcba`.\n2.  **Formulate the equation:** The problem states that the reversed number minus the original number is 33957. This can be written as the equation: `edcba - abcde = 33957`.\n3.  **Expand by place value:** Rewrite the numbers in the equation based on their place values: `(10000e + 1000d + 100c + 10b + a) - (10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e) = 33957`.\n4.  **Simplify the equation:** Combine like terms in the expanded equation: `(10000e - e) + (1000d - 10d) + (100c - 100c) + (10b - 1000b) + (a - 10000a) = 33957`, which simplifies to `9999(e - a) + 990(d - b) = 33957`.\n5.  **Divide the equation:** Divide both sides of the simplified equation by 99: `(9999(e - a) / 99) + (990(d - b) / 99) = 33957 / 99`. This results in `101(e - a) + 10(d - b) = 343`.\n6.  **Determine the constraint on `e - a`:** In the equation `101(e - a) + 10(d - b) = 343`, the term `10(d - b)` is a multiple of 10, meaning it ends in 0. For the sum to be 343 (which ends in 3), the term `101(e - a)` must end in 3. Since `e` and `a` are single digits (0-9), `e - a` is an integer between -9 and 9. By checking small integer values, we find that `101 * 3 = 303`, which ends in 3. No other integer in the range -9 to 9 makes `101(e-a)` end in 3. Therefore, we must have `e - a = 3`.\n7.  **Determine the constraint on `d - b`:** Substitute the finding `e - a = 3` back into the equation from Step 5: `101(3) + 10(d - b) = 343`. This simplifies to `303 + 10(d - b) = 343`. Subtracting 303 from both sides gives `10(d - b) = 40`. Dividing by 10 gives `d - b = 4`.\n8.  **Summarize the digit constraints:** The analysis shows that the digits of the original number must satisfy: `e = a + 3`, `d = b + 4`, and the digit `c` is not constrained by the equation.\n9.  **Count possibilities for `a` (and `e`):** Since `a` is the first digit of a 5-digit number, `a` cannot be 0 (`1 <= a <= 9`). From `e = a + 3`, and `e` must be a digit (`0 <= e <= 9`), we have `a + 3 <= 9`, which means `a <= 6`. Combining the constraints, `a` can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. This gives 6 possibilities for `a`.\n10. **Count possibilities for `b` (and `d`):** Since `b` is a digit, `0 <= b <= 9`. From `d = b + 4`, and `d` must be a digit (`0 <= d <= 9`), we have `b + 4 <= 9`, which means `b <= 5`. Combining the constraints, `b` can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. This gives 6 possibilities for `b`.\n11. **Count possibilities for `c`:** Since `c` is not constrained by the equation, it can be any digit from 0 to 9. This gives 10 possibilities for `c`.\n12. **Calculate the total number of possibilities:** The choices for `a`, `b`, and `c` are independent. The total number of possible original numbers `abcde` is the product of the number of choices for `a`, `b`, and `c`. Total possibilities = (choices for `a`) * (choices for `b`) * (choices for `c`) = 6 * 6 * 10 = 360.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

Mouse B bites the remaining half (which would take it 45 minutes alone), and Mouse C bites from the other side (which would take it 90 minutes alone for that half). Their combined biting rate on this remaining half means they will finish it in 30 minutes.\n6.  **Calculate the total time:** The total time elapsed when the second part of Rope B is finished is the sum of the time taken in the first phase and the time taken in the second phase.

We are looking for the *minimum* such number.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Divisibility Requirement:** A number is a multiple of 225 if and only if it is divisible by both 9 and 25. This is because 225 = 9 * 25, and 9 and 25 share no common factors other than 1.\n\n3.  **Apply the Divisibility Rule for 25 using allowed digits:** A number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since the number of gums can only contain digits 0 and 1, the last two digits *must* be 00 to satisfy the divisibility by 25 rule.\n\n4.  **Apply the Divisibility Rule for 9 using allowed digits:** A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Since the number can only contain digits 0 and 1, the sum of its digits is simply the count of how many '1's are in the number. Therefore, the number of '1's must be a multiple of 9.\n\n5.  **Determine the Minimum Number of '1's:** To find the *minimum* number of gums, we need the smallest possible value. This implies using the fewest possible digits, especially placing '1's in lower place values. The smallest positive multiple of 9 is 9. Thus, the minimum number of '1's the number must contain is nine.\n\n6.  **Construct the Smallest Number:** We need the smallest number composed of only 0s and 1s that contains exactly nine '1's (to be divisible by 9) and ends with '00' (to be divisible by 25). To make the number smallest, we must place the required nine '1's to the left of the mandatory final '00', in the lowest possible place values. The smallest way to arrange nine '1's before two '0's is to place the nine '1's consecutively followed by the two '0's.\n\n7.  **State the Resulting Minimum Number:** Following the construction in the previous step, the smallest number is 11,111,111,100. This number uses only 0s and 1s, has nine '1's (sum of digits is 9, divisible by 9), and ends in '00' (divisible by 25), confirming it is a multiple of 225.

{"ID": 151, "Question": "Question: In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.\nOn one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.\nFirst, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.\nSecond, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.\nThird, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.\nFourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)\nFor discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.\nAbout this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, \"Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.\"\nKnowing Junior, we asked, \"How big a headache is your math gonna give us?\"\nShe answered, \"I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.\"\nName the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.\n Solution: Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.\nAfter labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, \"Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof.

This trapezoid is the first equal portion.\n3.  **Explain the Proof Method (Dissection):** To prove the portions are equal without complex math, the octagon is conceptually divided into simpler shapes. This is done by drawing lines connecting opposite non-adjacent vertices (EH, BG, CF), which dissect the octagon into a central square, four equal triangles, and four equal rectangles surrounding the square.

{"ID": 152, "Question": "Question: A solid wooden cuboid is made which measures an exact, and even, number of centimetres along each of its edges. It is then painted black all over its exposed faces and, when the paint is dry, the cuboid is cut up into 1 centimetre cubes. These small cubes are counted and it is then found that the number having NO paint on them at all, is exactly the same as the number which do have some paint on them. What is the LEAST number of small cubes there could be in total?\n Solution: Least is 960 (8 by 10 by 12)", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "Least is 960 (8 by 10 by 12)", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": "Okay, let's break down the solution into simple, logical steps.\n\n**Problem:** A cuboid with even integer edge lengths is painted and cut into 1 cm cubes. The number of cubes with no paint equals the number of cubes with some paint. Find the least possible total number of 1 cm cubes.\n\n**Solution Summary:** The problem states that the number of cubes with no paint is equal to the number of cubes with paint. This means the number of unpainted cubes is exactly half the total number of cubes. We can express the number of unpainted cubes based on the cuboid's dimensions and set up an equation. Since the dimensions are even integers, we can substitute this constraint into the equation and find the smallest possible dimensions that satisfy the condition, leading to the smallest total number of cubes.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Define variables for the cuboid dimensions:** Let the lengths of the edges of the solid wooden cuboid be L, W, and H centimetres. The problem states that L, W, and H are exact and even positive integers. Since it's a solid cuboid made of 1cm cubes, the minimum dimension must be at least 2 cm (a 0cm or 1cm dimension wouldn't be a cuboid cut into 1cm cubes with paint). So, L \u2265 2, W \u2265 2, H \u2265 2, and L, W, H are even.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total number of small cubes:** When the cuboid is cut into 1 cm cubes, the total number of small cubes is the volume of the cuboid in cubic centimetres, which is Total = L * W * H.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of cubes with no paint:** A small cube has no paint if it was entirely in the interior of the original cuboid. The interior forms a smaller cuboid, 1 cm away from each painted face. If the original dimensions were L, W, H, the dimensions of the unpainted interior are (L-2), (W-2), and (H-2) centimetres. The number of unpainted cubes is Unpainted = (L-2) * (W-2) * (H-2). This is valid because L, W, H are even and at least 2. If any dimension were 2, say L=2, then L-2=0, and the unpainted volume is 0, which is correct as a 2cm thick slice has no interior cubes. However, we will see later that for a solution to exist, L, W, H must all be at least 4.\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of cubes with some paint:** The cubes with some paint are all the cubes on the surface. This number is the total number of cubes minus the number of unpainted cubes. Painted = Total - Unpainted = (L * W * H) - ((L-2) * (W-2) * (H-2)).\n\n5.  **Set up the equation based on the problem condition:** The problem states that the number of cubes having NO paint is exactly the same as the number which do have some paint. So, Unpainted = Painted.\n    Substitute the expressions from steps 3 and 4:\n    (L-2) * (W-2) * (H-2) = (L * W * H) - ((L-2) * (W-2) * (H-2)).\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** Add (L-2) * (W-2) * (H-2) to both sides of the equation from step 5:\n    2 * ((L-2) * (W-2) * (H-2)) = L * W * H. This means the number of unpainted cubes is half the total number of cubes.\n\n7.  **Incorporate the constraint that dimensions are even:** Since L, W, and H are even integers, we can write L = 2a, W = 2b, and H = 2c, where a, b, and c are positive integers (a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, c \u2265 1).\n    Substitute these into the equation from step 6:\n    2 * ((2a - 2) * (2b - 2) * (2c - 2)) = (2a) * (2b) * (2c).\n    Factor out 2 from each term in the parentheses:\n    2 * (2(a-1)) * (2(b-1)) * (2(c-1)) = 8abc.\n    2 * 8 * (a-1)(b-1)(c-1) = 8abc.\n    16 * (a-1)(b-1)(c-1) = 8abc.\n    Divide both sides by 8:\n    2 * (a-1)(b-1)(c-1) = abc.\n\n8.  **Identify the condition for a solution and the goal:** The equation 2 * (a-1)(b-1)(c-1) = abc must hold for integers a, b, c. From step 3, the unpainted dimensions (L-2, W-2, H-2) must be non-negative, meaning (2a-2) \u2265 0, (2b-2) \u2265 0, (2c-2) \u2265 0. This implies a-1 \u2265 0, b-1 \u2265 0, c-1 \u2265 0, so a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, c \u2265 1. If any of a, b, or c is 1 (meaning L, W, or H is 2), the left side of the equation becomes 0 (e.g., if a=1, 2*(1-1)(b-1)(c-1) = 0), but the right side abc would be positive (since b,c \u2265 1), leading to 0 = abc, which is impossible for positive a,b,c. Therefore, a, b, and c must all be integers greater than or equal to 2 (meaning L, W, H must be even and \u2265 4). The goal is to find the smallest possible Total = L * W * H = (2a)(2b)(2c) = 8abc. This is equivalent to finding the smallest possible product abc that satisfies 2 * (a-1)(b-1)(c-1) = abc with a, b, c being integers \u2265 2.\n\n9.  **Find the smallest integer solutions for a, b, c \u2265 2:** We need to find integers a, b, c \u2265 2 that minimize abc while satisfying 2(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) = abc. Without loss of generality, assume 2 \u2264 a \u2264 b \u2264 c. Rearrange the equation as abc / ((a-1)(b-1)(c-1)) = 2, or (a/(a-1)) * (b/(b-1)) * (c/(c-1)) = 2.

Similarly, (1 + 1/(c-1)) \u2264 1.25. The maximum possible product is 1.25 * 1.25 = 1.5625. Since 1.6 > 1.5625, no solution is possible with a=5 or higher.\n\n10. **Compare the products abc for valid solutions:** We found the following valid integer solutions for (a, b, c) with a \u2264 b \u2264 c and a,b,c \u2265 2 that satisfy 2(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) = abc:\n    *   (3, 5, 16), product abc = 3 * 5 * 16 = 240.\n    *   (4, 4, 9), product abc = 4 * 4 * 9 = 144.\n    *   (4, 5, 6), product abc = 4 * 5 * 6 = 120.\n\n11. **Determine the minimum total number of cubes:** The total number of cubes is 8 * abc.

Adding the first three equations gives:\n    2(a + b + c) = y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 + w\u00b2\n    Since a + b + c = x\u00b2, we have:\n    2x\u00b2 = y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 + w\u00b2\n    We can also solve for a, b, and c:\n    a = (a + b + c) - (b + c) = x\u00b2 - w\u00b2\n    b = (a + b + c) - (a + c) = x\u00b2 - z\u00b2\n    c = (a + b + c) - (a + b) = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2\n\n3.  **Establish constraints on the perfect squares:** For a, b, and c to be distinct positive integers, x, y, z, and w must be integers, and x > y, x > z, x > w, and y, z, w must be distinct.\n\n4.  **Establish constraints on the total sum (x\u00b2):** The numbers a, b, c must be less than 500. From a = x\u00b2 - w\u00b2, b = x\u00b2 - z\u00b2, c = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2, if we assume y < z < w < x, then c = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 will be the largest of a, b, c (since y\u00b2 is the smallest subtracted value). For c to be positive, x\u00b2 > y\u00b2. For c to be less than 500, x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 < 500. Since y must be at least 1 (y\u00b2=1 is the smallest possible square of a positive integer), the smallest possible value for c is x\u00b2 - (largest possible y\u00b2 < x\u00b2). To guarantee a, b, c are less than 500, the total sum x\u00b2 must itself not be excessively large. If the total sum x\u00b2 is, say, 441, then a,b,c = 441 - (squares). Since the smallest possible square is 1, the largest possible value for a,b,c would be 441-1 = 440, which is less than 500. The total sum x\u00b2 itself must be less than 500 + the smallest possible square for y\u00b2, z\u00b2, or w\u00b2. Since y, z, w must be distinct, their squares are at least 1\u00b2, 2\u00b2, 3\u00b2. Thus x\u00b2 - 1\u00b2 must be less than 500, implying x\u00b2 < 501.

Possible values for x\u00b2 are 1, 4, 9, ..., 484.\n\n5.  **Outline the search strategy:** We need to find a perfect square x\u00b2 (the total sum) and three distinct perfect squares y\u00b2, z\u00b2, w\u00b2 (the pairwise sums) such that y\u00b2, z\u00b2, w\u00b2 are all less than x\u00b2, their sum y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 + w\u00b2 is equal to 2x\u00b2, and the resulting numbers a=x\u00b2-w\u00b2, b=x\u00b2-z\u00b2, c=x\u00b2-y\u00b2 are positive, distinct, and less than 500. We can iterate through possible values of x\u00b2 (from the list in step 4) and try to find three distinct squares y\u00b2, z\u00b2, w\u00b2 that satisfy the conditions.\n\n6.  **Apply the strategy with a likely candidate for the total sum (x\u00b2):** The provided solution numbers (41, 80, 320) sum to 441. Since 441 = 21\u00b2, let's test if x\u00b2 = 441 is a valid total sum. So, S = 441.\n\n7.  **Find the required squares (y\u00b2, z\u00b2, w\u00b2):** We need to find three distinct perfect squares y\u00b2, z\u00b2, w\u00b2 such that y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 + w\u00b2 = 2 * S = 2 * 441 = 882, and y\u00b2, z\u00b2, w\u00b2 are all less than S=441. The perfect squares less than 441 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ..., 400. We need to find three distinct numbers from this list that sum to 882. A good way to search is to start with the largest squares less than 441. Let's try 400 (20\u00b2). The remaining sum needed is 882 - 400 = 482. Now we need two distinct squares less than 400 that sum to 482. Let's try the next largest square less than 400, which is 361 (19\u00b2). The remaining sum needed is 482 - 361 = 121. Is 121 a perfect square? Yes, 121 = 11\u00b2. The three distinct perfect squares are 121 (11\u00b2), 361 (19\u00b2), and 400 (20\u00b2). They are all less than 441.\n\n8.  **Calculate the three numbers (a, b, c):** Using S = 441 and the squares y\u00b2=121, z\u00b2=361, w\u00b2=400 (assigning them arbitrarily for now, the final set {a,b,c} will be the same regardless of which is called y\u00b2, z\u00b2, or w\u00b2), we calculate a, b, c:\n    a = S - w\u00b2 = 441 - 400 = 41\n    b = S - z\u00b2 = 441 - 361 = 80\n    c = S - y\u00b2 = 441 - 121 = 320\n    The three numbers are 41, 80, and 320.\n\n9.  **Verify the numbers satisfy all conditions:**\n    *   Are they distinct and positive? Yes, 41, 80, 320 are distinct positive integers.\n    *   Are they all under 500? Yes, 41 < 500, 80 < 500, and 320 < 500.\n    *   Are the sums of any two perfect squares?\n        *   41 + 80 = 121 = 11\u00b2 (Yes)\n        *   41 + 320 = 361 = 19\u00b2 (Yes)\n        *   80 + 320 = 400 = 20\u00b2 (Yes)\n    *   Is the sum of all three a perfect square?\n        *   41 + 80 + 320 = 441 = 21\u00b2 (Yes)\n    All conditions are met.

Define the constant rate at which grass grows per day as 'k'. Define the constant eating rates of the cow, goat, and goose as v1, v2, and v3, respectively (amount of grass eaten per day).\n2.  **Formulate the relationship between initial grass, growth, eating, and time:** For any given combination of animals grazing for a certain number of days (t), the total amount of grass eaten by the animals plus the amount of grass remaining must equal the initial amount of grass plus the amount grown. If the grass is completely eaten (amount remaining is 0), the relationship is: Initial Grass + Grass Grown = Grass Eaten. This can be written as `h + t * k = t * (sum of animal eating rates)`. Rearranging, we get `h = t * (sum of animal eating rates - k)`. The term `(sum of animal eating rates - k)` represents the *net* rate at which the grass is consumed relative to the initial amount.\n3.  **Write equations for each given scenario:** Using the relationship from step 2, set up an equation for each scenario provided in the problem:\n    *   Cow and Goat graze for 45 days: `h = 45 * (v1 + v2 - k)`, which implies `v1 + v2 - k = h/45`.\n    *   Cow and Goose graze for 60 days: `h = 60 * (v1 + v3 - k)`, which implies `v1 + v3 - k = h/60`.\n    *   Cow alone grazes for 90 days: `h = 90 * (v1 - k)`, which implies `v1 - k = h/90`.\n    *   Goat and Goose graze for 90 days: `h = 90 * (v2 + v3 - k)`, which implies `v2 + v3 - k = h/90`.\n4.  **Solve the system of equations for individual rates:** The four equations from step 3 form a system. Solving this system allows us to determine the individual rates (v1, v2, v3) and the growth rate (k) in terms of 'h'. The solution shows that the rates are proportional to h/180:\n    *   v1 = 3h/180\n    *   v2 = 2h/180\n    *   v3 = h/180\n    *   k = h/180\n5.  **Set up the equation for all three animals together:** Let 't' be the number of days all three animals (cow, goat, and goose) can graze on the field together until the grass is gone.

It begins by assuming the opposite of what needs to be proven.\n2.  **Formulate the Assumption for Contradiction:** The assumption is that at the party, *no two people know the same number of people*.\n3.  **Determine the Range of \"Numbers Known\" based on the Assumption:** If there are 'n' people and each person knows a different number of people, these 'n' distinct numbers must cover all possible integer values within the relevant range. The provided solution considers the range of possible numbers known (implicitly, others) to be from 0 up to n-1.\n4.  **Identify Key Individuals:** Under this assumption, there must be exactly one person who knows the minimum number of people (0 others) and exactly one person who knows the maximum number of people (n-1 others, meaning they know everyone else). Let's call the person who knows 0 others Person A, and the person who knows n-1 others Person B.\n5.  **Apply the Symmetry Principle:** The problem states that if one person knows another, the reverse is also true (knowing is symmetric).\n6.  **Derive the Contradiction:** Since Person B knows everyone else, Person B must know Person A. By the symmetry principle, this means Person A must also know Person B. However, Person A was defined as the person who knows 0 other people. Knowing Person B (who is a different person from A, assuming n > 1) means Person A knows at least one other person, which contradicts the definition of Person A.\n7.  **State the Conclusion:** Because the initial assumption (that no two people know the same number of people) leads to a logical contradiction, this assumption must be false.

Let A_last and B_last be their ages the last time they met, where A_last and B_last are prime numbers. Let 'a' and 'b' be their ages at the specific past time when Alf was half of Bert's age (so a = b/2).\n\n2.  **Translate Alf's Statement into an Equation:** Alf's complex statement about past ages can be broken down. When Alf was A/4 years old, Bert was B - (A - A/4) = B - 3A/4 years old (since A - A/4 is the time elapsed). According to Alf, this age (B - 3A/4) was equal to (A/4) plus half the age Bert's father would have been thirty years before he was six times the age Bert was when Alf was half Bert's age (6b - 30)/2. This gives the equation: `B - 3A/4 = A/4 + (6b - 30)/2`.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Equation:** Rearranging the equation from step 2 gives `B - 3A/4 - A/4 = (6b - 30)/2`, which simplifies to `B - A = 3b - 15`. This equation relates the current age difference (B - A) to the specific past ages 'b'.\n\n4.  **Use the Property of Constant Age Difference:** The difference between Alf's and Bert's ages must always be constant. Therefore, the current age difference (B - A) is equal to the age difference when Alf was 'a' and Bert was 'b' (b - a), and also equal to the age difference the last time they met (B_last - A_last). So, `B - A = b - a`.\n\n5.  **Combine Equations to Find the Age Difference:** We now have two expressions for the age difference: `B - A = 3b - 15` and `B - A = b - a`. Equating these gives `b - a = 3b - 15`. We also know from the definition of 'a' and 'b' that `a = b/2`. Substituting `a = b/2` into `b - a = 3b - 15` gives `b - b/2 = 3b - 15`.\n\n6.  **Solve for 'b' and 'a':** Simplify the equation from step 5: `b/2 = 3b - 15`. Multiplying by 2 gives `b = 6b - 30`. Rearranging gives `5b = 30`, so `b = 6`. Since `a = b/2`, we find `a = 6/2 = 3`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Constant Age Difference:** The constant age difference is `b - a = 6 - 3 = 3` years. This means Bert is always 3 years older than Alf. Therefore, the difference in their ages the last time they met (B_last - A_last) must also be 3.\n\n8.  **Find Prime Numbers with the Required Difference:** We are looking for two prime numbers (A_last and B_last) such that B_last - A_last = 3. Checking small prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...), the only pair of primes that differ by 3 is 2 and 5 (since 5 - 2 = 3).\n\n9.  **Determine the Ages the Last Time They Met:** Since Bert is older, B_last must be 5 and A_last must be 2.\n\n10. **Final Answer:** Alf and Bert were 2 and 5 years old, respectively, the last time they met.

The DPV has a 10-gallon tank (full) and two 45-gallon barrels of fuel, for a total of 100 gallons. The DPV gets 12 miles per gallon and can only carry one barrel at a time.\n2.  **Establish a fuel shuttling strategy:** To move both barrels forward efficiently, the strategy is to repeatedly shuttle them in segments. A segment involves moving one barrel part of the way, returning for the other barrel, moving the second barrel to the same point, consolidating fuel, and leaving one barrel with reduced fuel behind. The solution uses 60-mile segments.\n3.  **Execute the first segment of the shuttle (0 to 60 miles):** Drive one barrel (L) 60 miles (uses 5 gallons from the tank). Return to the start (uses 5 gallons from the tank). Refill the tank from the second barrel (F) (uses 10 gallons from F). Drive barrel F 60 miles (uses 5 gallons from the tank). At the 60-mile point, consolidate fuel by using 5 gallons from barrel F to refill the tank. After this 60-mile push: The DPV is at 60 miles, the tank is full (10 gallons), barrel L is full (45 gallons), and barrel F has 30 gallons left. 15 gallons of fuel have been used in total for this 60-mile move.\n4.  **Repeat the shuttling procedure:** Repeat the 60-mile segment procedure two more times. Each 60-mile segment uses another 15 gallons of fuel to move the remaining fuel forward.\n5.  **Reach the point where one barrel is empty:** After repeating the 60-mile push 3 times (total distance 60 * 3 = 180 miles), the DPV is 180 miles from the truck. At this point, the tank is full (10 gallons), one barrel (L) is still full (45 gallons), and the other barrel (F) is empty (0 gallons), as it has been used to refill the tank during the shuttles. The total remaining fuel is 10 + 45 + 0 = 55 gallons.\n6.  **Calculate the distance from the remaining fuel:** From the 180-mile point, the DPV has 55 gallons of fuel remaining. The DPV can travel an additional 55 gallons * 12 miles/gallon = 660 miles.\n7.  **Calculate the total distance traveled:** The total distance the DPV can travel from the breakdown point is the initial shuttling distance plus the final push distance: 180 miles + 660 miles = 840 miles.\n8.  **Compare total distance to base camp distance:** The base camp is 800 miles away from the breakdown point. The DPV can travel 840 miles, which is more than the 800 miles needed.\n9.  **Conclude successful delivery:** Since the DPV can travel 840 miles and the base camp is only 800 miles away, the DPV and medical supplies can be successfully delivered to the base camp.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

{"ID": 169, "Question": "Question: Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.\nWe were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.\nAfter a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?\n Solution: It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid.

The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90. These 90 id's will not have a corresponding number when written in reverse order.\nSecondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order.

Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.\nRest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order.

There are 9 choices for the first digit (1-9), 10 choices for the second digit (0-9), and 10 choices for the third digit (0-9). This gives a total of 9 * 10 * 10 = 900 possible valid 3-digit IDs.\n\n2.  **Understand the conflict rule.** The problem states that no two chosen employee IDs can be identical when one is written in reverse order. This means if ID 'ABC' is chosen, ID 'CBA' cannot also be chosen, unless 'ABC' and 'CBA' are the same number.\n\n3.  **Categorize the valid 3-digit IDs based on their reverse.** We analyze the 900 valid IDs by considering what happens when they are reversed.\n\n4.  **Count IDs that are symmetrical (read the same forwards and backward).** These are IDs of the form 'ABA', where A is the first digit (non-zero) and B is the second digit. The first digit A can be any number from 1 to 9 (9 choices). The second digit B can be any number from 0 to 9 (10 choices). The third digit must be the same as the first (1 choice). This gives 9 * 10 * 1 = 90 symmetrical IDs. When reversed, these IDs are identical to themselves. Therefore, the conflict rule does not create a pair to choose from; if a symmetrical ID is chosen, its 'reverse' (which is itself) is implicitly covered. All 90 symmetrical IDs can be selected.\n\n5.  **Count IDs whose reverse is NOT a valid 3-digit ID.** According to the problem rules, a 3-digit ID must not start with zero. If a valid 3-digit ID ends in zero (format 'AB0', where A is not zero), its reverse will start with zero (format '0BA'). The first digit A can be 1-9 (9 choices), the second digit B can be 0-9 (10 choices), and the third digit is 0 (1 choice). This gives 9 * 10 * 1 = 90 valid 3-digit IDs ending in zero. The reverse of these 90 IDs are not valid 3-digit IDs. Since their reverse is not a valid ID, they do not have a conflicting 'partner' in the set of valid 3-digit IDs. Therefore, all 90 of these IDs can be selected.\n\n6.  **Count the remaining valid IDs.** These are the IDs that are not symmetrical and do not end in zero. The total number of valid IDs is 900. Subtract the symmetrical IDs (90) and the IDs ending in zero (90): 900 - 90 - 90 = 720 remaining IDs. For any ID 'ABC' in this remaining group, its reverse 'CBA' will also be a valid 3-digit ID (since A is not 0, C is not 0, and 'ABC' is not symmetrical).\n\n7.  **Determine how many IDs can be selected from the remaining group.** The 720 remaining IDs form pairs where one ID is the reverse of the other (e.g., 123 and 321). Since the problem states that no two chosen IDs can be reverses of each other, we can only select one ID from each such pair. There are 720 IDs in this group, forming 720 / 2 = 360 pairs. Therefore, we can select exactly 360 IDs from this group.\n\n8.  **Calculate the maximum total number of employees.** The maximum number of employees corresponds to the total number of valid IDs that can be selected under the given rules.

In a grid with 'm' rows and 'n' columns, there are m+1 horizontal lines and n+1 vertical lines. The number of ways to choose 2 horizontal lines from m+1 is C(m+1, 2), which is equivalent to the sum of integers from 1 to m (m(m+1)/2). Similarly, the number of ways to choose 2 vertical lines from n+1 is C(n+1, 2), equivalent to the sum of integers from 1 to n (n(n+1)/2). The total number of rectangles is the product of these two choices.\n4.  **Apply the Formula to the Grid Dimensions:** The grid is 20 rows by 10 columns. So, we need to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 20 and the sum of integers from 1 to 10.\n5.  **Calculate the Sum for Rows:** The sum of integers from 1 to 20 is 1 + 2 + ... + 20.

The provided grid is a solution to this problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to fill a 5x5 grid using each number from 1 to 25 exactly once, such that the sum of the numbers in every row, every column, and both main diagonals is identical. This specific sum is called the magic constant.\n2.  **Calculate the Magic Constant:** For an n x n magic square using numbers from 1 to n\u00b2, the sum of all numbers is n\u00b2 * (n\u00b2 + 1) / 2. The sum of each row, column, or diagonal (the magic constant) is this total sum divided by n. For a 5x5 square with numbers 1 to 25 (n=5), the sum of all numbers is 25 * (25 + 1) / 2 = 25 * 26 / 2 = 325. The magic constant is 325 / 5 = 65.\n3.  **Verify the Solution:** Check that the provided grid satisfies the condition. Sum the numbers in each of the 5 rows, each of the 5 columns, and the two main diagonals. If all these sums equal 65, the grid is a valid magic square.\n4.  **Understand Construction (for odd-sized squares):** Magic squares of odd order (like 5x5) can be constructed using specific algorithms. A common method, like the Siamese method, involves starting with '1' in the center cell of the top row and moving diagonally upwards and to the right, wrapping around the grid boundaries when necessary, and moving down one cell when a position is already occupied.\n5.  **Confirm Validity:** The provided grid is confirmed to be a valid 5x5 magic square because each row, column, and main diagonal sums to the calculated magic constant of 65.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

Only one value of N will satisfy this condition, determining the correct total number of parts.\n6.  **Calculate Triplet's Parts:** Use the correct value of N (found in step 5) in the formula derived in step 3 to calculate the exact number of parts each triplet received.\n7.  **Calculate Rastus's Parts:** Subtract the sum of Weedy's parts (which is 1) and the combined parts of the three triplets from the total number of parts (N) to find the number of parts Rastus received.\n8.  **State the Final Answer:** Present the number of parts each son (Rastus and the identical triplets) received, based on the calculations.

The result `CF` ends in `F`. Thus, if `A=5`, then `F=5`. However, each letter must represent a unique number, so `A` cannot be equal to `F`. Therefore, `A` cannot be 5.\n3.  **Deduce G=1:** Since the last digit of `G * A` is `A`, and `A` is not 5 (from the previous step), `G` must be 1.\n4.  **Analyze the fourth equation:** The equation `F * A = C` shows that the product of `F` and `A` is a single digit `C`.

Using 1 in the sum (e.g., 1 + x) gives the same sum as using just x, but multiplying by 1 (1 * x) gives a smaller product than using x as a factor itself (or incorporating that value into another factor). Therefore, we only consider integers greater than 1.\n2.  **Determine the most efficient factors:** Consider integers greater than 1. Any integer greater than 4 can be broken down into smaller integers whose sum is equal to the original integer, and whose product is greater than the original integer (e.g., 5 = 2+3, 2*3 = 6 > 5; 6 = 3+3, 3*3 = 9 > 6). The numbers 2, 3, and 4 are the building blocks. Comparing using 2s vs 3s: for a sum of 6, 2+2+2 = 6, 2*2*2 = 8; 3+3 = 6, 3*3 = 9. Since 3s generally yield a larger product for the same sum compared to 2s, and breaking numbers down into 2s and 3s (or 4s, which is 2*2) is optimal, we should use as many 3s as possible.\n3.  **Prioritize using the number 3:** Based on step 2, the largest product for a given sum is achieved by using as many factors of 3 as possible.\n4.  **Calculate the maximum number of 3s and the remainder:** Divide the total sum (20) by 3 to see how many 3s can be used and what sum remains. 20 divided by 3 is 6 with a remainder of 2. This means we use six factors of 3, and the remaining sum is 2.\n5.  **Handle the remainder:** The remainder of 2 must be included in the sum. The only way to form a sum of 2 using integers greater than 1 is the number 2 itself. (If the remainder were 4, we would use two 2s instead of a single 4, as 2*2=4, giving the same product but potentially being useful if combined with other small remainders, though in this case it's just a remainder of 2).\n6.  **Form the set of factors and calculate the product:** The set of positive integers that sum to 20, following these steps, is six 3s and one 2 (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 18 + 2 = 20). The product of these integers is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 2 = 3^6 * 2.\n7.  **Calculate the final result:** Calculate 3^6 = 729. The product is 729 * 2 = 1458.

{"ID": 189, "Question": "Question: A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.\nHow fast can the man run?\n Solution: Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.

Substitute this into the man's distance from A (3/8 `y`) to express this distance in terms of `x` (which is the train's initial distance). In Scenario 1, the man travels this distance while the train travels distance `x`. Since they travel for the same amount of time, the ratio of their speeds is equal to the ratio of the distances they traveled: (Man's distance) / (Train's distance) = (Man's speed) / (Train's speed).

Note that each letter represents a unique digit from 0 to 9. Identify the given values (A = 9 and E = 7).\n    ```\n       I T\n     T A K E S\n         A\n     L I T T L E\n     ----------\n     E F F O R T\n    ```\n    (Substitute knowns: A=9, E=7)\n    ```\n       I T\n     T 9 K 7 S\n         9\n     L I T T L 7\n     ----------\n     7 F F O R T\n    ```\n\n2.  **Analyze the Units Column (Rightmost):** Look at the equation formed by the units digits, including any possible carry-over to the tens column (let's call it c1). The units column sums to T + S + A + E = T + 10*c1. Substitute A=9 and E=7: T + S + 9 + 7 = T + 10*c1, which simplifies to S + 16 = 10*c1. Since S is a single digit (0-9), S+16 must be between 16 and 25. The only multiple of 10 in this range is 20. This forces c1 = 2 and S = 4.\n\n3.  **Analyze Columns from Right to Left:** Move to the tens column, hundreds column, and so on. For each column, write down the sum of the digits in that column plus the carry-over from the previous column, equating it to the digit in the sum's corresponding place value plus ten times the carry-over to the next column. Use the values already deduced (S=4, c1=2) and the given values (A=9, E=7).\n    *   Tens: I + E + L + c1 = R + 10*c2 -> I + 7 + L + 2 = R + 10*c2 -> **I + L + 9 = R + 10*c2**\n    *   Hundreds: K + T + c2 = O + 10*c3\n    *   Thousands: A + T + c3 = F + 10*c4 -> 9 + T + c3 = F + 10*c4\n    *   Ten Thousands: T + I + c4 = F + 10*c5\n    *   Hundred Thousands: L + c5 = E + 10*c6 -> L + c5 = 7 + 10*c6\n\n4.  **Make Deductions Based on Constraints and Leading Digits:** The sum (EFFORT) is a 6-digit number starting with E=7. The number LITTLE (L I T T L E) is also a 6-digit number. The largest contribution to the hundred thousands place of the sum comes from L in LITTLE and T in TAKES, plus the carry (c5) from the ten thousands column. Since the sum starts with 7, and the individual addends are single digits in the hundred thousands column (L and T), the carry-over (c6) to the millions place must be 0. Thus, L + c5 must result in 7 (or 17, but L+c5 is unlikely to be this high given typical carries). Since L cannot be 7 (as E=7), L must be a digit from 0 to 6, and c5 must be the digit that makes L + c5 = 7. Possible pairs for (L, c5) are (6, 1), (5, 2), etc., keeping in mind c5 is a carry-over, usually 0, 1, or 2.\n\n5.  **Use Available Digits and Trial/Error (Informed):** At this stage, start trying values for letters based on the remaining available digits and the equations derived. For instance, test the most likely (L, c5) pair from step 4 (L=6, c5=1). If L=6 and c5=1, substitute these into the ten thousands column equation (T + I + c4 = F + 10*c5), which becomes T + I + c4 = F + 10. This strongly suggests c4 must be 1 and T + I + 1 = F + 10, or T + I = F + 9. Continue substituting deduced values and testing possibilities for remaining letters (like T and I, then K, R, O), ensuring that each newly assigned letter is a unique, available digit, and that the column equations remain consistent. (Following this process with the solution's values confirms T=1, I=8, which leads to F=0, and subsequently R=3, c2=2, and finally K=2, O=5 from the remaining digits).\n\n6.  **Verify the Solution:** Once all letters (I=8, T=1, A=9, K=2, E=7, S=4, L=6, F=0, R=3, O=5) have been assigned unique digits (0-9), plug the numbers back into the original addition problem to ensure the sum is arithmetically correct.\n    81 + 19274 + 9 + 681167 = 700531.

Verify this pattern holds true for all the reported victims by plugging in their specific data (e.g., for Joe: (70 - 50 years) / 2 years = 20 / 2 = 10 total candies; the problem states 9 were found, meaning he ate 1, confirming a total of 10).\n7.

Using weights that are powers of 3 enables measuring any integer amount by representing it as a sum where each power of 3 is either added, subtracted, or not used.

Define a variable, let's call it 'x', to represent the number of times the price is reduced by the specified increment ($0.20).\n2.  Express the weekly sales and the profit per box as functions of 'x'. Sales increase by 25 for each $0.20 reduction (each unit of 'x'), so sales = 100 + 25x. Profit per box decreases by $0.20 for each reduction (each unit of 'x'), so profit per box = $1.75 - 0.20x.\n3.  Write an equation for the total weekly profit (P) by multiplying the profit per box by the number of boxes sold per week: P(x) = ($1.75 - 0.20x)(100 + 25x).\n4.  Expand and simplify the profit equation P(x) to get a quadratic function of 'x': P(x) = -5x\u00b2 + 23.75x + 175. This equation represents a downward-opening parabola, and its maximum value will be at the vertex.\n5.  To find the value of 'x' that maximizes the profit, use calculus by taking the first derivative of the profit function P(x) with respect to 'x' and setting it equal to zero: P'(x) = -10x + 23.75. Solving -10x + 23.75 = 0 gives x = 2.375.\n6.

The first step is to list these prime numbers.\n2.  **Calculate the total distance walked:** The total distance is simply the sum of the lengths of all the legs of the walk (the sum of all the identified prime numbers). This answers question (a).\n3.  **Determine the direction of each leg:** Starting by walking right, each subsequent leg involves a 90-degree right turn. This means the sequence of directions is Right, Up, Left, Down, Right, Up, Left, Down, and so on, repeating every four steps.\n4.  **Calculate the net horizontal displacement:** The steps moving right contribute positively to the horizontal displacement, and the steps moving left contribute negatively. By summing the distances for all steps moving right and subtracting the sum of distances for all steps moving left, the net change in the horizontal position relative to the start is found.\n5.  **Calculate the net vertical displacement:** Similarly, the steps moving up contribute positively to the vertical displacement, and the steps moving down contribute negatively. By summing the distances for all steps moving up and subtracting the sum of distances for all steps moving down, the net change in the vertical position relative to the start is found.\n6.  **Calculate the straight-line distance back to the start:** The displacement from the start can be represented as a point (net horizontal displacement, net vertical displacement) on a 2D plane. The distance back to the starting position (the origin) is the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle formed by the net horizontal and vertical displacements. This distance is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: distance = sqrt((horizontal displacement)^2 + (vertical displacement)^2).\n7.  **Convert the distance to feet and inches:** The calculated distance is in feet. To express it to the nearest inch, the fractional part of the feet is multiplied by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot) and rounded to the nearest whole number.

To find the original total cost, divide the final price by 90% (or 0.90). This gives the total amount spent before the discount was applied ($296).\n\n2.  **Determine the Total Cost of Each Item Category:**\n    *   The total cost of wheels is given as $75.\n    *   The total cost of bearings is $24 less than the total cost of wheels, so the total cost of bearings is $75 - $24 = $51.\n    *   The cost of all the bearings for the two boys combined ($51) was $1 more than Alec's deck. Therefore, Alec's deck cost $51 - $1 = $50.\n    *   Alec's deck ($50) cost $5 more than Brett's deck. So, Brett's deck cost $50 - $5 = $45.\n    *   The total cost of decks is the sum of Alec's and Brett's decks: $50 + $45 = $95.\n    *   The total cost of all items before the discount was $296. This total is the sum of the costs of Decks, Trucks, Wheels, and Bearings. Subtract the known totals for Decks ($95), Wheels ($75), and Bearings ($51) from the overall total ($296) to find the total cost of Trucks: $296 - $95 - $75 - $51 = $75.\n\n3.  **Determine Individual Costs Per Item (Before Discount):**\n    *   Chris, Alec, and Brett each bought the same kinds of wheels, and the total for the three sets was $75. So, each set of wheels cost $75 / 3 = $25. Chris's total cost is just the cost of his wheels.\n    *   Alec's deck cost $50 and Brett's deck cost $45 (calculated in Step 2).\n    *   The total cost of trucks was $75, and Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec. Let Alec's truck cost be 'x'. Then Brett's truck cost is 'x + 5'. Their combined cost is x + (x + 5) = 75. Solving for x, we get 2x + 5 = 75, 2x = 70, x = $35. So, Alec spent $35 on trucks, and Brett spent $35 + $5 = $40 on trucks.\n    *   The total cost of bearings was $51, and Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings. Let Alec's bearing cost be 'y'. Then Brett's bearing cost is '2y + 3'. Their combined cost is y + (2y + 3) = 51. Solving for y, we get 3y + 3 = 51, 3y = 48, y = $16. So, Alec spent $16 on bearings, and Brett spent (2 * $16) + $3 = $32 + $3 = $35 on bearings.\n\n4.  **Calculate Each Person's Total Cost Before Discount:**\n    *   Alec's total cost before discount is the sum of his deck, trucks, wheels, and bearings: $50 + $35 + $25 + $16 = $126.\n    *   Brett's total cost before discount is the sum of his deck, trucks, wheels, and bearings: $45 + $40 + $25 + $35 = $145.\n    *   Chris's total cost before discount is only the cost of his wheels: $25.\n    *   *Self-check:* The sum of their individual totals ($126 + $145 + $25) should equal the overall total before discount ($296), which it does.\n\n5.  **Calculate Each Person's Final Cost (After Discount):** The 10% discount is applied to the total original purchase ($296).

A specific time becomes ambiguous if the *angles* of the hands relative to 12 o'clock represent a valid time, and if these two angles are *swapped*, they also represent another valid time.\n\n2.  **Determine the speeds of the hands:** The minute hand moves at a speed of 360 degrees per hour, which is 6 degrees per minute. The hour hand moves at a speed of 360 degrees in 12 hours, which is 30 degrees per hour or 0.5 degrees per minute.\n\n3.  **Set up the conditions for ambiguity:** Let the true time be *m* minutes past 12 o'clock. The angle of the minute hand from 12 is 6*m degrees. The angle of the hour hand from 12 is 0.5*m degrees. For the time to be ambiguous, these angles must correspond to another valid time, say *m'* minutes past some hour *h'*, when they are swapped. Specifically, the original hour hand angle (0.5*m) must equal the new minute hand angle (6*m' + k*360 for some integer k), and the original minute hand angle (6*m) must equal the new hour hand angle (h'*30 + 0.5*m' + j*360 for some integer j).\n\n4.  **Focus on the first ambiguous time after noon:** The first time this ambiguity can occur involves the hour hand moving just past 12 and the minute hand being a little further ahead. The swapped time will logically correspond to the *next* hour, where the original minute hand's position becomes the hour hand's position for the next hour (around 1 o'clock), and the original hour hand's position becomes the minute hand's position for that time. This scenario involves the time being *m* minutes past 12, and the ambiguous time being *m'* minutes past 1.\n\n5.  **Formulate the equations for this specific scenario:**\n    *   Original hour hand angle at 12:m = 0.5*m\n    *   Original minute hand angle at 12:m = 6*m\n    *   Ambiguous minute hand angle at 1:m' = 6*m'\n    *   Ambiguous hour hand angle at 1:m' = 30 + 0.5*m'\n    The condition for ambiguity becomes:\n    *   0.5*m = 6*m' (The original hour hand angle is the new minute hand angle)\n    *   6*m = 30 + 0.5*m' (The original minute hand angle is the new hour hand angle)\n\n6.  **Solve the system of equations:** These are two linear equations with two variables (*m* and *m'*). Solving this system yields the values for *m* and *m'*. From the first equation, m = 12m'. Substituting into the second equation gives 6(12m') = 30 + 0.5m', which simplifies to 72m' = 30 + 0.5m'. Solving for m' gives 71.5m' = 30, or (143/2)m' = 30, leading to m' = 60/143 minutes. Then, solving for m gives m = 12 * (60/143) = 720/143 minutes.\n\n7.  **State the first ambiguous time:** Convert the calculated value of *m* into minutes past 12. 720/143 minutes is equal to 5 and 5/143 minutes (since 5 * 143 = 715, and 720 - 715 = 5). This is the first time after 12:00 where the position of the hands is ambiguous, because the hour hand is at the angle 0.5 * (720/143) degrees, and the minute hand is at 6 * (720/143) degrees, and these same angles correspond to the minute hand being at 0.5 * (720/143) degrees and the hour hand being at 6 * (720/143) degrees relative to 12 for the time 1: (60/143) minutes.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

This is a classic coin change problem.\n2.  **Identify the Method:** This type of problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming.

Let's call this `ways[amount]`. Initialize `ways[0]` to 1 (there is one way to make change for 0 cents: use no coins) and `ways[amount]` to 0 for all amounts greater than 0.\n4.  **Process Each Coin Denomination:** Iterate through the available coin denominations one by one (e.g., 1, 5, 10, 25, 50).\n5.  **Update Ways for Each Amount (for the current coin):** For each coin `c` being considered, iterate through amounts `i` starting from the value of the coin (`c`) up to the target amount (100). For each amount `i`, add the number of ways to make change for `i - c` (using the coins considered *so far*) to the current number of ways to make change for `i`. This is because any combination that makes change for `i - c` can be extended to make change for `i` by simply adding one coin of value `c`. The formula is `ways[i] = ways[i] + ways[i - c]`.\n6.  **Complete Processing for All Coins:** Repeat Step 5 for every available coin denomination. After processing all coin values (1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 cents) in this manner, the value stored in `ways[100]` will represent the total number of distinct ways to make change for 100 cents using any combination of the given coins.\n7.  **State the Result:** The final value calculated for `ways[100]` is the answer.

Therefore, A, which is the last digit of the answer, must be even.", "Human Solution": "A = 2, B = 1, C = 7, D = 8", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": "Okay, here is a summary of the solution to the problem ABCD * 4 = DCBA, broken down into simple, logical steps.\n\n**Problem:** Find the digits A, B, C, and D that satisfy the equation ABCD * 4 = DCBA, where ABCD and DCBA represent four-digit numbers.\n\n**Solution Summary:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first digit (A):** The number ABCD is a four-digit number, so A must be greater than 0. When ABCD is multiplied by 4, the result DCBA is also a four-digit number. This means that 4 times the value of ABCD must be less than 10000. Since ABCD is at least 1000 (if A=1), 4*ABCD is at least 4000. Since 4*ABCD must be less than 10000, ABCD must be less than 10000 / 4 = 2500. This limits the possible values for the first digit A to either 1 or 2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the last digit (D):** Look at the units digit of the multiplication. The units digit of ABCD * 4 is A. The units digit of 4 * D must result in a number ending in A. For example, if D=3, 4*D=12, which ends in 2. If D=8, 4*D=32, which ends in 2. Since A can only be 1 or 2 (from Step 1), A must be 2 because there is no digit D such that 4*D ends in 1. Thus, A = 2. For 4*D to end in 2, D must be either 3 or 8.\n\n3.  **Combine analysis of A and D:** We know A=2 from Step 2. From Step 1, we know A can only be 1 or 2. Since A=2, the number ABCD starts with 2 (i.e., 2BCD). So, 2BCD * 4 = DCBA. The smallest possible value for 2BCD is 2000, and the largest is 2999. The product 2BCD * 4 will be between 2000 * 4 = 8000 and 2999 * 4 = 11996. Since the result DCBA is a four-digit number, it must be less than 10000. This means 2BCD * 4 must be between 8000 and 9999. Therefore, the first digit of the result, D, must be 8 or 9. Combining this with the conclusion from Step 2 that D must be 3 or 8, the only possible value for D is 8.\n\n4.  **Substitute known values and simplify the equation:** We now know A=2 and D=8. The equation becomes 2BC8 * 4 = 8CB2. Writing this in expanded form: (2000 + 100B + 10C + 8) * 4 = 8000 + 100C + 10B + 2. Distributing the 4 on the left side gives: 8000 + 400B + 40C + 32 = 8000 + 100C + 10B + 2. Subtract 8000 from both sides: 400B + 40C + 32 = 100C + 10B + 2. Rearrange the terms to group B and C: 400B - 10B = 100C - 40C + 2 - 32, which simplifies to 390B = 60C - 30. Divide the entire equation by 30: 13B = 2C - 1, or 2C = 13B + 1.\n\n5.  **Solve for B and C:** We have the equation 2C = 13B + 1, where B and C must be digits from 0 to 9. Since 2C is an even number, 13B + 1 must also be even, which means 13B must be odd. This only happens if B is an odd digit (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9). Also, since C is a digit from 0 to 9, 2C must be between 0*2=0 and 9*2=18. So, 0 \u2264 13B + 1 \u2264 18. Subtracting 1 from all parts gives -1 \u2264 13B \u2264 17. Dividing by 13 gives -1/13 \u2264 B \u2264 17/13 (approximately 1.3). The only odd digit B that falls within this range [-0.07, 1.3] is B = 1.\n\n6.  **Calculate C using the value of B:** Substitute B=1 into the equation 2C = 13B + 1: 2C = 13 * 1 + 1. This gives 2C = 14, so C = 7.\n\n7.  **Final Solution:** We have found A=2, B=1, C=7, and D=8. The number ABCD is 2178 and DCBA is 8712.\n\n8.  **Verification:** Check the original equation: 2178 * 4. 2178 * 4 = 8712. This matches DCBA, confirming the solution.\n\nThus, A=2, B=1, C=7, and D=8 is the correct solution.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

The distance covered in each bounce (up and down combined) is twice the height of that bounce. Since each bounce reaches 2/3 of the previous height, the distance covered in a bounce is 2 * (previous bounce height * 2/3).

He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer.

The goal is to find the number of people on the train before it reached Maver.\n2.  **Derive Key Constraints:** From the rule that twice as many people get in as get down (rule 1), and the rule that the difference in people getting in at consecutive stations is at least 20 (rule 3), we deduce that the difference in the number of people getting *down* at consecutive stations must be at least half of 20, which is 10.\n3.  **List Possibilities:** Based on rule 2, the number of people getting down at each station must be a prime number within a specific range (0-10 for Maver, 10-20 for Willow, ..., 50-60 for Rudolf). We list these possible prime numbers for each station.\n4.  **Determine Exact Numbers Getting Down:** Using the constraint from step 2 (difference >= 10) and the list of possible primes from step 3, we find the specific number of people who must have gotten down at each station, working backward from Rudolf. We test potential sequences, starting with the highest possible prime for Rudolf (59 or 53), to find a sequence of primes (one for each station in order) where each number is at least 10 greater than the previous one in the sequence (from Maver to Rudolf). The sequence found is 3 (Maver), 13 (Willow), 23 (Wonderland), 37 (Doku), 47 (Lemp), and 59 (Rudolf).\n5.  **Verify Total Getting Down:** We check if this sequence of numbers getting down (3, 13, 23, 37, 47, 59) satisfies rule 4, which states the total number getting down must be even. Summing these numbers (3 + 13 + 23 + 37 + 47 + 59 = 182), we confirm the total is an even number. (The possibility of 2 for Maver was ruled out because it would make the total sum 181, which is odd).\n6.  **Calculate Numbers Getting In:** Using rule 1, we find the number of people getting in at each station by doubling the number getting down at that station. We then calculate the total number of people who got in across all six stations.\n7.  **Calculate Net Change:** We find the total change in the number of people on the train across all six stations by subtracting the total number who got down from the total number who got in.\n8.  **Calculate Initial Number:** The number of people on the train at Rudolf (227) is the initial number before Maver plus the net change calculated in step 7.

Define a variable, 'x', representing the number of minutes past 2:00.\n2.  Calculate the starting angle of the hour hand from the 12 mark at exactly 2:00. This is 60 degrees (2 hours * 30 degrees/hour).\n3.  Calculate how many degrees the hour hand moves per minute (360 degrees / (12 hours * 60 minutes/hour) = 0.5 degrees/minute).\n4.  Write an expression for the total angle of the hour hand from the 12 mark after 'x' minutes have passed: 60 degrees + (0.5 * x) degrees.\n5.  Calculate how many degrees the minute hand moves per minute (360 degrees / 60 minutes = 6 degrees/minute).\n6.  Write an expression for the total angle of the minute hand from the 12 mark after 'x' minutes have passed: (6 * x) degrees.\n7.  Set up an equation based on the problem statement: the minute hand's angle is double the hour hand's angle. This gives: 6x = 2 * (60 + 0.5x).\n8.  Solve the equation for 'x':\n    *   6x = 120 + x\n    *   6x - x = 120\n    *   5x = 120\n    *   x = 120 / 5\n    *   x = 24\n9.  The value of 'x' is 24, meaning 24 minutes past 2:00.

The minute hand is at 24*6 = 144 degrees. 144 is indeed double 72.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

Understand the problem requires finding two whole numbers whose squares have a difference of 73. Let these numbers be represented by the variables `x` and `y`.\n2.  Express this problem algebraically: We are looking for whole numbers `x` and `y` such that `x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 73`.\n3.  Recall the difference of squares factorization formula, which states that `x\u00b2 - y\u00b2` can be factored as `(x + y)(x - y)`.\n4.  Apply this factorization to the equation from Step 2, resulting in the equation `(x + y)(x - y) = 73`.\n5.  Analyze the number 73: The number 73 is a prime number, meaning its only positive whole number factors are 1 and 73.\n6.  Consider the factors in the equation `(x + y)(x - y) = 73`: Since `x` and `y` are whole numbers, the terms `(x + y)` and `(x - y)` must also be integers. Their product is 73.\n7.  Identify the possible integer pairs for `(x + y)` and `(x - y)` whose product is 73. Given that `x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 73 > 0`, `x` must be greater than `y`. If `x` and `y` are non-negative whole numbers, `x > y >= 0`. This implies `x + y` is positive, and `x - y` is positive. The only pair of positive whole number factors for 73 is (1, 73).\n8.  Assign the factors to the terms: Since `x > y >= 0`, `x + y` must be greater than `x - y`. Therefore, we must assign the larger factor to the sum and the smaller factor to the difference: `x + y = 73` and `x - y = 1`.\n9.  Solve the resulting system of two linear equations:\n    Equation 1: `x + y = 73`\n    Equation 2: `x - y = 1`\n10. Add the two equations together to eliminate `y`: `(x + y) + (x - y) = 73 + 1`, which simplifies to `2x = 74`.\n11. Solve for `x` by dividing both sides by 2: `x = 74 / 2`, so `x = 37`.\n12. Substitute the value of `x` (37) into either of the original linear equations to solve for `y`. Using Equation 2: `37 - y = 1`.\n13. Solve for `y`: Subtract 1 from 37: `y = 37 - 1`, so `y = 36`.\n14. The two whole numbers are 37 and 36.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}
