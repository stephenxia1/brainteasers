0,"Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?
 Hint: To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.

Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,,True,0,0

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)
10,15 (2,3)
So the five smallest numbers with this property are:

Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,,True,0,0
6,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?
 Hint: A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is

The inscribed circle has its center (the incenter, let's call it $I$) inside the triangle, and it is tangent to all three sides. The distance from the incenter $I$ to each side is equal to the radius $r$.
We can divide the triangle $\triangle ABC$ into three smaller triangles by connecting the incenter $I$ to the vertices $A, B, C$. These three smaller triangles are $\triangle IAB$, $\triangle IBC$, and $\triangle ICA$.
The base of $\triangle IAB$ is side $c$, and its height is the perpendicular distance from $I$ to side $c$, which is $r$. The area of $\triangle IAB$ is thus $\frac{1}{2} \times c \times r$.
Similarly, the base of $\triangle IBC$ is side $a$, and its height is $r$. The area of $\triangle IBC$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times a \times r$.
The base of $\triangle ICA$ is side $b$, and its height is $r$. The area of $\triangle ICA$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times b \times r$.
The total area of $\triangle ABC$ is the sum of the areas of these three smaller triangles:
$A = \text{Area}(\triangle IAB) + \text{Area}(\triangle IBC) + \text{Area}(\triangle ICA)$
$A = \frac{1}{2}cr + \frac{1}{2}ar + \frac{1}{2}br$
We can factor out $\frac{1}{2}r$:
$A = \frac{1}{2}(c+a+b)r$
Since the semi-perimeter $s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}$, we have $a+b+c = 2s$. Substituting this into the equation:
$A = \frac{1}{2}(2s)r$
$A = sr$
Solving for $r$, we get the formula for the radius of the inscribed circle:
$r = \frac{A}{s}$

**Finding the radius of the circumscribed circle (circumradius), $R$:**

The circumscribed circle passes through all three vertices of the triangle $A, B, C$. Its center (the circumcenter) is equidistant from the vertices, and this distance is the radius $R$.
We can use the standard formula for the area of a triangle in terms of two sides and the sine of the included angle. For example, the area $A$ of $\triangle ABC$ can be given by:
$A = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin C$
where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of two sides, and $C$ is the angle between them.
The Law of Sines states that for any triangle, the ratio of the side length to the sine of the opposite angle is constant and is equal to twice the circumradius $R$:
$\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C} = 2R$
From the Law of Sines, we can express $\sin C$ in terms of side $c$ and the circumradius $R$:
$\frac{c}{\sin C} = 2R \implies \sin C = \frac{c}{2R}$
Now, substitute this expression for $\sin C$ into the area formula $A = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin C$:
$A = \frac{1}{2}ab \left(\frac{c}{2R}\right)$
$A = \frac{abc}{4R}$
Solving for $R$, we get the formula for the radius of the circumscribed circle:
$4AR = abc$
$R = \frac{abc}{4A}$

These formulas express the radii of the inscribed and circumscribed circles in terms of the properties of the triangle, using the area as suggested by the hint.

Final answer: The radius of the inscribed circle for a triangle with area $A$ and semi-perimeter $s$ is $r = \frac{A}{s}$. The radius of the circumscribed circle for a triangle with side lengths $a, b, c$ and area $A$ is $R = \frac{abc}{4A}$.",True,1,0
8,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""
""The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.""
Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.
 Hint: You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,,True,0,NULL
9,"Question: There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?
 Hint: The sum cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes. Think about what information is provided by each character knowing and/or not knowing the numbers.",The sum cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes. Think about what information is provided by each character knowing and/or not knowing the numbers.,"The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""

10,"Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?
 Hint: The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly.

This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6

1024N = 15625F + 8404

 Hint: Try to get a ratio between the train's speed and the speed of Al and Ben",Try to get a ratio between the train's speed and the speed of Al and Ben,"The train is 180 feet long.
When the back of the train passes Al, he and Ben have both walked 30 feet, meaning Ben will walk 15 feet more when the train passes him. 30 feet that Al walks plus 45 feet that Ben walks makes 75 feet that the back of the train travels in the same time that Ben walks 15 feet, meaning the train is 5 times as fast as Al and Ben.
In the time it takes Al to walk 30 feet, the front of the train moves 150 feet. This distance plus the 30 feet that Al has walked equals 180 feet.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let $L$ be the length of the train in feet.
Let $v_t$ be the speed of the train in feet per second.
Let $v_p$ be the speed of Al and Ben in feet per second. We are given that they walk at the same speed, so $v_A = v_B = v_p$.
Let $r = v_t / v_p$ be the ratio of the train's speed to the speed of Al and Ben. The hint suggests using this ratio.

Let's set up a coordinate system. Let the initial position of Al and Ben be the origin (0). Let the train be moving in the positive direction.
At time $t=0$, the front of the train is at position 0, and the back of the train is at position $-L$.

Consider Al's motion. Al starts walking at $t=0$ in the opposite direction of the train (negative direction).
Al's position at time $t$ is $x_A(t) = -v_p t$.
Al stops walking when the back of the train passes him. This means at the time Al stops, let's call it $t_A$, Al's position is equal to the position of the back of the train.
The position of the back of the train at time $t$ is $x_{train\_back}(t) = v_t t - L$.
So, at $t=t_A$, we have $x_A(t_A) = x_{train\_back}(t_A)$:
$-v_p t_A = v_t t_A - L$.

We are given that Al walks a distance $d_A = 30$ feet. The distance Al walks is $|x_A(t_A) - x_A(0)| = |-v_p t_A - 0| = v_p t_A$ (since $v_p \ge 0$ and $t_A \ge 0$).
So, $v_p t_A = 30$. This implies $t_A = \frac{30}{v_p}$.

Substitute $t_A$ into the equation for Al's stopping condition:
$-v_p \left(\frac{30}{v_p}\right) = v_t \left(\frac{30}{v_p}\right) - L$.
$-30 = \frac{30 v_t}{v_p} - L$.
Using the ratio $r = v_t / v_p$, we get:
$-30 = 30r - L$.
Rearranging this equation, we get $L - 30 = 30r$. (Equation 1)

Now consider Ben's motion. Ben starts walking at $t=0$ in the same direction as the train (positive direction).
Ben's position at time $t$ is $x_B(t) = v_p t$.
Ben stops walking when the back of the train passes him. This means at the time Ben stops, let's call it $t_B$, Ben's position is equal to the position of the back of the train.
So, at $t=t_B$, we have $x_B(t_B) = x_{train\_back}(t_B)$:
$v_p t_B = v_t t_B - L$.

We are given that Ben walks a distance $d_B = 45$ feet. The distance Ben walks is $|x_B(t_B) - x_B(0)| = |v_p t_B - 0| = v_p t_B$.
So, $v_p t_B = 45$. This implies $t_B = \frac{45}{v_p}$.

Substitute $t_B$ into the equation for Ben's stopping condition:
$v_p \left(\frac{45}{v_p}\right) = v_t \left(\frac{45}{v_p}\right) - L$.
$45 = \frac{45 v_t}{v_p} - L$.
Using the ratio $r = v_t / v_p$, we get:
$45 = 45r - L$.
Rearranging this equation, we get $L + 45 = 45r$. (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables, $L$ and $r$:
1) $L - 30 = 30r$
2) $L + 45 = 45r$

We want to find $L$. We can solve this system by eliminating $r$.
From Equation 1, $r = \frac{L - 30}{30}$.
From Equation 2, $r = \frac{L + 45}{45}$.

Set the expressions for $r$ equal to each other:
$\frac{L - 30}{30} = \frac{L + 45}{45}$.
To eliminate the denominators, multiply both sides by the least common multiple of 30 and 45, which is 90:
$90 \times \frac{L - 30}{30} = 90 \times \frac{L + 45}{45}$.
$3(L - 30) = 2(L + 45)$.
Distribute the numbers:
$3L - 90 = 2L + 90$.
Rearrange the terms to solve for $L$:
$3L - 2L = 90 + 90$.
$L = 180$.

The length of the train is 180 feet.

We can find the value of $r$ as well to check our solution. Using $L=180$ in Equation 1:
$180 - 30 = 30r$
$150 = 30r$
$r = \frac{150}{30} = 5$.
Using $L=180$ in Equation 2:
$180 + 45 = 45r$
$225 = 45r$
$r = \frac{225}{45} = 5$.
Since $r=5$, the train's speed is 5 times the speed of Al and Ben ($v_t = 5v_p$). This ratio is greater than 1, which is necessary for the back of the train to catch up to Ben who is walking in the same direction. The solution is consistent.

The final answer is $\boxed{180}$.",True,1,0
14,"Question: This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?
 Hint: Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers",Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
To find all Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00, set i = 1 and check all values of j.
j = 0, s = 25.17482517, time = 1:00:25.17
j = 1, s = 327.2727273, time = 1:05:27.27

15,"Question: I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?
 Hint: Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,,True,0,0
16,"Question: The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?
 Hint: 1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,,True,0,0

1. 2+2=12
2. 5-3=62
3. 3x4=61
4. 6/3=83

We need to find the value of 1-3 in this system. The hint suggests that this is a variation on the way we do math, not a standard number system base.

Let's analyze the structure of the results. The results are two-digit numbers. Let's assume the result of an operation `a op b` is a two-digit number AB, where A is the tens digit and B is the units digit.

Let's look at the units digit (B) of the results:
1. 2+2=12 -> B=2
2. 5-3=62 -> B=2
3. 3x4=61 -> B=1
4. 6/3=83 -> B=3

Let's examine if the units digit B is related to the operation symbol (+, -, x, /):
- When the operation is '+', B = 2.
- When the operation is '-', B = 2.
- When the operation is 'x', B = 1.
- When the operation is '/', B = 3.

This pattern suggests that the units digit B is determined solely by the operation being performed.
Rule for units digit (B):
- If the operation is '+', B = 2.
- If the operation is '-', B = 2.
- If the operation is 'x', B = 1.
- If the operation is '/', B = 3.

Now, let's look at the tens digit (A) of the results:
1. 2+2=12 -> A=1 (operands a=2, b=2, op=+)
2. 5-3=62 -> A=6 (operands a=5, b=3, op=-)
3. 3x4=61 -> A=6 (operands a=3, b=4, op=x)
4. 6/3=83 -> A=8 (operands a=6, b=3, op=/)

Let's try to find a relationship between the operands (a, b) and the tens digit A, potentially involving the operation.

Let's consider simple combinations of a and b: a+b, a-b, a*b, a/b.
For 2+2=12: a=2, b=2, op=+. a+b=4, a*b=4. A=1.
For 5-3=62: a=5, b=3, op=-. a+b=8, a*b=15. A=6.
For 3x4=61: a=3, b=4, op=x. a+b=7, a*b=12. A=6.
For 6/3=83: a=6, b=3, op=/. a+b=9, a*b=18. A=8.

Let's examine the sum a+b and the resulting A:
- (a,b)=(2,2), a+b=4, A=1.
- (a,b)=(5,3), a+b=8, A=6.
- (a,b)=(3,4), a+b=7, A=6.
- (a,b)=(6,3), a+b=9, A=8.

Let's see if A can be calculated as a+b minus some value that depends on the operation. Let A = a+b - k_op.

The expression must use the digit '2' exactly twice.

Let's analyze the allowed components:
- Digits: '2' (must be used exactly twice).
- Operations/Symbols: exponent (^), minus (-), brackets (()), square root (√), decimal point (.).

We need to combine two 2's using only these operations to obtain the value 5.

Consider the structure of the expression. One way to get 5 is by taking the square root of 25, since √25 = 5. Let's explore if we can construct the number 25 using the two 2's and the allowed operations.

We can use the decimal point with a 2 to form the number 0.2. Using the decimal point before the digit is represented as '.2', which implies 0.2 without using the digit '0'. This uses one of the two allowed '2's and the decimal point.
So, we have .2 (which is 0.2 or 1/5).

Now, we need to use the other '2' and the remaining allowed operations (exponent, minus, brackets, square root) to transform .2 into an expression that evaluates to 25, and then take the square root.

Consider the properties of the number 0.2 (or 1/5).
If we raise 1/5 to the power of -1, we get (1/5)^(-1) = 5.
If we raise 5 to the power of 2, we get 5^2 = 25.

 Hint:  for a hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.

Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.

(Since our answer only needs two dimensions, we will convert them into square (building), circle (open area), and rectangle (corner office).
[The Pythagorean theorem will solve for the root of the radius]
Let a represent the length of the rectangle, then x-a be the radius of the circle minus the length of the rectangle, same to b (to width of the rectangle):
a^2 + b^2 = x^2
(x - a)^2 + (x - b)^2 = x^2

[Use foil to expand the brackets]
x^2 = (x^2 - 16x - 16x + 256) + (x^2 - 8x - 8x + 64)

x = -40    and     x = -8
[Input those numbers into the now factored equation]

If the radius were 8, then that would mean the corner office would end up extending into the circular area (because the corner office is 16 x 8).
Therefore, the diameter of the cylinder or the dimensions of the building must be 40 * 2 (radius x 2) to make 80m x 80m.

----------------------------
log 2
= 46.84 million dollars
80 = 30 + 6 log2 (x + 2)
50 / 6 = log2 (x + 2)
250/6 = (x + 2)
x = 320.54 million dollars.
Therefore: increase in spending = 320.54 - 5 = 315.54 million",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let P(x) be the profit in millions of dollars when x million dollars are spent on research.
The given profit function is P(x) = 30 + 6 log(x+2).

The problem asks how much the company will have to spend on research to increase its profit to 80 million dollars. This means we need to find the value of x such that P(x) = 80.

Set up the equation:
30 + 6 log(x+2) = 80

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
6 log(x+2) = 80 - 30
6 log(x+2) = 50

Divide by 6:
log(x+2) = 50/6
log(x+2) = 25/3

The notation 'log' without a specified base is ambiguous. It can represent the base-10 logarithm (log$_{10}$) or the natural logarithm (log$_e$, often written as ln).

Let's consider both possibilities:

Case 1: Assume the base of the logarithm is 10 (log$_{10}$).
log$_{10}$(x+2) = 25/3
To solve for x+2, we exponentiate both sides with base 10:
x+2 = 10^(25/3)
x = 10^(25/3) - 2

The number 10^(25/3) is equal to 10^(8 + 1/3) = 10^8 * 10^(1/3). This is approximately 100,000,000 * 2.1544 = 215,440,000.
So, x is approximately 215,440,000 - 2 = 215,439,998.
Since x is in millions of dollars (as per the hint), this means the company would have to spend approximately 215,439,998 million dollars, which is over 215 trillion dollars. This is an extremely large and unrealistic amount for research spending to achieve a profit of 80 million dollars.

Case 2: Assume the base of the logarithm is e (natural logarithm, ln). This assumption is common in mathematical modeling contexts where 'log' is sometimes used interchangeably with 'ln', especially in fields related to growth and decay, which can be relevant to profit functions.
ln(x+2) = 25/3
To solve for x+2, we exponentiate both sides with base e:
x+2 = e^(25/3)
x = e^(25/3) - 2

The number e^(25/3) can be calculated numerically. 25/3 is approximately 8.3333. e^(25/3) is approximately 4147.05.
So, x is approximately 4147.05 - 2 = 4145.05.
Since x is in millions of dollars, this means the company would have to spend approximately 4145.05 million dollars, or 4.145 billion dollars. While this is still a large amount, it is significantly more plausible in the context of corporate finance compared to the base-10 result.

Given the ambiguity in the notation 'log' and the wildly different scales of the results, the implausibility of the result from assuming base 10 strongly suggests that the intended base of the logarithm was e.

Therefore, we proceed with the solution obtained assuming the base is e.
The amount of money the company will have to spend on research is x million dollars, where x = e^(25/3) - 2.
The problem asks for the amount of money in millions of dollars. The value of x we found is already in millions of dollars according to the problem statement and hint.

The exact amount the company will have to spend on research is e^(25/3) - 2 million dollars.

The final answer is $\boxed{e^{25/3} - 2}$.",True,0,0

Eileen        15
TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,,True,0,NULL

Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:

First, let's determine the dimensions of the balcony.
The height of the stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The vertical distance from the spotlights to the balcony floor is the height of the stage minus the height of the balcony floor:
Vertical distance = 7m - 4m = 3m.

The spotlight is positioned above the middle of the balcony and shines at a 45-degree angle, covering the entire balcony precisely. This setup creates a right-angled triangle where the vertical side is the distance from the spotlight to the balcony floor's center, the horizontal side is the radius of the balcony floor, and the angle between the vertical side and the light ray to the edge of the balcony is 45 degrees.
In a right-angled triangle with an angle of 45 degrees, the two non-hypotenuse sides are equal in length (as stated in the hint, derived from the properties of an isosceles right triangle).
So, the radius of the balcony floor is equal to the vertical distance from the spotlight to the balcony floor.
Radius (R) = 3m.

To calculate the volume of wood, we need to convert all dimensions to the same unit, preferably centimeters, since the cost is given per cubic centimeter.
1 meter = 100 centimeters.
Radius (R) = 3m = 3 * 100 cm = 300 cm.
Balcony floor thickness = 30 cm.
Fence height = 1m = 1 * 100 cm = 100 cm.
Fence thickness = 10 cm.

Next, let's calculate the volume of wood for the balcony floor.
The balcony is a full circle with radius R and thickness 30cm.
Volume of floor = Area of circle * Thickness
Volume of floor = π * R² * Thickness
Volume of floor = π * (300 cm)² * 30 cm
Volume of floor = π * 90000 cm² * 30 cm
Volume of floor = 2700000π cm³.

Now, let's calculate the volume of wood for the fence.
The fence surrounds the perimeter of the half of the balcony seen by the audience. This is the curved part of the semicircle formed by cutting the full circle in half.
The length of the fence is half the circumference of the full circle.
Circumference of full circle = 2 * π * R = 2 * π * 300 cm = 600π cm.
Length of fence (L) = (1/2) * Circumference = (1/2) * 600π cm = 300π cm.
The fence is solid with a height of 100 cm and a thickness of 10 cm.
Volume of fence = Length * Height * Thickness
Volume of fence = (300π cm) * (100 cm) * (10 cm)
Volume of fence = 300000π cm³.

The total volume of wood required is the sum of the volume of the floor and the volume of the fence.
Total volume = Volume of floor + Volume of fence
Total volume = 2700000π cm³ + 300000π cm³
Total volume = 3000000π cm³.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the wood.
Pine costs $1 per 5000 cm³.
Cost = (Total volume / Volume per dollar) * Price per volume
Cost = (3000000π cm³ / 5000 cm³) * $1
Cost = (3000000π / 5000) * $1
Cost = (3000π / 5) * $1
Cost = 600π * $1
Cost = 600π dollars.

The exact amount of money to spend is 600π dollars.

Final answer: 600π",True,0,0
49,"Question: The game of penultimate frisbee has two scoring moves: the bungee and the wedgie.
Each type of score is worth an odd prime number of points, with a bungee being worth more than a wedgie.  If the largest score that can never be achieved in a game is 95 points (no matter how long the game lasts), how many points is each move worth?
 Hint: If the two moves are worth p and q, the largest score that can not be
achieved by some combination  of bungees and wedgies is p*q-p-q.","If the two moves are worth p and q, the largest score that can not be
achieved by some combination  of bungees and wedgies is p*q-p-q.","The bungee is worth 17 points, and the wedgie is worth 7.
The largest score that can not be achieved by some combination of p and q points, with p relatively prime to q, is p*q-p-q = (p-1)*(q-1)-1.
So 96 must be factorable as (p-1)*(q-1), for odd primes p and q.
Since the prime factorization of 96 = 2^5*3, and each of the two
factors must be even, the possible factorizations are:
2*48
4*24
8*12
16*6
Only the last factorization yields two factors each of which is one less
than an odd prime, so 17 and 7 must be the two primes we seek.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let $p$ be the points awarded for a bungee and $q$ be the points awarded for a wedgie.
According to the problem statement, $p$ and $q$ are odd prime numbers.
Also, a bungee is worth more than a wedgie, so $p > q$.
The total score in a game is a sum of points from bungees and wedgies. If $b$ is the number of bungees and $w$ is the number of wedgies, the total score $S$ is given by $S = bp + wq$, where $b$ and $w$ are non-negative integers ($b \ge 0$, $w \ge 0$).

The problem states that the largest score that can never be achieved is 95 points.
The hint provides a formula for the largest score that cannot be achieved by a combination $bp + wq$ for non-negative integers $b$ and $w$. If $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers, this largest unattainable score is $pq - p - q$.

Since $p$ and $q$ are distinct prime numbers ($p > q$), they are relatively prime, i.e., $\gcd(p, q) = 1$. Thus, the hint is applicable.
We are given that the largest unattainable score is 95. Therefore, we have the equation:
$pq - p - q = 95$

We need to find odd prime numbers $p$ and $q$ that satisfy this equation and the condition $p > q$.
Let's rearrange the equation:
$pq - p - q - 95 = 0$
We can add 1 to both sides to factor the expression:
$pq - p - q + 1 = 95 + 1$
$(p - 1)(q - 1) = 96$

Let $P = p - 1$ and $Q = q - 1$. So, $PQ = 96$.
Since $p$ and $q$ are odd prime numbers, the smallest odd prime is 3.
Thus, $p \ge 3$ and $q \ge 3$.
This implies $p - 1 \ge 2$ and $q - 1 \ge 2$. So, $P \ge 2$ and $Q \ge 2$.
Also, since $p$ and $q$ are odd numbers, $p - 1$ and $q - 1$ must be even numbers.
So, $P$ and $Q$ are even integers greater than or equal to 2.
The condition $p > q$ implies $p - 1 > q - 1$, so $P > Q$.

We need to find pairs of even factors $(P, Q)$ of 96 such that $P > Q \ge 2$.
The factors of 96 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 96.
We list pairs of even factors $(P, Q)$ of 96 such that $P > Q \ge 2$:
1. If $Q = 2$, $P = 96 / 2 = 48$. This gives the pair $(48, 2)$. $P=48$ is even, $Q=2$ is even, $P > Q$, $Q \ge 2$. This is a valid pair for $(P, Q)$.
2. If $Q = 4$, $P = 96 / 4 = 24$. This gives the pair $(24, 4)$. $P=24$ is even, $Q=4$ is even, $P > Q$, $Q \ge 2$. This is a valid pair for $(P, Q)$.
3. If $Q = 6$, $P = 96 / 6 = 16$. This gives the pair $(16, 6)$. $P=16$ is even, $Q=6$ is even, $P > Q$, $Q \ge 2$. This is a valid pair for $(P, Q)$.
4. If $Q = 8$, $P = 96 / 8 = 12$. This gives the pair $(12, 8)$. $P=12$ is even, $Q=8$ is even, $P > Q$, $Q \ge 2$. This is a valid pair for $(P, Q)$.
The next even factor greater than 8 is 12. If $Q=12$, $P = 96/12 = 8$, but we require $P > Q$, so this case is not valid, nor are any subsequent cases where $Q$ is larger.

Now we need to find the corresponding values of $p = P + 1$ and $q = Q + 1$ for each valid pair $(P, Q)$ and check if $p$ and $q$ are odd prime numbers.

Case 1: $(P, Q) = (48, 2)$
$p = P + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49$
$q = Q + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$
Is $p=49$ an odd prime number? No, $49 = 7^2$. So this case is not valid.

Case 2: $(P, Q) = (24, 4)$
$p = P + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25$
$q = Q + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5$
Is $p=25$ an odd prime number? No, $25 = 5^2$. So this case is not valid.

Case 3: $(P, Q) = (16, 6)$
$p = P + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17$
$q = Q + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7$
Is $p=17$ an odd prime number? Yes, 17 is a prime number.
Is $q=7$ an odd prime number? Yes, 7 is a prime number.
Does $p > q$? $17 > 7$. Yes.
This pair $(p, q) = (17, 7)$ satisfies all the conditions. Let's verify the largest unattainable score: $pq - p - q = 17 \times 7 - 17 - 7 = 119 - 17 - 7 = 119 - 24 = 95$. This matches the given information.

Case 4: $(P, Q) = (12, 8)$
$p = P + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13$
$q = Q + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9$
Is $p=13$ an odd prime number? Yes, 13 is a prime number.
Is $q=9$ an odd prime number? No, $9 = 3^2$. So this case is not valid.

The only pair of odd prime numbers $(p, q)$ satisfying the conditions is $(17, 7)$.
We are given that a bungee is worth more than a wedgie, so the points for a bungee are $p$ and the points for a wedgie are $q$.
Bungee points = 17.
Wedgie points = 7.

The question asks how many points each move is worth.
The bungee is worth 17 points.
The wedgie is worth 7 points.

The final answer is $\boxed{Bungee: 17 points, Wedgie: 7 points}$.",True,1,0

The number of rings to be fit in this vacancy, R, is determined from the formula
R < (n - 1)*pi
where n is the nth times the diameter and R is an integer.
This formula is derived from the fact that the circumference of a polygon with R sides (made up by connecting all the nucleus of the rings in the donut area) is always smaller (actually is inscribed in) than the locus of the donut area. This locus is, of course, neither the donut's outer nor inner ring, but the one in between those two.

How tall is this pyramid?
 Hint: You might want to start at the top.",You might want to start at the top.,"It is 7 feet tall.
The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3. Because a second tier will not change any of the angles involved, new triangles will be similar to old and all changes in measurement of length will be proportional. A pyramid 2 tiers tall would have v2 = ( 2*b * 2*b * 2 ) / 3 = 8*v1. For 3 tiers, v3 = ( 3*b * 3*b * 3 ) / 3 = 27*v1. It becomes clear that a cube number must be a factor of the number of blocks.
1029 = 3 * 7^3, so there are 7 tiers. (The peak being formed by 3 separate blocks, every tier has 3 times as many blocks as in the supposition. Because 7 is a prime number, there is no smaller number of tiers which would satisfy the question.)",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,,True,0,0

Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).
Thus we get b = 11664/216 = 54.

Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.

64,"Question: The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with ""rock"", 2 points with ""scissors"", and 1 point with ""paper"".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one ""throw"", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.
The players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.
Knowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?
 Hint: (1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.
(2) This is a ""zero-sum"" game: what one player wins, the other loses.
(3) The game is ""symmetric"": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.
(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.

(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"To find the best strategy for maintaining your balance of chips, we can model this problem as a two-player zero-sum game. The ""best strategy"" in this context, especially when knowing nothing about the opponents and playing against different opponents each minute, is the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. In a zero-sum game, the Nash equilibrium strategy is also the maximin strategy, which guarantees the highest possible minimum expected payoff. For a symmetric zero-sum game, the expected payoff at equilibrium is zero, which corresponds to maintaining the chip balance over the long run.

Let our strategy be a probability distribution (r, p, s), where r is the probability of playing Rock, p is the probability of playing Paper, and s is the probability of playing Scissors, with r + p + s = 1 and r, p, s >= 0.

The payoffs from our perspective (Player A) when playing against an opponent (Player B) are given by the rules. Let's construct the payoff matrix, where the entries represent the chip change for Player A:

| A vs B | Rock (r_B) | Paper (p_B) | Scissors (s_B) |
|--------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| Rock (r) | 0          | -1          | +3             |
| Paper (p)| +1         | 0           | -2             |
| Scissors (s)| -3         | +2          | 0              |

For example, if we play Rock and the opponent plays Paper, we lose 1 chip (Paper beats Rock, winner gets 1 chip). If we play Rock and the opponent plays Scissors, we win 3 chips (Rock beats Scissors, winner gets 3 chips).

In a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of a symmetric zero-sum game, both players play the same strategy (r, p, s), and the expected payoff for each player is zero. For a player to be willing to play a mixed strategy involving Rock, Paper, and Scissors with non-zero probabilities, the expected payoff from choosing each of these pure strategies against the opponent's mixed strategy must be equal. Since the equilibrium expected payoff is 0, the expected payoff from each pure strategy must be 0.

Let E_R, E_P, and E_S be our expected payoffs from playing Rock, Paper, and Scissors, respectively, against an opponent who also plays the strategy (r, p, s).

E_R = r * 0 + p * (-1) + s * 3 = -p + 3s
E_P = r * 1 + p * 0 + s * (-2) = r - 2s
E_S = r * (-3) + p * 2 + s * 0 = -3r + 2p

At the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, E_R = E_P = E_S = 0.
This gives us a system of linear equations:
1) -p + 3s = 0  => p = 3s
2) r - 2s = 0   => r = 2s
3) -3r + 2p = 0

Let's check if the third equation is consistent with the first two. Substitute r = 2s and p = 3s into the third equation: -3(2s) + 2(3s) = -6s + 6s = 0. The equations are consistent.

We also have the constraint that the probabilities must sum to 1:
r + p + s = 1

Substitute the expressions for r and p in terms of s into this equation:
(2s) + (3s) + s = 1
6s = 1
s = 1/6

Now we can find r and p:
r = 2s = 2 * (1/6) = 2/6 = 1/3
p = 3s = 3 * (1/6) = 3/6 = 1/2

So, the mixed strategy is to play Rock with probability 1/3, Paper with probability 1/2, and Scissors with probability 1/6.

Let's verify that this strategy yields an expected payoff of 0 against any pure strategy of the opponent.
Suppose the opponent plays Rock (r_B=1, p_B=0, s_B=0). Our expected payoff is (1/3)*0 + (1/2)*1 + (1/6)*(-3) = 0 + 1/2 - 3/6 = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0.
Suppose the opponent plays Paper (r_B=0, p_B=1, s_B=0). Our expected payoff is (1/3)*(-1) + (1/2)*0 + (1/6)*2 = -1/3 + 0 + 2/6 = -1/3 + 1/3 = 0.
Suppose the opponent plays Scissors (r_B=0, p_B=0, s_B=1). Our expected payoff is (1/3)*3 + (1/2)*(-2) + (1/6)*0 = 3/3 - 2/2 + 0 = 1 - 1 = 0.

Since the expected payoff is 0 against any pure strategy, the expected payoff against any mixed strategy is also 0. This strategy guarantees that, on average, your chip balance will remain constant over time, regardless of how your opponents play. This is the best strategy for maintaining your balance of chips.

The probabilities (1/3, 1/2, 1/6) define the required mixture of Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

The final answer is $\boxed{Rock: 1/3, Paper: 1/2, Scissors: 1/6}$.",True,1,0
65,"Question: The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.

A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.

 Hint: Solve for their distance travelled at appropriate time increments",Solve for their distance travelled at appropriate time increments,"Jack will win the race and it will take an additional half minute to catch up with him.
Jacks moves 0.8 meters vertically in each step movement:
According to Pythagoras theorem for right angled triangle:

C = 0.8 m
Jill moves 1 meter vertically in each hop.

""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""

Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity.

We are given that 11 stone = 1 lump and 11 lumps = 1 mass.
Therefore, 1 mass = 11 lumps = 11 * (11 stone) = 121 stone.
The required range of weights to be measured is from 1 stone to 1 mass, which is from 1 stone to 121 stone, inclusive. We need to be able to measure any integer weight $W$ where $1 \le W \le 121$.

We are using a set of scales, which means we can place weights on either pan of the balance. If the item to be weighed, with weight $W$, is placed on one pan, we can achieve balance by placing a combination of our available weights on the other pan, or by placing some weights on the same pan as the item and others on the opposite pan.
Let the set of weights be $\{w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n\}$. To measure a weight $W$, we need to find coefficients $c_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ such that $W = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i w_i$. A coefficient $c_i = 1$ means the weight $w_i$ is placed on the pan opposite the item. A coefficient $c_i = -1$ means the weight $w_i$ is placed on the same pan as the item. A coefficient $c_i = 0$ means the weight $w_i$ is not used.

The range of integer weights that can be measured with a set of weights $\{w_1, \dots, w_n\}$ using coefficients $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ spans from $-\sum w_i$ to $\sum w_i$. Specifically, any integer weight $W$ that can be expressed in the form $\sum_{i=1}^n c_i w_i$ with $c_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ is measurable.
To be able to measure every integer weight from 1 up to some maximum value $M$, the set of measurable weights must include all integers from 1 to $M$. The total number of distinct non-zero sums $\sum c_i w_i$ possible is at most $3^n - 1$ (excluding the sum where all $c_i=0$). Since if a sum $S$ is possible, then $-S$ is also possible by flipping all the signs, the number of distinct positive sums is at most $(3^n-1)/2$.
To be able to measure all integer weights from 1 to 121, the number of distinct positive measurable weights must be at least 121.
Thus, we must have $(3^n-1)/2 \ge 121$.
$3^n - 1 \ge 242$
$3^n \ge 243$.

We need to find the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies this inequality. Let's calculate powers of 3:
$3^1 = 3$
$3^2 = 9$
$3^3 = 27$
$3^4 = 81$
$3^5 = 243$
The smallest integer $n$ such that $3^n \ge 243$ is $n=5$.
Therefore, the minimum number of weights required is at least 5.

Now we need to find a set of 5 weights that can measure any integer weight from 1 to 121. It is a known result in weighing problems that the optimal set of weights for a balance scale to measure consecutive integers are powers of 3. With $n$ weights $\{3^0, 3^1, \dots, 3^{n-1}\}$, any integer $N$ such that $-\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 3^i \le N \le \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 3^i$ can be uniquely represented in the form $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i 3^i$ with $c_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$. This is the balanced ternary representation of $N$.
The maximum positive weight measurable with weights $\{3^0, 3^1, \dots, 3^{n-1}\}$ is the sum of all weights:
$S_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 3^i = \frac{3^n-1}{3-1} = \frac{3^n-1}{2}$.

With $n=5$, the weights are $\{3^0, 3^1, 3^2, 3^3, 3^4\} = \{1, 3, 9, 27, 81\}$.
The maximum weight measurable with these weights is $S_5 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = \frac{3^5-1}{2} = \frac{243-1}{2} = \frac{242}{2} = 121$.
Since any integer from $-121$ to $121$ can be represented in balanced ternary using these weights, any integer weight from 1 to 121 stone can be measured by placing the item on one pan and the appropriate combination of weights on either pan according to the balanced ternary representation.

For example, to weigh 50 stone:
We find the balanced ternary representation of 50:
$50 = 1 \cdot 81 - 1 \cdot 27 + 0 \cdot 9 - 1 \cdot 3 - 1 \cdot 1$.
$50 = 81 - 27 - 3 - 1$.
This means placing the 81 stone weight on one pan and the 50 stone item along with the 27, 3, and 1 stone weights",True,1,0

77,"Question: I always remember the days when I was at high school, whiling away my time with my friends. Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.
Considering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?
He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.
 Hint: divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.",divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.,"Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24
This is for 12 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =
24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.
Now let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.
Here H can take values from 0 to 23.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 0 to 7 i.e., 8 values, for H = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21.

This is basically 50% * 50% * 50% * 50% * 50% = 3.125% chance of losing.
Don't do this in a real casino, because with weighted-value, in the one situation you lose, you lose all your money!",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let $A_0$ be the initial amount of money, which is $A_0 = 6.20$.
We are making exactly 5 bets in a game where the chance of winning is 50-50.
Let the amount bet on each game be $B$.
If the player wins a bet, their money increases by $B$. If the player loses a bet, their money decreases by $B$.
Let $n_w$ be the number of wins and $n_l$ be the number of losses in the 5 bets.
The total number of bets is 5, so $n_w + n_l = 5$.
The net change in the player's money after 5 bets is the total amount won minus the total amount lost. Assuming the amount won equals the amount lost per bet (which is typical for a 50-50 chance game unless specified otherwise, and is necessary to set up the equation for net gain), the net change is $n_w B - n_l B = (n_w - n_l)B$.
We are asked for the chances of winning $0.20$. This means the net gain is $0.20$.
So, $(n_w - n_l)B = 0.20$.

We have a system of two equations:
1) $n_w + n_l = 5$
2) $(n_w - n_l)B = 0.20$

From equation (1), we can express $n_l$ as $n_l = 5 - n_w$.
Substitute this into equation (2):
$(n_w - (5 - n_w))B = 0.20$
$(2n_w - 5)B = 0.20$.

Since $n_w$ must be an integer representing the number of wins in 5 bets, the possible values for $n_w$ are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Since the net gain is positive ($0.20$), and the bet amount $B$ must be positive, the factor $(2n_w - 5)$ must be positive.
$2n_w - 5 > 0 \implies 2n_w > 5 \implies n_w > 2.5$.
So, the possible integer values for $n_w$ are 3, 4, 5.

Let's consider these possibilities for $n_w$:
Case 1: $n_w = 3$. Then $n_l = 5 - 3 = 2$. The condition becomes $(3 - 2)B = 0.20 \implies 1 \cdot B = 0.20 \implies B = 0.20$.
Case 2: $n_w = 4$. Then $n_l = 5 - 4 = 1$. The condition becomes $(4 - 1)B = 0.20 \implies 3B = 0.20 \implies B = 0.20/3$.
Case 3: $n_w = 5$. Then $n_l = 5 - 5 = 0$. The condition becomes $(5 - 0)B = 0.20 \implies 5B = 0.20 \implies B = 0.04$.

The problem asks for ""your chances"", implying a unique probability. This suggests that there is a specific bet amount $B$ that is intended. The most natural interpretation, given the target winning amount is $0.20, is that the bet amount for each game is $0.20$. This interpretation makes the required difference between wins and losses equal to 1 ($n_w - n_l = 1$).

Assuming the bet amount is $B = 0.20$:
The condition for winning $0.20$ is $n_w - n_l = 1$.
Combined with $n_w + n_l = 5$, we solve for $n_w$ and $n_l$.
Adding the two equations: $(n_w + n_l) + (n_w - n_l) = 5 + 1 \implies 2n_w = 6 \implies n_w = 3$.
Substituting $n_w = 3$ into $n_w + n_l = 5$, we get $3 + n_l = 5 \implies n_l = 2$.
So, to win exactly $0.20$ with a bet amount of $0.20, the player must win exactly 3 out of the 5 bets and lose exactly 2 bets.

The outcome of each bet is independent, with a probability of winning $P(W) = 0.5$ and a probability of losing $P(L) = 0.5$.
We need to find the probability of getting exactly 3 wins in 5 independent trials. This is a binomial probability problem.
The number of trials is $n = 5$.
The number of successful outcomes (wins) is $k = 3$.
The probability of success on a single trial is $p = 0.5$.
The probability of failure on a single trial is $q = 1 - p = 0.5$.

The probability of getting exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials is given by the binomial probability formula: $P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$.

This often refers to properties related to the number 9, particularly concerning digits, digital sums, divisibility, or operations like casting out nines or 9's complement.

Let's examine the given numbers, 567 and 854, in relation to the number 9.

Consider the digital sum of each number:
For 567: $5 + 6 + 7 = 18$. Since 18 is divisible by 9, 567 is divisible by 9.
For 854: $8 + 5 + 4 = 17$. Since 17 is not divisible by 9, 854 is not divisible by 9.
One connection could be that one number is a multiple of 9 and the other is not. However, the phrase ""magic of 9"" often implies a more intricate property.

Consider the digital root of each number:
For 567: The digital sum is 18, and $1 + 8 = 9$. The digital root is 9.
For 854: The digital sum is 17, and $1 + 7 = 8$. The digital root is 8.
This indicates that 567 leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 9 (since its digital root is 9 or 0), and 854 leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 9 (since its digital root is 8). This is a property of each number individually, not a direct connection between them, other than stating their remainders modulo 9.

Let's explore the concept of the 9's complement, which is a common topic related to the ""magic of 9"". For a number with a fixed number of digits, the 9's complement is obtained by subtracting each digit from 9. For a three-digit number $N = 100a + 10b + c$, the digit-wise 9's complement forms the number $N' = 100(9-a) + 10(9-b) + (9-c)$.

Let's find the digit-wise 9's complement for 567:
The digits are 5, 6, and 7.
Subtracting each digit from 9 gives:

$9 - 6 = 3$

c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2

 Hint: nan",,"This is a bit tricky and I initially thought the answer was 1/16 or 6.2% but it is really 2/7 or 28.6%.
Either drawing '2 2 2' or some combination of '1 2 3' adds up to be 6. The chances of getting '2 2 2' are 5/16 (5 2s out of 16) times 4/15 (4 2s left out of 15) times 3/14 (3 2s left out of 14). This is 5/16 * 4/15 * 3/14 which equals 1/56.
The chances of getting some combination of '1 2 3' is equal to 6/16 (6 1s in the list) times 5/15 (5 2s out of 15 numbers left) times 5/14 (5 3s out of 14 numbers left) times the number of different combinations of '1 2 3' which is 6. This is 6/16 * 5/15 * 5/14 * 6 which equals 15/56.
1/56 + 15/56 = 16/56 or 2/7 or ~28.6%.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"The given set of sixteen numbers is:
1, 2, 3, 1,
2, 3, 1, 2,
3, 1, 2, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1.

Let's count the frequency of each distinct number in this set of sixteen numbers:
Number 1 appears 6 times.
Number 2 appears 5 times.
Number 3 appears 5 times.
The total number of numbers is 6 + 5 + 5 = 16.

We are asked to find the chances (probability) that when three of these sixteen numbers are drawn at random, their sum equals six. We assume that the three numbers are drawn without replacement and that the order of drawing does not matter, which means we are considering combinations of 3 numbers from the 16.

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 numbers from the 16 numbers. This is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.
Total number of ways to choose 3 numbers from 16 is C(16, 3).
C(16, 3) = 16! / (3! * (16-3)!) = 16! / (3! * 13!) = (16 * 15 * 14) / (3 * 2 * 1) = (16 * 15 * 14) / 6.
C(16, 3) = (16/2) * (15/3) * (14/1) = 8 * 5 * 14 = 40 * 14 = 560.
So, there are 560 total possible combinations of three numbers that can be drawn from the set of sixteen numbers.

Next, we need to find the number of combinations of three numbers from the given set that sum to 6. The numbers available in the set are 1, 2, and 3. We need to find sets of three numbers {a, b, c} such that a + b + c = 6, where a, b, and c are chosen from the available numbers. The possible combinations of three positive integers that sum to 6 are {1, 2, 3} and {2, 2, 2}. We need to count how many ways these combinations can be formed using the numbers from the given set, considering the frequencies of each number.

Case 1: The three numbers drawn are {1, 2, 3}.
To form this combination, we need to choose one number with the value 1, one number with the value 2, and one number with the value 3.
There are 6 numbers with the value 1. The number of ways to choose one 1 is C(6, 1) = 6.
There are 5 numbers with the value 2. The number of ways to choose one 2 is C(5, 1) = 5.
There are 5 numbers with the value 3. The number of ways to choose one 3 is C(5, 1) = 5.
The number of ways to choose one 1, one 2, and one 3 is the product of the number of ways to choose each:
Number of ways for Case 1 = C(6, 1) * C(5, 1) * C(5, 1) = 6 * 5 * 5 = 150.

Case 2: The three numbers drawn are {2, 2, 2}.
To form this combination, we need to choose three numbers with the value 2.
There are 5 numbers with the value 2. The number of ways to choose three 2s from five 2s is C(5, 3).
C(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 5! / (3! * 2!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1)) = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1) = 20 / 2 = 10.
Number of ways for Case 2 = 10.

The total number of favorable combinations (where the sum of the three numbers is 6) is the sum of the number of ways for Case 1 and Case 2.
Total number of favorable combinations = 150 + 10 = 160.

The probability of drawing three numbers whose sum is six is the ratio of the number of favorable combinations to the total number of combinations.
Probability = (Total number of favorable combinations) / (Total number of combinations) = 160 / 560.

Now, simplify the fraction 160/560.
160/560 = 16/56.
Both 16 and 56 are divisible by their greatest common divisor, which is 8.
16 ÷ 8 = 2.
56 ÷ 8 = 7.
So, the simplified fraction is 2/7.

The chances that three numbers will be drawn whose sum equals six is 2/7.

The final answer is $\boxed{2/7}$.",True,1,0

According to the problem statement, the essay was more than 1000 pages but less than 10,000 pages. So, $1000 < N < 10000$.

Let $D(N)$ be the total number of digits used to number the pages from 1 to $N$.
We need to calculate $D(N)$ for $N$ in the range $1000 < N < 10000$.
The pages are numbered sequentially starting from 1.
Pages 1 through 9 are single-digit numbers. There are 9 such pages, using $9 \times 1 = 9$ digits.
Pages 10 through 99 are two-digit numbers. There are $99 - 10 + 1 = 90$ such pages, using $90 \times 2 = 180$ digits.
Pages 100 through 999 are three-digit numbers. There are $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$ such pages, using $900 \times 3 = 2700$ digits.
The total number of digits used for pages 1 to 999 is $9 + 180 + 2700 = 2889$.

Since $N > 1000$, the essay includes pages numbered with four digits. These pages start from 1000.
The pages from 1000 up to $N$ are four-digit numbers. The number of such pages is $N - 1000 + 1 = N - 999$.
Each of these pages uses 4 digits. The total number of digits used for these pages is $4 \times (N - 999)$.

The total number of digits $D(N)$ is the sum of the digits used for pages 1-999 and the digits used for pages 1000-N.
$D(N) = (\text{digits for 1-999}) + (\text{digits for 1000-N})$
$D(N) = 2889 + 4(N - 999)$
$D(N) = 2889 + 4N - 3996$
$D(N) = 4N - 1107$.
This formula is valid for $N \ge 1000$. Since $1000 < N < 10000$, this formula is applicable.

The problem states that the number of digits used, $D(N)$, was a multiple of the number of actual pages, $N$.
This means $D(N) = kN$ for some integer $k$.
Substituting the expression for $D(N)$:
$4N - 1107 = kN$
We can rearrange this equation to find information about $N$:
$1107 = 4N - kN$
$1107 = N(4-k)$

This equation implies that $N$ must be a divisor of 1107. Also, $4-k$ must be an integer, which is true if $k$ is an integer.
We need to find the divisors of 1107. Let's find the prime factorization of 1107.
Sum of digits of 1107 is $1+1+0+7=9$, which is divisible by 3, so 1107 is divisible by 3.
$1107 \div 3 = 369$.
Sum of digits of 369 is $3+6+9=18$, which is divisible by 3, so 369 is divisible by 3.
$369 \div 3 = 123$.
Sum of digits of 123 is $1+2+3=6$, which is divisible by 3, so 123 is divisible by 3.
$123 \div 3 = 41$.
41 is a prime number.
So, the prime factorization of 1107 is $3^3 \times 41^1$.

The divisors of 1107 are found by taking combinations of the prime factors:
$3^0 \times 41^0 = 1$
$3^1 \times 41^0 = 3$
$3^2 \times 41^0 = 9$
$3^3 \times 41^0 = 27$
$3^0 \times 41^1 = 41$
$3^1 \times 41^1 = 123$
$3^2 \times 41^1 = 369$
$3^3 \times 41^1 = 1107$
The divisors of 1107 are 1, 3, 9, 27, 41, 123, 369, and 1107.

The problem states that the number of pages $N$ is in the range $1000 < N < 10000$.
We need to find which of the divisors of 1107 fall within this range.
Comparing the list of divisors with the range condition:
1 is not in the range.
3 is not in the range.
9 is not in the range.
27 is not in the range.
41 is not in the range.
123 is not in the range.
369 is not in the range.
1107 is in the range ($1000 < 1107 < 10000$).

The only divisor of 1107 that satisfies the condition $1000 < N < 10000$ is $N=1107$.

Let's verify this solution.
If $N=1107$, the number of digits used is $D(1107) = 4(1107) - 1107 = 3 \times 1107 = 3321$.
The number of pages is $N=1107$.
Is $D(N)$ a multiple of $N$?
$3321 \div 1107 = 3$.
Since 3 is an integer, $D(1107)$ is indeed a multiple of $N=1107$. The integer $k$ is 3.
The condition $1000 < N < 10000$ is also satisfied since $1000 < 1107 < 10000$.

The hint suggests observing the number of digits for 1000 pages and thinking about the ratio between digits and pages.
For $N=1000$, $D(1000) = 2889 + 4 = 2893$. The ratio $D(1000)/1000 = 2893/1000 = 2.893$.
For $N$ in the range $1000 < N < 10000$, the ratio is $D(N)/N = (4N - 1107)/N = 4 - 1107/N$.
This ratio must be a whole number $k$. So $k = 4 - 1107/N$.
Since $1000 < N < 10000$, we can find the range of the ratio $k$.
$1/10000 < 1/N < 1/1000$ (Note: strict inequality is important).
Multiplying by 1107:
$1107/10000 < 1107/N < 1107/1000$
$0.1107 < 1107/N < 1.107$
Now consider $k = 4 - 1107/N$. Subtracting the inequality from 4 and reversing the signs:
$4 - 1.107 < 4 - 1107/N < 4 - 0.1107$
$2.893 < k < 3.8893$
Since $k$ must be a whole number (integer), the only possible integer value for $k$ in the range $(2.893, 3.8893)$ is $k=3$.
So, $k=3$.
Substituting this back into the equation $k = 4 - 1107/N$:
$3 = 4 - 1107/N$
$1107/N = 4 - 3$
$1107/N = 1$
$N = 1107$.
This result is consistent with the divisor method and fully incorporates the hint.

The number of pages the essay contained is 1107.

The final answer is $\boxed{1107}$.",True,1,0

We are told that &$ is a double-digit number. This means &$ is an integer between 10 and 99 inclusive. The symbol & represents the tens digit of &$ and $ represents the units digit of &$. So, &$ = 10 * & + $.
Since & is a digit from 1 to 9, & cannot be 0. The hint confirms this and states that & = 1.

Given & = 1, the set of available digits for the other symbols { \, >, $, ^, %, ?, @, # } is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, as & uses the digit 1.
The value of &$ is 10 * 1 + $ = 10 + $. Since &$ is a double-digit number and $ is a digit from 1 to 9, &$ must be a number between 10 + 1 = 11 and 10 + 9 = 19. So, &$ is a number from the set {11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}.

Let's use equation 6: # * $ = &$ = 10 + $.
We can rearrange this equation as # * $ - $ = 10, which factors as $ * (# - 1) = 10.
Since $ and # are distinct digits from {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, $ must be one of these values, and # must be one of these values, different from $. # - 1 must be an integer between 2 - 1 = 1 and 9 - 1 = 8. $ must be an integer from 2 to 9.

We are looking for two factors of 10, $ and (# - 1), such that $ is in {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and # - 1 is in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. The factors of 10 are (1, 10), (2, 5), (5, 2).

Case 1: $ = 1$. This is not possible because $ must be from {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. (Also, & = 1 and symbols are distinct).

If $ = 2$, then &$ = 10 + $ = 10 + 2 = 12.

From \ + ^ = 11, possible pairs (\, ^) from {3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9} are (3, 8), (8, 3), (4, 7), (7, 4).
From ? + ^ = 6, possible pairs (?, ^) from {3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9} are tricky because 6 is a small sum for digits from this set.
If ^ = 3, ? = 3 (not distinct).
If ^ = 4, ? = 2 (2 is used by $).
If ^ = 5, ? = 1 (1 is used by &).
If ^ is 7, 8, or 9, ? becomes negative, which is not possible for a digit.
Thus, there are no possible values for ? and ^ from the remaining digits {3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9} that satisfy ? + ^ = 6.
So, the case $ = 2$ does not lead to a valid solution.

Case 3: $ = 5$. Then # - 1 = 2, which means # = 3.

Possible (?, ^) pairs: (4, 8) and (8, 4).

Now we look for a common value for ^ in both sets of pairs.
If ^ = 8:
From \ + ^ = 14, \ = 14 - 8 = 6. This is in {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} and is distinct from ^ (8).
From ? + ^ = 12, ? = 12 - 8 = 4. This is in {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} and is distinct from ^ (8).
So, ^ = 8, \ = 6, ? = 4 is a possible assignment. Let's check if these digits {8, 6, 4} are distinct from the already used digits {1, 5, 3}. Yes, they are.
Used digits so far: {1, 5, 3, 8, 6, 4}.

> = 9 is in the set {2, 7, 9}. This is possible.
Used digits: {1, 5, 3, 8, 6, 4, 9}.
Remaining available digits for { %, @ } are {2, 7}.

2) ^ + % = 15 => 8 + % = 15 => % = 7.
% = 7 is in the set {2, 7}. This is possible.
Used digits: {1, 5, 3, 8, 6, 4, 9, 7}.
Remaining available digit for { @ } is {2}. So @ must be 2.

3) ? + > + @ = 15. Let's check if this is consistent.
We have ? = 4, > = 9, @ = 2.
4 + 9 + 2 = 13 + 2 = 15. This equation is satisfied.

Let's verify the assignments:
& = 1, $ = 5, # = 3, ^ = 8, \ = 6, ? = 4, > = 9, % = 7, @ = 2.
Used digits: {1, 5, 3, 8, 6, 4, 9, 7, 2}. This set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. All symbols represent distinct digits from 1 to 9.

Let's check all equations:
&$ = 10 + $ = 10 + 5 = 15.
1) \ + > = 6 + 9 = 15. (Correct)
2) ^ + % = 8 + 7 = 15. (Correct)
3) ? + > + @ = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15. (Correct)
4) \ + ^ + & = 6 + 8 + 1 = 15. (Correct)
5) # + ? + ^ = 3 + 4 + 8 = 15. (Correct)
6) # * $ = 3 * 5 = 15. (Correct)

All equations are satisfied and all conditions are met.

Let's consider the other possibility for ^ from the sets of pairs:
If ^ = 4:
From \ + ^ = 14, \ = 14 - 4 = 10. Not possible as \ must be a single digit.

So, the only possible assignment of digits to symbols is the one found.

The solution is:
\ = 6
> = 9
& = 1
$ = 5
^ = 8
% = 7
? = 4
@ = 2
# = 3

The final answer is $\backslash = 6, > = 9, \& = 1, \$ = 5, \textasciicircum} = 8, \% = 7, ? = 4, @ = 2, \# = 3$.

The final answer is $\backslash = 6, > = 9, \& = 1, \$ = 5, \textasciicircum} = 8, \% = 7, ? = 4, @ = 2, \# = 3$.

Final check on the question asked. It asks to ""Solve"". This implies finding the value for each symbol.

Final Answer Derivation:
From the hint, & = 1.
&$ is a double digit number, so &$ = 10 + $.
The digits are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. & = 1, so remaining digits are {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
From # * $ = 10 + $, we derived $ * (# - 1) = 10$.
Possible pairs for ($ , # - 1$) from the remaining digits ({2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} for $ and {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} for # - 1):
- $ = 2$, # - 1 = 5 => # = 6. Used digits {1, 2, 6}. Remaining {3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}. &$ = 12.
  Equations: \ + > = 12, ^ + % = 12, ? + > + @ = 12, \ + ^ = 11, 6 + ? + ^ = 12 => ? + ^ = 6.
  Pairs for \ + ^ = 11 from {3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}: (3, 8), (8, 3), (4, 7), (7, 4).
  Pairs for ? + ^ = 6 from {3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}: No pairs exist where both digits are from this set and distinct. (e.g., 3+3 not distinct, 4+2 (2 used), 5+1 (1 used)). Case $ = 2$ is invalid.
- $ = 5$, # - 1 = 2 => # = 3. Used digits {1, 5, 3}. Remaining {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}. &$ = 15.
  Equations: \ + > = 15, ^ + % = 15, ? + > + @ = 15, \ + ^ = 14, 3 + ? + ^ = 15 => ? + ^ = 12.
  Pairs for \ + ^ = 14 from {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}: (6, 8), (8, 6).
  Pairs for ? + ^ = 12 from {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}: (4, 8), (8, 4).
  The common value for ^ is 8.
  If ^ = 8: \ = 14 - 8 = 6. ? = 12 - 8 = 4.
  So, ^ = 8, \ = 6, ? = 4. These are distinct digits from {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
  Used digits {1, 5, 3, 8, 6, 4}. Remaining digits {2, 7, 9}.
  \ + > = 15 => 6 + > = 15 => > = 9. > = 9 is in {2, 7, 9}. Used {1, 5, 3, 8, 6, 4, 9}. Remaining {2, 7}.
  ^ + % = 15 => 8 + % = 15 => % = 7. % = 7 is in {2, 7}. Used {1, 5, 3, 8, 6, 4, 9, 7}. Remaining {2}.
  The last remaining digit must be @ = 2. Check the equation ? + > + @ = 15: 4 + 9 + 2 = 15. Correct.
All symbols have been assigned a unique digit from 1-9.

\ = 6
> = 9
& = 1
$ = 5

% = 7
? = 4

How many natural numbers less than a googol are both the square of a square and the cube of a cube?

 Hint: Represent any such numbers as N^y where y is some positive real number",Represent any such numbers as N^y where y is some positive real number,"599
The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.
The 36th root of a googol is
(10^100)^(1/36) = 10^(100/36) = 10^(2.77777...) ~ 599.48
so 599 is the largest integer N such that N^36 < 10^100.

92,"Question: You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?
(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)

(2): m > l > x > s
(3): 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650, divided by 25 gives...
(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186
(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186
Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.
The solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10. This is a total of 35 slushes, and therefore 35 coupons given out. 35 * $0.75 = $26.25 in losses from the coupons. $46.50 - $26.25 = $20.25 net profit when accounting for the coupons. You made your goal!",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Here is the solution, following the required steps and justification:

First, we need to determine the profit made on each size of slush. The problem provides the selling price, cup cost, and ingredient cost per ounce. The ingredient cost per ounce is $0.06.

The sizes are:
Small (S): 12 oz, Price $1.50, Cup $0.03
Medium (M): 20 oz, Price $2.25, Cup $0.05
Large (L): 32 oz, Price $3.75, Cup $0.08
X-Large (XL): 40 oz, Price $4.50, Cup $0.10

Calculate the ingredient cost for each size:
Small: 12 oz * $0.06/oz = $0.72
Medium: 20 oz * $0.06/oz = $1.20
Large: 32 oz * $0.06/oz = $1.92
X-Large: 40 oz * $0.06/oz = $2.40

Calculate the total cost for each size (cup cost + ingredient cost):
Small: $0.03 + $0.72 = $0.75
Medium: $0.05 + $1.20 = $1.25
Large: $0.08 + $1.92 = $2.00
X-Large: $0.10 + $2.40 = $2.50

Calculate the profit for each size (selling price - total cost):
Small: $1.50 - $0.75 = $0.75
Medium: $2.25 - $1.25 = $1.00
Large: $3.75 - $2.00 = $1.75
X-Large: $4.50 - $2.50 = $2.00
These profit figures match the hint provided.

Let s, m, l, and x be the number of small, medium, large, and x-large slushes sold today, respectively. These quantities must be non-negative integers. Since the total profit is non-zero, at least one quantity must be positive.

The total profit from sales today was $46.50. This can be expressed as:
$0.75s + $1.00m + $1.75l + $2.00x = $46.50

We are given information about the quantities sold:
1. Medium was the best-selling size.
2. Medium sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls: m = 4s.
3. The order of sales from most to least was: medium, large, x-large, small. So, m > l > x > s.

Since m = 4s and m > l > x > s, s must be a positive integer. If s=0, then m=0, and the inequalities m > l > x > s would require l, x to be negative or non-integers, which is not possible for quantities sold.
Substituting m = 4s into the total profit equation:
0.75s + 1.00(4s) + 1.75l + 2.00x = 46.50
0.75s + 4s + 1.75l + 2.00x = 46.50
4.75s + 1.75l + 2.00x = 46.50

Multiply by 100 to remove decimals:
475s + 175l + 200x = 4650

Divide by 25:
(475/25)s + (175/25)l + (200/25)x = 4650/25
19s + 7l + 8x = 186

We also have the constraints from the sales order and m = 4s:
m = 4s
m > l implies 4s > l. Since l is an integer, 4s >= l + 1.
l > x implies l >= x + 1.
x > s implies x >= s + 1.
s is a positive integer (s >= 1).
Since l > x and x > s, we have l > s, and also l >= x + 1 >= (s + 1) + 1 = s + 2.
So the constraints are:
s >= 1 (integer)
m = 4s
l >= s + 2 (integer)
x >= s + 1 (integer)
4s > l (integer)

We need to find positive integer solutions for s, l, and x that satisfy 19s + 7l + 8x = 186 and the constraints 4s > l >= s+2 and x >= s+1.

Let's test values for s starting from 1.
If s = 1:
m = 4. Constraints: 4 > l > x > 1. l >= 1+2=3, x >= 1+1=2.
Equation: 19(1) + 7l + 8x = 186 => 19 + 7l + 8x = 186 => 7l + 8x = 167.
Constraints: 4 > l >= 3, l > x >= 2.
If l = 3: 7(3) + 8x = 167 => 21 + 8x = 167 => 8x = 146. x = 146/8 = 73/4 (not integer).
No integer solutions for l=3.
There are no other possible integer values for l such that 4 > l >= 3. So s = 1 yields no solution.

If s = 2:
m = 8. Constraints: 8 > l > x > 2. l >= 2+2=4, x >= 2+1=3.
Equation: 19(2) + 7l + 8x = 186 => 38 + 7l + 8x = 186 => 7l + 8x = 148.
Constraints: 8 > l >= 4, l > x >= 3.
Try values for l from 4 to 7:
If l = 4: 7(4) + 8x = 148 => 28 + 8x = 148 => 8x = 120 => x = 15. Check constraints: 8 > l=4 > x=15 > 2? No, 4 > 15 is false.
If l = 5: 7(5) + 8x = 148 => 35 + 8x = 148 => 8x = 113. x = 113/8 (not integer).
If l = 6: 7(6) + 8x = 148 => 42 + 8x = 148 => 8x = 106. x = 106/8 = 53/4 (not integer).
If l = 7: 7(7) + 8x = 148 => 49 + 8x = 148 => 8x = 99. x = 99/8 (not integer).
No integer solutions for s = 2.

If s = 3:
m = 12. Constraints: 12 > l > x > 3. l >= 3+2=5, x >= 3+1=4.
Equation: 19(3) + 7l + 8x = 186 => 57 + 7l + 8x = 186 => 7l + 8x = 129.
Constraints: 12 > l >= 5, l > x >= 4.
We need 7l = 129 - 8x. Since 7l must be divisible by 7, 129 - 8x must be divisible by 7.
129 mod 7 = 3. 8x mod 7 = x mod 7.
So we need 3 - x mod 7 to be 0 mod 7, which means x mod 7 = 3.
Possible values for x >= 4 where x mod 7 = 3: 4, 11, 18, ...
If x = 4: 7l + 8(4) = 129 => 7l + 32 = 129 => 7l = 97. l = 97/7 (not integer).
If x = 11: 7l + 8(11) = 129 => 7l + 88 = 129 => 7l = 41. l = 41/7 (not integer).
If x >= 11, then 8x >= 88. l >= x+1 >= 12. But l < 12. So x cannot be 11 or greater.
No integer solutions for s = 3.

For $x=4$, $f(4) = 272$. Difference = $f(4) - 4^4 = 272 - 256 = 16$.
For $x=5$, $f(5) = 650$. Difference = $f(5) - 5^4 = 650 - 625 = 25$.
For $x=6$, $f(6) = 1332$. Difference = $f(6) - 6^4 = 1332 - 1296 = 36$.
For $x=7$, $f(7) = 2450$. Difference = $f(7) - 7^4 = 2450 - 2401 = 49$.

The differences we found are 9, 16, 25, 36, 49.
We observe that these differences are the squares of the corresponding inputs:
$3^2 = 9$
$4^2 = 16$
$5^2 = 25$
$6^2 = 36$
$7^2 = 49$

This pattern suggests that the output $f(x)$ is obtained by adding the square of the input ($x^2$) to the fourth power of the input ($x^4$).
Thus, the formula for the function machine appears to be $f(x) = x^4 + x^2$.

Let's verify this formula with the given input-output pairs:
For $x=3$, $f(3) = 3^4 + 3^2 = 81 + 9 = 90$. This matches the given output.
For $x=4$, $f(4) = 4^4 + 4^2 = 256 + 16 = 272$. This matches the given output.
For $x=5$, $f(5) = 5^4 + 5^2 = 625 + 25 = 650$. This matches the given output.
For $x=6$, $f(6) = 6^4 + 6^2 = 1296 + 36 = 1332$. This matches the given output.
For $x=7$, $f(7) = 7^4 + 7^2 = 2401 + 49 = 2450$. This matches the given output.
The formula $f(x) = x^4 + x^2$ is consistent with all the provided data points.

Now we need to find what comes out if 10 goes in. This means we need to calculate $f(10)$ using the formula $f(x) = x^4 + x^2$.
For $x=10$:
$f(10) = 10^4 + 10^2$
$f(10) = 10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 + 10 \times 10$
$f(10) = 10000 + 100$
$f(10) = 10100$

Thus, when 10 goes into the machine, 10100 comes out.

The final answer is $\boxed{10100}$.",True,1,0
94,"Question: Dear Jim:
Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.

 Hint: Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,,True,0,NULL

The title hints you can easily go on to find for a ten-digit number that otherwise has same characteristics.","Answer-
397.
397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.
102?  Is 204 = 201 + 1?  No.
103?  Is 206 = 301 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds even.]
396?  Is 792 = 693 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds again.]
The answer given is the only one that passes.
As for extra points, an infinite number of 9's can be added between the 3 and the 7 without spoiling the major characteristics.

For example, if you start with the iterative equation,

You begin by opening every locker. Then you close every second locker. Then you go to every third locker and open it (if it's closed) or close it (if it's open).  Let's call this action toggling a locker. Continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n.  After 100 passes, where you toggle only locker #100, how many lockers are open?
 Hint: Think about this can be related to the number of factors of each number",Think about this can be related to the number of factors of each number,"Answer: 10 lockers are left open:
Lockers #1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.
Each of these numbers are perfect squares. This problem is based on the factors of the locker number.
Each locker is toggled by each factor; for example, locker #40 is toggled on pass number 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40.  That's eight toggles: open-closed-open-closed-open-closed-open-closed.
The only way a locker could be left open is if it is toggled an odd number of times. The only numbers with an odd number of factors are the perfect
squares. Thus, the perfect squares are left open.
For example, locker #25 is toggled on pass number 1, 5, and 25 (three toggles): open-closed-open.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let's analyze the state of each locker after 100 passes. There are 100 lockers, numbered from 1 to 100. Initially, all lockers are closed.

Consider locker number $k$, where $k$ is an integer from 1 to 100.
On pass number $n$, you toggle every $n$-th locker. This means locker $k$ is toggled during pass $n$ if $k$ is a multiple of $n$. In other words, locker $k$ is toggled during pass $n$ if $n$ is a divisor of $k$.

The passes are numbered from 1 to 100. So, locker $k$ is toggled on pass $n$ if $n$ is a divisor of $k$ and $1 \le n \le 100$. Since $k$ is between 1 and 100, any divisor $n$ of $k$ must satisfy $1 \le n \le k$. If $k \le 100$, then any divisor $n$ of $k$ must satisfy $1 \le n \le 100$.
Thus, locker $k$ is toggled once for each divisor of $k$. The total number of times locker $k$ is toggled is equal to the number of divisors of $k$.

Let $d(k)$ denote the number of divisors of $k$.
The initial state of locker $k$ is closed.
After 1 toggle, it is open.
After 2 toggles, it is closed.
After 3 toggles, it is open.
After $m$ toggles, the locker is open if $m$ is odd, and closed if $m$ is even.

Therefore, locker $k$ is open after 100 passes if and only if the total number of times it has been toggled is odd. This means locker $k$ is open if and only if the number of divisors of $k$, $d(k)$, is odd.

Now we need to determine which numbers $k$ between 1 and 100 have an odd number of divisors.
Consider the divisors of a number $k$. Divisors typically come in pairs $(d, k/d)$, where $d \cdot (k/d) = k$.
For example, the divisors of 12 are (1, 12), (2, 6), (3, 4). There are 6 divisors (an even number).
For a number $k$ to have an odd number of divisors, at least one of these pairs $(d, k/d)$ must consist of only one distinct number, meaning $d = k/d$. This occurs if and only if $d^2 = k$.
So, a number $k$ has an odd number of divisors if and only if $k$ is a perfect square.

We are looking for the number of lockers that are open, which is the number of integers $k$ between 1 and 100 (inclusive) such that $k$ is a perfect square.
The perfect squares are the squares of integers. We need to find the integers $m$ such that $1 \le m^2 \le 100$.
Taking the square root of the inequality, we get $1 \le m \le \sqrt{100}$, which means $1 \le m \le 10$.
The integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
The corresponding perfect squares are:
$1^2 = 1$
$2^2 = 4$
$3^2 = 9$
$4^2 = 16$
$5^2 = 25$
$6^2 = 36$
$7^2 = 49$
$8^2 = 64$
$9^2 = 81$
$10^2 = 100$

There are exactly 10 perfect squares between 1 and 100. These numbers correspond to the lockers that will be open at the end. The lockers that will be open are numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.

The number of open lockers is the count of these perfect squares. There are 10 such numbers.

$N + 1 \equiv 2 + 1 \pmod{3} \implies N + 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{3} \implies N + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$.
$N + 1 \equiv 3 + 1 \pmod{4} \implies N + 1 \equiv 4 \pmod{4} \implies N + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$.

$N + 1 \equiv 7 + 1 \pmod{8} \implies N + 1 \equiv 8 \pmod{8} \implies N + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$.
$N + 1 \equiv 8 + 1 \pmod{9} \implies N + 1 \equiv 9 \pmod{9} \implies N + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}$.

These congruences mean that $N+1$ is divisible by each of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
Therefore, $N+1$ is a common multiple of these numbers. The smallest positive common multiple is the least common multiple (LCM). The set of common multiples is the set of multiples of the LCM.
So, $N+1 = k \times \text{LCM}(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)$ for some integer $k$.

We need to calculate the LCM of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
We find the prime factorization of each number:
2 = $2^1$
3 = $3^1$
4 = $2^2$
5 = $5^1$
6 = $2 \times 3$
7 = $7^1$
8 = $2^3$
9 = $3^2$

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of all prime factors that appear in any of the numbers (2, 3, 5, 7):
Highest power of 2: $2^3$ (from 8)
Highest power of 3: $3^2$ (from 9)
Highest power of 5: $5^1$ (from 5)
Highest power of 7: $7^1$ (from 7)

LCM(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = $2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 = 8 \times 9 \times 5 \times 7$.
LCM = $72 \times 35$.
$72 \times 35 = 72 \times (30 + 5) = 72 \times 30 + 72 \times 5 = 2160 + 360 = 2520$.

So, $N+1$ is a multiple of 2520.
$N+1 = k \times 2520$, which means $N = 2520k - 1$ for some integer $k$.

We are given that the number $N$ is less than 3000.
$N < 3000$
$2520k - 1 < 3000$
$2520k < 3001$
$k < \frac{3001}{2520}$
$k < 1.19007...$

Since $k$ is an integer, the possible values for $k$ are $k \le 1$. So, $k$ can be 1, 0, -1, -2, and so on.
The possible values for $N$ are:
If $k=1$, $N = 2520(1) - 1 = 2519$. This is less than 3000.
If $k=0$, $N = 2520(0) - 1 = -1$. This is less than 3000.
If $k=-1$, $N = 2520(-1) - 1 = -2520 - 1 = -2521$. This is less than 3000.
If $k=-2$, $N = 2520(-2) - 1 = -5040 - 1 = -5041$. This is less than 3000.
There are infinitely many such integers less than 3000.

However, the phrasing ""What is that number?"" suggests a unique solution. In problems involving remainders, unless otherwise specified, the term ""number"" usually refers to a positive integer, and the standard definition of remainder ($0 \le r < n$) is assumed for positive divisors. If we assume $N$ must be a positive integer, we add the condition $N > 0$.

$N > 0$
$2520k - 1 > 0$
$2520k > 1$
$k > \frac{1}{2520}$
$k > 0.00039...$

So, we need an integer $k$ such that $k > 0.00039...$ and $k < 1.19007...$.
The only integer $k$ that satisfies both conditions is $k=1$.

Using $k=1$, the number is $N = 2520(1) - 1 = 2519$.
This number is positive (2519 > 0) and less than 3000 (2519 < 3000).
Let's verify the remainder conditions for $N=2519$:
$2519 = 2 \times 1259 + 1$ (remainder 1)
$2519 = 3 \times 839 + 2$ (remainder 2)
$2519 = 4 \times 629 + 3$ (remainder 3)
$2519 = 5 \times 503 + 4$ (remainder 4)
$2519 = 6 \times 419 + 5$ (remainder 5)
$2519 = 7 \times 359 + 6$ (remainder 6)
$2519 = 8 \times 314 + 7$ (remainder 7)
$2519 = 9 \times 279 + 8$ (remainder 8)

All conditions are satisfied. Under the standard interpretation of such problems implying a unique positive integer solution, 2519 is the only number less than 3000 that fits the criteria.

That's 30% for Kurt and 33-1/3% for Patty.
Method:
Let K, P, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, K+P+R.
Now, since Kurt's percentage equals Patty's quantity, we get
100*K/T = P.
Similarly,
100*P/T = R plus a fraction.  Now, look at the common factor, 100/T.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
K*F = P and P*F = R (plus a fraction),

 Hint: Start from the last digits.",Start from the last digits.,"First, there are ten different letters in this equation: E, F, I, N, O, R, S, T, X, Y. Therefore, every digit from 0 to 9 is used.
Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.
If T=8, then R=X+3, we can have R=6, X=3, or R=7, X=4.
If R=6, X=3, the remaining digits are 2, 4, 7, and again we can't choose S=F+1.
If R=7, X=4, the remaining digits are 2, 3, 6, where 3=2+1. Hence S=3, F=2.

According to the problem statement, when the two cars race in opposite directions, they start at the same point and meet every 30 seconds. When moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds, $x + y$. The distance covered by car 1 in 30 seconds is $30x$, and the distance covered by car 2 in 30 seconds is $30y$. When they meet for the first time after starting from the same point, the sum of the distances they have traveled is equal to the length of the track.
So, we have the equation:
$30x + 30y = 1800$
Dividing both sides of this equation by 30, we simplify it to:
$x + y = 60$ (Equation 1)
This equation is consistent with the information provided in the hint: $1800m = 30x + 30y$.

According to the problem statement, when the two cars race in the same direction, they start at the same point and meet every 120 seconds. When moving in the same direction, they meet when the faster car has completed exactly one more lap than the slower car. The relative speed at which the distance between the cars changes is the absolute difference of their speeds, $|x - y|$. The distance the faster car gains on the slower car to meet again at the starting point is one full lap, which is 1800 meters. This takes 120 seconds.
So, the relative distance covered in 120 seconds is equal to the track length:
$120 \times |x - y| = 1800$
Dividing both sides of this equation by 120, we get:
$|x - y| = 15$

This absolute value equation gives us two possibilities for the difference in speeds:
Case 1: $x - y = 15$ (This assumes $x \ge y$)
Case 2: $y - x = 15$ (This assumes $y \ge x$)

We will solve the system of equations using the first case, $x - y = 15$, assuming $x \ge y$. We will verify if this assumption is consistent with the solution we find. The system of equations is:
1) $x + y = 60$
2) $x - y = 15$

We can solve this system using the elimination method, as suggested by the hint (""Use method of substitution or elimination""). We add Equation 1 and Equation 2:
$(x + y) + (x - y) = 60 + 15$
$x + y + x - y = 75$
$2x = 75$
Dividing both sides by 2:
$x = \frac{75}{2}$
$x = 37.5$ m/s

Now, we substitute the value of $x$ into Equation 1 ($x + y = 60$):
$37.5 + y = 60$
Subtracting 37.5 from both sides:
$y = 60 - 37.5$
$y = 22.5$ m/s

We found $x = 37.5$ m/s and $y = 22.5$ m/s. Since $37.5 \ge 22.5$, our initial assumption in Case 1 ($x \ge y$) is consistent with the solution.
If we had used Case 2 ($y - x = 15$), we would have added $x + y = 60$ and $-x + y = 15$, which results in $2y = 75$, so $y = 37.5$ and $x = 60 - 37.5 = 22.5$. This solution ($x = 22.5$, $y = 37.5$) is also valid and corresponds to simply labeling the cars differently.

Both solutions indicate that the speeds of the two cars are 37.5 m/s and 22.5 m/s.

To confirm, let's check these speeds against the problem conditions:
Opposite directions: Relative speed = $37.5 + 22.5 = 60$ m/s. Time to meet = Distance / Relative speed = $1800 / 60 = 30$ seconds. This matches the problem statement.
Same direction: Assume car 1 is faster with speed 37.5 m/s and car 2 is slower with speed 22.5 m/s. Relative speed = $37.5 - 22.5 = 15$ m/s. Time for the faster car to gain one lap = Distance / Relative speed = $1800 / 15 = 120$ seconds. This matches the problem statement.

The hint also showed a step for substitution from $1800 = 30x + 30y$, which is $1800 - 30x = 30y$. Dividing by 30 gives $y = \frac{1800 - 30x}{30} = 60 - x$. Substituting this into the second equation, $x - y = 15$, yields $x - (60 - x) = 15$, which simplifies to $2x - 60 = 15$, giving $2x = 75$ and $x = 37.5$. Then $y = 60 - 37.5 = 22.5$. This demonstrates the substitution method also yields the same correct speeds.

The speeds of the two cars are 37.5 m/s and 22.5 m/s.

The final answer is $\boxed{37.5 \text{ m/s and } 22.5 \text{ m/s}}$.",True,0,0

In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.

We are given $T_h = 105^\circ F$ and $T_c = 45^\circ F$.
Let $R_h$ be the rotation of the hot water faucet and $R_c$ be the rotation of the cold water faucet. The maximum rotation for each faucet is 360 degrees.
We are told that the hot water faucet is turned on ""all the way"", which means its rotation is at the maximum. So, $R_h = 360$ degrees.
We want the mixed water temperature to be $T_{mix} = 98.6^\circ F$. We need to find the rotation $R_c$ of the cold water faucet.

The hint provided is: ""Add how much you've rotated each and divide by the total rotation to get the average temperature.""
This hint suggests using a weighted average to find the mixed temperature, where the rotations of the faucets are the weights. Assuming that the flow rate of water from each faucet is proportional to its rotation angle, the temperature of the mixture is given by the formula:
$T_{mix} = \frac{R_h \times T_h + R_c \times T_c}{R_h + R_c}$

We are given $T_h = 105^\circ F$, $T_c = 45^\circ F$, $R_h = 360$ degrees, and $T_{mix} = 98.6^\circ F$. We need to solve for $R_c$.
Substitute the given values into the formula:
$98.6 = \frac{360 \times 105 + R_c \times 45}{360 + R_c}$

Now, we solve this equation for $R_c$:
$98.6 \times (360 + R_c) = 360 \times 105 + 45 R_c$

Distribute $98.6$ on the left side and calculate the product $360 \times 105$:
$98.6 \times 360 = 35496$
$360 \times 105 = 37800$

Substitute these values back into the equation:
$35496 + 98.6 R_c = 37800 + 45 R_c$

Now, we isolate the $R_c$ terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. Subtract $45 R_c$ from both sides:
$35496 + 98.6 R_c - 45 R_c = 37800$
$35496 + (98.6 - 45) R_c = 37800$
$35496 + 53.6 R_c = 37800$

Subtract $35496$ from both sides:
$53.6 R_c = 37800 - 35496$
$53.6 R_c = 2304$

Now, divide by $53.6$ to find $R_c$:
$R_c = \frac{2304}{53.6}$

To simplify the calculation, multiply the numerator and denominator by 10 to remove the decimal point:
$R_c = \frac{23040}{536}$

We can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. Both are divisible by 8:
$23040 \div 8 = 2880$
$536 \div 8 = 67$
So, $R_c = \frac{2880}{67}$ degrees.

The number 67 is a prime number. We check if 2880 is divisible by 67 by performing division:
$2880 \div 67$
$67 \times 40 = 2680$
$2880 - 2680 = 200$
$67 \times 2 = 134$
$200 - 134 = 66$
So, $2880 = 42 \times 67 + 66$.

The exact value of $R_c$ is $\frac{2880}{67}$ degrees.
As a mixed number, this is $42 \frac{66}{67}$ degrees.
This value is between 0 and 360 degrees, which is a valid range for the cold water faucet rotation.

The amount you would have to rotate the cold water faucet is $R_c$. Assuming the faucet starts from the off position (0 degrees rotation), the required rotation is $42 \frac{66}{67}$ degrees.

The final answer is $\frac{2880}{67}$. As a mixed number, this is $42 \frac{66}{67}$.

The final answer is $\boxed{\frac{2880}{67}}$.",True,1,0

116,"Question: Mad Ade's kids, Mad Ade junior and little Miss Mad Ade were going to cut the grass on their square lawn, while their dad was out buying a bumper family sized kebab with extra grease. They agreed that each should cut one-half of the area. Junior went first, and cut a border 2 metres wide all the way around.
After doing a few sums, Little Miss agreed that exactly one-half had been cut and happily cut the rest.
What was the area of the lawn?
 Hint: set a mathematical equation by putting the area/dimensions of the whole lawn in terms of the area/dimensions of what little Miss Maddie has to mow",set a mathematical equation by putting the area/dimensions of the whole lawn in terms of the area/dimensions of what little Miss Maddie has to mow,set a mathematical equation by putting the area/dimensions of the whole lawn in terms of the area/dimensions of what little Miss Maddie has to mow -- Area of lawn was 186.51 square metres,GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let $s$ be the side length of the square lawn in metres.
The total area of the lawn is $A = s^2$ square metres.

Mad Ade junior cuts a border 2 metres wide all the way around the square lawn.
When a border of width 2 metres is cut from a square of side length $s$, the remaining shape is a smaller square in the centre.
The side length of this inner square is reduced by the border width from each side. So, the side length of the inner square is $s - 2 - 2 = s - 4$ metres.
For this inner square to be a physical region with a positive side length, we must have $s-4 > 0$, which implies $s > 4$.

The area of the inner square is $(s-4)^2$ square metres. This is the area that little Miss Mad Ade has to cut.

The problem states that Junior cut exactly one-half of the area. Since the lawn is divided into two parts (the part junior cut and the part little Miss cut), this means the area little Miss has to cut is also exactly one-half of the total area.
So, the area little Miss cuts is $\frac{1}{2} A = \frac{1}{2} s^2$.

We can now set up a mathematical equation based on the area little Miss has to cut:
Area little Miss cuts = $\frac{1}{2}$ Total Area
$(s-4)^2 = \frac{1}{2} s^2$

This equation puts the area little Miss has to mow $((s-4)^2)$ in terms of the dimension ($s$) and area ($s^2$) of the whole lawn, as suggested by the hint.

Now, we solve this equation for $s$:
$(s-4)^2 = \frac{1}{2} s^2$
Expand the left side:
$s^2 - 8s + 16 = \frac{1}{2} s^2$

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
$2(s^2 - 8s + 16) = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} s^2$
$2s^2 - 16s + 32 = s^2$

Rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic equation ($as^2 + bs + c = 0$):
$2s^2 - s^2 - 16s + 32 = 0$
$s^2 - 16s + 32 = 0$

We use the quadratic formula to solve for $s$: $s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.
Here, $a=1$, $b=-16$, $c=32$.
$s = \frac{-(-16) \pm \sqrt{(-16)^2 - 4(1)(32)}}{2(1)}$
$s = \frac{16 \pm \sqrt{256 - 128}}{2}$
$s = \frac{16 \pm \sqrt{128}}{2}$

Simplify the square root: $\sqrt{128} = \sqrt{64 \times 2} = \sqrt{64} \times \sqrt{2} = 8\sqrt{2}$.
Substitute this back into the expression for $s$:
$s = \frac{16 \pm 8\sqrt{2}}{2}$
$s = \frac{16}{2} \pm \frac{8\sqrt{2}}{2}$
$s = 8 \pm 4\sqrt{2}$

We have two potential solutions for the side length $s$:
$s_1 = 8 + 4\sqrt{2}$
$s_2 = 8 - 4\sqrt{2}$

We established earlier that the side length $s$ must be greater than 4 for the inner square to have a positive side length $(s-4)$.
Let's check both solutions against this condition.
For $s_1 = 8 + 4\sqrt{2}$:
$s_1 - 4 = (8 + 4\sqrt{2}) - 4 = 4 + 4\sqrt{2}$. Since $\sqrt{2}$ is positive, $4 + 4\sqrt{2}$ is positive. This solution is valid.

For $s_2 = 8 - 4\sqrt{2}$:
$s_2 - 4 = (8 - 4\sqrt{2}) - 4 = 4 - 4\sqrt{2}$.
We know $\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414$. So $4\sqrt{2} \approx 5.656$.
$s_2 - 4 \approx 4 - 5.656 = -1.656$.
Since $4 - 4\sqrt{2} = 4(1 - \sqrt{2})$, and $1 - \sqrt{2}$ is negative, $s_2 - 4$ is negative.
A square cannot have a negative side length. Thus, $s_2 = 8 - 4\sqrt{2}$ is not a valid solution for the side length of the original lawn under the described cutting process.

The only valid side length for the lawn is $s = 8 + 4\sqrt{2}$ metres.

The question asks for the area of the lawn, which is $A = s^2$.
Area $= (8 + 4\sqrt{2})^2$
Using the formula $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$:
Area $= (8)^2 + 2(8)(4\sqrt{2}) + (4\sqrt{2})^2$
Area $= 64 + 64\sqrt{2} + (4^2 \times (\sqrt{2})^2)$
Area $= 64 + 64\sqrt{2} + (16 \times 2)$
Area $= 64 + 64\sqrt{2} + 32$
Area $= 96 + 64\sqrt{2}$

The area of the lawn is $96 + 64\sqrt{2}$ square metres.

Let's verify the result:
Total Area = $96 + 64\sqrt{2}$.
Side length $s = 8 + 4\sqrt{2}$.
Inner square side length $s-4 = 4 + 4\sqrt{2}$.
Area of inner square (Little Miss's area) = $(4 + 4\sqrt{2})^2 = 4^2 + 2(4)(4\sqrt{2}) + (4\sqrt{2})^2 = 16 + 32\sqrt{2} + 32 = 48 + 32\sqrt{2}$.
Half of the total area = $\frac{1}{2} (96 + 64\sqrt{2}) = 48 + 32\sqrt{2}$.
The area little Miss cuts is indeed exactly half of the total area.
The area Junior cuts is the total area minus Little Miss's area: $(96 + 64\sqrt{2}) - (48 + 32\sqrt{2}) = 48 + 32\sqrt{2}$, which is also half of the total area. The solution is consistent with the problem statement.

The final answer should be the value of the area.

The final answer is $96 + 64\sqrt{2}$.",True,1,0

The number of additional pieces formed on cut x will always be x. The sum of all integers from 1 to n is n*(n+1)/2. So the sum of additional pieces cut will be n*(n+1)/2.
Finally add 1 because we start with 1 piece: n*(n+1)/2 + 1.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let $P(n)$ be the largest number of pieces we can form with $n$ straight cuts of a pizza.

Let's analyze the first few cases to understand how the number of pieces increases.
For $n=0$ cuts, we have the whole pizza as a single piece. So, $P(0) = 1$.

For $n=1$ cut, we make a single straight cut across the pizza. This divides the pizza into two pieces. So, $P(1) = 2$.

For $n=2$ cuts, we make a second straight cut. To maximize the number of pieces, the second cut should intersect the first cut. If the two cuts intersect inside the pizza, they divide the pizza into 4 pieces. If they are parallel, they divide the pizza into 3 pieces. To get the largest number of pieces, we make them intersect. So, $P(2) = 4$.

For $n=3$ cuts, we make a third straight cut. We want to maximize the number of new pieces added by this cut. We already have 4 pieces formed by the first two intersecting cuts. Let the first two cuts be $L_1$ and $L_2$, which intersect inside the pizza. Now we add a third cut $L_3$.
The third cut $L_3$ is a straight line. The number of new pieces created by $L_3$ is equal to the number of existing pieces that $L_3$ cuts through. When $L_3$ cuts through an existing piece, it divides that piece into two. If $L_3$ cuts through $k$ existing pieces, it adds $k$ new pieces.
Consider the line $L_3$. It passes through the pizza, forming a chord. This chord is divided into segments by the points where $L_3$ intersects the previous cuts $L_1$ and $L_2$. To maximize the number of pieces, we should choose $L_3$ such that it intersects both $L_1$ and $L_2$ at distinct points inside the pizza.
If $L_3$ intersects $L_1$ and $L_2$ at two distinct points inside the pizza, these two points divide the chord $L_3 \cap \text{Pizza}$ into 3 segments. Each of these segments lies in a different existing piece.
Let the segments of $L_3 \cap \text{Pizza}$ be $s_1, s_2, s_3$. $s_1$ is in piece $p_1$, $s_2$ is in piece $p_2$, and $s_3$ is in piece $p_3$. The pieces $p_1, p_2, p_3$ must be distinct. (As $L_3$ crosses $L_1$ or $L_2$, it moves from one piece to an adjacent one).
The cut along $L_3$ divides each of these 3 pieces ($p_1, p_2, p_3$) into two. Thus, 3 new pieces are created.
The total number of pieces is $P(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$. So, $P(3) = 7$.

Let's generalize this. Suppose we have made $j$ cuts $L_1, \ldots, L_j$ such that they form $P(j)$ pieces, which is the maximum possible for $j$ cuts. Now we make the $(j+1)$-th cut, $L_{j+1}$.
To maximize the number of new pieces, the $(j+1)$-th cut $L_{j+1}$ should intersect all previous $j$ cuts $L_1, \ldots, L_j$ at distinct points inside the pizza, and none of these intersection points should coincide with intersection points of the previous cuts. Such an arrangement is called being in general position within the disk, and it is always possible to choose the $(j+1)$-th cut to achieve this if the first $j$ cuts are in general position.
If the $(j+1)$-th cut $L_{j+1}$ intersects the previous $j$ cuts $L_1, \ldots, L_j$ at $j$ distinct points inside the pizza, these $j$ intersection points divide the chord $L_{j+1} \cap \text{Pizza}$ into $j+1$ segments.
Let these segments be $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_{j+1}$. Each segment $s_k$ lies in an existing piece $p_k$ formed by the previous $j$ cuts.
These $j+1$ segments lie in $j+1$ distinct pieces. This is because adjacent segments $s_k$ and $s_{k+1}$ are separated by an intersection point with some $L_i$. Crossing $L_i$ moves from one piece to an adjacent one. Thus, the piece containing $s_k$ is different from the piece containing $s_{k+1}$.
The cut along $L_{j+1}$ divides each of these $j+1$ distinct pieces into two. So, $",True,0,0

One less complex method is to imagine the axis of the cone form a right triangle. This triangle shares the dimensions of the cone, so it is 12 by 5. We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.
Next we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x. If we add 10x on both sides, we get 22x=60, and dividing 22 from both sides yields x=60/22=30/11.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let $r$ be the radius of the cylinder and $h$ be the height of the cylinder.
The problem states that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to its height. The diameter of the cylinder is $2r$.
So, we have the relationship $h = 2r$.

The cone has height $H = 12$ units and radius $R = 5$ units.
The cylinder is inscribed in the cone with their axes coinciding.
Hint #1 specifies that the cylinder's bottom face is on the cone's bottom face, and the cylinder's top circumference touches the cone.

Consider a cross-section of the cone and cylinder through their common axis. This cross-section is an isosceles triangle (representing the cone) with base $2R=10$ and height $H=12$, and a rectangle (representing the cylinder) with width $2r$ and height $h$.
The bottom side of the rectangle lies on the base of the triangle. The top corners of the rectangle lie on the slant sides of the triangle.

We can use similar triangles as suggested by Hint #2. Consider the right half of the cross-section, which is a right-angled triangle.
The large right triangle representing the cone has a base equal to the cone's radius $R=5$ and a height equal to the cone's height $H=12$.

Now consider the smaller right triangle formed at the top of the cone, above the cylinder's top face.
The apex of this small triangle is the apex of the cone.
The base of this small triangle is the radius of the cylinder's top face, which is $r$.
The height of this small triangle is the vertical distance from the cone's apex to the cylinder's top face.
The cone's apex is at a height of 12 (relative to the base). The cylinder's bottom base is at a height of 0 (on the cone's base). The cylinder's height is $h$, so its top base is at a height of $h$.
The height of the small triangle is the height of the cone minus the height of the cylinder, which is $H - h = 12 - h$.

The large right triangle and the small right triangle are similar. The ratio of corresponding sides is equal.
The ratio of the base to the height in the large triangle is $\frac{R}{H} = \frac{5}{12}$.
The ratio of the base to the height in the small triangle is $\frac{r}{12 - h}$.

Since the triangles are similar, these ratios are equal:
$\frac{r}{12 - h} = \frac{5}{12}$

We are given that the height of the cylinder is equal to its diameter, $h = 2r$. Substitute this into the equation:
$\frac{r}{12 - 2r} = \frac{5}{12}$

Now, solve this equation for $r$:
Multiply both sides by $12(12 - 2r)$ to eliminate the denominators:
$12 \times r = 5 \times (12 - 2r)$
$12r = 60 - 10r$

Add $10r$ to both sides:
$12r + 10r = 60$
$22r = 60$

Divide by 22:
$r = \frac{60}{22}$

Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
$r = \frac{30}{11}$

The radius of the cylinder is $\frac{30}{11}$ units.

We can find the height of the cylinder: $h = 2r = 2 \times \frac{30}{11} = \frac{60}{11}$ units.
The height of the cylinder is $\frac{60}{11} \approx 5.45$ units, which is less than the cone's height of 12 units.
The radius of the cylinder is $\frac{30}{11} \approx 2.73$ units, which is less than the cone's radius of 5 units.
The dimensions are reasonable for a cylinder inscribed in this manner.

We can represent $N$ as a number formed by five digits $d_4 d_3 d_2 d_1 d_0$, where $d_4$ is the ten thousands digit, $d_3$ is the thousands digit, $d_2$ is the hundreds digit, $d_1$ is the tens digit, and $d_0$ is the units digit.
The value of $N$ is $10000 d_4 + 1000 d_3 + 100 d_2 + 10 d_1 + d_0$.
Since $N$ is a five-digit number, $d_4$ must be a non-zero digit, i.e., $d_4 \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$, and $d_3, d_2, d_1, d_0$ are digits from 0 to 9.
So, $10000 \le N \le 99999$.

When the digit 9 is placed at the beginning of $N$, a new number is formed. Let's call this new number $N_1$. The digits of $N_1$ are $9 d_4 d_3 d_2 d_1 d_0$.
The value of $N_1$ is $9 \times 10^5 + 10000 d_4 + 1000 d_3 + 100 d_2 + 10 d_1 + d_0$.
In terms of $N$, $N_1 = 900000 + N$.

When the digit 9 is placed at the end of $N$, another new number is formed. Let's call this new number $N_2$. The digits of $N_2$ are $d_4 d_3 d_2 d_1 d_0 9$.
The value of $N_2$ is $10 \times (10000 d_4 + 1000 d_3 + 100 d_2 + 10 d_1 + d_0) + 9$.
In terms of $N$, $N_2 = 10N + 9$.

According to the problem statement, the number formed by placing a 9 at the beginning ($N_1$) is four times larger than the number formed by placing the 9 at the end ($N_2$).
So, we have the equation:
$N_1 = 4 \times N_2$.

Substitute the expressions for $N_1$ and $N_2$ in terms of $N$:
$900000 + N = 4 \times (10N + 9)$.

Now, we solve this linear equation for $N$.
$900000 + N = 40N + 36$.
Subtract $N$ from both sides of the equation:
$900000 = 39N + 36$.
Subtract 36 from both sides of the equation:
$900000 - 36 = 39N$.
$899964 = 39N$.

To find $N$, we need to divide 899964 by 39.
$N = \frac{899964}{39}$.

Let's perform the division:
Divide 89 by 39: $89 = 2 \times 39 + 11$. The first digit of $N$ is 2. The remainder is 11.
Bring down the next digit (9) to get 119.
Divide 119 by 39: $119 = 3 \times 39 + 2$. ($3 \times 39 = 117$). The next digit is 3. The remainder is 2.
Bring down the next digit (9) to get 29.
Divide 29 by 39: $29 = 0 \times 39 + 29$. The next digit is 0. The remainder is 29.
Bring down the next digit (6) to get 296.
Divide 296 by 39: $296 = 7 \times 39 + 23$. ($7 \times 39 = 273$). The next digit is 7. The remainder is 23.
Bring down the next digit (4) to get 234.
Divide 234 by 39: $234 = 6 \times 39 + 0$. ($6 \times 39 = 234$). The next digit is 6. The remainder is 0.

So, the result of the division is 23076.
$N = 23076$.

We need to check if this number satisfies the conditions of the problem.
Is $N = 23076$ a five-digit number? Yes, it is. It falls within the range [10000, 99999].
The first digit of $N=23076$ is 2. This is consistent with the hint provided.

Now, let's verify the original condition with $N=23076$.
If we place 9 at the beginning of 23076, we get $N_1 = 923076$.
If we place 9 at the end of 23076, we get $N_2 = 230769$.
The condition is $N_1 = 4 \times N_2$.
Let's calculate $4 \times N_2$:
$4 \times 230769 = 923076$.
This matches $N_1$. The condition is satisfied.

The five-digit number that satisfies the given conditions is 23076.

The final answer is $\boxed{23076}$.",True,1,0
124,"Question: I have a machine which has four cog wheels in constant mesh. The largest cog has 242 teeth and the others have 160, 64 and 22 respectively. How many revolutions must the largest cog make before each of the cogs is back in its starting position?
 Hint: The least common multiple is helpful",The least common multiple is helpful,"160 revolutions.
The least common multiple of 242=2*11^2, 160=2^5*5, 64=2^6 and 22=2*11 is 2^6*5*11^2=38720.
38720/242=160.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let $N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4$ be the number of teeth on the four cog wheels. We are given $N_1 = 242$, $N_2 = 160$, $N_3 = 64$, and $N_4 = 22$. Let $N_1$ be the number of teeth on the largest cog.

The cogs are in constant mesh, forming a gear train. When cogs are in mesh, the distance traveled along the circumference at the point of engagement is the same. If a cog with $N$ teeth rotates by $R$ revolutions, the total ""tooth units"" that have passed a reference point is $R \times N$. For all cogs in a meshed train, this value must be the same for any given period of time. Let this common value be $L$.
So, we have $R_1 N_1 = R_2 N_2 = R_3 N_3 = R_4 N_4 = L$, where $R_i$ is the number of revolutions of the cog with $N_i$ teeth.

For each cog to be back in its starting position, the number of revolutions it has made must be an integer. That is, $R_i$ must be a non-negative integer for $i=1, 2, 3, 4$. Since we are looking for the first time this happens after the initial state (where $R_i=0$), we are looking for the smallest positive integer values for $R_i$.

From the relation $R_i N_i = L$, we have $R_i = L/N_i$. For $R_i$ to be an integer for all $i$, $L$ must be a multiple of $N_i$ for all $i=1, 2, 3, 4$. Thus, $L$ must be a common multiple of $N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4$.
We are looking for the first time all cogs are simultaneously in their starting positions, which corresponds to the smallest positive integer values for $R_i$. This occurs when $L$ is the smallest positive common multiple, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of $N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4$.
So, $L = \text{lcm}(N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4)$.

We need to calculate $\text{lcm}(242, 160, 64, 22)$. First, find the prime factorization of each number:
$242 = 2 \times 121 = 2 \times 11^2$
$160 = 16 \times 10 = 2^4 \times 2 \times 5 = 2^5 \times 5^1$
$64 = 2^6$
$22 = 2 \times 11 = 2^1 \times 11^1$

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:
Prime factor 2: The powers are $2^1, 2^5, 2^6, 2^1$. The highest power is $2^6$.
Prime factor 5: The powers are $5^0, 5^1, 5^0, 5^0$. The highest power is $5^1$.
Prime factor 11: The powers are $11^2, 11^0, 11^0, 11^1$. The highest power is $11^2$.

So, $\text{lcm}(242, 160, 64, 22) = 2^6 \times 5^1 \times 11^2 = 64 \times 5 \times 121$.
$\text{lcm} = 320 \times 121 = 38720$.

The value of $L$ is 38720.
The question asks for the number of revolutions the largest cog must make. The largest cog has $N_1 = 242$ teeth. The number of revolutions for the largest cog is $R_1 = L / N_1$.
$R_1 = 38720 / 242$.

We can use the prime factorizations to perform the division:
$R_1 = (2^6 \times 5 \times 11^2) / (2^1 \times 11^2)$
$R_1 = 2^{6-1} \times 5^{1-0} \times 11^{2-2}$
$R_1 = 2^5 \times 5^1 \times 11^0$
$R_1 = 32 \times 5 \times 1$
$R_1 = 160$.

The largest cog must make 160 revolutions for all cogs to be simultaneously back in their starting positions for the first time.
Let's check the revolutions for the other cogs:
$R_2 = 38720 / 160 = 242$ revolutions.
$R_3 = 38720 / 64 = 605$ revolutions.
$R_4 = 38720 / 22 = 1760$ revolutions.
Since $R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4$ are all integers, all cogs are simultaneously back in their starting positions after 160 revolutions of the largest cog. This is the first time this occurs after the start because we used the LCM.

The final answer is $\boxed{160}$.",True,1,0

The fastest way to get everyone across is for B and C to start out on foot and A to start out with the bicycle. At a point y, A will get off the bicycle and walk the rest of the way. Eventually C will get to the bicycle abandoned by A, then ride back to a point x, leaving the bicycle there, then turning around and walk until he reaches the end. Person B will walk until he reaches the bicycle left by C and then ride the rest of the way.

A: 1*y + 10*(1-y)
B: 5*x + 1*(1-x)
C: 2*y + (y-x) + 2*(1-x)

Bill said he was going to sit beside the curb and wait until a fare came along.

Pedestrians walking east have velocity $v_E = +4$ km/h.
Pedestrians walking west have velocity $v_W = -4$ km/h.

The problem states that an equal number of pedestrians walk in each direction. This implies that the linear density of pedestrians walking east, $\rho_E$, is equal to the linear density of pedestrians walking west, $\rho_W$. Let's denote this density by $\rho$.

The rate at which a driver encounters potential fares (pedestrians) depends on the relative speed between the cab and the pedestrians and the density of pedestrians. A higher encounter rate implies a higher ""chance of picking up a fare"". We assume the chance of picking up a fare is directly proportional to the total rate of encountering pedestrians.

For a driver with velocity $v_d$, the rate of encountering eastbound pedestrians is proportional to $\rho_E |v_d - v_E|$.
The rate of encountering westbound pedestrians is proportional to $\rho_W |v_d - v_W|$.
The total rate of encountering pedestrians ($R$) is proportional to the sum of these rates:
$R \propto \rho_E |v_d - v_E| + \rho_W |v_d - v_W|$
Given $\rho_E = \rho_W = \rho$, $v_E = 4$, and $v_W = -4$, the total rate is proportional to:
$R \propto \rho (|v_d - 4| + |v_d - (-4)|) = \rho (|v_d - 4| + |v_d + 4|)$.

We can compare the ""chances of picking up a fare"" by comparing the factor $(|v_d - 4| + |v_d + 4|)$ for each driver.

Let's calculate this factor for each driver based on their strategy:

1.  **Bill:** Sits beside the curb and waits. His velocity is $v_{Bill} = 0$ km/h.
    Factor for Bill = $|0 - 4| + |0 + 4| = |-4| + |4| = 4 + 4 = 8$.
    So, Bill's chance is proportional to $8\rho$.

2.  **Bob:** Cruises west at 4 km/h. His velocity is $v_{Bob} = -4$ km/h (since west is the negative direction).
    Factor for Bob = $|-4 - 4| + |-4 + 4| = |-8| + |0| = 8 + 0 = 8$.
    So, Bob's chance is proportional to $8\rho$.

3.  **Frank:** Cruises east at 8 km/h. His velocity is $v_{Frank} = +8$ km/h.
    Factor for Frank = $|8 - 4| + |8 + 4| = |4| + |12| = 4 + 12 = 16$.
    So, Frank's chance is proportional to $16\rho$.

4.  **Jim:** Cruises west at 12 km/h. His velocity is $v_{Jim} = -12$ km/h.
    Factor for Jim = $|-12 - 4| + |-12 + 4| = |-16| + |-8| = 16 + 8 = 24$.
    So, Jim's chance is proportional to $24\rho$.

Let $C_{Driver}$ represent the chance of picking up a fare for each driver. We have $C_{Bill} \propto 8$, $C_{Bob} \propto 8$, $C_{Frank} \propto 16$, and $C_{Jim} \propto 24$. We can express these chances as $C_{Bill} = k \times 8$, $C_{Bob} = k \times 8$, $C_{Frank} = k \times 16$, $C_{Jim} = k \times 24$ for some positive constant $k$.

Now, let's evaluate each claim made by the drivers:

*   **Bob's claim:** He would have twice the chance of picking up a fare as Bill.
    The claim is $C_{Bob} = 2 \times C_{Bill}$.
    Comparing the proportional factors: $8 = 2 \times 8$. This is false, as $8 \neq 16$.
    Bob's chance ($8\rho$) is equal to Bill's chance ($8\rho$).
    Bob's claim is wrong.

*   **Frank's claim:** His chances were twice as good as either Bill's or Bob's.
    The claim is $C_{Frank} = 2 \times C_{Bill}$ AND $C_{Frank} = 2 \times C_{Bob}$.
    Comparing $C_{Frank}$ and $C_{Bill}$: $16 = 2 \times 8$. This is true, as $16 = 16$.
    Comparing $C_{Frank}$ and $C_{Bob}$: $16 = 2 \times 8$. This is true, as $16 = 16$.
    Both parts of Frank's claim are true.
    Frank's claim is correct.

*   **Jim's claim:** His chances of picking up a fare were twice as good as Frank's.
    The claim is $C_{Jim} = 2 \times C_{Frank}$.
    Comparing the proportional factors: $24 = 2 \times 16$. This is false, as $24 \neq 32$.
    Jim's chance ($24\rho$) is 1.5 times Frank's chance ($16\rho$).
    Jim's claim is wrong.

Therefore, based on the analysis of encounter rates, only Frank's claim is correct.

The final answer is $\boxed{Bob's claim is wrong, Frank's claim is correct, and Jim's claim is wrong.}$.",True,1,0

Let S_m, S_n, and S_e be Smith's counts in the morning, noon, and evening, respectively.

We are given the following clues:
1. On Smith's noon trip there were 32 fewer people than in his morning count.
   S_n = S_m - 32

2. Kevin counted a total of 122 in the morning and noon counts, just one higher than his evening count, but 24 more than Smith's Evening count.
   This clue can be broken down into three parts:
   a) Kevin's morning and noon counts total 122:
      K_m + K_n = 122
   b) The total of Kevin's morning and noon counts is one higher than his evening count:
      K_m + K_n = K_e + 1
   c) The total of Kevin's morning and noon counts is 24 more than Smith's Evening count:
      K_m + K_n = S_e + 24

3. Kevin's morning count is the same as Smith's average. We interpret ""Smith's average"" as the average of Smith's three counts:
   K_m = (S_m + S_n + S_e) / 3

4. Kevin's evening count was 37 more than Smith's morning count.
   K_e = S_m + 37

The problem asks for the day's average, which is the average of all six counts: (K_m + K_n + K_e + S_m + S_n + S_e) / 6.

Following the hint, we start with Clue 2.
From Clue 2a and 2b, we have K_m + K_n = 122 and K_m + K_n = K_e + 1.
Substituting 122 into the second equation:
122 = K_e + 1
K_e = 122 - 1
K_e = 121

From Clue 2a and 2c, we have K_m + K_n = 122 and K_m + K_n = S_e + 24.
Substituting 122 into the second equation:
122 = S_e + 24
S_e = 122 - 24
S_e = 98

Now we use Clue 4, which relates K_e and S_m.
We have K_e = S_m + 37 and we found K_e = 121.
Substituting the value of K_e:
121 = S_m + 37
S_m = 121 - 37
S_m = 84

Now we use Clue 1, which relates S_n and S_m.
We have S_n = S_m - 32 and we found S_m = 84.
Substituting the value of S_m:
S_n = 84 - 32
S_n = 52

Now we have all of Smith's counts (S_m, S_n, S_e). We use Clue 3, which relates K_m to the average of Smith's counts.
K_m = (S_m + S_n + S_e) / 3
Substituting the values S_m = 84, S_n = 52, and S_e = 98:
K_m = (84 + 52 + 98) / 3
K_m = (136 + 98) / 3
K_m = 234 / 3
K_m = 78

Finally, we use Clue 2a to find Kevin's noon count, K_n.
We have K_m + K_n = 122 and we found K_m = 78.
Substituting the value of K_m:
78 + K_n = 122
K_n = 122 - 78
K_n = 44

Now we have all six counts:
K_m = 78
K_n = 44
K_e = 121
S_m = 84
S_n = 52
S_e = 98

Let's verify these values against the original clues:
1. S_n = S_m - 32 => 52 = 84 - 32 => 52 = 52 (Correct)
2. K_m + K_n = 122 => 78 + 44 = 122 => 122 = 122 (Correct)
   K_m + K_n = K_e + 1 => 122 = 121 + 1 => 122 = 122 (Correct)
   K_m + K_n = S_e + 24 => 122 = 98 + 24 => 122 = 122 (Correct)
3. K_m = (S_m + S_n + S_e) / 3 => 78 = (84 + 52 + 98) / 3 => 78 = 234 / 3 => 78 = 78 (Correct)
4. K_e = S_m + 37 => 121 = 84 + 37 => 121 = 121 (Correct)
All values are consistent with the clues.

Now we calculate the day's average. The average is the sum of all six counts divided by 6.
Sum = K_m + K_n + K_e + S_m + S_n + S_e
Sum = 78 + 44 + 121 + 84 + 52 + 98
Sum = 122 + 121 + 84 + 52 + 98
Sum = 243 + 84 + 52 + 98
Sum = 327 + 52 + 98

You do not have any time or distance measuring tools and the length of the rope is unknown.  How can you measure 75 minutes?
 Hint: Set distance and time relations and equations",Set distance and time relations and equations,"Mark the two ropes as Rope(A) and Rope(B).
1. Let Mouse(A) and Mouse(C) start biting off Rope(A) at the same time, starting each from  one end (moving in opposite directions).  At the same time, let Mouse(B) start biting off Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(A) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X = S(A) * 60, where S(A) is biting speed for Mouse(A) and X is Rope(A) length
X = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X is Rope(A) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(A)/S(C) = 3:1, which means that for each 3 units Mouse(A) will move, Mouse (C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(A) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(A) bites off three times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides Rope(A) length in to 4 units.
Mouse(A) bitten off portion = 3/4 X (where X is Rope(A) length)
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/4 X
Finding the time spent before Rope(A) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(A) needs  60 minutes to bite off X, How many minutes are needed to bite off 3/4 X?
Minutes needed = 3/4 * 60 = 45 minutes are needed to fully bite off Rope(A) by Mouse(A) and Mouse(C).  At that point in time, Mouse(B) would have bitten off exactly half the length of Rope(B) (needing 90 minutes to bite off the full rope), and needs an additional 45 minutes to bite off the remaining rope half.
2. Let Mouse(B) continue biting off Rope(B) and make Mouse(C) start biting off the other end of Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(B) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X/2 = S(B) * 90, where S(B) is biting speed for Mouse(B) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
X/2 = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(B)/S(C) = 2:1, which means that for each 2 units Mouse(B) will move, Mouse(C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(B) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(B) bites off two times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides the remaining half of Rope(B) length to 3 units.

This contains nine ones, so it is divisible by 9, and two 0's at the end, so it is divisible by 25.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let $N$ be the total number of gums Rob ate.
According to the problem, Rob finished all of his packages, and each package contains 225 gums. This means the total number of gums $N$ must be a multiple of 225. So, $N = 225k$ for some positive integer $k$.

The problem states that the number of gums $N$, when written in base 10, contains nothing but the digits 1 and 0.
We are looking for the minimum such number $N$.

Since $N$ is a multiple of 225, and $225 = 9 \times 25 = 3^2 \times 5^2$, $N$ must be divisible by both 9 and 25.

The divisibility rule for 25 states that a number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since the digits of $N$ can only be 0 or 1, the last two digits of $N$ must be 00. So $N$ must end in 00.

The divisibility rule for 9 states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. Since the digits of $N$ can only be 0 or 1, the sum of the digits of $N$ is simply the number of 1's in its decimal representation. Let $n_1$ be the number of 1's in $N$. Then $n_1$ must be a multiple of 9. Since $N$ is a positive number (Rob ate some gums), $N$ must contain at least one digit 1, so $n_1 \ge 1$. The possible values for $n_1$ are 9, 18, 27, and so on. To find the minimum number $N$, we should consider the smallest possible values for $n_1$ first.

Let's start with the smallest possible value for the sum of digits, which is $n_1 = 9$. This means $N$ must contain exactly nine digits equal to 1.

We know $N$ must end in 00. Let the decimal representation of $N$ be $d_m d_{m-1} \dots d_2 d_1 d_0$. We know $d_1=0$ and $d_0=0$. The other digits $d_m, \dots, d_2$ must be either 0 or 1. The sum of all digits is $d_m + \dots + d_2 + d_1 + d_0 = d_m + \dots + d_2$. This sum must be equal to $n_1 = 9$.

So, among the digits $d_m, d_{m-1}, \dots, d_2$, exactly nine of them must be 1, and the rest must be 0. The number of these digits is $m-2+1 = m-1$. Since exactly 9 of these digits are 1, the total number of these digits must be at least 9. So $m-1 \ge 9$, which means $m \ge 10$.
The total number of digits in $N$ is $m+1$. The minimum number of digits is $10+1=11$.

Let's consider the case where $N$ has the minimum possible number of digits, which is 11. So $m=10$. The digits are $d_{10} d_9 \dots d_2 d_1 d_0$. We know $d_1=0$ and $d_0=0$. The remaining digits are $d_{10}, d_9, \dots, d_2$. There are $10-2+1 = 9$ such digits. The sum of these 9 digits must be 9 (since the total sum of digits is 9). Since each of these digits can only be 0 or 1, the only way for their sum to be 9 is if all 9 digits are equal to 1.
So, $d_{10}=1, d_9=1, \dots, d_2=1$.
This determines the number $N$ completely: $N = 11111111100$.

Let's check if this number satisfies all conditions:
1. It consists only of digits 1 and 0: Yes, it is $11,111,111,100$.
2. It is a multiple of 225:
   - The sum of its digits is $9 \times 1 + 2 \times 0 = 9$, which is divisible by 9.
   - It ends in 00, so it is divisible by 25.
   - Since it is divisible by both 9 and 25, and $\gcd(9, 25)=1$, it is divisible by $9 \times 25 = 225$.

So, the number $11111111100$ satisfies the conditions. We need to confirm it is the *minimum* such number.
We found that the minimum number of digits is 11 when the sum of digits is 9. For an 11-digit number ending in 00 with a sum of digits 9, the digits $d_{10}, \dots, d_2$ must all be 1, which leads uniquely to $11111111100$.

What if the sum of digits is 18? Then we need eighteen 1's. The number must end in 00. So we need at least 18 digits equal to 1 and at least 2 digits equal to 0 (at the end). The minimum number of digits in this case would be $18 + 2 = 20$. The smallest such number would have eighteen 1's followed by two 0's: $11111111111111111100$. This is a 20-digit number. Any 20-digit number is much larger than any 11-digit number (the smallest 20-digit number is $10^{19}$, while $11111111100$ is approximately $1.1 \times 10^{10}$).
Higher multiples of 9 for the sum of digits will lead to numbers with even more digits, hence even larger numbers.

Therefore, the smallest number satisfying the conditions is indeed the one with the smallest possible sum of digits (9) and the minimum number of digits (11), which is $11111111100$.

= 88++9
= 88 + (9 *2)
= 88 + 18
= 106",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let's analyze the given examples to determine the rules for the operators '**' and '++'.
We are given:
1) 3**5 = 27 but 5**3 = 35
2) 4++8 = 20 but 8++4 = 16

Let the operator '**' be represented by the function f(a, b), so f(3, 5) = 27 and f(5, 3) = 35.
Let the operator '++' be represented by the function g(a, b), so g(4, 8) = 20 and g(8, 4) = 16.

The hint suggests that both operators use some combination of multiplication and addition. It also suggests relating the change in digits on each side with the differences in the outputs. Let's consider how the output changes when the operands are swapped (a, b) vs (b, a).

For the operator '**':
f(3, 5) = 27 and f(5, 3) = 35.
The difference in outputs is f(5, 3) - f(3, 5) = 35 - 27 = 8.
The difference in the operands in the order (a, b) then (b, a) is (b-a) = 5-3 = 2. Or (a-b) = 3-5 = -2.
Let's try to find a function f(a, b) involving multiplication and addition of a and b. Possible forms include A*a + B*b, a*b + k*a, a*b + k*b, etc.
Let's assume f(a, b) has the form A*a + B*b.
A*3 + B*5 = 27
A*5 + B*3 = 35
Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:
(5A - 3A) + (3B - 5B) = 35 - 27
2A - 2B = 8
A - B = 4, so A = B + 4.
Substitute A = B + 4 into the first equation:
(B + 4)*3 + B*5 = 27
3B + 12 + 5B = 27
8B + 12 = 27
8B = 15
B = 15/8. This leads to fractional coefficients, which might be valid but let's explore other possibilities based on the hint.

The hint connects the difference in outputs to the change in inputs. Let's consider the difference f(a, b) - f(b, a).
We observed f(5, 3) - f(3, 5) = 8.
Let's assume f(a, b) is of the form a*b + k*a.
f(a, b) = a*b + k*a
f(3, 5) = 3*5 + k*3 = 15 + 3k = 27 => 3k = 12 => k = 4.
Let's check if f(5, 3) with k=4 matches the given value.
f(5, 3) = 5*3 + 4*5 = 15 + 20 = 35. This matches the given value.
So, the rule for '**' is a**b = a*b + 4a.
Let's verify this rule with the hint about the difference when swapping.
f(a, b) - f(b, a) = (a*b + 4a) - (b*a + 4b) = ab + 4a - ab - 4b = 4a - 4b = 4(a-b).
For (3, 5), f(3, 5) - f(5, 3) = 27 - 35 = -8. And 4(3-5) = 4(-2) = -8. This matches the hint's implied relationship (the difference in output is proportional to the difference in input operands).

Now let's analyze the operator '++'.
g(4, 8) = 20 and g(8, 4) = 16.
The difference in outputs is g(8, 4) - g(4, 8) = 16 - 20 = -4.
The difference in operands is (a-b) = 4-8 = -4 or (b-a) = 8-4 = 4.
The difference in output (-4) is -1 times the difference in the first operand minus the second operand (4-8 = -4).
Let's try to find a function g(a, b) using multiplication and addition.
Let's assume g(a, b) is of the form A*a + B*b.
A*4 + B*8 = 20
A*8 + B*4 = 16
Multiply the first equation by 4 and the second by 8:
16A + 32B = 80
64A + 32B = 128
Subtract the first equation from the second:
(64A - 16A) + (32B - 32B) = 128 - 80
48A = 48
A = 1.
Substitute A = 1 into the first equation:
1*4 + B*8 = 20
4 + 8B = 20
8B = 16
B = 2.
So, g(a, b) = 1*a + 2*b = a + 2b.
Let's check if this rule matches the second example g(8, 4).
g(8, 4) = 8 + 2*4 = 8 + 8 = 16. This matches the given value.
So, the rule for '++' is a++b = a + 2b.
Let's verify this rule with the hint about the difference when swapping.
g(a, b) - g(b, a) = (a + 2b) - (b + 2a) = a + 2b - b - 2a = b - a = -(a-b).
For (4, 8), g(4, 8) - g(8, 4) = 20 - 16 = 4. And -(4-8) = -(-4) = 4. This matches the hint's implied relationship.

We have derived the rules for the operators:
a**b = a*b + 4a
a++b = a + 2b

Now, we need to calculate the expression (8**7)++9.
First, evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 8**7.
Using the rule a**b = a*b + 4a with a=8 and b=7:
8**7 = 8*7 + 4*8 = 56 + 32 = 88.

Next, evaluate the outer expression: 88++9.
Using the rule a++b = a + 2b with a=88 and b=9:
88++9 = 88 + 2*9 = 88 + 18 = 106.

The result of (8**7)++9 is 106.

 Hint: The number of trailing zeros is equivalent to the number of factors of 10",The number of trailing zeros is equivalent to the number of factors of 10,"The ! stands for factorial.  So, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!
The only way to get a trailing zero is by multiplying a factor of 1000! which is 2 by a factor of 1000! which is 5. The modified problem is thus: How many such pairs of factors are there?
There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5.

Finally there is 1 = [1000/625] number which is a multiple of 625, this gives one further factor of 5. Thus there are exactly  200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249 factors of 5 in 1000! and since there are more than sufficient factors of 2, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"To find the number of trailing zeros in the number 1000!, we need to determine the number of times 10 is a factor in its prime factorization.
The number 10 is a product of the prime numbers 2 and 5 ($10 = 2 \times 5$). Therefore, the number of factors of 10 in 1000! is limited by the number of pairs of factors of 2 and 5 in its prime factorization.
The number of factors of a prime number $p$ in the prime factorization of $n!$ is given by Legendre's formula:
$E_p(n!) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \rfloor$

In this problem, $n = 1000$, and we are interested in the prime factors 2 and 5. The number of factors of 10 in 1000! is $\min(E_2(1000!), E_5(1000!))$.

First, let's calculate the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of 1000!, denoted by $E_5(1000!)$:
$E_5(1000!) = \lfloor \frac{1000}{5} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{5^2} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{5^3} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{5^4} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{5^5} \rfloor + ...$
We continue adding terms as long as the denominator is less than or equal to 1000. The powers of 5 are $5^1 = 5$, $5^2 = 25$, $5^3 = 125$, $5^4 = 625$, $5^5 = 3125$. Since $3125 > 1000$, we only need to sum the first four terms.
$E_5(1000!) = \lfloor \frac{1000}{5} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{25} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{125} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{625} \rfloor$
$E_5(1000!) = \lfloor 200 \rfloor + \lfloor 40 \rfloor + \lfloor 8 \rfloor + \lfloor 1.6 \rfloor$
$E_5(1000!) = 200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249$.

Next, let's calculate the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of 1000!, denoted by $E_2(1000!)$:
$E_2(1000!) = \lfloor \frac{1000}{2} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{2^2} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{2^3} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{2^4} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{2^5} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{2^6} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{2^7} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{2^8} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{2^9} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{2^{10}} \rfloor + ...$
The powers of 2 are $2^1 = 2$, $2^2 = 4$, $2^3 = 8$, $2^4 = 16$, $2^5 = 32$, $2^6 = 64$, $2^7 = 128$, $2^8 = 256$, $2^9 = 512$, $2^{10} = 1024$. Since $1024 > 1000$, we stop at $2^9$.
$E_2(1000!) = \lfloor \frac{1000}{2} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{4} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{8} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{16} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{32} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{64} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{128} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{256} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{1000}{512} \rfloor$
$E_2(1000!) = \lfloor 500 \rfloor + \lfloor 250 \rfloor + \lfloor 125 \rfloor + \lfloor 62.5 \rfloor + \lfloor 31.25 \rfloor + \lfloor 15.625 \rfloor + \lfloor 7.8125 \rfloor + \lfloor 3.90625 \rfloor + \lfloor 1.953125 \rfloor$
$E_2(1000!) = 500 + 250 + 125 + 62 + 31 + 15 + 7 + 3 + 1 = 994$.

The number of factors of 10 is the minimum of the number of factors of 2 and 5:
Number of trailing zeros = $\min(E_2(1000!), E_5(1000!)) = \min(994, 249)$.
The minimum is 249.

Alternatively, we can observe that for any positive integer $n$, the number of factors of 2 in $n!$ is always greater than or equal to the number of factors of 5 in $n!$. This is because multiples of 2 occur more frequently than multiples of 5 in the sequence of integers from 1 to $n$. Thus, $E_2(n!) \ge E_5(n!)$ for $n \ge 1$.
Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in $n!$ is equal to $E_5(n!)$.
In this case, the number of trailing zeros in 1000! is $E_5(1000!)$, which we calculated to be 249.

According to the second cadet, ""the number of legs they now had was equal to the square of the number of sharks."" Let $L$ be the total number of legs the cadets had after the fight.
$L = S^2$
The number of legs must be a non-negative integer. Since $S$ is a positive integer, $S^2$ will be a positive integer.

According to the third cadet, ""the number of cadet legs was 14 more than the total number of cadet and shark heads."" The number of cadet heads is $C$ (each cadet has one head). The number of shark heads is $S$ (each shark has one head). The total number of cadet and shark heads is $C + S$.
$L = (C + S) + 14$

We have a system of three equations:
1) $C = 4S$
2) $L = S^2$
3) $L = C + S + 14$

We want to find the value of $S$. We can use substitution to eliminate $C$ and $L$.

Substitute the expression for $C$ from equation (1) into equation (3):
$L = (4S) + S + 14$
$L = 5S + 14$

Now we have two different expressions for $L$:
From equation (2): $L = S^2$
From the substituted equation: $L = 5S + 14$

Set these two expressions for $L$ equal to each other:
$S^2 = 5S + 14$

Rearrange the equation into a standard quadratic form by moving all terms to one side:
$S^2 - 5S - 14 = 0$

We can solve this quadratic equation for $S$ by factoring. We need to find two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. The pairs of factors of 14 are (1, 14) and (2, 7). Since the product is negative, one factor is positive and the other is negative. Since the sum is negative, the larger absolute value factor must be negative. Let's check the pairs with a negative sign: (1, -14) gives a sum of 1 - 14 = -13; (2, -7) gives a sum of 2 - 7 = -5. The correct pair of numbers is 2 and -7.

Factor the quadratic equation:
$(S + 2)(S - 7) = 0$

This gives two possible solutions for $S$:
$S + 2 = 0 \implies S = -2$
$S - 7 = 0 \implies S = 7$

Since $S$ represents the number of sharks, it must be a positive integer. The solution $S = -2$ is not physically possible. Therefore, the only valid solution is $S = 7$.

Let's verify this solution with the given information.
If $S = 7$ sharks, then the number of cadets is $C = 4S = 4 \times 7 = 28$.
The number of cadet legs after the fight is $L = S^2 = 7^2 = 49$.
According to the third cadet's statement, $L$ should be equal to $C + S + 14$. Let's calculate this value: $C + S + 14 = 28 + 7 + 14 = 35 + 14 = 49$.
This matches the value of $L$ calculated from the second cadet's statement, $L=49$. The numbers are consistent with all conditions.

The problem states that ""all of the sharks were killed"". The number of sharks killed is equal to the initial number of sharks, which is $S$.
We found that $S = 7$.

The number of sharks killed was 7.

The final answer is $\boxed{7}$.",True,1,0

During a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%. After a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, the cost of a Red Rose bouquet  decreases by 162 Roka (Roka being the native Romankachi currency). After another year in which there was inflation once more followed by a slowdown, the cost of this bouquet reduces by a further 147.42 Roka. What was the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet ?
 Hint: Everything can be expressed and solvd in terms of the original price of the bouquet and the inflation rate",Everything can be expressed and solvd in terms of the original price of the bouquet and the inflation rate,"The original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.
Let the original price of the Red Rose bouquet  be 'B' Roka.
It is given that during a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%.
Hence after a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 162 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)
(since B(1+Y) is the price during inflation and  B(1-Y)(1+Y) the price during the slowdown)
Therefore the decrease in price after one year
= B - B(1-Y^2)
= B - B + B*Y^2
= B*Y^2 = 162      ... Equation 1
Hence after another year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 147.42 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)(1-Y^2)
= B(1-Y^2)^2
(since B(1-Y^2) is the price at the end of the previous year and           B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y) the price during the slowdown this year)
Therefore the decrease in price this year
= B(1-Y^2) - B(1-Y^2)^2
= B(1-Y^2)[1 - (1-Y^2)]
= B(1-Y^2)( Y^2) = 147.42    ... Equation 2
Dividing Equation 2 by Equation 1, we get
(1-Y^2) = 0.91 => Y^2 = 0.09
Substituting the above value of Y^2 in equation 1, we get
B*0.09 = 162
Hence B = 162/0.09 = 1800 Roka.
Therefore the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let P0 be the original price of the Red Rose bouquet in Roka.
Let Y% be the rate of price change, where Y is a positive number. Let r = Y/100 be the rate as a decimal.
During inflation, the price increases by Y%, which means the price is multiplied by (1 + r).
During a slowdown, the price decreases by Y% of the existing price, which means the price is multiplied by (1 - r).

In the first year, there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown.
The price after inflation is P0 * (1 + r).
The price after the subsequent slowdown is [P0 * (1 + r)] * (1 - r) = P0 * (1 + r)(1 - r) = P0 * (1 - r^2).
Let P1 be the price after the first year. So, P1 = P0 * (1 - r^2).

The problem states that the cost decreases by 162 Roka after the first year.
This means the difference between the original price and the price after the first year is 162.
P0 - P1 = 162.
Substituting the expression for P1:
P0 - P0 * (1 - r^2) = 162.
P0 - P0 + P0 * r^2 = 162.
P0 * r^2 = 162. This is our first equation.

In the second year, the process repeats, starting from the price at the beginning of the second year, which is P1.
The price after inflation is P1 * (1 + r).
The price after the subsequent slowdown is [P1 * (1 + r)] * (1 - r) = P1 * (1 + r)(1 - r) = P1 * (1 - r^2).
Let P2 be the price after the second year. So, P2 = P1 * (1 - r^2).

The problem states that the cost reduces by a further 147.42 Roka after the second year.
This means the difference between the price after the first year (P1) and the price after the second year (P2) is 147.42.
P1 - P2 = 147.42.
Substituting the expression for P2:
P1 - P1 * (1 - r^2) = 147.42.
P1 - P1 + P1 * r^2 = 147.42.
P1 * r^2 = 147.42. This is our second equation.

We have a system of two equations:
1) P0 * r^2 = 162
2) P1 * r^2 = 147.42

We also know from the first year's decrease that P1 = P0 - 162.
Substitute this expression for P1 into the second equation:
(P0 - 162) * r^2 = 147.42.

Now we have two equations involving P0 and r^2:
a) P0 * r^2 = 162
b) (P0 - 162) * r^2 = 147.42

From equation (a), since P0 is a price and must be positive, we can write r^2 = 162 / P0.
Substitute this expression for r^2 into equation (b):
(P0 - 162) * (162 / P0) = 147.42.

Multiply both sides by P0 to clear the denominator:
(P0 - 162) * 162 = 147.42 * P0.
Distribute the 162 on the left side:
162 * P0 - 162 * 162 = 147.42 * P0.
162 * P0 - 162^2 = 147.42 * P0.

Rearrange the terms to solve for P0:
162 * P0 - 147.42 * P0 = 162^2.
(162 - 147.42) * P0 = 162^2.
14.58 * P0 = 162^2.

Calculate 162^2:
162 * 162 = 26244.

So, 14.58 * P0 = 26244.
Now, solve for P0:
P0 = 26244 / 14.58.

To perform the division, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 100 to remove the decimal point:
P0 = (26244 * 100) / (14.58 * 100).
P0 = 2624400 / 1458.

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor or by successive divisions.
Let's divide by 2:
P0 = 1312200 / 729.
We know that 729 = 9^3 = 3^6. Let's check for divisibility by 9.
Sum of digits of 1312200 is 1+3+1+2+2+0+0 = 9, so it's divisible by 9.
1312200 / 9 = 145800.
P0 = 145800 / 81.
Sum of digits of 145800 is 1+4+5+8+0+0 = 18, which is divisible by 9.
145800 / 9 = 16200.
P0 = 16200 / 9.
16200 / 9 = 1800.

So, the original price P0 is 1800 Roka.

Let's verify the answer.
If P0 = 1800, then P0 * r^2 = 162 gives 1800 * r^2 = 162, so r^2 = 162/1800 = 9/100. Thus r = 3/10 = 0.3 (or Y = 30%).
P1 = P0 - 162 = 1800 - 162 = 1638.
Also, P1 = P0 * (1 - r^2) = 1800 * (1 - 0.09) = 1800 * 0.91 = 1638. This matches.
The decrease in the second year is P1 * r^2 = 1638 * 0.09.
1638 * 0.09 = 1638 * 9 / 100 = 14742 / 100 = 147.42.
The decrease in the second year is 147.42 Roka, which matches the problem statement.
The price after the second year is P2 = P1 - 147.42 = 1638 - 147.42 = 1490.58.
Also, P2 = P1 * (1 - r^2) = 1638 * (1 - 0.09) = 1638 * 0.91 = 1490.58. This matches.

All conditions are satisfied. The original price of the Red Rose bouquet was 1800 Roka.

151,"Question: In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.
On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.

After labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, ""Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof. First, I mark a line from A to D.  This creates a trapezoid (trapezium in Britain) ABCD.  Next, I mark the lines EH, BG, and CF.  These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.""
The partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon.

 Hint: Rates problem--use the same algebraic techniques",Rates problem--use the same algebraic techniques,"The cow, the goat, and the goose eat grass with a constant speed (amount per day): v1 for the cow, v2 for the goat, v3 for the goose.
The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:
v1 = 3 x h/180,
v2 = 2 x h/180,
v3 = 1 x h/180,
k = 1 x h/180.
Then holds for the time t that the three animals can graze together: h-tx(v1+v2+v3-k) = 0, so t = h/(v1+v2+v3-k) = h/(3xh/180+2xh/180+1xh/180-1xh/180) = 36.

 Hint: 1?? x 3? = ?254",1?? x 3? = ?254,186 x 39 = 7254,GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"The problem asks us to complete the equation `??? x 3? = ????` using each digit from 1 to 9 exactly once. The hint provided is `1?? x 3? = ?254`.

Let the 3-digit number be $N_1$ and the 2-digit number be $N_2$. Let the product be $P$.
The equation is $N_1 \times N_2 = P$.
The digits used in $N_1$, $N_2$, and $P$ together must be a permutation of the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
$N_1$ has 3 digits, $N_2$ has 2 digits, and $P$ has 4 digits. Total digits = $3 + 2 + 4 = 9$.

From the hint, $N_1$ starts with 1, and $N_2$ starts with 3. Also, $P$ ends with 254.
So the equation is of the form $1BC \times 3D = F254$, where A=1, the first digit of $N_2$ is 3, the second digit of $P$ is 2, the third digit of $P$ is 5, and the fourth digit of $P$ is 4.
The digits already fixed are {1, 3, 2, 5, 4}. These are 5 distinct digits.
The remaining digits are {6, 7, 8, 9}. These four digits must fill the remaining positions: the second digit of $N_1$ (B), the third digit of $N_1$ (C), the second digit of $N_2$ (D), and the first digit of $P$ (F).
So, the set $\{B, C, D, F\}$ must be equal to the set $\{6, 7, 8, 9\}$. These four digits must be distinct.

The equation is $1BC \times 3D = F254$.
The units digit of the product $F254$ is 4. The units digit of the product is obtained by multiplying the units digits of $N_1$ and $N_2$. The units digit of $N_1$ is C and the units digit of $N_2$ is D.
So, $C \times D \pmod{10} = 4$.
C and D are distinct digits from the set {6, 7, 8, 9}. Let's list the possible products of distinct pairs from this set and check their units digits:
$6 \times 7 = 42$ (ends in 2)
$6 \times 8 = 48$ (ends in 8)
$6 \times 9 = 54$ (ends in 4)
$7 \times 8 = 56$ (ends in 6)
$7 \times 9 = 63$ (ends in 3)
$8 \times 9 = 72$ (ends in 2)

The only pairs (C, D) from {6, 7, 8, 9} such that $C \times D$ ends in 4 are (6, 9) and (9, 6).

Case 1: C = 6 and D = 9.
The digits {B, F} must be the remaining digits from {6, 7, 8, 9} after removing 6 and 9, which is {7, 8}. So B and F are distinct digits from {7, 8}.
The equation is $1B6 \times 39 = F254$.
If B = 7, then F must be 8. The equation becomes $176 \times 39 = F254$.
Let's calculate $176 \times 39$:
$176 \times 39 = 176 \times (40 - 1) = 176 \times 40 - 176 = 7040 - 176 = 6864$.
The product is 6864. This should be in the form $F254$.
Here, F = 6. This contradicts our assumption that F = 8.
Let's check the digits used: {1, 7, 6} for 176, {3, 9} for 39, {6, 8, 6, 4} for 6864. The set of all digits is {1, 7, 6, 3, 9, 6, 8, 4}. The digit 6 is repeated in 176 and 6864. This is not a valid solution as all digits from 1 to 9 must be used exactly once.

If B = 8, then F must be 7. The equation becomes $186 \times 39 = F254$.
Let's calculate $186 \times 39$:
$186 \times 39 = 186 \times (40 - 1) = 186 \times 40 - 186 = 7440 - 186 = 7254$.
The product is 7254. This should be in the form $F254$.
Here, F = 7. This is consistent with our assumption that F = 7.
Let's check the digits used: {1, 8, 6} for 186, {3, 9} for 39, {7, 2, 5, 4} for 7254. The set of all digits used is {1, 8, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2, 5, 4}. This set is exactly {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
All digits from 1 to 9 are used exactly once. The equation is $186 \times 39 = 7254$. This matches the form $1BC \times 3D = F254$ with B=8, C=6, D=9, F=7.
This is a valid solution.

Case 2: C = 9 and D = 6.
The digits {B, F} must be the remaining digits from {6, 7, 8, 9} after removing 9 and 6, which is {7, 8}. So B and F are distinct digits from {7, 8}.
The equation is $1B9 \times 36 = F254$.
If B = 7, then F must be 8. The equation becomes $179 \times 36 = F254$.
Let's calculate $179 \times 36$:
$179 \times 36 = 179 \times (30 + 6) = 179 \times 30 + 179 \times 6 = 5370 + 1074 = 6444$.
The product is 6444. This should be in the form $F254$. The last two digits are 44, not 54. Also the second digit is 4, not 2. This does not match.

If B = 8, then F must be 7. The equation becomes $189 \times 36 = F254$.
Let's calculate $189 \times 36$:
$189 \times 36 = 189 \times (40 - 4) = 189 \times 40 - 189 \times 4 = 7560 - 756 = 6804$.
The product is 6804. This should be in the form $F254$. The second digit is 8, not 2. This does not match.

Thus, the only valid solution that fits the hint and uses all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once is $186 \times 39 = 7254$.
The completed equation is $186 \times 39 = 7254$.

The final answer is $\boxed{186 \times 39 = 7254}$.",True,1,0

Now the nth person will know (n-1) people; (n-1)th person will know (n-2) people because no one knows the same number of people; similarly (n-2)th person will known (n-3) people. Thus, the 2nd person will know 1 person. Hence the 1st person[say A] will know 0 people or will know no one. Now since the nth person knows every one, he knows A .Therefore A knows the nth person. Hence our supposition is wrong and at least 2 people know the same number of people.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let $n$ be the number of people at the party. Let $V = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$ be the set of people. We assume $n \ge 2$, as the statement refers to ""two people"".

Let $k_i$ be the number of people that person $v_i$ knows.
We are given two conditions about the ""knowing"" relationship:
1. If person A knows person B, then person B knows person A. This means the relationship is symmetric.
2. Everyone knows himself or herself.

Let $N(v_i)$ be the set of people that person $v_i$ knows. The number of people $v_i$ knows is $k_i = |N(v_i)|$.

From condition 2, $v_i \in N(v_i)$ for all $i \in \{1, \dots, n\}$. This means that for each person $v_i$, the set $N(v_i)$ contains at least $v_i$ itself. Thus, $k_i = |N(v_i)| \ge 1$.

Since $N(v_i)$ is a subset of the set of all people $V = \{v_1, \dots, v_n\}$, the maximum number of people $v_i$ can know is $n$. Thus, $k_i = |N(v_i)| \le n$.

Combining these, the number of people $v_i$ knows, $k_i$, must be an integer in the set $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$. So, for every $i \in \{1, \dots, n\}$, $k_i \in \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.

We want to prove that there exist two distinct people $v_i$ and $v_j$ ($i \ne j$) such that $k_i = k_j$. We will use indirect reasoning as suggested by the hint.

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that no two people at the party know the same number of people. This means that the values $k_1, k_2, \dots, k_n$ are all distinct.
Since there are $n$ people, there are $n$ distinct values for the number of people known. These $n$ distinct values must be chosen from the set $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$. The only way to have $n$ distinct integers in this set is if the set of values $\{k_1, k_2, \dots, k_n\}$ is exactly $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.

So, under our assumption, the numbers of people known by the $n$ individuals are $1, 2, \dots, n$ in some order. This means:
- There exists exactly one person who knows exactly 1 person.
- There exists exactly one person who knows exactly 2 people.
- ...
- There exists exactly one person who knows exactly $n$ people.

Let $v_a$ be the person who knows exactly 1 person. So $k_a = 1$.
Let $v_b$ be the person who knows exactly $n$ people. So $k_b = n$.

Since we assumed $n \ge 2$, the number of people known by $v_a$ (which is 1) is different from the number of people known by $v_b$ (which is $n$). Therefore, $v_a$ and $v_b$ must be distinct people; $v_a \ne v_b$.

Consider the person $v_b$, who knows exactly $n$ people. Since there are only $n$ people at the party, $v_b$ knows everyone. This means that for any person $v_j \in V$, $v_b$ knows $v_j$. In particular, $v_b$ knows $v_a$. So $v_a \in N(v_b)$.

Now we use condition 1: if A knows B, then B knows A (symmetry). Since $v_b$ knows $v_a$, it follows that $v",True,0,0

The digit 7 is absent from this sum.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"The binomial expansion of $(x+y)^n$ is given by $\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k$. The coefficients of the expansion are $\binom{n}{k}$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, n$. In this problem, $n = 123456789$. The coefficients are $\binom{123456789}{k}$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, 123456789$.

The binomial coefficients are symmetric, i.e., $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}$.
For $n \ge 2$, the sequence of coefficients starts with $\binom{n}{0}, \binom{n}{1}, \binom{n}{2}, \ldots$ and ends with $\ldots, \binom{n}{n-2}, \binom{n}{n-1}, \binom{n}{n}$.
The values of these coefficients are:
$\binom{n}{0} = 1$
$\binom{n}{1} = n$
$\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$
$\binom{n}{3} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}$
...
$\binom{n}{n-2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$
$\binom{n}{n-1} = n$
$\binom{n}{n} = 1$

We are given $n = 123456789$. Since $n$ is a large integer greater than 3, we can compare the values of the first few coefficients:
$\binom{n}{0} = 1$
$\binom{n}{1} = n = 123456789$
$\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \frac{123456789 \times 123456788}{2}$

Comparing these values:
$1 < n$ since $n = 123456789$.
Comparing $n$ and $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$:
$\frac{n(n-1)}{2} - n = \frac{n(n-1) - 2n}{2} = \frac{n^2 - n - 2n}{2} = \frac{n^2 - 3n}{2} = \frac{n(n-3)}{2}$.
Since $n = 123456789 > 3$, $\frac{n(n-3)}{2} > 0$, so $n < \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.

Thus, for $n = 123456789$, the smallest coefficient value is 1, the next smallest is $n$, and the next smallest is $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.
The coefficient value 1 appears twice: $\binom{n}{0}$ and $\binom{n}{n}$.
The coefficient value $n$ appears twice: $\binom{n}{1}$ and $\binom{n}{n-1}$.
The coefficient value $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ appears twice: $\binom{n}{2}$ and $\binom{n}{n-2}$.

The ordered list of coefficient values starts with 1, 1, $n$, $n$, $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, \frac{n(n-1)}{2}, \ldots$.
The four smallest coefficients are therefore $1, 1, n, n$. This is consistent with the hint provided, which states the smallest coefficients are 1, 1, c, and c for $(a+b)^c$.

The sum of the four smallest coefficients is $1 + 1 + n + n = 2 + 2n$.
Substitute the value of $n = 123456789$:
Sum $= 2 + 2 \times 123456789$.
First, calculate $2 \times 123456789$:
$2 \times 123456789 = 246913578$.
Now, add 2 to this product:
Sum $= 2 + 246913578 = 246913580$.

The problem states that this sum is a nine-digit number with each digit being a distinct number from the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0\}$.
The sum is 246913580, which is indeed a nine-digit number.

$o_2(10) = 90 = 10 \times 9 = 10 \times (10-1)$
$o_2(11) = 110 = 11 \times 10 = 11 \times (11-1)$
$o_2(12) = 132 = 12 \times 11 = 12 \times (12-1)$
$o_2(13) = 156 = 13 \times 12 = 13 \times (13-1)$
The pattern for the second output number is $o_2(n) = n(n-1) = n^2 - n$.

Now we can find the formula for the first output number $o_1(n)$ using the sum $S(n) = o_1(n) + o_2(n)$:
$o_1(n) = S(n) - o_2(n)$
$o_1(n) = (n^3 - n^2) - (n^2 - n)$
$o_1(n) = n^3 - n^2 - n^2 + n$
$o_1(n) = n^3 - 2n^2 + n$
This can be factored as $o_1(n) = n(n^2 - 2n + 1) = n(n-1)^2$.

Let's verify the formulas for $o_1(n)$ and $o_2(n)$ with the given examples:
For $n=9$: $o_1(9) = 9(9-1)^2 = 9 \times 8^2 = 9 \times 64 = 576$. $o_2(9) = 9(9-1) = 9 \times 8 = 72$. Correct.
For $n=10$: $o_1(10) = 10(10-1)^2 = 10 \times 9^2 = 10 \times 81 = 810$. $o_2(10) = 10(10-1) = 10 \times 9 = 90$. Correct.
The formulas hold for all given examples.

We need to find the output when the input is $n=25$.
Using the derived formulas:
$o_1(25) = 25(25-1)^2 = 25(24)^2 = 25 \times 576$
$o_1(25) = 14400$
$o_2(25) = 25(25-1) = 25 \times 24$
$o_2(25) = 600$

The two numbers that come out when 25 goes in are 14400 and 600.
Observing the examples, the first number listed is always the larger number.
Let's compare $o_1(25)$ and $o_2(25)$: $14400 > 600$.
So, the output should be presented as 14400 and 600, in that order as indicated by the examples' format.

The final answer is 14400 and 600.

Final answer: 14400 & 600",True,1,0
169,"Question: Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.
We were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?
 Hint: Find numbers who do not have a duplicate that will be deleted",Find numbers who do not have a duplicate that will be deleted,"It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.
Hence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.
Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90. These 90 id's will not have a corresponding number when written in reverse order.
Secondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order. For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.
Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.
Therefore total number of valid employee id's possible = 90 + 90 + 360 = 540.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,,True,0,0

 Hint: Two of the prices should add to the third price and multiply to 2 to produce equality",Two of the prices should add to the third price and multiply to 2 to produce equality,"£2.85*£1.60*£1.25= £5.70
£2.85+£1.60+£1.25=£5.70",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the prices of the three magazines in pounds sterling be $P_1, P_2,$ and $P_3$. The problem states that the sum of the prices is the same as the product of the prices, and this value is £5.70.
We can write these conditions as:
1) $P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 5.70$
2) $P_1 \times P_2 \times P_3 = 5.70$

The hint provides a relationship between the prices. It states, ""Two of the prices should add to the third price and multiply to 2 to produce equality"". Let's assume, without loss of generality, that $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the two prices that add to the third price $P_3$. So, the first part of the hint gives us:
3) $P_1 + P_2 = P_3$

Now let's use this relationship with the given conditions. Substitute equation (3) into equation (1):
$(P_1 + P_2) + P_3 = 5.70$
$P_3 + P_3 = 5.70$
$2 P_3 = 5.70$
$P_3 = \frac{5.70}{2} = 2.85$

So, one of the prices is £2.85.

Now substitute equation (3) into equation (2):
$(P_1 \times P_2) \times P_3 = 5.70$

We know $P_3 = 2.85$, so substitute this value into the equation:
$(P_1 \times P_2) \times 2.85 = 5.70$
$P_1 \times P_2 = \frac{5.70}{2.85}$
$P_1 \times P_2 = 2$

The second part of the hint states that the two prices that add to the third price should ""multiply to 2 to produce equality"". Our derivation shows that if two prices",True,0,0

= 11550
Hence, total 11,550 different rectangles are possible.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"A rectangle in a grid is formed by selecting two distinct horizontal lines and two distinct vertical lines.
Let the grid have $M$ squares horizontally and $N$ squares vertically. In this problem, $M=20$ and $N=10$.
There are $M+1$ horizontal lines and $N+1$ vertical lines in the grid.

To form a rectangle, we must choose 2 out of the $M+1$ horizontal lines to be the top and bottom boundaries, and 2 out of the $N+1$ vertical lines to be the left and right boundaries.
The number of ways to choose 2 distinct horizontal lines from $M+1$ lines is given by the binomial coefficient $\binom{M+1}{2}$.
$\binom{M+1}{2} = \binom{20+1}{2} = \binom{21}{2} = \frac{21 \times (21-1)}{2} = \frac{21 \times 20}{2} = 21 \times 10 = 210$.

The number of ways to choose 2 distinct vertical lines from $N+1$ lines is given by the binomial coefficient $\binom{N+1}{2}$.
$\binom{N+1}{2} = \binom{10+1}{2} = \binom{11}{2} = \frac{11 \times (11-1)}{2} = \frac{11 \times 10}{2} = 11 \times 5 = 55$.

Each combination of 2 horizontal lines and 2 vertical lines defines a unique rectangle within the grid. The total number of different rectangles (including squares, which are a type of rectangle) is the product of the number of ways to choose the horizontal boundaries and the number of ways to choose the vertical boundaries.

Total number of rectangles = $\binom{M+1}{2} \times \binom{N+1}{2} = 210 \times 55$.

Calculating the product:
$210 \times 55 = 210 \times (50 + 5) = 210 \times 50 + 210 \times 5$
$210 \times 50 = 10500$
$210 \times 5 = 1050$
$10500 + 1050 = 11550$.

The total number of different squares and rectangles (combined figure not individual) that can be found in the grid is 11550. The phrase ""(combined figure not individual)"" implies that we are counting each specific instance of a rectangle within the grid, not just the abstract shapes.

Alternatively, we can consider rectangles of size $w \times h$, where $w$ is the width and $h$ is the height. For a grid of size $M \times N$, the possible widths are $1 \le w \le M$ and the possible heights are $1 \le h \le N$.
A rectangle of size $w \times h$ can be placed in $(M-w+1)$ horizontal positions and $(N-h+1)$ vertical positions.
The number of rectangles of size $w \times h$ is $(M-w+1)(N-h+1)$.
The total number of rectangles is the sum over all possible dimensions:
Total rectangles = $\sum_{w=1}^{M} \sum_{h=1}^{N} (M-w+1)(N-h+1)$.
Let $i = M-w+1$ and $j = N-h+1$. As $w$ goes from 1 to $M$, $i$ goes from $M$ to 1. As $h$ goes from 1 to $N$, $j$ goes from $N$ to 1.
Total rectangles = $\sum_{i=1}^{M} \sum_{j=1}^{N} i \times j = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{M} i\right) \times \left(\sum_{j=1}^{N} j\right)$.
We know that $\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.
So, $\sum_{i=1}^{M} i = \frac{M(M+1)}{2} = \frac{20(20+1)}{2} = \frac{20 \times 21}{2} = 210$.
And, $\sum_{j=1}^{N} j = \frac{N(N+1)}{2} = \frac{10(10+1)}{2} = \frac{10 \times 11}{2} = 55$.
Total rectangles = $210 \times 55 = 11550$.
This calculation confirms the previous result and aligns with the hint to define an expression covering all possible products of dimensions (referring to the summation of counts for each dimension pair).

This is a classic problem of constructing a normal magic square of order 5.

The numbers to be used are 1, 2, 3, ..., 25. The sum of these numbers is S = $\frac{25 \times (25+1)}{2} = \frac{25 \times 26}{2} = 25 \times 13 = 325$.
Since the sum of each of the 5 rows must be the same magic constant, let's call it M. The total sum of all numbers in the grid is also the sum of the sums of the 5 rows, which is 5M.
So, 5M = 325.
M = $\frac{325}{5} = 65$.
This confirms the hint given: all the rows, columns, and diagonals must add up to 65.

For constructing an odd-order magic square (like a 5x5 square), a standard method is the Siamese method. Here's how one variant of this method works:
1.  Start by placing the number 1 in the center cell of the top row. In a 5x5 grid, the center cell of the top row is at row 1, column 3 (using 1-based indexing).
2.  Place consecutive numbers by moving diagonally up and to the right.
3.  If the move goes out of the top row, wrap around to the bottom row of the next column.
4.  If the move goes out of the rightmost column, wrap around to the leftmost column of the row one step up.
5.  If the move goes to a cell that is already filled, place the number directly below the current cell instead.
6.  If the move goes out of the top-right corner simultaneously (i.e., out of the top row and the rightmost column), place the number directly below the current cell instead. (Note: In this specific variant, rule 6 is covered by rules 3, 4, and 5. Moving up-right from the top-right cell (1,5) goes to (0,6). Rule 3 wraps row 0 to 5, giving (5,6). Rule 4 wraps col 6 to 1, giving (5,1). If cell (5,1) is occupied, apply rule 5). A simpler combined rule for boundary wrap: if moving up from row 1 goes to row 0, move to row 5. If moving right from col 5 goes to col 6, move to col 1.
Let's use the simplified wrap rules: if the move takes you to row 0, go to row n (5); if the move takes you to column n+1 (6), go to column 1. If the target cell is filled, move down one row from the current cell.

If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.
If N=5 and A=1, then E=9. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
If N=2 and A=4, then E=6. R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.
If N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.
If N=2, then since R cannot be 5, R=8, L=5, and I=7.
If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.
Since 1+S+T equals 5 or 15, S+T equals 4 or 14. If S+T=14, then S and T must be 5 and 9, or 6 and 8, in some order. But each of our three scenarios has a letter for at least one of 5 and 9, as well as one for 8. So S+T=4, S and T are 1 and 3 in some order, and O+S=12.
If S=1, then O=11. But since each letter represents only one digit, S=3, T=1, and O=9.
If N=5, then A=1. But since T=1, this cannot work.
If N=4, then I=9. But since O=9, this cannot work.
We are left with one possible scenario:
T=1, N=2, S=3, A=4, L=5, E=6, I=7, R=8, and O=9.

The older girl should receive one pearl, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""
And so it was.
How many pearls were there in the bag?
How many daughters did the old man have?
How many pearls did each girl get?
 Hint: If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","There were 36 pearls.
There were 6 daughters.
Each daughter got 6 pearls.
The girl number x will have x pearls and a seventh of the rest. Since the last girl leaves no pearls in the bag, then when she takes her pearls the rest in the bag is zero (a seventh of nothing is nothing).
Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).
That is, k+1 = 7 and then k = 6.
So, the number of pearls is 6*6 = 36, and there were 6 girls.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,,True,0,0

rewriting 3b +7s + f as
2b + b + 7s + f = 120
2(44.50 - 3s)+ b + 7s + f = 120
89 -6s + b + 7s + f = 120
b + s + f = 120 - 89 = 31",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let B be the cost of one burger in dollars, S be the cost of one shake in dollars, and F be the cost of one order of fries in dollars.

According to the information given in the problem, we can set up the following system of linear equations:
1)  3B + 7S + F = 120
2)  4B + 10S + F = 164.50

We are asked to find the cost of an ordinary meal, which is the cost of one burger, one shake, and one order of fries. In terms of our variables, we want to find the value of B + S + F.

We have a system of two equations with three variables. While we cannot find the unique values for B, S, and F individually, we can potentially find the unique value for the combination B + S + F.

Following the hint, we will set up the system of equations and try to eliminate into a desirable equation. Let's eliminate F by subtracting the first equation from the second equation, as the coefficient of F is 1 in both equations.

Subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):
(4B + 10S + F) - (3B + 7S + F) = 164.50 - 120

Perform the subtraction on the left side:
4B - 3B + 10S - 7S + F - F = B + 3S

Perform the subtraction on the right side:
164.50 - 120 = 44.50

So, we obtain a new equation:
3) B + 3S = 44.50

This equation gives us a relationship between the cost of a burger and the cost of three shakes. Now we need to see how this relationship helps us find the value of B + S + F.

Consider the expression we want to find: B + S + F.
Let's look at Equation (1) again: 3B + 7S + F = 120.
We can rearrange the terms on the left side to highlight the desired expression B + S + F and terms related to our new Equation (3):
3B + 7S + F = (B + S + F) + 2B + 6S

Notice that the term 2B + 6S can be factored as 2(B + 3S).
So, Equation (1) can be rewritten as:
(B + S + F) + 2(B + 3S) = 120

Now we can substitute the value of B + 3S from Equation (3) into this equation. We found that B + 3S = 44.50.
(B + S + F) + 2(44.50) = 120

Calculate the value of 2(44.50):
2 * 44.50 = 89

Substitute this value back into the equation:
(B + S + F) + 89 = 120

To find the value of B + S + F, subtract 89 from both sides of the equation:
B + S + F = 120 - 89
B + S + F = 31

The cost of one burger, one shake, and one order of fries is $31.

We can verify this result using Equation (2) as well.
Equation (2) is 4B + 10S + F = 164.50.
We can rearrange the terms on the left side:
4B + 10S + F = (B + S + F) + 3B + 9S

Notice that the term 3B + 9S can be factored as 3(B + 3S).
So, Equation (2) can be rewritten as:
(B + S + F) + 3(B + 3S) = 164.50

Now substitute the value of B + 3S from Equation (3), which is 44.50:
(B + S + F) + 3(44.50) = 164.50

Calculate the value of 3(44.50):
3 * 44.50 = 133.50

Substitute this value back into the equation:
(B + S + F) + 133.50 = 164.50

To find the value of B + S + F, subtract 133.50 from both sides of the equation:
B + S + F = 164.50 - 133.50
B + S + F = 31

Both original equations lead to the same result for B + S + F when using the derived relationship B + 3S = 44.50. Therefore, the cost of an ordinary meal consisting of one burger, one shake, and one order of fries is indeed $31.

The final answer is $\boxed{31}$.",True,1,0
179,"Question: Weedy Willie was getting too old to work the land alone so he decided to divide his cornfield between himself and his four sons in proportion to their five work rates. He knew that Rastus, Wig, Twig and Swig together could plant a field of corn in five hours whereas Wig, Twig and Swig and himself together could manage the same task in six hours. So Weedy divided his field into a two-digit square number of parts and kept just one part for himself. Now, Wig, Twig and Swig were identical triplets so each received the same whole number of parts. How many parts did each son get?
 Hint: Let the work rates of the triplets combined (Wig, Twig and Swig), Rastus and Willie be x, y, z, respectively. Then

Since Wig, Twig, and Swig are identical triplets, their work rates are equal: $w_{Wi} = w_T = w_S$. Let $w$ denote this common work rate, so $w = w_{Wi} = w_T = w_S$.

The problem states that Rastus, Wig, Twig, and Swig together can plant a field of corn in five hours. Their combined work rate is $w_R + w_{Wi} + w_T + w_S = w_R + 3w$. Let $F$ be the total work required to plant the field. Then $F = (w_R + 3w) \times 5$.

The problem also states that Wig, Twig, Swig, and Weedy Willie together can manage the same task in six hours. Their combined work rate is $w_{Wi} + w_T + w_S + w_W = 3w + w_W$. Then $F = (3w + w_W) \times 6$.

Equating the expressions for $F$, we get:
$5(w_R + 3w) = 6(3w + w_W)$
$5w_R + 15w = 18w + 6w_W$
$5w_R - 3w - 6w_W = 0$.

The field is divided into parts in proportion to their five work rates: $w_W, w_R, w_{Wi}, w_T, w_S$.
Let $n_W, n_R, n_{Wi}, n_T, n_S$ be the number of parts received by Weedy Willie, Rastus, Wig, Twig, and Swig, respectively.
The numbers of parts are proportional to the work rates, so $\frac{n_W}{w_W} = \frac{n_R}{w_R} = \frac{n_{Wi}}{w_{Wi}} = \frac{n_T}{w_T} = \frac{n_S}{w_S} = k$ for some positive constant $k$.
Since $w_{Wi} = w_T = w_S = w$, we have $n_{Wi} = n_T = n_S$. Let $n_w$ be the number of parts for each triplet son, so $n_w = n_{Wi} = n_T = n_S$.
Then $\frac{n_W}{w_W} = \frac{n_R}{w_R} = \frac{n_w}{w} = k$.
So, $n_W = kw_W$, $n_R = kw_R$, $n_w = kw$.

Weedy Willie kept just one part for himself, so $n_W = 1$.
$kw_W = 1$, which means $k = \frac{1}{w_W}$.
Substituting this into the expressions for $n_R$ and $n_w$:
$n_R = \frac{w_R}{w_W}$
$n_w = \frac{w}{w_W}$.

Since $n_R$ and $n_w$ are numbers of parts, they must be positive integers. This implies that $w_W$ must be a common divisor of $w_R$ and $w$. We can assume $w_W$ is the greatest common divisor without loss of generality, which means $n_R$ and $n_w$ are coprime, or just that $w_W$ is a unit rate, effectively setting $w_W=1$ in some system of units. The proportionality ensures that the relative rates are what matter. Let's work with $n_R = w_R/w_W$ and $n_w = w/w_W$.

For $k=1$, $S_1 = Q_1$.

We are given the score at the end of the 1st quarter:
$S_1 = 27$.

We are given information about the points scored in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarters.
For the 2nd quarter: ""In the 2nd, they scored 1/2 of their score at the end of the 2nd, less 1.""
This means $Q_2 = \frac{1}{2} S_2 - 1$.
We also know that $S_2 = S_1 + Q_2$.
Substitute the expression for $Q_2$ into the equation for $S_2$:
$S_2 = S_1 + (\frac{1}{2} S_2 - 1)$.
Substitute the known value of $S_1$:
$S_2 = 27 + \frac{1}{2} S_2 - 1$.
Now, solve this equation for $S_2$:
$S_2 - \frac{1}{2} S_2 = 27 - 1$
$\frac{1}{2} S_2 = 26$
$S_2 = 2 \times 26 = 52$.
The score at the end of the 2nd quarter was 52.

We also know that $S_3 = S_2 + Q_3$.
Substitute the expression for $Q_3$ into the equation for $S_3$:
$S_3 = S_2 + (\frac{1}{3} S_3 - 2)$.
Substitute the known value of $S_2$:
$S_3 = 52 + \frac{1}{3} S_3 - 2$.
Now, solve this equation for $S_3$:
$S_3 - \frac{1}{3} S_3 = 52 - 2$
$\frac{2}{3} S_3 = 50$
$S_3 = \frac{3}{2} \times 50 = 3 \times 25 = 75$.
The score at the end of the 3rd quarter was 75.

For the 4th quarter: ""In the 4th quarter, they scored 1/4 of the total points which they scored in the game, less 3.""
The total points scored in the game is the score at the end of the 4th quarter, which is $S_4$.
This means $Q_4 = \frac{1}{4} S_4 - 3$.
We also know that $S_4 = S_3 + Q_4$.
Substitute the expression for $Q_4$ into the equation for $S_4$:
$S_4 = S_3 + (\frac{1}{4} S_4 - 3)$.
Substitute the known value of $S_3$:
$S_4 = 75 + \frac{1}{4} S_4 - 3$.
Now, solve this equation for $S_4$:
$S_4 - \frac{1}{4} S_4 = 75 - 3$
$\frac{3}{4} S_4 = 72$
$S_4 = \frac{4}{3} \times 72 = 4 \times 24 = 96$.
The score at the end of the 4th quarter, which is the final score, was 96.

To verify the result, let's calculate the points scored in each quarter:
$Q_1 = S_1 = 27$.
$Q_2 = S_2 - S_1 = 52 - 27 = 25$.
Check rule for Q2: $\frac{1}{2} S_2 - 1 = \frac{1}{2}(52) - 1 = 26 - 1 = 25$. This is correct.
$Q_3 = S_3 - S_2 = 75 - 52 = 23$.
Check rule for Q3: $\frac{1}{3} S_3 - 2 = \frac{1}{3}(75) - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23$. This is correct.
$Q_4 = S_4 - S_3 = 96 - 75 = 21$.
Check rule for Q4: $\frac{1}{4} S_4 - 3 = \frac{1}{4}(96) - 3 = 24 - 3 = 21$. This is correct.
The total score is $Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 + Q_4 = 27 + 25 + 23 + 21 = 96$, which matches $S_4$.

From 3: All the possible combinations of numbers multiplied that would give a two digit number: (Eliminate any with 1 or 2 in the product eg 3*7=21 or 3*8=24 etc)
4*8 =32
5*6 =30
5*7 =35
5*8 =40
6*7 =42
6*8 =48
The second term of the product must be one of the numbers multiplied by each other, so eliminate any that don't fit in here leaving:
5*7 =35
6*8 =48
So, filling in what's known so far:
F2*2=CF
D1*2=B2
H*E=DH
F*2 = C
From 1: F=4, then C = 8
From 2: B = 6
From 3: H*E = 5*7 or 5*7 = 35   D=3 H= 5, so E = 7",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H represent distinct digits from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.
The given equations are:
1. FA * A = CF
2. DG * A = BA
3. H * E = DH
4. F * A = C

We are given the hint: G = 1.

Let's rewrite the equations using the numerical values of the letters. A two-letter sequence like FA represents the number 10*F + A.
1. (10*F + A) * A = 10*C + F
2. (10*D + G) * A = 10*B + A
3. H * E = 10*D + H
4. F * A = C

Substitute G = 1 into the equations:
1. (10*F + A) * A = 10*C + F
2. (10*D + 1) * A = 10*B + A
3. H * E = 10*D + H
4. F * A = C

Consider equation 3: H * E = 10*D + H.
Rearranging this equation, we get H * E - H = 10*D, which simplifies to H * (E - 1) = 10*D.
Since H and D are digits from {1, ..., 8} (specifically from {2, ..., 8} as G=1), and H is non-zero, 10*D must be positive, so H and E-1 must be positive. Since E is a digit from {1, ..., 8} and E is distinct from G=1, E >= 2, so E-1 >= 1.
The product H * (E - 1) is a multiple of 10. Since H is a single digit (1-8) and E-1 is between 1 and 7 (as E is a digit 2-8, E cannot be 1), the only way their product can be a multiple of 10 is if one factor contains a factor of 5 and the other contains a factor of 2.
The only digit in {1, ..., 8} that is a multiple of 5 is 5.
So, either H = 5 or E - 1 = 5.

Case 1: H = 5.
Substitute H = 5 into H * (E - 1) = 10*D:
5 * (E - 1) = 10*D
Divide by 5: E - 1 = 2*D
E = 2*D + 1.
H, E, D must be distinct digits from {1, ..., 8}, and G=1, H=5. So D and E must be from {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}.
Let's check possible values for D from {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8} such that E = 2*D + 1 is also a distinct digit in this set, different from 1 and 5.
- If D = 2, E = 2*(2) + 1 = 5. But H = 5, and E must be distinct from H. So D cannot be 2.
- If D = 3, E = 2*(3) + 1 = 7. This is possible. G=1, H=5, D=3, E=7. These are distinct digits {1, 3, 5, 7}.
- If D = 4, E = 2*(4) + 1 = 9. This is not possible as E must be a digit from 1 to 8.
- If D = 6, E = 2*(6) + 1 = 13. Not possible.
- If D = 7, E = 2*(7) + 1 = 15. Not possible.
- If D = 8, E = 2*(8) + 1 = 17. Not possible.
So, under Case 1 (H=5), the only possibility is D=3 and E=7.

Current assignment: G=1, D=3, H=5, E=7.
Used digits: {1, 3, 5, 7}.
Remaining letters: {A, B, C, F}. Remaining digits: {2, 4, 6, 8}.

Now consider equation 2: (10*D + G) * A = 10*B + A.
Substitute D=3 and G=1:
(10*3 + 1) * A = 10*B + A
31 * A = 10*B + A
Subtract A from both sides: 30 * A = 10 * B
Divide by 10: 3 * A = B.
A and B must be distinct digits from the remaining set {2, 4, 6, 8}.
Let's check possible values for A from {2, 4, 6, 8} such that B = 3*A is also a distinct digit in this set.
- If A = 2, B = 3 * 2 = 6. This is possible. A=2, B=6. Used digits: {1, 3, 5, 7} + {2, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}.
- If A = 4, B = 3 * 4 = 12. Not possible as B must be a single digit.
- If A = 6, B = 3 * 6 = 18. Not possible.
- If A = 8, B = 3 * 8 = 24. Not possible.
So, the only possibility is A=2 and B=6.

Current assignment: G=1, D=3, H=5, E=7, A=2, B=6.
Used digits: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}.
Remaining letters: {C, F}. Remaining digits: {4, 8}.
So, C and F must be 4 and 8 in some order.

Now consider equation 4: F * A = C.
Substitute A=2: F * 2 = C.
F and C must be distinct digits from {4, 8}.
- If F = 4, C = 4 * 2 = 8. This is possible. F=4, C=8.
- If F = 8, C = 8 * 2 = 16. Not possible as C must be a single digit.
So, the only possibility is F=4 and C=8.

This gives the complete assignment:
A=2, B=6, C=8, D=3, E=7, F=4, G=1, H=5.
All letters are assigned unique digits from 1 to 8: {2, 6, 8, 3, 7, 4, 1, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.

Let's verify this assignment by checking all the original equations:
A=2, B=6, C=8, D=3, E=7, F=4, G=1, H=5.

1. FA * A = CF
FA = 10*F + A = 10*4 + 2 = 42
CF = 10*C + F = 10*8 + 4 = 84
42 * 2 = 84. (Correct)

2. DG * A = BA
DG = 10*D + G = 10*3 + 1 = 31
BA = 10*B + A = 10*6 + 2 = 62
31 * 2 = 62. (Correct)

3. H * E = DH
DH = 10*D + H = 10*3 + 5 = 35
H * E = 5 * 7 = 35. (Correct)

4. F * A = C
F * A = 4 * 2 = 8
C = 8. (Correct)

All equations are satisfied. This is a valid solution.

Case 2: E - 1 = 5.
Then E = 6.
Substitute E=6 into H * (E - 1) = 10*D:
H * 5 = 10*D
Divide by 5: H = 2*D.
G=1, E=6. H and D must be distinct digits from {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}.
Let's check possible values for D from {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8} such that H = 2*D is also a distinct digit in this set, different from 1 and 6.
- If D = 2, H = 2 * 2 = 4. This is possible. G=1, E=6, D=2, H=4. Used digits: {1, 2, 4, 6}.
- If D = 3, H = 2 * 3 = 6. But E = 6, and H must be distinct from E. So D cannot be 3.
- If D = 4, H = 2 * 4 = 8. This is possible. G=1, E=6, D=4, H=8. Used digits: {1, 4, 6, 8}.
- If D = 5, H = 2 * 5 = 10. Not possible.
- If D = 7, H = 2 * 7 = 14. Not possible.
- If D = 8, H = 2 * 8 = 16. Not possible.

Subcase 2a: G=1, E=6, D=2, H=4.

Consider equation 2: (10*D + G) * A = 10*B + A.
Substitute D=2 and G=1:
(10*2 + 1) * A = 10*B + A
21 * A = 10*B + A
Subtract A: 20 * A = 10 * B
Divide by 10: 2 * A = B.
A and B must be distinct digits from {3, 5, 7, 8}.
- If A = 3, B = 2 * 3 = 6. But E = 6, and B must be distinct from E. So A cannot be 3.

- If A = 7, B = 2 * 7 = 14. Not possible.
- If A = 8, B = 2 * 8 = 16. Not possible.

Consider equation 2: (10*D + G) * A = 10*B + A.
Substitute D=4 and G=1:
(10*4 + 1) * A = 10*B + A
41 * A = 10*B + A
Subtract A: 40 * A = 10 * B
Divide by 10: 4 * A = B.
A and B must be distinct digits from {2, 3, 5, 7}.
- If A = 2, B = 4 * 2 = 8. But H = 8, and B must be distinct from H. So A cannot be 2.
- If A = 3, B = 4 * 3 = 12. Not possible.
- If A = 5, B = 4 * 5 = 20. Not possible.
- If A = 7, B = 4 * 7 = 28. Not possible.
This subcase yields no valid solution.

Since Case 2 (E=6) yields no valid solutions, the only valid assignment is the one found in Case 1.

The unique solution is:
A = 2
B = 6
C = 8
D = 3
E = 7

188,"Question: In the early years of the last century, a MADADIAN industrialist, Nastee, had employed 100 labourers to build his new improved Kebab and Rat Poison factory. Things were a little different those days, and the employment of labourers' wives and children was commonplace, although Nastee did not allow any woman to work without her husband. Also, at least half the men working came with their wives.
He paid five Madadian Wonks per day to each man, four Wonks to each woman and one Wonk to each child. He gave out 200 Wonks every evening.
How many men, women and children were working with Nastee?
 Hint: System of equations for men, women, and children","System of equations for men, women, and children","16 men, 12 women and 72 children were working with Nastee.
Let's assume that there were X men, Y women and Z children working with Nastee Hence,
X + Y + Z = 100
5X + 4Y + Z = 200
Eliminating X and Y in turn from these equations, we get
X = 3Z - 200
Y = 300 - 4Z
If a woman works, her husband also works, and at least half the men working came with their wives; the value of Y lies between X and X/2. Substituting these limiting values in equations, we get

Z = 500/7 i.e. 71.428

We are given the total number of labourers is 100. So, we have the equation:
M + W + C = 100 (1)

We are given the wages for each group and the total daily wage.
Each man is paid 5 Wonks.
Each woman is paid 4 Wonks.
Each child is paid 1 Wonk.
The total daily wage is 200 Wonks. So, we have the equation:
5M + 4W + C = 200 (2)

We have a system of two linear equations with three variables. We can eliminate one variable. Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):
(5M + 4W + C) - (M + W + C) = 200 - 100
5M + 4W + C - M - W - C = 100
4M + 3W = 100 (3)

We are also given constraints on the number of men, women, and children:
1. M, W, and C must be non-negative integers.
2. ""Nastee did not allow any woman to work without her husband."" This implies that every woman working must have her husband also working among the 100 labourers. Therefore, the number of women (W) must be less than or equal to the number of men (M), as each woman requires a unique husband from the group of working men. So, W <= M.
3. ""at least half the men working came with their wives."" The number of men whose wives are working is equal to the number of working women (W), since each working woman has a working husband among the men. This number (W) must be at least half of the total number of men (M). So, W >= M/2.

We need to find non-negative integer solutions (M, W) for the equation 4M + 3W = 100 that also satisfy the inequalities W <= M and W >= M/2.

From 4M + 3W = 100, we can express W in terms of M:
3W = 100 - 4M
W = (100 - 4M) / 3

Since W must be a non-negative integer, we have two conditions:
a) 100 - 4M >= 0 => 4M <= 100 => M <= 25.
b) 100 - 4M must be divisible by 3.
Let's check the divisibility by 3 for 100 and 4:
100 mod 3 = 1
4 mod 3 = 1
So, (100 - 4M) mod 3 = (1 - 1*M) mod 3 = (1 - M) mod 3.
For (1 - M) mod 3 to be 0, M mod 3 must be 1.

So, M must be a non-negative integer such that M <= 25 and M mod 3 = 1.
The possible values for M are 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25.

Now we find the corresponding value of W for each possible value of M and check the constraints W <= M and W >= M/2.

- If M = 1: W = (100 - 4*1) / 3 = 96 / 3 = 32. Check constraints: W <= M (32 <= 1) is false.
- If M = 4: W = (100 - 4*4) / 3 = 84 / 3 = 28. Check constraints: W <= M (28 <= 4) is false.
- If M = 7: W = (100 - 4*7) / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24. Check constraints: W <= M (24 <= 7) is false.
- If M = 10: W = (100 - 4*10) / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20. Check constraints: W <= M (20 <= 10) is false.
- If M = 13: W = (100 - 4*13) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16. Check constraints: W <= M (16 <= 13) is false.
- If M = 16: W = (100 - 4*16) / 3 = 36 / 3 = 12. Check constraints: W <= M (12 <= 16) is true. W >= M/2 (12 >= 16/2 = 8) is true. This is a possible solution for (M, W).
- If M = 19: W = (100 - 4*19) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8. Check constraints: W <= M (8 <= 19) is true. W >= M/2 (8 >= 19/2 = 9.5) is false.
- If M = 22: W = (100 - 4*22) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4. Check constraints: W <= M (4 <= 22) is true. W >= M/2 (4 >= 22/2 = 11) is false.
- If M = 25: W = (100 - 4*25) / 3 = 0 / 3 = 0. Check constraints: W <= M (0 <= 25) is true. W >= M/2 (0 >= 25/2 = 12.5) is false.

The only pair (M, W) that satisfies all the conditions (4M + 3W = 100, M >= 0, W >= 0, W <= M, and W >= M/2) is (16, 12).

Now we find the number of children C using equation (1):
M + W + C = 100
16 + 12 + C = 100
28 + C = 100
C = 100 - 28
C = 72

We must also ensure that C is a non-negative integer, which 72 is.

Thus, the number of men is 16, the number of women is 12, and the number of children is 72.
Let's verify these numbers against all original conditions:
- Total labourers: 16 + 12 + 72 = 100. (Correct)
- Total wage: 5*16 + 4*12 + 1*72 = 80 + 48 + 72 = 128 + 72 = 200. (Correct)
- W <= M: 12 <= 16. (Correct)
- W >= M/2: 12 >= 16/2 = 8. (Correct)
- M, W, C are non-negative integers: 16, 12, 72 are all positive integers. (Correct)

All conditions are satisfied by this unique solution.

The final answer is $\boxed{Men: 16, Women: 12, Children: 72}$.",True,1,0
189,"Question: A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?
 Hint: You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let L be the length of the railway bridge between locations A and B.
Let Vm be the speed of the man (which we need to find).
Let Vt be the speed of the train, Vt = 80 kph.

The man is initially located at a distance (3/8)L from A.
His distance from B is therefore L - (3/8)L = (5/8)L.

Let D be the initial distance of the train from A when the man hears it. The train is approaching from A's side, so it is traveling towards B.

Scenario 1: The man runs back to A.
The distance the man runs is (3/8)L.
Let t1 be the time it takes the man to run back to A.
Using the formula distance = rate × time, we have:
(3/8)L = Vm * t1  (Equation 1)

The problem states that if he runs back to A, he meets the train at A. This means the train arrives at A at the same time t1.
The distance the train travels to reach A from its initial position is D.
D = Vt * t1
D = 80 * t1  (Equation 2)

From Equation 1, t1 = (3/8)L / Vm. Substituting this into Equation 2:
D = 80 * [(3/8)L / Vm]
D = 30L / Vm  (Equation 3)

Scenario 2: The man runs to B.
The distance the man runs is (5/8)L.
Let t2 be the time it takes the man to run to B.
Using the formula distance = rate × time, we have:
(5/8)L = Vm * t2  (Equation 4)

The problem states that if he runs to B, the train overtakes him at B. This means the train arrives at B at the same time t2.
The distance the train travels to reach B from its initial position is D + L (the initial distance D to A plus the length of the bridge L).
D + L = Vt * t2
D + L = 80 * t2  (Equation 5)

From Equation 4, t2 = (5/8)L / Vm. Substituting this into Equation 5:
D + L = 80 * [(5/8)L / Vm]
D + L = 50L / Vm  (Equation 6)

Now we have a system of two linear equations (Equation 3 and Equation 6) with two unknowns, D and Vm:
3) D = 30L / Vm
6) D + L = 50L / Vm

Substitute the expression for D from Equation 3 into Equation 6:
(30L / Vm) + L = 50L / Vm

Since L is the length of the bridge, L must be greater than 0. We can divide every term in the equation by L:
30 / Vm + 1 = 50 / Vm

Now, we solve for Vm. Subtract 30 / Vm from both sides of the equation:
1 = 50 / Vm - 30 / Vm
1 = (50 - 30) / Vm
1 = 20 / Vm

Multiply both sides by Vm:
Vm = 20.

The speed of the man is 20 kph. The units are kph because the train's speed was given in kph and the length unit L cancelled out.

To verify, let Vm = 20 kph and Vt = 80 kph.
From Equation 3, D = 30L / 20 = (3/2)L. The train starts 1.5 times the bridge length away from A.
Time for man to run to A: t1 = (3/8)L / Vm = (3/8)L / 20 = 3L / 160.
Time for train to reach A: D / Vt = (3/2)L / 80 = 3L / 160. The times match.
Time for man to run to B: t2 = (5/8)L / Vm = (5/8)L / 20 = 5L / 160 = L / 32.
Time for train to reach B: (D + L) / Vt = ((3/2)L + L) / 80 = (5/2)L / 80 = 5L / 160 = L / 32. The times match.
The solution is consistent with the problem conditions.

The final answer is $\boxed{20 \text{ kph}}$.",True,1,0
190,"Question: In a chess tournament conducted by the Romankachi World Chess Federation, every person played one game with every other person in the group. The total number of games that men played between themselves exceeded those played by men with women by 18. If there were 4 women on the tournament, totally how many games were played in the tournament?
 Hint: The only variable needed is the number of men--find different expressions for the total number of games between just men and the number of games between men and women",The only variable needed is the number of men--find different expressions for the total number of games between just men and the number of games between men and women,"Totally 120 games were played in the tournament.
Let N be the number of men in the tournament.
Then the number of games played by men between themselves
= N*(N-1)/2
The number of games played by men with women
= 4*N
(since there were 4 women in the tournament)
It is given that the total number of games that men played between themselves exceeded those played by men with women by 18.
Hence
N*(N-1)/2 - 4*N = 18
N*(N-1) - 8*N = 36
N*N - N - 8*N = 36
N^2 - 9*N - 36 = 0
Factorizing we get,
N^2 - 12*N + 3*N - 36 = 0
N*(N - 12) + 3*(N - 12) = 0
(N - 12)(N + 3) = 0
Hence N = 12 or -3 (not possible).
Hence the number of men in the chess tournament
= N = 12
Therefore the total number of people participating in the chess tournament = 12 + 4 = 16.
The total number of games played in the tournament
= T*(T-1)/2
= 16*15/2
= 120",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let $M$ be the number of men in the tournament and $W$ be the number of women.
We are given that $W=4$.

In the tournament, every person played one game with every other person. This is a round-robin tournament.
The total number of participants is $M+W = M+4$.
The total number of games played in the tournament is the number of pairs of people that can be chosen from the $M+W$ participants, which is given by the combination formula $\binom{M+W}{2}$.
Total games $G_{total} = \binom{M+W}{2} = \binom{M+4}{2} = \frac{(M+4)(M+4-1)}{2} = \frac{(M+4)(M+3)}{2}$.

The games played can be divided into three categories:
1. Games played between two men (Man vs Man). The number of such games is the number of ways to choose 2 men from $M$ men: $G_{MM} = \binom{M}{2} = \frac{M(M-1)}{2}$.
2. Games played between two women (Woman vs Woman). The number of such games is the number of ways to choose 2 women from $W$ women: $G_{WW} = \binom{W}{2}$. Since $W=4$, $G_{WW} = \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2} = 6$.
3. Games played between a man and a woman (Man vs Woman). The number of such games is the number of ways to choose 1 man from $M$ men and 1 woman from $W$ women: $G_{MW} = M \times W$. Since $W=4$, $G_{MW} = M \times 4 = 4M$.

The total number of games is also the sum of games from these three categories: $G_{total} = G_{MM} + G_{WW} + G_{MW}$.
$\frac{(M+4)(M+3)}{2} = \frac{M(M-1)}{2} + 6 + 4M$.
$\frac{M^2 + 7M + 12}{2} = \frac{M^2 - M}{2} + 6 + 4M$.
Multiply by 2: $M^2 + 7M + 12 = M^2 - M + 12 + 8M$.
$M^2 + 7M + 12 = M^2 + 7M + 12$. This confirms the breakdown of games is consistent with the total number of games formula, but it does not help us find $M$.

The problem gives a specific condition relating the number of games: ""The total number of games that men played between themselves exceeded those played by men with women by 18"".
This can be written as the equation: $G_{MM} - G_{MW} = 18$.

Substitute the expressions for $G_{MM}$ and $G_{MW}$ in terms of $M$ and $W$:
$\frac{M(M-1)}{2} - MW = 18$.

We know $W=4$, so substitute this value into the equation:
$\frac{M(M-1)}{2} - M(4) = 18$.
$\frac{M(M-1)}{2} - 4M = 18$.

Now, we solve this equation for $M$.
Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
$M(M-1) - 8M = 36$.
Expand the term $M(M-1)$:
$M^2 - M - 8M = 36$.
Combine the terms involving $M$:
$M^2 - 9M = 36$.
Move the constant term to the left side to form a standard quadratic equation:
$M^2 - 9M - 36 = 0$.

We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. We need to find two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -9. These numbers are 3 and -12, because $3 \times (-12) = -36$ and $3 + (-12) = -9$.
So, we can factor the quadratic equation as:
$(M+3)(M-12) = 0$.

This equation gives two possible solutions for $M$:
$M+3 = 0 \implies M = -3$.
$M-12 = 0 \implies M = 12$.

Since $M$ represents the number of men, it must be a non-negative integer. The number of men must be greater than or equal to 0. In the context of a tournament with games between men, $M$ must be at least 2 for $G_{MM}$ to be non-zero. However, the problem does not state $G_{MM} > 0$. But $M$ must be an integer $\ge 0$.
A negative number of men is not physically possible, so $M=-3$ is not a valid solution.
Thus, the number of men is $M=12$.

Now that we have the number of men ($M=12$) and the number of women ($W=4$), we can find the total number of games played in the tournament.
The total number of participants is $M+W = 12+4 = 16$.
The total number of games is $\binom{M+W}{2} = \binom{16}{2}$.
$\binom{16}{2} = \frac{16 \times (16-1)}{2} = \frac{16 \times 15}{2} = \frac{240}{2} = 120$.

Let's verify the condition with $M=12$ and $W=4$.
Number of games between men: $G_{MM} = \binom{12}{2} = \frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66$.
Number of games between men and women: $G_{MW} = 12 \times 4 = 48$.
The condition is $G_{MM} - G_{MW} = 18$.
$66 - 48 = 18$. This is true, so our value of $M=12$ is correct.

The total number of games played is 120.

The final answer is $\boxed{120}$.",True,1,0
191,"Question: There is a number.
1. If it is not a multiple of 4, then it is between 60 and 69.
2. If it is a multiple of 3 it is between 50 and 59.
3. If it is not a multiple of 6 it is between 70 and 79.
What is the number?
 Hint: Eliminate possibilities within 50-79",Eliminate possibilities within 50-79,76,GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the number be $N$. The given conditions are:
1. If $N$ is not a multiple of 4, then $60 \le N \le 69$.
2. If $N$ is a multiple of 3, then $50 \le N \le 59$.
3. If $N$ is not a multiple of 6, then $70 \le N \le 79$.

We can write the contrapositive of these conditional statements, which are logically equivalent:
1'. If $N < 60$ or $N > 69$, then $N$ is a multiple of 4.
2'. If $N < 50$ or $N > 59$, then $N$ is not a multiple of 3.
3'. If $N < 70$ or $N > 79$, then $N$ is a multiple of 6.

The hint suggests eliminating possibilities within the range [50, 79]. Let's consider the number $N$ based on which of the ranges [50, 59], [60, 69], or [70, 79] it falls into. These three ranges cover the entire interval [50, 79].

Case 1: $50 \le N \le 59$.
If $N$ is in this range, then $N < 60$. From condition 1', if $N < 60$, then $N$ must be a multiple of 4. So, $N$ must be a multiple of 4. The multiples of 4 in the range [50, 59] are 52 and 56.
If $N$ is in this range, then $N < 70$. From condition 3', if $N < 70$, then $N$ must be a multiple of 6. So, $N$ must be a multiple of 6. The multiples of 6 in the range [50, 59] are 54.
For $N$ to be in the range [50, 59] and satisfy conditions 1 and 3 (specifically, their contrapositives, which apply here), $N$ must be a multiple of 4 and a multiple of 6. This means $N$ must be a multiple of the least common multiple of 4 and 6, which is 12. The multiples of 12 are ..., 36, 48, 60, ... There are no multiples of 12 in the range [50, 59].
Therefore, there is no number in the range [50, 59] that satisfies conditions 1 and 3. So, the number cannot be in this range.

Case 2: $60 \le N \le 69$.
If $N$ is in this range, then $N$ is not in the range [50, 59]. From condition 2', if $N < 50$ or $N > 59$, then $N$ is not a multiple of 3. Since $N \ge 60 > 59$, $N$ must not be a multiple of 3.
If $N$ is in this range, then $N$ is not in the range [70, 79]. From condition 3', if $N < 70$ or $N > 79$, then $N$ is a multiple of 6. Since $N \le 69 < 70$, $N$ must be a multiple of 6.
So, if $60 \le N \le 69$, $N$ must not be a multiple of 3 and $N$ must be a multiple of 6. However, any multiple of 6 is also a multiple of 3 (since $6 = 2 \times 3$). This is a contradiction. A number cannot be a multiple of 6 and not a multiple of 3 simultaneously.
Therefore, there is no number in the range [60, 69] that satisfies conditions 2 and 3. So, the number cannot be in this range.

Case 3: $70 \le N \le 79$.
If $N$ is in this range, then $N$ is not in the range [60, 69]. From condition 1', if $N < 60$ or $N > 69$, then $N$ is a multiple of 4. Since $N \ge 70 > 69$, $N$ must be a multiple of 4. The multiples of 4 in the range [70, 79] are 72 and 76.
If $N$ is in this range, then $N$ is not in the range [50, 59]. From condition 2', if $N < 50$ or $N > 59$, then $N$ is not a multiple of 3. Since $N \ge 70 > 59$, $N$ must not be a multiple of 3.
So, if $70 \le N \le 79$, $N$ must be a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. Let's check the multiples of 4 in this range:
- 72: Is 72 a multiple of 3? Yes, $7+2=9$, which is divisible by 3. So 72 is a multiple of 3.
- 76: Is 76 a multiple of 3? No, $7+6=13$, which is not divisible by 3. So 76 is not a multiple of 3.
The only number in the range [70, 79] that is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3 is 76.

Now we must check if $N=76$ satisfies all three original conditions.
- Condition 1: If 76 is not a multiple of 4, then $60 \le 76 \le 69$.
  76 is a multiple of 4 ($76 = 19 \times 4$). So the premise ""76 is not a multiple of 4"" is false. A conditional statement with a false premise is true. Condition 1 is satisfied.
- Condition 2: If 76 is a multiple of 3, then $50 \le 76 \le 59$.
  76 is not a multiple of 3. So the premise ""76 is a multiple of 3"" is false. A conditional statement with a false premise is true. Condition 2 is satisfied.
- Condition 3: If 76 is not a multiple of 6, then $70 \le 76 \le 79$.
  76 is not a multiple of 6 (since it's not a multiple of 3). So the premise ""76 is not a multiple of 6"" is true.
  The conclusion is ""$70 \le 76 \le 79$"". This is true.
  A conditional statement with a true premise and a true conclusion is true. Condition 3 is satisfied.

Since $N=76$ satisfies all three conditions, it is the number we are looking for.

We should also confirm that the number cannot be outside the range [50, 79].
If $N < 50$:
From condition 1' ($N < 60$), $N$ is a multiple of 4.
From condition 2' ($N < 50$), $N$ is not a multiple of 3.
From condition 3' ($N < 70$), $N$ is a multiple of 6.
If $N$ is a multiple of 6, it is also a multiple of 3. This contradicts the requirement that $N$ is not a multiple of 3. So, no number less than 50 satisfies the conditions.

If $N > 79$:
From condition 1' ($N > 69$), $N$ is a multiple of 4.
From condition 2' ($N > 59$), $N$ is not a multiple of 3.
From condition 3' ($N > 79$), $N$ is a multiple of 6.
If $N$ is a multiple of 6, it is also a multiple of 3. This contradicts the requirement that $N$ is not a multiple of 3. So, no number greater than 79 satisfies the conditions.

Thus, the number must be in the range [50, 79], and we have shown that the only number in this range satisfying all conditions is 76.

$f(10) = 960$
$f(11) = 1287$

We are asked to find $f(20)$.
The hint suggests trying to use a power of the input to get somewhere close to the output. Let's consider powers of the input $x$, such as $x^2$ and $x^3$.

Let's evaluate $x^2$ and $x^3$ for the given inputs:
For $x=7$: $7^2 = 49$, $7^3 = 343$. $f(7) = 315$ is closer to $343$.
For $x=8$: $8^2 = 64$, $8^3 = 512$. $f(8) = 480$ is closer to $512$.
For $x=9$: $9^2 = 81$, $9^3 = 729$. $f(9) = 693$ is closer to $729$.
For $x=10$: $10^2 = 100$, $10^3 = 1000$. $f(10) = 960$ is closer to $1000$.
For $x=11$: $11^2 = 121$, $11^3 = 1331$. $f(11) = 1287$ is closer to $1331$.

It appears that $f(x)$ is related to $x^3$. Let's calculate the difference between $x^3$ and $f(x)$ for each given pair:
For $x=7$: $7^3 - f(7) = 343 - 315 = 28$.
For $x=8$: $8^3 - f(8) = 512 - 480 = 32$.
For $x=9$: $9^3 - f(9) = 729 - 693 = 36$.
For $x=10$: $10^3 - f(10) = 1000 - 960 = 40$.
For $x=11$: $11^3 - f(11) = 1331 - 1287 = 44$.

Let $d(x) = x^3 - f(x)$. We have the sequence of differences: 28, 32, 36, 40, 44.
Let's examine the pattern in this sequence. The differences between consecutive terms are:
$32 - 28 = 4$
$36 - 32 = 4$
$40 - 36 = 4$
$44 - 40 = 4$
This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4. The first term in this sequence corresponds to $x=7$, which is 28.
The general form of an arithmetic sequence starting at index $n_0$ is $a_{n_0} + (n - n_0)r$, where $r$ is the common difference. In our case, the index is $x$, the starting index is $7$, the first term $d(7)$ is $28$, and the common difference $r$ is $4$.
So, the formula for $d(x)$ is $d(x) = d(7) + (x - 7) \times 4$.
$d(x) = 28 + (x - 7) \times 4$
$d(x) = 28 + 4x - 28$
$d(x) = 4x$.

So, we have the relationship $x^3 - f(x) = 4x$.
We can rearrange this equation to find the formula for $f(x)$:
$f(x) = x^3 - 4x$.

Let's verify this formula with the given input-output pairs:
$f(7) = 7^3 - 4(7) = 343 - 28 = 315$. (Correct)
$f(8) = 8^3 - 4(8) = 512 - 32 = 480$. (Correct)
$f(9) = 9^3 - 4(9) = 729 - 36 = 693$. (Correct)
$f(10) = 10^3 - 4(10) = 1000 - 40 = 960$. (Correct)
$f(11) = 11^3 - 4(11) = 1331 - 44 = 1287$. (Correct)

The formula $f(x) = x^3 - 4x$ is consistent with all the given data.
Now we need to find the output when 20 goes in, which means we need to calculate $f(20)$.
Using the formula $f(x) = x^3 - 4x$:
$f(20) = 20^3 - 4 \times 20$.
Calculate $20^3$: $20 \times 20 \times 20 = 400 \times 20 = 8000$.
Calculate $4 \times 20$: $4 \times 20 = 80$.
Substitute these values into the formula:
$f(20) = 8000 - 80$.
$f(20) = 7920$.

Thus, if 20 goes in, 7920 will come out.

198,"Question: Detective Grant was inspecting the scene of the crime. The 50-year-old victim, Joe, had been poisoned by a candy containing cyanide. On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table. John, 46, was found with 5 candies the day after a 4-yr sentence had been turned over a week ago. Jim, 35, had gotten off a 5-yr sentence a few days ago, only to be found dead with 6 candies yesterday.
Grant puzzled over these cases for days, and then -boom- it hit him. There was a pattern in these murders! What pattern did Grant spot?

We are given the following information:
1. Each victim ate one candy before they died. This means the total number of candies initially present was the number of candies found plus one.
2. The life expectancy when the murders were committed was 70 years.

Let's list the data for each victim, including the total number of candies initially present (Candies Found + 1):

*   **Joe:** Age = 50, Sentence = 2 years, Candies Found = 9.
    Total Candies = 9 + 1 = 10.
*   **Jeff:** Age = 30, Sentence = 10 years, Candies Found = 3.
    Total Candies = 3 + 1 = 4.
*   **John:** Age = 46, Sentence = 4 years, Candies Found = 5.
    Total Candies = 5 + 1 = 6.
*   **Jim:** Age = 35, Sentence = 5 years, Candies Found = 6.
    Total Candies = 6 + 1 = 7.

Let A be the victim's age, S be the length of their jail sentence in years, and C be the number of candies found on the table. Let LE be the life expectancy, which is given as 70 years. The total number of candies initially present is C + 1.

We are looking for a pattern relating A, S, LE, and C + 1. Let's examine potential relationships using the given data.

Consider the victim's remaining life expectancy, which is LE - A.
For Joe: Remaining Life = 70 - 50 = 20 years.
For Jeff: Remaining Life = 70 - 30 = 40 years.
For John: Remaining Life = 70 - 46 = 24 years.
For Jim: Remaining Life = 70 - 35 = 35 years.

Now let's look at the relationship between the remaining life expectancy, the sentence length (S), and the total number of candies (C + 1).

For Joe: Remaining Life = 20, Sentence = 2, Total Candies = 10.
Is there a simple relationship between 20, 2, and 10?
We can observe that 20 divided by 2 equals 10 (20 / 2 = 10).

Let's test if this relationship holds for the other victims: Remaining Life / Sentence = Total Candies.

For Jeff: Remaining Life = 40, Sentence = 10, Total Candies = 4.
Is 40 / 10 equal to 4? Yes, 40 / 10 = 4. This matches the Total Candies.

For John: Remaining Life = 24, Sentence = 4, Total Candies = 6.
Is 24 / 4 equal to 6? Yes, 24 / 4 = 6. This matches the Total Candies.

For Jim: Remaining Life = 35, Sentence = 5, Total Candies = 7.
Is 35 / 5 equal to 7? Yes, 35 / 5 = 7. This matches the Total Candies.

The pattern consistently holds for all four victims. The pattern is:
(Life Expectancy - Age) / Sentence = Total Candies Initially Present

Substituting the values and terms:
(70 - A) / S = C + 1

This means the victim's remaining life expectancy (70 minus their age) divided by their jail sentence length equals the number of candies found on the table plus one (the total number of candies initially available). Detective Grant spotted this mathematical relationship connecting the victim's personal information (age and sentence) with the crime scene details (number of candies).

The final answer is $\boxed{The\ victim's\ remaining\ life\ expectancy\ (70\ minus\ their\ age)\ divided\ by\ their\ jail\ sentence\ length\ equals\ the\ total\ number\ of\ candies\ initially\ present\ (the\ number\ of\ candies\ found\ on\ the\ table\ plus\ one).}$.",True,0,0

The costs are in pounds (£).

We are given the following information from the problem statement:
1. A mixed packet containing 1 pound of walnuts and 2 pounds of Brazil nuts costs £1.98. This can be written as the equation:
   $1w + 2b = 1.98$ (Equation 1)

2. A packet containing 4 pounds of filberts and 1 pound of walnuts costs £2.48. This gives us the equation:
   $4f + 1w = 2.48$ (Equation 2)

3. A mixed packet containing 3 pounds of almonds, 1 pound of walnuts, and 1 pound of filberts costs £2.99. This translates to the equation:
   $3a + 1w + 1f = 2.99$ (Equation 3)

We want to find the cost of a packet containing 1 pound of each type of nut. This means we want to find the value of $w + b + f + a$.

We have a system of three linear equations with four variables ($w, b, f, a$). Since the number of variables is greater than the number of independent equations, the system does not have a unique solution for each individual variable. This aligns with the hint given. However, the question asks for a specific linear combination of these variables ($w+b+f+a$), and it is possible that this specific combination has a unique value.

We can express three of the variables in terms of the fourth variable (say, $w$) using the given equations.

From Equation 1:
$2b = 1.98 - w$
$b = \frac{1.98 - w}{2} = 0.99 - 0.5w$

From Equation 2:
$4f = 2.48 - w$
$f = \frac{2.48 - w}{4} = 0.62 - 0.25w$

Now substitute the expression for $f$ into Equation 3:
$w + f + 3a = 2.99$
$w + (0.62 - 0.25w) + 3a = 2.99$
Combine the terms involving $w$:
$(1 - 0.25)w + 0.62 + 3a = 2.99$
$0.75w + 0.62 + 3a = 2.99$
Subtract 0.62 from both sides:
$0.75w + 3a = 2.99 - 0.62$
$0.75w + 3a = 2.37$
Solve for $3a$:
$3a = 2.37 - 0.75w$
Solve for $a$:
$a = \frac{2.37 - 0.75w}{3} = 0.79 - 0.25w$

Now we have expressions for $b$, $f$, and $a$ in terms of $w$:
$b = 0.99 - 0.5w$
$f = 0.62 - 0.25w$
$a = 0.79 - 0.25w$

We want to find the value of $w + b + f + a$. Substitute the expressions we found into this sum:
$w + b + f + a = w + (0.99 - 0.5w) + (0.62 - 0.25w) + (0.79 - 0.25w)$

Group the terms involving $w$ and the constant terms:
$w + b + f + a = (w - 0.5w - 0.25w - 0.25w) + (0.99 + 0.62 + 0.79)$
$w + b + f + a = (1 - 0.5 - 0.25 - 0.25)w + (0.99 + 0.62 + 0.79)$
$w + b + f + a = (1 - 1.00)w + (2.40)$
$w + b + f + a = 0w + 2.40$
$w + b + f + a = 2.40$

The cost of a packet containing 1 pound of each type of nut is £2.40. The fact that the coefficient of $w$ is zero confirms that the total cost of this specific mix is independent of the individual price of walnuts (or any other nut, as we could have expressed all variables in terms of $b$, $f$, or $a$ as well), which is consistent with the hint that individual costs cannot be determined uniquely.

The final answer is $\boxed{£2.40}$.",True,1,0
201,"Question: Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Snow, there lived the fair Princess Miyuki, who had always been fascinated by fairy tales and the stories of the wonders of the world. She believed that her sleeping, handsome prince was cursed to be one of the mummies in the pyramids of Egypt, and when she was done being Fantaghiro-saving-her-Romualdo, her prince would then build a beautiful palace as a monument of their love (which of course would be more beautiful than Taj Mahal) where both of them will live happily ever after...
So, you see, that's why Princess Miyuki had refused each and every love declaration or marriage proposal that came her way.
But of course, what's a story without the brave and wise heroic prince? Here comes Prince Hajikidama of the Marbles Kingdom. He's no mummy, but his brilliant(?) brain deduced that in order to win the princess' heart, he'd have to give her what she wanted most - her fantasy, and his token of understanding (her childish delusional nature).
In the end, labouring his mind's creativity department for all its worth, Prince Hajikidama decided that a 'Mountain of Love', reaching so high it collected the never-fallen-snow in Marbles Kingdom, might do the trick. That actually is a tetrahedral-shaped (pyramid with 4 equilateral triangular faces) crystallic marbles-made structure (like a giant pile of apples or oranges at a greengrocer's store) consisting of one marble crowning on the top layer, three on the next-to-top layer, six on the third layer, ten on the fourth layer, and so forth. If there are exactly 1,000,000 layers, specify the total number of marbles needed in the construction of entire mountain.
 Hint: Triangle numbers sum",Triangle numbers sum,"The formula is
S = n(n+1)(n+2)/6
so when n = 1,000,000
S = 166,667,166,667,000,000",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"The number of marbles in each layer of the tetrahedral structure forms a sequence. Let $L_n$ be the number of marbles in the $n$-th layer from the top.
According to the problem description:
Layer 1: $L_1 = 1$
Layer 2: $L_2 = 3$
Layer 3: $L_3 = 6$
Layer 4: $L_4 = 10$
...and so forth.

We observe the pattern in the number of marbles in each layer:
$L_1 = 1$
$L_2 = 1 + 2 = 3$
$L_3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$
$L_4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$

This pattern shows that the number of marbles in the $n$-th layer, $L_n$, is the sum of the first $n$ positive integers. This is the definition of the $n$-th triangle number, denoted by $T_n$.
The formula for the $n$-th triangle number is $T_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.
So, $L_n = T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

The mountain consists of exactly 1,000,000 layers. The total number of marbles in the entire mountain is the sum of the marbles in each layer from $n=1$ to $n=1,000,000$.
Let $N$ be the total number of layers, so $N = 1,000,000$.
The total number of marbles is $\sum_{n=1}^{N} L_n = \sum_{n=1}^{N} T_n$.

The sum of the first $N$ triangle numbers is known as the $N$-th tetrahedral number, denoted by $Te_N$. The hint ""Triangle numbers sum"" points directly to this concept.
The formula for the $N$-th tetrahedral number is $Te_N = \sum_{n=1}^{N} T_n = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

We can derive this formula:
$Te_N = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{n^2+n}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum_{n=1}^{N} n^2 + \sum_{n=1}^{N} n \right)$
Using the standard summation formulas:
$\sum_{n=1}^{N} n = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}$
$\sum_{n=1}^{N} n^2 = \frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6}$
Substituting these into the expression for $Te_N$:
$Te_N = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6} + \frac{N(N+1)}{2} \right)$
To combine the terms inside the parenthesis, we find a common denominator (6):
$Te_N = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6} + \frac{3N(N+1)}{6} \right)$
Factor out the common term $\frac{N(N+1)}{6}$:
$Te_N = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{N(N+1)}{6} \left( (2N+1) + 3 \right)$
$Te_N = \frac{N(N+1)}{12} (2N+4)$
$Te_N = \frac{N(N+1)}{12} \cdot 2(N+2)$
$Te_N = \frac{N(N+1)(N+2)}{6}$

Now we need to calculate $Te_N$ for $N = 1,000,000$.
$Te_{1,000,000} = \frac{1,000,000 \times (1,000,000+1) \times (1,000,000+2)}{6}$
$Te_{1,000,000} = \frac{1,000,000 \times 1,000,001 \times 1,000,002}{6}$

We can perform the calculation. Note that $1,000,002$ is divisible by 6:
$1,000,002 \div 6 = 166,667$.
So, the expression becomes:
$Te_{1,000,000} = 1,000,000 \times 1,000,001 \times 166,667$

Now, we multiply the numbers:
First, calculate $1,000,001 \times 166,667$:
$1,000,001 \times 166,667 = (1,000,000 + 1) \times 166,667$
$= 1,000,000 \times 166,667 + 1 \times 166,667$
$= 166,667,000,000 + 166,667$
$= 166,667,166,667$

Finally, multiply this result by $1,000,000$:
$166,667,166,667 \times 1,000,000 = 166,667,166,667,000,000$.

The total number of marbles needed for the construction of the entire mountain with 1,000,000 layers is 166,667,166,667,000,000.

First, we observe that these numbers are all perfect squares:
1) 25 = 5^2
2) 100 = 10^2
3) 169 = 13^2
4) 225 = 15^2

The question asks for a property that these numbers have in common, *besides* being perfect squares.
The hint provided is:
25 = 16 + 9
100 = 36 + 64

Let's examine the hint. The numbers on the right side of the equations (16, 9, 36, 64) are all perfect squares.
16 = 4^2
9 = 3^2
36 = 6^2
64 = 8^2

The hint suggests that the numbers in the list can be expressed as the sum of two perfect squares. Furthermore, the examples in the hint use positive perfect squares (16, 9, 36, 64). This suggests the common property is that the numbers can be expressed as the sum of two positive perfect squares.

Let's check if this property holds for the other numbers in the list, 169 and 225. We need to determine if 169 and 225 can be written as the sum of two positive perfect squares.
For 169: We look for positive integers a and b such that a^2 + b^2 = 169. We can test squares of integers: 1^2=1, 2^2=4, 3^2=9, 4^2=16, 5^2=25, ..., 12^2=144, 13^2=169.
If a^2 = 25 (5^2), then b^2 = 169 - 25 = 144 = 12^2. Since 5 and 12 are positive integers, 25 and 144 are positive perfect squares. So, 169 = 25 + 144 = 5^2 + 12^2.
For 225: We look for positive integers a and b such that a^2 + b^2 = 225. We can test squares of integers: ..., 9^2=81, ..., 12^2=144, ..., 15^2=225.
If a^2 = 81 (9^2), then b^2 = 225 - 81 = 144 = 12^2. Since 9 and 12 are positive integers, 81 and 144 are positive perfect squares. So, 225 = 81 + 144 = 9^2 + 12^2.

We have now shown that all four numbers in the list can be expressed as the sum of two positive perfect squares:
25 = 3^2 + 4^2
100 = 6^2 + 8^2
169 = 5^2 + 12^2
225 = 9^2 + 12^2

This property is common to all the numbers in the list. The question asks for a property *besides* being perfect squares. For this property to be ""besides being perfect squares"", it must not be true for all perfect squares. Let's check some other perfect squares:
1 = 1^2. Can 1 be written as the sum of two positive perfect squares? No (1 = a^2 + b^2 with a,b > 0 implies 1 = 1^2 + b^2 is impossible, 1 = a^2 + 1^2 is impossible).
4 = 2^2. Can 4 be written as the sum of two positive perfect squares? No (a^2 + b^2 = 4 with a,b > 0. Possible squares are 1. 1+1 = 2 != 4).
9 = 3^2. Can 9 be written as the sum of two positive perfect squares? No (a^2 + b^2 = 9 with a,b > 0. Possible squares are 1, 4. 1+4=5 != 9).
16 = 4^2. Can 16 be written as the sum of two positive perfect squares? No (a^2 + b^2 = 16 with a,b > 0. Possible squares are 1, 4, 9. 1+4=5, 1+9=10, 4+9=13. None sum to 16).
36 = 6^2. Can 36 be written as the sum of two positive perfect squares? No (a^2 + b^2 = 36 with a,b > 0. Possible squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25. Sums: 1+4=5, ..., 1+25=26, 4+9=13, ..., 4+25=29, 9+16=25, 9+25=34, 16+25=41).

Since there are perfect squares (like 1, 4, 9, 16, 36) that cannot be expressed as the sum of two positive perfect squares, the property ""being the sum of two positive perfect squares"" is not true for all perfect squares. Therefore, it is a property that the given numbers have in common *besides* being perfect squares.

The common property is that each number can be expressed as the sum of two positive perfect squares.

The final answer is $\boxed{They are the sum of two positive perfect squares}$.",True,1,0

""Yours, probably.  Mr. Collins is at a conference for the weekend, and Monette took his math class.  It looks like she handed back an exam.""
""I teach math.  Can I help?""
All three talked at once; Monette was as frustrated as the two students.  While they jabbered, Corman managed to read the problem in question:
""My house is built on a strangely-shaped lot, so my back yard is a right triangle with an area of 840 square feet.  Each of the three sides measures an integral number of feet.  If I want to stake my dog so that he can reach the entire yard, how long must his rope be?""
Monette finally pulled rank on the adolescents.  ""It's not really your problem, but I'd be glad of some help.  Mr. Collins marked their papers wrong; their answers don't match his.

From the students' comments, we know that the Collins yard has the middle-sized hypotenuse.
A right triangle inscribes neatly into a semicircle, with the hypotenuse forming a diameter.  The shortest rope needed to reach all points is one staked at the midpoint of the hypotenuse, forming a radius of the circle.  74/2 = 37 feet.
The blond student found the first answer above, and would have used a rope of 29 feet.  The other student figured it at 113/2, or 56.5 feet.

206,"Question: Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)
 Hint: Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,,True,0,0

So, what is the password?
 Hint: There is some casework to be done on D; obviously we have that S = 1",There is some casework to be done on D; obviously we have that S = 1,"The password is LENS.
Since SL-D=3 or (SL-1)-D=3 (meaning SL-D=4), and since the highest possible sum of two different one-digit numbers is 17, S must equal 1.
Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.
Suppose D=7. Then L is 0 or 1, and since S=1, L=0. A must be 1 or 2, but since S=1, A=2.
Suppose D=8. Then L is 1 or 2, and since S=1, L=2. A must be 2 or 3, but since L=2, A=3.
Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.
Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.
If D=7, then L=0. But since 10-7=3, D cannot be 7.
If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.
If E=4, then N=3. But if D=8, A=3, and if D=9, L=3 and A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=5, then since 1I-E=6, I=1. But since S=1, this cannot work.
If E=7, then I=3. But if D=8, then A=3, and if D=9, then L=3. So this cannot work.
If E=8, then I=4, and D cannot be 8. But if D=9, then A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=9, then N=8, and D cannot be 8 or 9. So this cannot work.
Therefore, E=6, N=5, and I=2. If D=8, then L=2, so D must equal 9. This means:
S=1, I=2, L=3, A=4, N=5, E=6, and D=9.

210,"Question: In the far future, you find yourself a cube-maker. To make cubes, you would take a 12 by 12 by 12 Rubik's cube-like object.

You may say the total number of possible cubes (not necessarily with side length one) in the twelve by twelve by twelve Rubik's cube, and hocus-pocus, cubes of all sizes would appear. Assuming that each side in the tiny cubes has length one and that you may only make cubes of integer side length, what number should you say for the new technology to work?
 Hint: For 1^3+2^3+... n^3, use (1+2+...n)^2.","For 1^3+2^3+... n^3, use (1+2+...n)^2.","6084.
First, try a easier problem. Try a two by two by two Rubik's cube. There are 8 tiny cubes and one 2 by 2 by 2 cube. It should come to your notice that you take 2^3+1^3. But just to check, you look at a standard Rubik's cube with side length 3. There are, predictably, 27 one by one cubes, 8 two by two cubes, and one 3 by 3 cube. That was 3^3 +2^3 + 1^3. Now you can come to the conclusion that for any Rubik's cube with side length n, there are n^3+(n-1)^3 + ... 2^3+1^3 total cubes with integer side length. Therefore, there are 1^3+2^3+...12^3 cubes in the Rubik's cube with side length 12. The hint gives the formula for adding a sequence of cubes. Thus, you would get (1+2+3+4+...+11+12)^2 = 6084 cubes.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the side length of the large Rubik's cube-like object be $N=12$. This object is composed of $N \times N \times N$ tiny 1x1x1 cubes. We are asked to find the total number of possible cubes of integer side length within this object.

Let $s$ be the side length of a cube. Since the cubes must have integer side length and must be contained within the $N \times N \times N$ object, the possible values for $s$ are integers from 1 to $N$. In this case, $1 \le s \le 12$.

Consider a cube of side length $s$. We can specify the position of such a cube by the coordinates of its corner with the smallest x, y, and z values. Let's assume the tiny cubes are indexed by coordinates $(x, y, z)$ where $1 \le x, y, z \le N$. A cube of side length $s$ with its corner at $(x, y, z)$ occupies the space of tiny cubes from $(x, y, z)$ to $(x+s-1, y+s-1, z+s-1)$.

For the entire cube of side length $s$ to be contained within the $N \times N \times N$ object, all its tiny cubes must be within the bounds $[1, N] \times [1, N] \times [1, N]$. This means the corner with the largest coordinates, $(x+s-1, y+s-1, z+s-1)$, must satisfy:
$x+s-1 \le N$
$y+s-1 \le N$
$z+s-1 \le N$

From these inequalities, we get:
$x \le N-s+1$
$y \le N-s+1$
$z \le N-s+1$

Since $x, y, z$ must also be at least 1, the possible integer values for $x$ range from 1 to $N-s+1$. The number of possible values for $x$ is $(N-s+1) - 1 + 1 = N-s+1$. Similarly, there are $N-s+1$ possible values for $y$ and $N-s+1$ possible values for $z$.

The number of possible locations for a cube of side length $s$ is the product of the number of choices for $x, y$, and $z$. So, the number of cubes of side length $s$ is $(N-s+1)^3$.

We need to find the total number of possible cubes of all integer side lengths from 1 to $N$. This is the sum of the number of cubes of side length $s$ for each $s$ from 1 to $N$.
Total number of cubes = $\sum_{s=1}^{N} (N-s+1)^3$.

In this problem, $N=12$. So, the total number of cubes is $\sum_{s=1}^{12} (12-s+1)^3$.

Let's change the index of summation. Let $k = 12-s+1$.
When $s=1$, $k = 12-1+1 = 12$.
When $s=2$, $k = 12-2+1 = 11$.
...
When $s=12$, $k = 12-12+1 = 1$.
As $s$ goes from 1 to 12, $k$ goes from 12 down to 1. The sum can be written as:
Total number of cubes = $\sum_{k=1}^{12} k^3 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \dots + 12^3$.

The hint provided is: For $1^3+2^3+... n^3$, use $(1+2+...n)^2$. This tells us that the sum of the cubes of the first $n$ natural numbers is equal to the square of the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers.
For $n=12$, we have $\sum_{k=1}^{12} k^3 = \left(\sum_{k=1}^{12} k\right)^2$.

First, we calculate the sum of the first 12 natural numbers:
$\sum_{k=1}^{12} k = 1 + 2 + \dots + 12$.
Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$:
Sum $= \frac{12(12+1)}{2} = \frac{12 \times 13}{2} = 6 \times 13 = 78$.

Now, we calculate the square of this sum to find the total number of cubes:
Total number of cubes = $78^2$.
$78^2 = 78 \times 78$.
$78 \times 78 = (70 + 8) \times (70 + 8) = 70 \times 70 + 70 \times 8 + 8 \times 70 + 8 \times 8$
$= 4900 + 560 + 560 + 64$
$= 4900 + 1120 + 64$
$= 6020 + 64 = 6084$.

Alternatively, using multiplication:
   78
 x 78
 -----
  624 (8 * 78)
 5460 (70 * 78)
 -----
 6084

The total number of possible cubes of integer side length within the 12x12x12 Rubik's cube-like object is 6084. This is the number you should say for the new technology to work.

This is 73.756 feet, or 73 feet, 9 inches.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Here is the solution following the steps and justifications.

First, we list all prime numbers less than 100. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
The prime numbers less than 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.
There are 25 prime numbers less than 100. Let's denote them as $p_k$ for $k = 1, 2, \dots, 25$.
$p_1 = 2, p_2 = 3, p_3 = 5, \dots, p_{25} = 97$.

Part a) How far have you walked?
The total distance walked is the sum of the distances walked in each segment. The distance of the $k$-th segment is the $k$-th prime number, $p_k$.
Total distance $= \sum_{k=1}^{25} p_k$
Total distance $= 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31 + 37 + 41 + 43 + 47 + 53 + 59 + 61 + 67 + 71 + 73 + 79 + 83 + 89 + 97$.
Summing these numbers:
$2+3=5$
$5+5=10$
$10+7=17$
$17+11=28$
$28+13=41$
$41+17=58$
$58+19=77$

$712+79=791$
$791+83=874$
$874+89=963$
$963+97=1060$.
The total distance walked is 1060 feet.

Part b) How far (to the nearest inch) do you have to walk to return to your starting position?
This is the straight-line distance from the final position to the starting position. Let the starting position be the origin (0, 0) in the Cartesian plane.
The first step is to the right (positive x-direction) with distance $p_1$.
The second step is after turning right 90 degrees. If the first step was along (1, 0), turning right 90 degrees results in direction (0, -1) (south). Distance $p_2$.
The third step is after turning right 90 degrees again, resulting in direction (-1, 0) (west). Distance $p_3$.

Take the alphabetic position of the first letter, take half and then multiply by 1000. F = 6, halved = 3, * 1000 = 3,000.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Here is the solution following the steps derived from the problem description and the hint.

The given distances from England to particular countries are:
Australia - 500 miles
Peru - 8,000 miles
India - 4,500 miles
Scotland - 9,500 miles

We are asked to find the distance listed for France.

The hint suggests that the full length of the word (country name) does not matter, and that doubling the distances could make the pattern more illuminating.

Let's double the given distances:
Australia: 500 miles * 2 = 1000 miles
Peru: 8,000 miles * 2 = 16,000 miles
India: 4,500 miles * 2 = 9,000 miles
Scotland: 9,500 miles * 2 = 19,000 miles

Now let's consider the country names and the doubled distances. The hint mentions that the full length of the word does not matter, implying that some other characteristic of the word might be relevant. Let's look at the first letter of each country name.
Australia starts with A.
Peru starts with P.
India starts with I.
Scotland starts with S.
France starts with F.

Let's consider the alphabetical position of these first letters:
A is the 1st letter of the alphabet.
P is the 16th letter of the alphabet.
I is the 9th letter of the alphabet.
S is the 19th letter of the alphabet.
F is the 6th letter of the alphabet.

Now let's compare the alphabetical positions of the first letters with the doubled distances:
Australia (First letter A, position 1): Doubled distance is 1000.
Peru (First letter P, position 16): Doubled distance is 16000.
India (First letter I, position 9): Doubled distance is 9000.
Scotland (First letter S, position 19): Doubled distance is 19000.

Observing the pattern, we can see that the doubled distance appears to be the alphabetical position of the first letter multiplied by 1000.
For Australia: 1 * 1000 = 1000. This matches the doubled distance.
For Peru: 16 * 1000 = 16000. This matches the doubled distance.
For India: 9 * 1000 = 9000. This matches the doubled distance.
For Scotland: 19 * 1000 = 19000. This matches the doubled distance.

The pattern holds true for all given examples. The rule is: Doubled Distance = (Alphabetical Position of the First Letter) * 1000.

Now we can apply this pattern to find the distance listed for France.
France starts with the letter F.
The alphabetical position of F is 6.

According to the pattern, the doubled distance for France is:
Doubled Distance for France = (Alphabetical position of F) * 1000
Doubled Distance for France = 6 * 1000 = 6000 miles.

The question asks for the original distance listed for France, not the doubled distance. Since we doubled the original distance to find the pattern, we now need to divide the result by 2 to get the original distance.

Original Distance for France = Doubled Distance for France / 2
Original Distance for France = 6000 miles / 2 = 3000 miles.

Therefore, the atlas listed France as being 3,000 miles away.

The final answer is $\boxed{3000}$.",True,1,0
214,"Question: Alec, Brett and Chris each purchased parts for their skateboards at the sports store. Alec and Brett wanted to build new skateboards, so they each needed to purchase a deck, trucks, bearings and wheels. Chris only needed new wheels. The store offers a 10% discount for purchases over $250, so the boys decided to pay for all the parts together to qualify for the discount. Altogether, the boys spent $266.40. The clues below reflect the price of the items before the discount is applied.
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
They each bought the same kinds of wheels. Together they spent $75 for the 3 sets of wheels. Each set contained 4 wheels.
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his. However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Brett spent $3 more on bearings than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
How much did each person spend?
 Hint: Find the total price, then focus on each item separately","Find the total price, then focus on each item separately","Alec spent $113.40.
Brett spent $130.50.
Chris spent $22.50.
Component Alec Brett Chris Total
Deck $50 $45 $0 $95
Trucks 35 40 $0 75
Wheels 25 25 25 75
Bearings 16 35 $0 51
Total before discount $126 $145 $25 $296
less 10% discount $12.60 $14.50 $2.50 $29.60
Amount spent $113.40 $130.50 $22.50 $266.40
Explanation:
First find the original price of all the items combined. $266.40 is the price after the 10% discount was applied.
That means $266.40 is equal to 90% of the original price.
Write an equation and then cross multiply:
266.40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x   =   9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)
Let x = the amount Alec spent on trucks.
x + (x+5) = 75
2x + 5 = 75
2x = 70
x = 35
Alec spent $35 on trucks. Brett spent $5 more than Alec. Therefore, Brett spent $40 on trucks.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51
x + (2x + 3) = 51
3x + 3 = 51
3x = 48
x = 16
Alec's spent $16 on bearings.
Brett spent $35 on bearings",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let $C_{total}$ be the total cost of all the items before the discount.
The total amount spent after a 10% discount is $266.40. This means the amount paid is 90% of the original total cost.
$0.90 \times C_{total} = 266.40$
$C_{total} = \frac{266.40}{0.90} = \frac{2664}{9} = 296$
The total cost of all items before the discount was $296.

Let $D_A, T_A, B_A, W_A$ be the cost of Alec's deck, trucks, bearings, and wheels, respectively.
Let $D_B, T_B, B_B, W_B$ be the cost of Brett's deck, trucks, bearings, and wheels, respectively.
Let $W_C$ be the cost of Chris's wheels.
Alec and Brett each purchased a deck, trucks, bearings, and wheels. Chris purchased only wheels.
$C_{total} = (D_A + T_A + B_A + W_A) + (D_B + T_B + B_B + W_B) + W_C = 296$.

Clue 2: They each bought the same kinds of wheels. Together they spent $75 for the 3 sets of wheels.
This means $W_A = W_B = W_C$. Let $W$ be the cost of one set of wheels.
$W_A + W_B + W_C = 3W = 75$
$W = \frac{75}{3} = 25$
So, $W_A = 25, W_B = 25, W_C = 25$.

Clue 3: The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
The total cost of bearings for the 2 boys combined is $B_A + B_B$.
The total cost of wheels is $W_A + W_B + W_C = 75$.
$B_A + B_B = 75 - 24 = 51$. (Equation 1)

Clue 1: The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
$B_A + B_B = D_A + 1$. (Equation 2)
From Equation 1 and Equation 2:
$D_A + 1 = 51$
$D_A = 51 - 1 = 50$. The cost of Alec's deck was $50.

Clue 4: Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
$D_A = D_B + 5$.
$50 = D_B + 5$
$D_B = 50 - 5 = 45$. The cost of Brett's deck was $45.

Clue 5: Brett spent $3 more on bearings than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
$B_B = 2B_A + 3$. (Equation 3)
We also know $B_A + B_B = 51$ (Equation 1).
Substitute Equation 3 into Equation 1:
$B_A + (2B_A + 3) = 51$
$3B_A + 3 = 51$
$3B_A = 48$
$B_A = \frac{48}{3} = 16$. The cost of Alec's bearings was $16.
Now find $B_B$ using Equation 3:
$B_B = 2(16) + 3 = 32 + 3 = 35$. The cost of Brett's bearings was $35.

Now we know the cost of decks, bearings, and wheels for Alec and Brett, and wheels for Chris.
$D_A = 50, B_A = 16, W_A = 25$
$D_B = 45, B_B = 35, W_B = 25$
$W_C = 25$

We still need to find the cost of trucks for Alec ($T_A$) and Brett ($T_B$).
Clue 4 also states: Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
$T_B = T_A + 5$. (Equation 4)

The sum of the costs of all items before the discount is $296.
$(D_A + T_A + B_A + W_A) + (D_B + T_B + B_B + W_B) + W_C = 296$
Substitute the known values:
$(50 + T_A + 16 + 25) + (45 + T_B + 35 + 25) + 25 = 296$
$91 + T_A + 105 + T_B + 25 = 296$
$221 + T_A + T_B = 296$
$T_A + T_B = 296 - 221 = 75$. (Equation 5)

Now we have a system of two equations for $T_A$ and $T_B$:
1) $T_B = T_A + 5$ (Equation 4)
2) $T_A + T_B = 75$ (Equation 5)
Substitute Equation 4 into Equation 5:
$T_A + (T_A + 5) = 75$
$2T_A + 5 = 75$
$2T_A = 70$
$T_A = \frac{70}{2} = 35$. The cost of Alec's trucks was $35.
Now find $T_B$ using Equation 4:
$T_B = 35 + 5 = 40$. The cost of Brett's trucks was $40.

The cost of the items purchased by each person before the discount:
Alec: $D_A + T_A + B_A + W_A = 50 + 35 + 16 + 25 = 126$.
Brett: $D_B + T_B + B_B + W_B = 45 + 40 + 35 + 25 = 145$.
Chris: $W_C = 25$.
The total cost before discount is $126 + 145 + 25 = 296$, which matches our calculation.

The boys paid a total of $266.40. Since they paid together to get the discount, the most reasonable way to determine how much each person spent is to allocate the total discounted price proportionally to the original cost of the items each person purchased.
The total discount factor is $\frac{266.40}{296} = 0.9$.
Amount Alec spent = (Alec's original cost) $\times$ 0.9 = $126 \times 0.9 = 113.40$.
Amount Brett spent = (Brett's original cost) $\times$ 0.9 = $145 \times 0.9 = 130.50$.
Amount Chris spent = (Chris's original cost) $\times$ 0.9 = $25 \times 0.9 = 22.50$.
Let's check the sum: $113.40 + 130.50 + 22.50 = 266.40$. This matches the total amount spent.

Final Answer: Alec spent $113.40, Brett spent $130.50, and Chris spent $22.50.

The final answer is $\boxed{Alec spent $113.40, Brett spent $130.50, and Chris spent $22.50}$.",True,1,0

How many tables and chairs should the factory produce per hour to yield the highest revenue, and what is that revenue?
 Hint: Find the prodution limit of the machines and the intersections of these lines",Find the prodution limit of the machines and the intersections of these lines,"The 10 saws can produce 600 minutes of work per hour (10 saws * 60 minutes).
The 6 lathes can produce 360 minutes of work per hour (6 lathes * 60 minutes).
The 18 sanding machines can produce 1080 minutes of work per hour (18 sanding machines * 60 minutes).
Let c be the number of chairs produced per hour and t the number of tables produced per hour.
The number of saws limit the combination of chairs and tables to 600=10c+5t.
The number of lathes limit the combination of chairs and tables to 360=5c+5t.

Next graph these three lines. It should be expected that the answer will lie on the intersection of two of these lines or to make all chairs or all tables. The intersection of the saw and sanding machine line occurs outside of how many chairs the lathe can make so this combination is not a viable answer. The saw and lathe lines cross at 48 chairs and 24 tables. The lathe and sanding machine lines cross at 24 chairs and 48 tables.
Next determine the revenue at all points of intersection.

The resources available are:
- Saws: 10 machines, total time available = $10 \times 60 = 600$ minutes.
- Lathes: 6 machines, total time available = $6 \times 60 = 360$ minutes.
- Sanding machines: 18 machines, total time available = $18 \times 60 = 1080$ minutes.

The time required for each product is:
- Chair: 10 minutes (saw), 5 minutes (lathe), 5 minutes (sanding).
- Table: 5 minutes (saw), 5 minutes (lathe), 20 minutes (sanding).

The constraints based on machine time are:
- Saw constraint: $10C + 5T \le 600 \implies 2C + T \le 120$
- Lathe constraint: $5C + 5T \le 360 \implies C + T \le 72$
- Sanding constraint: $5C + 20T \le 1080 \implies C + 4T \le 216$

The non-negativity constraints are:
- $C \ge 0$
- $T \ge 0$

The objective is to maximize the total revenue, $R$, which is given by the selling price of chairs and tables:
- Revenue function: $R(C, T) = 10C + 20T$

We need to find the values of $C$ and $T$ that maximize $R(C, T)$ subject to the given constraints. This is a linear programming problem. We can solve it by identifying the feasible region defined by the constraints and evaluating the objective function at the vertices of this region.

The boundary lines of the constraint inequalities are:
L1: $2C + T = 120$
L2: $C + T = 72$
L3: $C + 4T = 216$
And the axes $C = 0$, $T = 0$.

The feasible region is the set of points $(C, T)$ that satisfy all constraints. We find the vertices of this region by finding the intersection points of the boundary lines and checking if they satisfy the other constraints.

1.  Intersection of L1 and L2:
    $2C + T = 120$
    $C + T = 72$
    Subtracting the second equation from the first gives $C = 48$. Substituting $C=48$ into $C + T = 72$ gives $48 + T = 72$, so $T = 24$. The intersection point is (48, 24).
    Check if (48, 24) satisfies L3: $48 + 4(24) = 48 + 96 = 144 \le 216$. Yes, it does. So, (48, 24) is a vertex.

2.  Intersection of L2 and L3:
    $C + T = 72 \implies C = 72 - T$
    $C + 4T = 216$
    Substitute $C$ in the second equation: $(72 - T) + 4T = 216 \implies 72 + 3T = 216 \implies 3T = 144 \implies T = 48$.
    Substitute $T=48$ into $C = 72 - T$: $C = 72 - 48 = 24$. The intersection point is (24, 48).
    Check if (24, 48) satisfies L1: $2(24) + 48 = 48 + 48 = 96 \le 120$. Yes, it does. So, (24, 48) is a vertex.

3.  Intersection of L1 and L3:
    $2C + T = 120 \implies T = 120 - 2C$
    $C + 4T = 216$
    Substitute $T$ in the second equation: $C + 4(120 - 2C) = 216 \implies C + 480 - 8C = 216 \implies -7C = -264 \implies C = 264/7$.
    $T = 120 - 2(264/7) = (840 - 528)/7 = 312/7$. The intersection point is (264/7, 312/7).
    Check if (264/7, 312/7) satisfies L2: $264/7 + 312/7 = 576/7$. $72 = 504/7$. $576/7 \not\le 504/7$. No, it violates L2. So, (264/7, 312/7) is not a vertex of the feasible region.

4.  Intersections with the axes:
    - Intersection with $T=0$:
        L1: $2C = 120 \implies C = 60$. Point (60, 0). Check L2: $60+0=60 \le 72$ (ok). Check L3: $60+4(0)=60 \le 216$ (ok). Vertex: (60, 0).
        L2: $C = 72$. Point (72, 0). Check L1: $2(72)+0=144 \not\le 120$ (violated). Not a vertex.
        L3: $C = 216$. Point (216, 0). Check L1: $2(216)+0=432 \not\le 120$ (violated). Not a vertex.
    - Intersection with $C=0$:
        L1: $T = 120$. Point (0, 120). Check L2: $0+120=120 \not\le 72$ (violated). Not a vertex.
        L2: $T = 72$. Point (0, 72). Check L3: $0+4(72)=288 \not\le 216$ (violated). Not a vertex.
        L3: $4T = 216 \implies T = 54$. Point (0, 54). Check L1: $2(0)+54=54 \le 120$ (ok). Check L2: $0+54=54 \le 72$ (ok). Vertex: (0, 54).
    - Origin: (0, 0). Satisfies all constraints. Vertex: (0, 0).

The vertices of the feasible region are (0, 0), (60, 0), (48, 24), (24, 48), and (0, 54).

Now, we evaluate the revenue function $R(C, T) = 10C + 20T$ at each vertex:
- $R(0, 0) = 10(0) + 20(0) = 0$
- $R(60, 0) = 10(60) + 20(0) = 600$
- $R(48, 24) = 10(48) + 20(24) = 480 + 480 = 960$
- $R(24, 48) = 10(24) + 20(48) = 240 + 960 = 1200$
- $R(0, 54) = 10(0) + 20(54) = 0 + 1080 = 1080$

Comparing the revenue values, the maximum revenue is 1200, which occurs at the vertex (24, 48).
This means the factory should produce 24 chairs and 48 tables per hour.

The highest revenue is $1200.

The final answer is $\boxed{24 \text{ chairs and } 48 \text{ tables to yield a revenue of } \$1200}$.",True,1,0

 Hint: Factorials can get a non-zero number from 0",Factorials can get a non-zero number from 0,"(0!+0!+0!+0!+0!)! = 120
0! is defined to equal 1.
(1+1+1+1+1)! = 5! = 120",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Yes, it is possible to make a total of 120 using five zeroes and mathematical operations.

To demonstrate this, we must use exactly five instances of the number 0 and combine them using valid mathematical operations to arrive at the value 120.

The hint suggests using factorials to obtain a non-zero number from 0. The factorial of 0, denoted by 0!, is defined as 1. This is a crucial step as it allows us to introduce non-zero values into our calculation starting from zeroes.

We are given five zeroes. Let's apply the factorial operation to each of them:
1. Apply the factorial operation to the first zero: 0! = 1. (We have used one zero).
2. Apply the factorial operation to the second zero: 0! = 1. (We have used two zeroes).
3. Apply the factorial operation to the third zero: 0! = 1. (We have used three zeroes).
4. Apply the factorial operation to the fourth zero: 0! = 1. (We have used four zeroes).
5. Apply the factorial operation to the fifth zero: 0! = 1. (We have used five zeroes).

After performing these operations, we have used all five of the given zeroes, and the result of these operations is five numbers, each equal to 1. We now have the numbers {1, 1, 1, 1, 1} derived from the original five zeroes.

Our goal is to reach a total of 120 using these numbers and any further mathematical operations. We know that 120 is equal to 5! (5 factorial). If we can combine the five numbers equal to 1 to form the number 5, we can then take the factorial of that result to obtain 120.

We can use the addition operation to combine the five 1s:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.

This addition operation combines the results obtained from using the five zeroes. The result of this sum is 5.

Finally, we apply the factorial operation to the sum (which is 5):
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Combining these steps, the entire mathematical expression using the five zeroes is:
(0! + 0! + 0! + 0! + 0!)!

Let's evaluate this expression step-by-step to verify it equals 120:
First, evaluate the factorials of the zeroes inside the parentheses. As established, 0! = 1.
So, the expression inside the parentheses becomes:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

Next, perform the addition inside the parentheses:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Finally, evaluate the factorial of the result from the parentheses:
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Thus, using five zeroes and the mathematical operations of factorial and addition, we can successfully obtain the total of 120.

222,"Question: Homer had always contemplated the size of the old oak tree in the field behind his house.  Standing 5 feet away from the 8 foot high fence in the back of the yard, he could just barely see the top leaves of the tree over the top of the fence.  He knew that the tree was 200 feet from the fence.  Homer was 6 feet tall, making his line of vision, 67 inches from the ground.
Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.
 Hint: TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches
Tree height from eye level = TAN (25.80 deg) * 2460 inches = 1189 inches
Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.  With the measurement capabilities available to any lumberjack (or any average Homer) precise measurements are not possible.  Thus the need to clarify these calculations as estimates.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Here is the step-by-step solution to estimate the height of the old oak tree.

We are given the following information:
1. Distance from Homer to the fence = 5 feet.
2. Height of the fence = 8 feet.
3. Distance from the fence to the tree = 200 feet.
4. Homer's line of vision = 67 inches from the ground.

We need to estimate the height of the tree.

First, we convert all measurements to a consistent unit, feet.
Homer's line of vision is 67 inches from the ground. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, his eye height in feet is 67 inches * (1 foot / 12 inches) = 67/12 feet.

The problem states that Homer could just barely see the top leaves of the tree over the top of the fence. This means Homer's line of sight from his eye level to the top of the tree passes exactly over the top of the 8-foot-high fence. We can model this situation using similar triangles or trigonometry, as suggested by the hint.

Let's use trigonometry based on the hint.
Imagine a right triangle formed by:
1. The horizontal line from Homer's eye level extending towards the fence.
2. The vertical line from the top of the fence downwards to Homer's eye level.
3. The line of sight from Homer's eye to the top of the fence.

The horizontal distance from Homer to the fence is 5 feet. This is the adjacent side of the angle of elevation from Homer's eye level.
The vertical distance from Homer's eye level to the top of the fence is the height of the fence minus Homer's eye height.
Vertical distance = 8 feet (fence height) - 67/12 feet (eye height) = 96/12 feet - 67/12 feet = 29/12 feet. This is the opposite side of the angle of elevation.

Let A be the angle of elevation from Homer's eye level to the line of sight passing over the top of the fence. Using the definition of tangent:
TAN A = Opposite / Adjacent
TAN A = (29/12 feet) / (5 feet)
TAN A = 29 / (12 * 5)
TAN A = 29/60.

Now, consider a larger right triangle formed by:
1. The horizontal line from Homer's eye level extending towards the tree.
2. The vertical line from the top of the tree downwards to Homer's eye level.
3. The line of sight from Homer's eye to the top of the tree.

The horizontal distance from Homer to the tree is the distance from Homer to the fence plus the distance from the fence to the tree: 5 feet + 200 feet = 205 feet. This is the adjacent side of the angle of elevation A for the large triangle.

Let H be the total height of the tree from the ground. The height of the tree above Homer's eye level is H - 67/12 feet. This is the opposite side of the angle of elevation A for the large triangle.

Using the definition of tangent for the large triangle, with the same angle A:
TAN A = (Height of tree above eye level) / (Horizontal distance to tree)
TAN A = (H - 67/12 feet) / (205 feet).

Since the angle A is the same in both cases, the tangent values must be equal:
(H - 67/12) / 205 = 29/60.

Now, we solve this equation for H:
Multiply both sides by 205:
H - 67/12 = 205 * (29/60).

Calculate the right side:
205 * 29 = 5945.
So, H - 67/12 = 5945 / 60.

Simplify the fraction 5945/60 by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:
5945 / 5 = 1189.
60 / 5 = 12.
So, H - 67/12 = 1189 / 12.

Now, isolate H by adding 67/12 to both sides:
H = 1189/12 + 67/12.

Add the fractions since they have a common denominator:
H = (1189 + 67) / 12
H = 1256 / 12.

Simplify the fraction 1256/12 by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
1256 / 4 = 314.
12 / 4 = 3.
So, H = 314/3 feet.

The calculated height of the tree is 314/3 feet. To provide an estimate in a common format, we can convert this fraction to feet and inches.
314 divided by 3 is 104 with a remainder of 2.
So, 314/3 feet = 104 feet and 2/3 of a foot.

Convert the fractional part of a foot to inches:
(2/3) feet * (12 inches / 1 foot) = (2 * 12) / 3 inches = 24 / 3 inches = 8 inches.

So, the height of the tree is 104 feet and 8 inches.

Final answer: 104 feet 8 inches",True,1,0

D. The chess marathon ran for a total of 16 hours.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"To solve this problem, we will assign a numerical value to each time-related quote, as suggested by the hint. Then, we will identify the quotes that do not belong by finding criteria that distinguish two of them from the rest.

Step 1: Assign a numerical value to each quote.
We will derive a numerical value for each statement based on the duration of time or the prominent number related to time mentioned in the quote.

A. 'My shortest business-related call today was from 5:55pm-5:55:29pm.'
The duration of the call is from 5:55:00 pm to 5:55:29 pm.
Duration = 5:55:29 - 5:55:00 = 29 seconds.
We assign the number 29 to quote A.

B. 'With the exception of one, five-day work week, I worked every day in September.'
The statement mentions a ""five-day work week"" as an exception. The number 5 is explicitly stated and is related to a period of time (days).
We assign the number 5 to quote B, representing the length of the exceptional period in days.

C. 'Sum of 3 Right angles and one 19 degree angle.'
This quote is about angles, which are measures in geometry, not time.
The sum of the angles is 3 * 90 degrees + 19 degrees = 270 + 19 = 289 degrees.
We assign the number 289 to quote C.

D. 'The chess marathon lasted from 12noon-4am.'
The duration of the chess marathon is from 12:00 pm to 4:00 am the next day.
From 12:00 pm to 12:00 am (midnight) is 12 hours.
From 12:00 am to 4:00 am is 4 hours.
Total duration = 12 hours + 4 hours = 16 hours.
We assign the number 16 to quote D, representing the duration in hours.

E. 'The show comes on at 4:30. It goes off at 5:30'
The duration of the show is from 4:30 to 5:30.
Duration = 5:30 - 4:30 = 1 hour.
1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.
We assign the number 60 to quote E, representing the duration in minutes.

So, the numerical values assigned to the quotes A, B, C, D, and E are 29, 5, 289, 16, and 60, respectively.

Step 2: Identify the quote(s) that are not primarily about time.
Let's examine the subject of each quote:
A is about the duration of a phone call. This is time-related.
B is about the number of days worked in a month (September). This is time-related.
C is about the sum of angles. This is related to geometry, not time.
D is about the duration of a chess marathon. This is time-related.
E is about the duration of a show. This is time-related.

Quote C is clearly different from the others because it deals with angles and geometry, while A, B, D, and E deal with time or duration. Therefore, quote C does not belong.

Step 3: Among the time-related quotes, identify a mathematical property that distinguishes one from the others based on their numerical values.
The time-related quotes are A, B, D, and E, with assigned numerical values 29, 5, 16, and 60. We need to find a property that one of these numbers (5, 16, 29, 60) does not share with the other three.

Let's consider the property of being a sum of two integer squares. An integer n can be written as the sum of two integer squares (n = a^2 + b^2 for integers a and b) if and only if the prime factorization of n contains no prime number congruent to 3 mod 4 raised to an odd power.

Let's check this property for each number:
- For 5: The prime factorization of 5 is just 5. 5 is a prime congruent to 1 mod 4 (5 = 4*1 + 1). Thus, 5 is a sum of two squares: 5 = 1^2 + 2^2.
- For 16: The prime factorization of 16 is 2^4. The only prime factor is 2, which is not congruent to 3 mod 4. Thus, 16 is a sum of two squares: 16 = 4^2 + 0^2.
- For 29: The prime factorization of 29 is just 29. 29 is a prime congruent to 1 mod 4 (29 = 4*7 + 1). Thus, 29 is a sum of two squares: 29 = 2^2 + 5^2.
- For 60: The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. The prime factor 3 is congruent to 3 mod 4 (3 = 4*0 + 3). The power of 3 in the factorization is 1, which is odd. According to the theorem, 60 is not a sum of two integer squares.

Based on this property, the numbers 5, 16, and 29 are all sums of two integer squares, but 60 is not. The number 60 is associated with quote E.

Step 4: State the two quotes that do not belong.
We have identified that quote C does not belong because it is not related to time.
Among the time-related quotes (A, B, D, E), quote E is distinguished by its associated numerical value (60) not being a sum of two integer squares, a property shared by the numbers associated with A, B, and D (29, 5, 16).

Therefore, the two time-related quotes that do not belong are C and E.

Final Answer Justification:
Quote C does not belong because it refers to the sum of angles, which is a concept from geometry, unlike the other quotes that pertain to time or duration.
Quotes A, B, D, and E are time-related, and their associated numerical values (29, 5, 16, and 60 respectively) can be examined for a distinguishing property. The numbers 5, 16, and 29 are all sums of two integer squares (5 = 1^2 + 2^2, 16 = 4^2 + 0^2, 29 = 2^2 + 5^2). The number 60, however, is not a sum of two integer squares (as its prime factorization contains 3 raised to an odd power). Thus, quote E does not belong with the other time-related quotes based on this numerical property.

The two quotes that do not belong are C and E.

Final answer should list the quotes by their letter.

228,"Question: Can you take 4 7's and arrange them with any math symbols needed to make the total be 100?
 Hint: Division is needed",Division is needed,Note that 77 and 77 can be separated to some form of the identity (77/77 = 1) but then we can use a decimal point to get 77/.77 and 77/.77=100,GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"To solve the problem, we need to arrange exactly four 7's using mathematical symbols to obtain the value 100. The hint provided states that division is needed. We are allowed to use any mathematical symbols needed.

Let the four 7's be represented as the digits $7, 7, 7, 7$. We need to form an expression using these digits and mathematical symbols that evaluates to 100.

We can use concatenation to form numbers like 77 from two 7's, 777 from three 7's, etc. We can use a decimal point to form numbers like 0.7, 0.77, 7.7, etc. These are commonly accepted methods in these types of puzzles under the condition ""any math symbols needed"", as the decimal point and the act of placing digits next to each other to form a number are mathematical notations.

Let's consider forming numbers using the four 7's and see if we can combine them with operations, keeping in mind the hint about division.

Consider the number 77, formed by concatenating two 7's. We have two 7's remaining.
We need to reach 100. If we perform division, perhaps we can create a ratio that simplifies to 100.
Let's try dividing 77 by a number formed from the remaining two 7's.
What if we divide 77 by 0.77?
The number 0.77 can be formed from the remaining two 7's by placing a decimal point before them.
So, we can form the expression $77 / .77$.

Let's verify if this expression uses exactly four 7's.
The number 77 uses two 7's by concatenation.
The number .77 uses the other two 7's by using a decimal point and concatenation.
In total, we have used $2 + 2 = 4$ sevens. This satisfies the condition.

Now, let's evaluate the expression $77 / .77$.
The decimal number $0.77$ can be written as the fraction $77/100$.
So, the expression becomes $77 / (77/100)$.
Dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal.
$77 / (77/100) = 77 \times (100/77)$.
We can cancel out the factor of 77 in the numerator and the denominator:
$77 \times (100/77) = (77/77) \times 100 = 1 \times 100 = 100$.
The expression evaluates to 100.

The mathematical symbols used are the digit '7', concatenation (to form 77 and .77), the division symbol '/', and the decimal point '.'. The problem allows ""any math symbols needed"", which includes these standard mathematical notations and operations. The hint that division is needed is also satisfied.

Thus, the arrangement $77 / .77$ using four 7's results in 100.

Final check of all conditions:
1. Use 4 7's: Yes, the digits in 77 and .77 are four 7's.
2. Arrange them with any math symbols: Yes, we used division, concatenation, and a decimal point.

The problem states that ABCD * 4 = DCBA.
So, $4 \times (1000A + 100B + 10C + D) = 1000D + 100C + 10B + A$.

Since ABCD is a four-digit number, $A$ must be a non-zero digit, i.e., $A \in \{1, 2, ..., 9\}$.
Since DCBA is also a four-digit number, $D$ must be a non-zero digit, i.e., $D \in \{1, 2, ..., 9\}$.
The digits A, B, C, and D must be distinct.

The product $4 \times ABCD$ is DCBA, which is a four-digit number.
The smallest four-digit number is 1000 and the largest is 9999.

Combining the possible values for A (1 or 2) with the condition that A must be even, the only possibility is $A = 2$.

Now we know A = 2. The equation becomes 2BCD * 4 = DCB2.
Let's consider the multiplication in terms of columns, as we learned in elementary school:
  2 B C D
x       4
---------
D C B 2

Looking at the units column, the multiplication of D by 4 must result in a number ending in A = 2.
Let's list the possible values for D (digits from 0 to 9):
$4 \times 0 = 0$ (ends in 0)
$4 \times 1 = 4$ (ends in 4)
$4 \times 2 = 8$ (ends in 8)
$4 \times 3 = 12$ (ends in 2)
$4 \times 4 = 16$ (ends in 6)
$4 \times 5 = 20$ (ends in 0)
$4 \times 6 = 24$ (ends in 4)
$4 \times 7 = 28$ (ends in 8)
$4 \times 8 = 32$ (ends in 2)
$4 \times 9 = 36$ (ends in 6)
The digits D for which $4 \times D$ ends in 2 are 3 and 8.
So, D can be 3 or 8.
Since the digits A, B, C, D must be distinct, and we know A=2, D cannot be 2. This is consistent with D being 3 or 8.

Now let's consider the thousands column. 4 multiplied by A (which is 2), plus any carry-over from the hundreds column, must result in D.
$4 \times A + \text{carry}_3 = D$.
Substituting A=2, we get $4 \times 2 + \text{carry}_3 = D$, which is $8 + \text{carry}_3 = D$.
The carry-over $\text{carry}_3$ is from the multiplication of 4 by B plus any carry from the tens column. $4 \times B + \text{carry}_2 = 10 \times \text{carry}_3 + C$. The maximum value of $4 \times B + \text{carry}_2$ (where B is a digit and carry_2 is at most 3) is $4 \times 9 + 3 = 39$, so $\text{carry}_3$ can be at most 3.
So $\text{carry}_3 \in \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$.
We have $8 + \text{carry}_3 = D$.
If D = 3, then $8 + \text{carry}_3 = 3$. This is impossible since $\text{carry}_3 \ge 0$.
If D = 8, then $8 + \text{carry}_3 = 8$. This implies $\text{carry}_3 = 0$.
So, we must have $D = 8$ and $\text{carry}_3 = 0$.

We have found A = 2 and D = 8. These are distinct digits.
Now let's use the carries from the multiplication process:
1. Units column: $4 \times D = 10 \times \text{carry}_1 + A$.
   With D=8 and A=2: $4 \times 8 = 32$. So $32 = 10 \times \text{carry}_1 + 2$.
   $30 = 10 \times \text{carry}_1$, which gives $\text{carry}_1 = 3$.

2. Tens column: $4 \times C + \text{carry}_1 = 10 \times \text{carry}_2 + B$.
   With $\text{carry}_1 = 3$: $4C + 3 = 10 \times \text{carry}_2 + B$.

3. Hundreds column: $4 \times B + \text{carry}_2 = 10 \times \text{carry}_3 + C$.
   With $\text{carry}_3 = 0$: $4B + \text{carry}_2 = 10 \times 0 + C$, so $4B + \text{carry}_2 = C$.

We have a system of two equations with B, C, and $\text{carry}_2$:
(1) $4C + 3 = 10 \times \text{carry}_2 + B$
(2) $4B + \text{carry}_2 = C$

Substitute the expression for C from equation (2) into equation (1):
$4 \times (4B + \text{carry}_2) + 3 = 10 \times \text{carry}_2 + B$
$16B + 4 \times \text{carry}_2 + 3 = 10 \times \text{carry}_2 + B$
Subtract B and $4 \times \text{carry}_2$ from both sides:
$15B + 3 = 6 \times \text{carry}_2$
Divide by 3:
$5B + 1 = 2 \times \text{carry}_2$

Now consider the possible values for $\text{carry}_2$. $\text{carry}_2$ is the carry-over from $4C + \text{carry}_1 = 4C + 3$.
Since C is a digit (0-9), $4C+3$ can range from $4 \times 0 + 3 = 3$ to $4 \times 9 + 3 = 39$.
So, $\text{carry}_2$ can be the tens digit of these results, which means $\text{carry}_2 \in \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$.

Let's test these possible values for $\text{carry}_2$ in the equation $5B + 1 = 2 \times \text{carry}_2$:
- If $\text{carry}_2 = 0$: $5B + 1 = 2 \times 0 = 0 \implies 5B = -1$. No integer solution for B.
- If $\text{carry}_2 = 1$: $5B + 1 = 2 \times 1 = 2 \implies 5B = 1$. No integer solution for B.
- If $\text{carry}_2 = 2$: $5B + 1 = 2 \times 2 = 4 \implies 5B = 3$. No integer solution for B.
- If $\text{carry}_2 = 3$: $5B + 1 = 2 \times 3 = 6 \implies 5B = 5 \implies B = 1$.

So, the only possible values are $\text{carry}_2 = 3$ and $B = 1$.

We have found B = 1 and $\text{carry}_2 = 3$. Now we can find C using equation (2):
$C = 4B + \text{carry}_2 = 4 \times 1 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$.

The determined digits are A=2, B=1, C=7, D=8.
Let's check if these digits are distinct: {2, 1, 7, 8}. Yes, they are all distinct.
Let's verify the original equation: ABCD * 4 = DCBA.
Substituting the values: 2178 * 4 = 8712.
Let's perform the multiplication: $2178 \times 4 = (2000 + 100 + 70 + 8) \times 4 = 8000 + 400 + 280 + 32 = 8712$.
The number 8712 corresponds to DCBA, where D=8, C=7, B=1, A=2. This matches our findings.

All conditions are satisfied, and all letters have been assigned a unique digit.

The letters stand for:
A = 2
B = 1
C = 7
D = 8

Final verification:
ABCD = 2178
DCBA = 8712
Is 2178 * 4 = 8712? Yes.
Are A, B, C, D distinct digits? Yes, {2, 1, 7, 8}.
Is A non-zero? Yes, A=2.
Is D non-zero? Yes, D=8.

 Hint: nan",,"The prime factorization of 225 is 5*5*3*3. So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.
All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,,True,0,0
232,"Question: Which three consecutive prime numbers, when multiplied together, give the product 190747?
 Hint: 50^2 = 125000",50^2 = 125000,"60^3 = 216000; 50^3 = 125000; 53, 59 and 61.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the three consecutive prime numbers be $p_1, p_2, p_3$, where $p_1 < p_2 < p_3$, and there are no prime numbers between $p_1$ and $p_2$, and no prime numbers between $p_2$ and $p_3$.
We are given that the product of these three prime numbers is 190747.
So, $p_1 \times p_2 \times p_3 = 190747$.

Since the three prime numbers are consecutive, they are relatively close to each other. Their values should be around the cube root of the product.
Let's estimate the cube root of 190747.
We know that $50^3 = 125000$ and $60^3 = 216000$. Since 190747 is between 125000 and 216000, the cube root of 190747 is between 50 and 60.
Let's refine the estimate:
$57^3 = 185193$
$58^3 = 195112$
Since 190747 is between 185193 and 195112, the cube root of 190747 is between 57 and 58.
This suggests that the prime numbers we are looking for are around 57 or 58. The middle prime number $p_2$ should be close to this value.

Let's list the prime numbers around 57:
..., 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, ...
We are looking for three consecutive prime numbers. Let's consider the consecutive prime triplets in this region.
The prime numbers around 57 are 53, 59, 61. Let's check if these are consecutive.
The prime number after 53 is 59.
The prime number after 59 is 61.
So, 53, 59, and 61 are indeed three consecutive prime numbers.

Now, let's check the product of these three consecutive prime numbers:
$53 \times 59 \times 61$.
First, calculate $53 \times 59$:
$53 \times 59 = 53 \times (60 - 1) = 53 \times 60 - 53 \times 1 = 3180 - 53 = 3127$.
Next, calculate $3127 \times 61$:
$3127 \times 61 = 3127 \times (60 + 1) = 3127 \times 60 + 3127 \times 1 = 187620 + 3127 = 190747$.

The product of 53, 59, and 61 is 190747, which matches the given product.
Since 53, 59, and 61 are consecutive prime numbers, they are the required numbers.

To confirm that this is the unique solution, we can check the product of the previous set of three consecutive primes (47, 53, 59) and the next set (59, 61, 67).
Product of (47, 53, 59): $47 \times 53 \times 59 = 47 \times 3127 = 146969$. This is less than 190747.
Product of (59, 61, 67): $59 \times 61 \times 67 = 3599 \times 67 = 241133$. This is greater than 190747.
Since the product of consecutive positive numbers increases as the numbers increase, the triplet (53, 59, 61) is the unique set of three consecutive prime numbers whose product is 190747.

The hint $50^2 = 125000$ is mathematically incorrect ($50^2 = 2500$). However, if we interpret it as a hint about the magnitude of the numbers, potentially related to $50^3 = 125000$, it suggests the numbers are around 50, which is consistent with our finding that the numbers are 53, 59, and 61.

Therefore, the sum of all such numbers is 29+89=118.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let $p$ be a prime number. We are looking for prime numbers $p$ such that $1 < p < 100$ and they satisfy two conditions:
1. $p$ is 1 greater than a multiple of 4. This can be written using modular arithmetic as $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$.
2. $p$ is 1 less than a multiple of 5. This can be written using modular arithmetic as $p \equiv -1 \pmod{5}$. This is equivalent to $p \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$.

We need to find all prime numbers $p$ in the range $(1, 100)$ that satisfy the system of congruences:
$p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$
$p \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$

We can solve this system using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We are looking for a number $p$ that satisfies both congruences. The modulus of the combined congruence will be the least common multiple of 4 and 5, which is $\text{lcm}(4, 5) = 20$. So, the solution will be of the form $p \equiv x \pmod{20}$ for some integer $x$.

We can find $x$ by testing values or by a constructive method.
From the first congruence, $p$ can be written as $p = 4k + 1$ for some integer $k$.
Substituting this into the second congruence:
$4k + 1 \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$
Subtract 1 from both sides:
$4k \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$
To solve for $k$, we can multiply by the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 5. The inverse of 4 modulo 5 is 4, since $4 \times 4 = 16 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$.
$4 \times 4k \equiv 4 \times 3 \pmod{5}$
$16k \equiv 12 \pmod{5}$
$k \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$
So, $k$ must be of the form $k = 5t + 2$ for some integer $t$.

Now substitute this expression for $k$ back into the equation for $p$:
$p = 4k + 1 = 4(5t + 2) + 1 = 20t + 8 + 1 = 20t + 9$.

Thus, any integer $p$ that satisfies both congruences must be of the form $20t + 9$ for some integer $t$. In modular arithmetic notation, $p \equiv 9 \pmod{20}$.

We are looking for prime numbers $p$ in the range $(1, 100)$ that are of the form $20t + 9$.
Let's list the numbers of this form within the given range:
For $t=0$, $p = 20(0) + 9 = 9$.
For $t=1$, $p = 20(1) + 9 = 29$.
For $t=2$, $p = 20(2) + 9 = 49$.
For $t=3$, $p = 20(3) + 9 = 69$.
For $t=4$, $p = 20(4) + 9 = 89$.
For $t=5$, $p = 20(5) + 9 = 109$, which is greater than 100, so we stop here.

The numbers between 1 and 100 that satisfy the given congruences are 9, 29, 49, 69, and 89.

Now we need to determine which of these numbers are prime.
- 9 is divisible by 3 ($9 = 3 \times 3$), so it is not prime.
- To check if 29 is prime, we test for divisibility by prime numbers up to $\sqrt{29}$. Since $\sqrt{29} \approx 5.38$, we only need to check primes 2, 3, and 5.
  - 29 is not divisible by 2 (it is odd).
  - The sum of the digits of 29 is $2+9=11$, which is not divisible by 3, so 29 is not divisible by 3.
  - 29 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
  Therefore, 29 is a prime number.
- 49 is divisible by 7 ($49 = 7 \times 7$), so it is not prime.
- 69 is divisible by 3 ($69 = 3 \times 23$), so it is not prime.
- To check if 89 is prime, we test for divisibility by prime numbers up to $\sqrt{89}$. Since $\sqrt{89} \approx 9.43$, we need to check primes 2, 3, 5, and 7.
  - 89 is not divisible by 2 (it is odd).
  - The sum of the digits of 89 is $8+9=17$, which is not divisible by 3, so 89 is not divisible by 3.
  - 89 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
  - Divide 89 by 7: $89 = 12 \times 7 + 5$. The remainder is not 0, so 89 is not divisible by 7.
  Therefore, 89 is a prime number.

The prime numbers between 1 and 100 that satisfy both conditions are 29 and 89.

Snogs are each one more than a multiple of 8.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"A number is a snog if it satisfies a specific property. We are given examples of numbers that are snogs and numbers that are not snogs, along with the hint ""Snogs are one more than..."".

Let n be a number. The hint suggests that if n is a snog, then n = m + 1 for some number m that has a certain property. Let's examine the numbers m = n - 1 for the given snogs:
If 25 is a snog, then 25 - 1 = 24.
If 73 is a snog, then 73 - 1 = 72.
If 81 is a snog, then 81 - 1 = 80.
If 9 is a snog, then 9 - 1 = 8.
If 33 is a snog, then 33 - 1 = 32.
If 41 is a snog, then 41 - 1 = 40.
If 65 is a snog, then 65 - 1 = 64.
The numbers m derived from the snogs are {24, 72, 80, 8, 32, 40, 64}. Let's look for a common property among these numbers.
We can observe that all these numbers are multiples of 8:
24 = 8 × 3
72 = 8 × 9
80 = 8 × 10
8 = 8 × 1
32 = 8 × 4
40 = 8 × 5
64 = 8 × 8
It appears that the property of m is ""being a multiple of 8"".

Now let's test this hypothesis with the numbers that are NOT snogs. According to our hypothesis, if n is NOT a snog, then n - 1 should NOT be a multiple of 8.
If 5 is NOT a snog, then 5 - 1 = 4. Is 4 a multiple of 8? No, 4 = 8 × 0 + 4.
If 70 is NOT a snog, then 70 - 1 = 69. Is 69 a multiple of 8? No, 69 = 8 × 8 + 5.
If 16 is NOT a snog, then 16 - 1 = 15. Is 15 a multiple of 8? No, 15 = 8 × 1 + 7.
If 3 is NOT a snog, then 3 - 1 = 2. Is 2 a multiple of 8? No, 2 = 8 × 0 + 2.
If 29 is NOT a snog, then 29 - 1 = 28. Is 28 a multiple of 8? No, 28 = 8 × 3 + 4.
If 44 is NOT a snog, then 44 - 1 = 43. Is 43 a multiple of 8? No, 43 = 8 × 5 + 3.
If 59 is NOT a snog, then 59 - 1 = 58. Is 58 a multiple of 8? No, 58 = 8 × 7 + 2.
If 60 is NOT a snog, then 60 - 1 = 59. Is 59 a multiple of 8? No, 59 = 8 × 7 + 3.
If 64 is NOT a snog, then 64 - 1 = 63. Is 63 a multiple of 8? No, 63 = 8 × 7 + 7.

In all cases, the numbers obtained by subtracting 1 from the non-snogs are indeed not multiples of 8. This confirms our hypothesis.
The property of a snog n is that n - 1 is a multiple of 8. This can be written as n - 1 ≡ 0 (mod 8), which is equivalent to n ≡ 1 (mod 8).
So, a number is a snog if and only if its remainder when divided by 8 is 1.

Now we apply this rule to the list of numbers provided in the question:
48, 57, 37, 17, 53, 49, 62, 8, 4, 18.
We check the remainder of each number when divided by 8:
48 ÷ 8 = 6 remainder 0. 48 ≡ 0 (mod 8). Not a snog.
57 ÷ 8 = 7 remainder 1. 57 ≡ 1 (mod 8). Is a snog.
37 ÷ 8 = 4 remainder 5. 37 ≡ 5 (mod 8). Not a snog.
17 ÷ 8 = 2 remainder 1. 17 ≡ 1 (mod 8). Is a snog.
53 ÷ 8 = 6 remainder 5. 53 ≡ 5 (mod 8). Not a snog.
49 ÷ 8 = 6 remainder 1. 49 ≡ 1 (mod 8). Is a snog.

18 ÷ 8 = 2 remainder 2. 18 ≡ 2 (mod 8). Not a snog.

The numbers from the list that are snogs are those that have a remainder of 1 when divided by 8. These numbers are 57, 17, and 49.

1. The third digit is twice the fifth: $d_3 = 2 \times d_5$.
Since $d_3$ and $d_5$ are single digits from 1 to 9, the possible pairs $(d_5, d_3)$ are:
- If $d_5 = 1$, $d_3 = 2$.
- If $d_5 = 2$, $d_3 = 4$.
- If $d_5 = 3$, $d_3 = 6$.
- If $d_5 = 4$, $d_3 = 8$.
(If $d_5 \ge 5$, $d_3 \ge 10$, which is not a digit).

2. The fourth is six greater than the second: $d_4 = d_2 + 6$.
Since $d_2$ and $d_4$ are single digits from 1 to 9, the possible pairs $(d_2, d_4)$ are:
- If $d_2 = 1$, $d_4 = 7$.
- If $d_2 = 2$, $d_4 = 8$.
- If $d_2 = 3$, $d_4 = 9$.
(If $d_2 \ge 4$, $d_4 \ge 10$, which is not a digit).

3. The last (fifth) is three less than the first: $d_5 = d_1 - 3$, or $d_1 = d_5 + 3$.
Since $d_1$ and $d_5$ are single digits from 1 to 9, the possible pairs $(d_5, d_1)$ are:
- If $d_5 = 1$, $d_1 = 4$.
- If $d_5 = 2$, $d_1 = 5$.
- If $d_5 = 3$, $d_1 = 6$.
- If $d_5 = 4$, $d_1 = 7$.",True,0,0

240,"Question: In the legendary land of Madadia, everything is wonderful. There is no inflation, so Madadian wonks (local currency 100 winks = 1 wonk) are constant in value.
Mad Ade's cousin Manic Martin works as an accountant in one of Madadia's leading accounting firms.
After his first year his salary was a straight 10,000 wonks, with which Manic Martin was quite happy. His manager was so impressed with his work he offered Manic Martin a wage rise.
Now this being Madadia, things are not always done as they are elsewhere, the wage rise was offered over a 17.5 year contract period, These contracts are immutably binding, and will still be paid to benefactors in the event of death or permanent disability.
Manic Martin has a choice of how to receive his raise.  The first option was for an immediate 5% raise to 10,500 wonks annually, with an additional 5% raise every 6 months. The second option was for an immediate 10% raise to 11,000 wonks annually, with an additional 10% raise every year. Manic Martin's salary, based upon his current annual, was paid bi-weekly.
Which deal would benefit Manic Martin the most?
 Hint: Think about the difference between the first and second half of every year",Think about the difference between the first and second half of every year,"The 5% semi-annual raise yields a higher return.
This may have been your first guess, but there is something odd about the answer. At the start of the problem, the 10% raise is earning more-  11,000 annually vs. 10,500. After the first year, the 5% option has earned 10,762 compared to 11,000.
What are the two options earning at the moment the contract closes, after 17.5 years? Surprisingly, the 5% option only realizes a little more than 55,160, compared to the 10% option which is still ahead with just under 56,000.
So where's the advantage in the 5% option? It hides in the second half of every year. Even in the first year, the 5% option makes more in the second six months than the 10% option. For the first few years, this is not enough to offset the difference. But cumulatively, over seventeen and a half years, 5% realizes a grand total of 390.27 more than the 10% option.

241,"Question: If you drop a bouncy ball from a distance of 9 feet from the floor, the ball will continue to bounce. Assume that each time it bounces back two thirds of the distance of the previous bounce. How far will the ball travel before it stops?
 Hint: Geometric series...",Geometric series...,"45 feet.
The distance can be calculated as 9 + (9)*(2/3)*(2) + (9)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(2)+..., with the 2 accounting for the upward and downward travel distance.

Factoring out the 18 will result in a series that is equal to (1/(1-(2/3))), which equals 3.  Multiplying by the 18 and then subtracting the nine used to create the series will result in 54 - 9 = 45.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let $h_0$ be the initial height from which the ball is dropped. We are given $h_0 = 9$ feet.
When the ball hits the floor, it bounces back up to a height that is two thirds of the previous distance.
Let $h_n$ be the maximum height reached after the $n$-th bounce.
According to the problem, $h_1 = \frac{2}{3} h_0$, $h_2 = \frac{2}{3} h_1 = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 h_0$, $h_3 = \frac{2}{3} h_2 = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 h_0$, and in general, $h_n = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n h_0$.

The total distance the ball travels consists of the initial drop, followed by a sequence of bounces. Each bounce involves the ball traveling upwards to a certain height and then falling back down from that same height.

The distance traveled during the initial drop is $d_0 = h_0$.

After the first bounce, the ball travels up a distance of $h_1$ and then down a distance of $h_1$. The total distance for the first bounce cycle is $2h_1$.
After the second bounce, the ball travels up a distance of $h_2$ and then down a distance of $h_2$. The total distance for the second bounce cycle is $2h_2$.
After the $n$-th bounce, the ball travels up a distance of $h_n$ and down a distance of $h_n$. The total distance for the $n$-th bounce cycle is $2h_n$.

The ball continues to bounce infinitely, but the height of each successive bounce decreases. The total distance traveled before the ball stops is the sum of the initial drop distance and the distances traveled during all subsequent bounce cycles.

Total distance $D = d_0 + (2h_1) + (2h_2) + (2h_3) + \dots$
$D = h_0 + 2h_1 + 2h_2 + 2h_3 + \dots$

Substitute the expressions for $h_n$ in terms of $h_0$:
$D = h_0 + 2\left(\frac{2}{3}h_0\right) + 2\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 h_0 + 2\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 h_0 + \dots$
$D = h_0 + 2h_0\left[\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 + \dots\right]$

The expression in the square brackets is an infinite geometric series with the first term $a = \frac{2}{3}$ and the common ratio $r = \frac{2}{3}$.
Since the absolute value of the common ratio, $|r| = \left|\frac{2}{3}\right| = \frac{2}{3}$, is less than 1, the series converges.

The sum of an infinite geometric series with first term $a$ and common ratio $r$ (where $|r| < 1$) is given by the formula $S = \frac{a}{1-r}$.

In this case, the sum of the series is:
$S = \frac{\frac{2}{3}}{1 - \frac{2}{3}} = \frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{3}{3} - \frac{2}{3}} = \frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{1} = 2$.

Now substitute this sum back into the equation for the total distance $D$:
$D = h_0 + 2h_0(S)$
$D = h_0 + 2h_0(2)$
$D = h_0 + 4h_0$
$D = 5h_0$

Given that the initial height $h_0 = 9$ feet, the total distance is:
$D = 5 \times 9$ feet
$D = 45$ feet.

Alternatively, we can sum the initial drop and the distances of each bounce cycle separately.
Initial drop = 9 feet.
Distance of 1st bounce cycle = $2 \times h_1 = 2 \times \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 2 \times 6 = 12$ feet.
Distance of 2nd bounce cycle = $2 \times h_2 = 2 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 \times 9 = 2 \times \frac{4}{9} \times 9 = 2 \times 4 = 8$ feet.
Distance of 3rd bounce cycle = $2 \times h_3 = 2 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times 9 = 2 \times \frac{8}{27} \times 9 = 2 \times \frac{8}{3} = \frac{16}{3}$ feet.
And so on.

The total distance is the sum of the initial drop and the distances of all bounce cycles:
$D = 9 + 12 + 8 + \frac{16}{3} + \dots$

The sequence of distances for the bounce cycles (up and down) is $12, 8, \frac{16}{3}, \dots$. This is a geometric series with the first term $A = 12$ and the common ratio $R = \frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3}$.
Since $|R| = \frac{2}{3} < 1$, the series converges.
The sum of this infinite geometric series is $S_{bounces} = \frac{A}{1-R} = \frac{12}{1 - \frac{2}{3}} = \frac{12}{\frac{1}{3}} = 12 \times 3 = 36$ feet.

The total distance is the initial drop plus the sum of the distances of all bounce cycles:
$D = 9 + S_{bounces}$
$D = 9 + 36$
$D = 45$ feet.

Both methods yield the same result and utilize the concept of a geometric series as suggested by the hint.

The final answer is $\boxed{45 \text{ feet}}$.",True,1,0

As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.

1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.

 Hint: Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.

3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have

Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74

Rudolf 59 118

At exactly 2:00, the angle made by the hour hand is 60 degrees from vertical.  If you let x = the number of minutes past 2:00 that we are looking for, then the hour hand will be at:

It can't be x+y (that would be more than ""1"") so it must be x-y=1. By simple substitution the answer is revealed.",GeminiFlash,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the two whole numbers be $x$ and $y$.
According to the problem statement, the square of one whole number minus the square of another whole number equals 73. We can represent this equation as $x^2 - y^2 = 73$.

Since the difference of the squares is a positive number (73), the square of the first number must be greater than the square of the second number. Since $x$ and $y$ are whole numbers (non-negative integers), this implies that the first number, $x$, must be greater than the second number, $y$. Thus, we assume $x > y \ge 0$.

We can factor the left side of the equation $x^2 - y^2 = 73$ as a difference of squares:
$(x - y)(x + y) = 73$.

Since $x$ and $y$ are whole numbers and $x > y \ge 0$, $x-y$ and $x+y$ must be integers.
Furthermore, since $x > y \ge 0$, $x-y$ must be a positive integer, and $x+y$ must be a positive integer.
Let $a = x-y$ and $b = x+y$. We have $ab = 73$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers.

We need to find the positive integer factors of 73. The number 73 is a prime number. The only positive integer factors of a prime number are 1 and the number itself.
So, the only pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ such that $ab = 73$ are $(1, 73)$ and $(73, 1)$.

We also know that $x+y \ge x-y$ because $y \ge 0$ implies $x+y - (x-y) = 2y \ge 0$. Therefore, $b \ge a$.
Considering the possible pairs $(a, b) = (x-y, x+y)$, we must have $b \ge a$.
This leaves only one possibility for the pair $(a, b)$:
$a = x-y = 1$
$b = x+y = 73$

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables $x$ and $y$:
1) $x - y = 1$
2) $x + y = 73$

We can solve this system by adding the two equations:
$(x - y) + (x + y) = 1 + 73$
$2x = 74$
$x = \frac{74}{2} = 37$.

Now substitute the value of $x$ into either equation to find $y$. Using the first equation:
$37 - y = 1$
$y = 37 - 1 = 36$.

We have found the two numbers $x=37$ and $y=36$.
We need to verify if these are whole numbers and if they satisfy the original condition.
37 is a whole number, and 36 is a whole number.
Let's check the original equation:
$x^2 - y^2 = 37^2 - 36^2$.
We can compute the squares: $37^2 = 1369$ and $36^2 = 1296$.
$37^2 - 36^2 = 1369 - 1296 = 73$.
Alternatively, using the difference of squares factorization:
$37^2 - 36^2 = (37 - 36)(37 + 36) = (1)(73) = 73$.
The condition is satisfied.

The hint ""73 is similar 41,29,19 etc."" points to the fact that 73 is a prime number, just like 41, 29, and 19. This primality is crucial because it limits the number of factors, making the factorization method very efficient compared to trial and error on the squares of numbers. If the number was composite, there would be more pairs of factors to check, although the parity condition ($x-y$ and $x+y$ must have the same parity) would still limit the possibilities. For a prime number $p > 2$, the factors are 1 and $p$, which are both odd, so $x-y=1$ and $x+y=p$ always gives integer solutions for $x$ and $y$.

The two whole numbers are 37 and 36.

The final answer is $\boxed{37 \text{ and } 36}$.",True,1,0
