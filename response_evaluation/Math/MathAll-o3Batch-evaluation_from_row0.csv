0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning

1,"What is the smallest integer such that if you rotate the number to the left you get a number that is exactly one and a half times the original number?
(To rotate the number left, take the first digit off the front and append it to the end of the number.  2591 rotated to the left is 5912.)","The number has 16 digits.  I repeat, the number has 16 digits.","1,176,470,588,235,294

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)
10,15 (2,3)
So the five smallest numbers with this property are:

3529411764705882

5882352941176470
Notice that 2352941176470588 can be rotated TWICE, yielding 1.5 times the number each time since the 4->6->9 n digits are in order.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We want the smallest positive integer N whose left-rotation equals 1.5 N.

Let N have n digits.  Write
N = a·10^{n-1} + b ,
where a (1≤a≤9) is the first digit and b is the (n–1)-digit tail, possibly with leading zeros.
Left-rotating gives
R = b·10 + a .
We need
b·10 + a = 1.5 (a·10^{n-1} + b).

Eliminate decimals:
10b + a = (3/2)(a·10^{n-1} + b)
⇒ 20b + 2a = 3a·10^{n-1} + 3b
⇒ 17b + 2a = 3a·10^{n-1}
⇒ 17b = a(3·10^{n-1} – 2).          (1)

Because a ≤ 9 < 17, equation (1) forces
17 | (3·10^{n-1} – 2).               (2)

Thus we require
3·10^{n-1} ≡ 2 (mod 17)
⇒ 10^{n-1} ≡ 12 (mod 17)   (since 3^{-1} ≡ 6 mod 17).

Compute powers of 10 mod 17 until 12 appears:

10^1≡10, 10^2≡15, 10^3≡14, 10^4≡4, 10^5≡6,
10^6≡9, 10^7≡5, 10^8≡16, 10^9≡7, 10^{10}≡2,
10^{11}≡3, 10^{12}≡13, 10^{13}≡11, 10^{14}≡8,
10^{15}≡12.

The first appearance is at exponent 15, so n–1 = 15 and hence n = 16.
Therefore the sought number has 16 digits.

Now (2) is satisfied, so (1) gives
b = a(3·10^{15} – 2) / 17.

Take the smallest possible leading digit a = 1 (larger a only increases N):

b = (3·10^{15} – 2) / 17
  = (3 000 000 000 000 000 – 2) / 17
  = 2 999 999 999 999 998 / 17
  = 176 470 588 235 294.

Thus
N = a·10^{15} + b
  = 1·10^{15} + 176 470 588 235 294
  = 1 176 470 588 235 294.

Check:
Left-rotate N: 1 764 705 882 352 941.
1.5·N = 1.5 × 1 176 470 588 235 294 = 1 764 705 882 352 941.

They match, so the number is correct, and with 16 digits it is minimal.

5,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Ralph was impressed by the ingenuity of Rex's last attempt using clues involving prime numbers, but he thinks he's got an even better one for Rex. He tells Rex he's thinking of a 6-digit number.
""All of the digits are different. The digital sum matches the number formed by the last two digits in the number. The sum of the first two digits is the same as the sum of the last two digits.""
""Take the sum of the number, the number rotated one to the left, the number rotated one to the right, the number with the first three and last three digits swapped, the number with the digit pairs rotated to the left, and the number with the digit pairs rotated to the right. The first and last digits of this sum match the last two digits of the number, in some order.""
Ralph then asks, ""If each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs in the number is prime, then what is the number?""
Rex looks confused, and for a moment Ralph thinks he's finally gotten him. Then Rex smiles, scribbles a few things down on a pad of paper and then says, ""Very nice, Ralph!""
Rex then tells Ralph his number.
What did Rex say?
(See the hint for an explanation of the terminology.)","The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number. The digital sum of 247 is 2+4+7 = 13.

Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the left gives 789056;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the right gives 905678.","416723
Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the six different digits be

   The pair (e,f) = (2,3) works:

      ef = 23 (prime)  
      e + f = 5

      From (2) we need a + b = 5 with ab prime and digits new.  
      The only possibility is ab = 41.

      From (3) we need c + d = 13 with cd prime, digits new.  
      The only possibility is cd = 67.

   Hence the candidate number is 416 723.

5.  Check the rotations and pair–rotations mentioned in the statement:

      N               = 416 723  
      rotate left     = 167 234  
      rotate right    = 341 672  
      swap halves     = 723 416  
      rotate pairs L  = 672 341  
      rotate pairs R  = 234 167  

      Their sum is S = 2 555 553.

      First digit of S = 2, last digit = 3.  
      These are exactly the last two digits (e,f) = (2,3) of N, in some order,
      so the long-sum condition is satisfied.

6.  The alternative number arising from (e,f) = (2,9) (namely 476 129 or 836 129)
    gives a sum whose outer digits are 3 and 9, failing this requirement.

Therefore the only six-digit number satisfying every condition is

      416 723.

6,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

n = number of sides of the two regular polygons  
R = circum-radius of the house (the radius of the round foundation)  
r = in-radius of the house  
Rₗ = circum-radius of the lot  
rₗ = in-radius of the lot  
s  = side of the house  
S  = side of the lot ( = length of the pipe )  
θ = π/n  

1.  “The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is the same as the diameter of the foundation.”  
    ⇒ Distance from the foundation circle to the lot boundary is 2R.  
    The foundation is concentric with the lot, so this distance is rₗ – R.  
    Therefore rₗ – R = 2R ⇒ rₗ = 3R. (1)

2.  Regular n-gon relations  
        r = R cos θ, S = 2R u, rₗ = S/(2 tan θ).           (2)

3.  “The pipe bisected the area of the house and its ends are on the boundary.”  
    Any straight line through the centre of a regular polygon halved its area, so the pipe passes through the centre.  
    Its length therefore is 2u for some radius u with r ≤ u ≤ R.  
    We are only told that this length equals the length of a side of the lot, so  

        S = 2u.                                                  (3)

4.  Using (1), (2) and (3):

        3R = rₗ = S/(2 tan θ) = (2u)/(2 tan θ) = u/ tan θ  
        ⇒ u = 3R tan θ.                                          (4)

    But u ≤ R, r ≤ u, so  
        r = R cos θ ≤ u = 3R tan θ ≤ R  
        ⇒ cos θ ≤ 3 tan θ ≤ 1.                                 (5)

    Inequalities (5) are satisfied only for θ between about 17.5° and 18.4°.  
    The only integer n with π/n in that tiny interval is n = 10.  
    So both the lot and the house are regular decagons.  

    For θ = π/10 = 18°  
        sin θ = 0.309016994, cos θ = 0.951056516, tan θ = 0.324919696.

    Equation (4) with u ≤ R now fixes u = 3R tan θ = 0.974758 R < R, so all
    conditions are consistent.

5.  Fence length.  
    There are ten sides; one side is the gate (length S), the other nine are fenced.  
        9 S = 400 ⇒ S = 400/9 ft = 44.444 … ft.              (6)

6.  Radius of the house.  
    From S = 2u with u = 3R tan θ,

        R = S / (6 tan θ) = (400/9)/(6·0.324919696)
          = 22.7996 ft.                                       (7)

7.  One–storey floor area of the house (regular decagon).  
    House side length s = 2R sin θ = 2·22.7996·0.309016994 = 14.0899 ft.  
    Area of a regular n-gon: A = n s² / (4 tan θ)

        A₁ = 10·(14.0899)² / (4·0.324919696) = 1 528.36 ft².  (8)

8.  Central circular atrium.  
    The “longest measurement” of the lot is its diameter 2Rₗ.  
    Atrium diameter = (1/10)·2Rₗ = 0.2 Rₗ, so atrium radius = 0.1 Rₗ.  
    Now Rₗ = rₗ /cos θ = 3R /cos θ = 3·22.7996/0.951056516 = 71.927 ft.  
    Atrium radius = 7.1927 ft, area = π·7.1927² = 162.58 ft². (9)

    Net usable floor per storey  
        A₁ – A_atrium = 1 528.36 – 162.58 = 1 365.78 ft².     (10)

9.  The house has two storeys, both with the same footprint around the open
    atrium, so total square footage  

        2·1 365.78 = 2 731.6 ft² ≈ 2 732 square feet.        (11)

trigonometry, and he answered:

Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.
We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).

8,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""

Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"1.  “One less” and “one more” are each the product of five primes  
   ⇒  N – 1 and N + 1 have 5 primes apiece.  
   The three numbers together possess 13 different primes  
   ⇒  the 5 primes of N – 1, the 5 primes of N + 1 and the primes of N are pair-wise disjoint, so N itself has 13 – 5 – 5 = 3 distinct prime factors.

2.  Let those three primes be 2, p, q (they must contain the even prime 2, otherwise the sum of three odd primes could not be 1400).  
   Sum-of-prime-factors condition: 2 + p + q = 1400 ⇒ p + q = 1398. (1)

3.  Digital–sum conditions  
   •  Each of the three primes 2, p, q has a prime digit–sum.  
   •  If S1 = d.s.(2)=2, S2 = d.s.(p), S3 = d.s.(q), then d.s.(S1S2S3) is a prime whose reverse is the digit–sum of N itself.

   Examination of two–digit primes whose reversals are also prime and can be a digit–sum (≤ 54 for a 6–digit number) leaves only  
        d.s.(product) = 13 and d.s.(N) = 31. (2)

4.  “The middle two digits are the only prime digits.”  
   That forces an even number of digits; trying 4 digits quickly fails, so N must have 6 digits:

        N = d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6
        d3 and d4 are the only prime digits (2,3,5,7);
        d3d4 itself is prime and can only be 37 or 73
        (because a 3–digit prime cannot end in 2 or 5).

   The other four digits come from {0,1,4,6,8,9} and
        d.s.(N)=31 ⇒ (d1+d2+d5+d6)=21. (3)

5.  The first three digits form a prime whose successive digit–sums are prime:
        d1d2d3 is prime, DS1 = d1+d2+d3 prime,
        DS2 = d.s.(DS1) prime,
        DS3 = d.s.(DS2) prime.
   The only possibilities are DS1 = 5,7,11,23,29.

   Working these constraints through gives exactly two admissible
   6–digit numbers

        443 794  and  887 314. (4)

6.  Both pass every “digit” criterion, but we still need the
    prime-factor properties.  To avoid heavy factoring, note:

    If N were divisible by 13 then its three different primes would be
        {2, 13, r} and 2 + 13 + r = 1400 ⇒ r = 1385, not a prime.
    Hence Rex’s number cannot be divisible by 13.

    Of the two candidates found in (4) only 443 794 is divisible by 13,
    so it is automatically ruled out; the other number must be Rex’s.

        N = 887 314 = 2 × 487 × 911  (p + q = 487 + 911 = 1398)
        d.s.(N) = 8+8+7+3+1+4 = 31.
        N – 1 = 887 313 = 3·7·29·31·47  (5 primes)

Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?",The sum cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes. Think about what information is provided by each character knowing and/or not knowing the numbers.,"The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Here, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is 52.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning, step by step

Let the two integers be x ≤ y,  
S = x + y (known only to Sachin),  
P = x·y   (known only to Prashant).  
All numbers are > 1.

0.  Public knowledge  
Everybody (including Nakul) knows only that 2 ≤ x ≤ y and hears every sentence of the conversation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Sachin :  “Prashant, I don’t think that we know the numbers.”

•  Sachin certainly does not know the numbers, so S ≠ 4,5 (because
   4 = 2+2 and 5 = 2+3 would each determine the pair immediately).

•  Moreover he is sure that Prashant cannot know the numbers either.
   Therefore for every pair {a,b} with a+b = S the product a·b must
   have more than one factorisation into integers ≥2.
   (If even one product were unique, Sachin could not be certain that
   Prashant is ignorant.)

Call such sums admissible.  All people now know that S is admissible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Prashant :  “Aha!  Now I know the numbers.”

After hearing “S is admissible”, Prashant looks at his product P.

For Prashant to be suddenly certain, P must have exactly one factor
pair whose sum is admissible; all its other factor pairs must have
non-admissible sums.  Searching through the possible products shows
that the only product with this property is

       P = 52 = 4·13.

Indeed, 52 factors as  
        52 = 2·26   sum 28  (not admissible: 28 fails Sachin’s test)  
        52 = 4·13   sum 17  (admissible)

So Prashant can deduce {x,y} = {4,13}.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Sachin :  “Oh, now I also know the numbers.”

Sachin knows S.  The sums compatible with Prashant’s remark are those
which occur just once in a product that behaved as in step 2.

Looking at his own admissible sum S he finds that

      S = 17

is the only admissible sum that can appear in just one place inside a
product qualifying for step 2 (namely inside 52 = 4·13).  Therefore
Sachin, too, arrives at {x,y} = {4,13}.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Nakul :  “Now I also know the numbers.”

An outsider has heard all the public reasoning:

•  S must be admissible (step 1);  
•  P must be the unique product that left Prashant certain (step 2);  
•  S must be the unique admissible sum that still survives (step 3).

Putting these together leaves the single possibility x = 4, y = 13.
Hence Nakul also identifies the two numbers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion

All four mathematicians inevitably pin down the same pair:

Final answer: 4 and 13",True,1,1
10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

N₀ = number of coconuts in the original pile  
N₁ = pile after the 1st person has acted  
N₂ = pile after the 2nd person has acted  
⋯  
N₅ = pile seen next morning  

Forward (night-time) action of any person  
• He finds one coconut left over, gives it to the monkey.  
• The remainder is divisible by 5; he keeps one fifth and leaves four fifths.  

Hence for every k = 1,2,3,4,5  

Nₖ = 4/5 · (Nₖ₋₁ – 1) .                                     (1)

It is easier to work backwards.  From (1) we can solve for Nₖ₋₁:

5Nₖ = 4(Nₖ₋₁ – 1)   ⇒   4Nₖ₋₁ = 5Nₖ + 4   ⇒  

Nₖ₋₁ = (5Nₖ + 4)/4 .                                     (2)

For (2) to give an integer, 5Nₖ + 4 must be divisible by 4; because 5 ≡ 1 (mod 4) this is equivalent to  

Nₖ ≡ 0 (mod 4).                                            (3)

Start with the final (morning) pile.  The five survivors now divide it exactly, so

N₅ ≡ 0 (mod 5).                                            (4)

Because of (3) with k = 5, we also need N₅ ≡ 0 (mod 4).  
Thus  

N₅ is a multiple of lcm(4,5) = 20.  Write N₅ = 20t.       (5)

Step 1 backward (compute N₄)

N₄ = (5N₅ + 4)/4 = (5·20t + 4)/4 = 25t + 1.

Condition (3) for k = 4 demands N₄ ≡ 0 (mod 4):

25t + 1 ≡ t + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ t ≡ 3 (mod 4).

Put t = 4s + 3 and go on.

Step 2 backward (compute N₃)

N₄ = 25(4s + 3) + 1 = 100s + 76.

N₃ = (5N₄ + 4)/4 = (5·(100s + 76) + 4)/4 = 125s + 96.

Again N₃ ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ s ≡ 0 (mod 4).  
Write s = 4r.

Step 3 backward  

N₂ = (5N₃ + 4)/4 = (5·(125r + 96) + 4)/4 = 625r + 121.

Need N₂ ≡ 0 (mod 4): 625r + 121 ≡ r + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ r ≡ 3 (mod 4).  
Put r = 4u + 3.

Step 4 backward  

N₁ = (5N₂ + 4)/4 = (5·(625(4u+3) + 121) + 4)/4 = 3125u + 2496.

Impose N₁ ≡ 0 (mod 4): 3125u + 2496 ≡ u ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ u = 4v.

Step 5 backward (original pile)

N₀ = (5N₁ + 4)/4  
    = (5·(3125u + 2496) + 4)/4  
    = 15625u + 3121  
    = 15625·(4v) + 3121  
    = 15625v + 3121.                                       (6)

The smallest non-negative v is 0, giving the minimal possible pile:

N₀ = 3121.

Verification (forward):

Start with 3121
 1st person: (3121 −1)/5 = 624 kept, 2496 left.  
 2nd person: (2496 −1)/5 = 499 kept, 1996 left.  
 3rd person: (1996 −1)/5 = 399 kept, 1596 left.  
 4th person: (1596 −1)/5 = 319 kept, 1276 left.  
 5th person: (1276 −1)/5 = 255 kept, 1020 left.  
Morning: 1020/5 = 204 each, no remainder.

Everything is integral and the conditions are satisfied.

11,What is the only non-palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome?,A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward as it does backward.  An example would be 1221. An integer is a number that has no decimal places.  A cube is the result of multiplying a number by itself three times.,"2201
2201^3 = 10662526601",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let n be the sought positive integer and N = n³ its cubic palindrome.

1.  The last (and first) digit  
   Since the last digit of a cube is determined by the last digit of its base  

         0→0, 1→1, 2→8, 3→7, 4→4, 5→5, 6→6, 7→3, 8→2, 9→9,  

   the only possibilities for the common first-and-last digit d of N are  
   d = 0,1,4,5,6,9,8,7,2,3 respectively.  
   But d = 0 would force N to start with 0, impossible;  
   d = 5 would give a leading 5 and N > 5·10ᵏ while still ending in 125, which is easily
   seen to ruin the palindromic symmetry.  
   A quick parity check rules out the even digits 2,4,6,8 (their cubes are even,
   whereas a palindrome that starts with an even digit would have to be even and hence end
   with 0, contradiction).  
   Hence d = 1 is the only viable first/last digit and n must end in 1.  
   Write n = 10k + 1 (k ≥ 1).

2.  Reducing the number of candidates  
   Expand the cube:

        n³ = (10k + 1)³ = 1 000 k³ + 300 k² + 30 k + 1.               (★)

   Because the last two digits of N are “01”, the number 30 k must be divisible by 100;
   hence k is a multiple of 10: k = 10ℓ, ℓ ≥ 1.  
   Put this into (★):

        n = 100ℓ + 1,

        n³ = 1 000 000 ℓ³ + 30 000 ℓ² + 300 ℓ + 1.                 (★★)

   •  The last four digits of N are given by 300 ℓ + 1.  
      Denote them by abcd; written as a four–digit string they read

         abcd = 300 ℓ + 1  (0 ≤ a ≤ 9).

   •  N is a palindrome, so its first four digits are dcba, the reverse of abcd.

3.  For how many digits does N have?  
   If ℓ ≤ 21, then 1 000 000 ℓ³ < 10¹⁰, so N has at most 10 digits;  
   if ℓ ≥ 47, then 1 000 000 ℓ³ ≥ 10¹¹, so N has at least 12 digits.  
   Hence a palindromic N with an even number of digits is impossible  
   (palindromes with an even number of digits are divisible by 11, yet cubes are never
   divisible by 11).  
   Therefore N must have 11 digits, forcing 22 ≤ ℓ ≤ 46.

4.  Matching the first four digits with the last four  
   Divide (★★) by 10⁷ (to throw away the last seven digits).  
   Because N has 11 digits, the integer part

         ⌊N / 10⁷⌋ = ⌊0.1ℓ³ + 0.003ℓ²⌋

   equals the four–digit number dcba.  
   But dcba, being the reverse of abcd = 300 ℓ + 1, must start with “10” (since
   abcd ends with “01”).  
   Consequently

         1000 ≤ ⌊0.1ℓ³ + 0.003ℓ²⌋ < 1100.                         (†)

   Now check which ℓ between 22 and 46 satisfies (†):

         ℓ = 22 → 0.1ℓ³ + 0.003ℓ² = 1066.252…  ✅ within the range  
         ℓ = 23 → 0.1ℓ³ + 0.003ℓ² = 1218.287…  too large  
         ℓ ≥ 24  value increases further.

   Thus ℓ = 22 is the unique solution.

5.  Assembling the number  
   With ℓ = 22:

        n = 100ℓ + 1 = 2201,

        n³ = 2201³ = 10 662 526 601,

   and indeed 10 662 526 601 reads the same forward and backward.

Since every logical branch produced at most one candidate and that candidate
works, 2201 is the only non-palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome.

When the back of the train passes Al, he and Ben have both walked 30 feet, meaning Ben will walk 15 feet more when the train passes him. 30 feet that Al walks plus 45 feet that Ben walks makes 75 feet that the back of the train travels in the same time that Ben walks 15 feet, meaning the train is 5 times as fast as Al and Ben.
In the time it takes Al to walk 30 feet, the front of the train moves 150 feet. This distance plus the 30 feet that Al has walked equals 180 feet.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 L = length of the train (ft)  
 v_t = speed of the train (ft/s)  
 v_w = walking speed of Al and Ben (ft/s)

At the instant the front of the train passes them (t = 0):

• Al starts walking opposite the train.  
  – The back of the train is L ft behind him and is moving toward him at speed v_t.  
  – Al is moving toward the back at speed v_w.  
  – Relative speed between Al and the back = v_t + v_w.  
  – Time until the back reaches Al: t_A = L / (v_t + v_w).  
  – Distance Al walks: v_w t_A = v_w L /(v_t + v_w) = 30 ft. (1)

• Ben starts walking in the same direction as the train.  
  – The back of the train is L ft behind him and must catch up.  
  – Relative speed between the back and Ben = v_t – v_w.  
  – Time until the back reaches Ben: t_B = L / (v_t – v_w).  
  – Distance Ben walks: v_w t_B = v_w L /(v_t – v_w) = 45 ft. (2)

Set up the two equations:

(1) v_w L /(v_t + v_w) = 30  
(2) v_w L /(v_t – v_w) = 45

Solve for the ratio v_t / v_w:

30(v_t + v_w) = 45(v_t – v_w)  
30v_t + 30v_w = 45v_t – 45v_w  
15v_t = 75v_w  
v_t = 5v_w.

Now find L using either equation.  Using (1):

L = 30 (v_t + v_w)/v_w  
  = 30 (5v_w + v_w)/v_w  
  = 30·6 = 180 ft.

(Checking with (2): L = 45 (5v_w – v_w)/v_w = 45·4 = 180 ft.)

Therefore the train is 180 feet long.

Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
To find all Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00, set i = 1 and check all values of j.
j = 0, s = 25.17482517, time = 1:00:25.17
j = 1, s = 327.2727273, time = 1:05:27.27

There are 143 total swap times.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 H = the hour that is showing (H = 0,1,…,11 with H = 0 meaning 12 o’clock)  
 M = the exact number of minutes past the hour (a real number, 0 ≤ M < 60)

Angles measured clockwise from 12 o’clock

 hour–hand angle Ah = 30 H + 0.5 M   (degrees)  
 minute–hand angle Am = 6 M           (degrees)

At a Swap Time the two hands may be exchanged and the picture must again be a legal clock-time, say H′ hours M′ minutes.  
Therefore

 6 M′ = 30 H + 0.5 M                (1)  
 30 H′ + 0.5 M′ = 6 M               (2)

Solve (1) for M′ and insert in (2):

 M′ = 5H + M/12

 30 H′ + 0.5(5H + M/12) = 6 M  
 ⇒ 720 H′ + 60 H = 143 M          (3)

Hence the original minutes are

 M = 60(H + 12 H′)/143             (4)

and, by symmetry, the minutes after the swap are

 M′ = 60(12 H + H′)/143            (5)

Both M and M′ must lie in [0,60).  
The only choice of (H,H′) that makes either expression equal to 60 is H = H′ = 11, so every ordered pair (H,H′) except (11,11) gives a legitimate Swap Time.

A) One Swap Time  
Take H = 1, H′ = 1 in (4):

 M = 60(1+12)/143 = 780/143 = 5.454545… min  
 = 5 min 27.27 s

So 1 : 05 : 27.27 is a Swap Time (12 : 00 : 00 also works, but this is a non-trivial example).

B) All Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00 (H = 1, H′ = 0…11)

For H = 1 put H′ = 0,1,…,11 in (4).  
Let k = 12 H′ + 1; then M = 60k/143 minutes.

k  M (min)          expressed as   time (rounded to 0.01 s)

133 55.804196…     55 min 48.25 s  1 : 55 : 48.25  

Thus the twelve Swap Times in the 1-o’clock hour are  

1 : 00 : 25.17, 1 : 05 : 27.27, 1 : 10 : 29.37, 1 : 15 : 31.47, 1 : 20 : 33.57,

1 : 50 : 46.15, 1 : 55 : 48.25.

Bonus) How many Swap Times are there altogether?  

There are 12 possible values for H and 12 for H′, giving 144 ordered pairs.  
Exactly one pair, (H,H′) = (11,11), leads to M = M′ = 60, which is not a valid minute reading.  
Hence the total number of Swap Times is 144 − 1 = 143.

15,"I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?","Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

Tommy’s present age = T  
Timmy’s present age = t  
Tammy’s present age = m  
Tracey’s present age = r  
Tony’s present age = n  
Mother’s present age = M  

All ages are whole numbers and the birth-order is  

Tommy  > Timmy  > Tammy  > Tracey  > Tony.

------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  “I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.”

When Tony was born the children were n years younger, so Timmy’s age then
was t – n.  
Hence            m = 3(t – n).                                       (1)

------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  “When Mum turns 50, Tony will be as old as Mum was when she had Tommy.”

Mum will reach 50 in (50 – M) years; Tony will then be n + (50 – M).

Mum’s age when Tommy was born was M – T.

So               n + (50 – M) = M – T  
                       ⇔        2M = T + n + 50                     (2)

Because M<50, (2) gives T + n < 50.

------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Factor condition at Tony’s birth  

Mum’s age at Tony’s birth:    B₅ = M – n.  
Tommy’s, Timmy’s, Tammy’s and Tracey’s ages then:  

     T – n,    t – n,    m – n,    r – n

are all factors of B₅.

------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Eliminating M and B₅

Let P = T – n (Tommy’s age when Tony was born).

From (2):  M = (T + n + 50)/2 = (P + n + n + 50)/2 = n + 30.

Therefore B₅ = M – n = 30 + n – n = 30, and

     P, t – n, m – n, r – n all divide 30.                        (3)

Also  P = T – n = (T + n) – 2n < 50 – 2n < 50, and (from (2))
                P = T – n is even and divides 30, so P = 2 or 10.

P = 2 is impossible (5 children can’t fit in a 2-year span), hence

     P = 10  → T = n + 10,  M = n + 30,  B₅ = 30.                 (4)

------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Working out the smaller ages

Because T – n = 10 is a factor of 30, all four factors in (3) must be
divisors of 30.

Let  

     a = t – n  (divisor of 30, less than 10)  
     b = m – n  (divisor of 30, between a and 0)  
     c = r – n  (divisor of 30, between b and 0)

From (1):   m = 3(t – n) = 3a  ⇒  b = m – n = 3a – n.

For the birth-order we need a > b > c > 0, so

     3a – n < a ⇒ 2a < n          (5)

------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  The “other year” condition

“The only other year in which more than two of us were factors of Mum’s
age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.”

Half of Tammy’s current age is (3a)/2, so it must be an integer ⇒ a is
even.

Divisors of 30 less than 10 that are even: 2 or 6.

• a = 2 violates (5) (it would force n ≤ 4), so  
• a = 6.

Then  n > 12 and, from T + n < 50, we have n ≤ 19.

But b = 3a – n = 18 – n must be positive ⇒ n < 18, so n = 13, 14, 15, 16 or 17.

Checking each value so that b is a divisor of 30 gives possibilities:

     n=13 → b=5 (divides 30)  
     n=14 → b=4 (not a divisor)  
     n=15 → b=3 (divides 30)  
     n=16 → b=2 (divides 30)  
     n=17 → b=1 (divides 30)

The “other year” occurs when Tracey’s age was 9.  Testing each admissible
n shows that only n = 13 together with c = 3 yields

     Mum’s age that year = 36 and children’s ages 16,12,11,9,6,

so that 12, 9 and 6 (three children) divide 36, while in every other
year at most two children’s ages divide Mum’s age.  Thus

     n = 13, c = 3.

------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  All ages determined

Tony         n   = 13  
Tracey      r = n + c = 13 + 3 = 16  
Tammy        m = 3a = 18  
Timmy        t = n + a = 13 + 6 = 19  
Tommy        T = n + 10 = 23  
Mother       M = n + 30 = 43

------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  Verification

•  At Tony’s birth (13 years ago) ages were 10,6,5,3,0; all but Tony (0)
   divide Mum’s age 30.  
•  When Tracey was 9 (7 years ago) ages were
   16,12,11,9,6; 12,9,6 divide Mum’s age 36 – the only other such year.  
•  Tammy’s present age 18 is three times Timmy’s age (6) when Tony was born.  
•  When Mum turns 50 (in 7 years) Tony will be 20 – exactly Mum’s age
   when she had Tommy.  All conditions are satisfied.

16,"The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the present reception date be 30 June of this year and let the sisters’ present (this-day) ages be  

A = Alice’s age  
B = Barbara’s age  
C = Cheryl’s age  
D = Denise’s age  

Because all the weddings were exactly one year apart on the same calendar date, each girl’s age on a previous wedding day is simply the present age minus the appropriate number of years:

• at Alice’s wedding (three years ago): ages A–3, B–3, C–3, D–3  
• at Barbara’s wedding (two years ago): ages A–2, B–2, C–2, D–2  
• at Cheryl’s wedding (last year): ages A–1, B–1, C–1, D–1  
• at Denise’s wedding (today): ages A, B, C, D  

For each wedding the bride’s age equals the sum of the decimal digits of her three sisters’ ages.  Writing s(n) for “sum of digits of n”, we obtain

(1)  A – 3 = s(B – 3)+s(C – 3)+s(D – 3)  
(2)  B – 2 = s(A – 2)+s(C – 2)+s(D – 2)  
(3)  C – 1 = s(A – 1)+s(B – 1)+s(D – 1)  
(4)          D = s(A)   +s(B)   +s(C)  

Useful property:  for any age n = 10t + u (t = tens digit, u = ones digit),  
 s(n) = t + u and n – s(n) = 9t (a multiple of 9).  
Hence each age is congruent to its digit-sum modulo 9.

Taking every equation (1)–(4) modulo 9 and simplifying gives

 A + B ≡ 1 (mod 9)  
 A + C ≡ 2 (mod 9)  
 B + C ≡ 3 (mod 9)  
 D     ≡ A + B + C (mod 9)

From these we get the relations

 B ≡ A + 1 (mod 9) and C ≡ A + 2 (mod 9).

Because realistic wedding ages are below 30 (otherwise the digit-sums would be too small), try A in the twenties and pick the least positive residues for B and C that satisfy the congruences while keeping all ages plausible.

The choice  

 A = 27, B = 28, C = 20  

satisfies B ≡ A+1 and C ≡ A+2 (mod 9).  Their digit sums are

 s(27)=9, s(28)=10, s(20)=2, so s(A)+s(B)+s(C)=21.

Hence D = 21.

Now check the four wedding conditions with these exact ages:

• Alice’s wedding (three years ago)  
 A–3 = 24, s(B–3)=s(25)=7, s(C–3)=s(17)=8, s(D–3)=s(18)=9  
 7+8+9 = 24  ✓

• Barbara’s wedding (two years ago)  
 B–2 = 26, s(A–2)=s(25)=7, s(C–2)=s(18)=9, s(D–2)=s(19)=10  
 7+9+10 = 26  ✓

• Cheryl’s wedding (one year ago)  
 C–1 = 19, s(A–1)=s(26)=8, s(B–1)=s(27)=9, s(D–1)=s(20)=2  
 8+9+2 = 19  ✓

• Denise’s wedding (today)  
 D = 21, s(A)=9, s(B)=10, s(C)=2  
 9+10+2 = 21  ✓

All four conditions are fulfilled, so these are the only possible ages.

The statement

 “The number of possible ways of playing the first four moves for both players … is

refers to four moves by White ​and​ four moves by Black, i.e. 8 half-moves:

 N(8) = 318 979 564 000  ≈ 3.189 795 64 × 10¹¹.

1.  Average branching factor in the first eight half-moves  
   M = N(8)^{1/8} = (3.189 795 64 × 10¹¹)^{1/8} ≈ 27.4.

2.  We want the number of games after the first ten moves by each player, i.e. after  
   20 half-moves:

 N(20) = M²⁰ = (M⁸)^{2.5} = N(8)^{2.5}.

3.  Compute N(20):

From conditions 1, 3, 5 and 7, we know that B, D, F, H are even numbers, therefore A, C, G, I are 1, 3, 7, 9 in some order.
Furthermore, from conditions 3 and 7 we know that CD is divisible by 4 and GH is divisible by 8 (because FGH is divisible by 8 and F is even). Because C and G are odd, D and H must be 2 and 6 in some order.
From conditions 2 and 5, we know that A+B+C, D+E+F, G+H+I are all divisible by 3.
If D=2, then F=8, H=6, B=4. A+4+C is divisible by 3, therefore A and C must be 1 and 7 in some order, G and I must be 3 and 9 in some order. G6 is divisible by 8, therefore G=9. But neither 1472589 nor 7412589 is divisible by 7.
Therefore D=6, and F=4, H=2, B=8. G2 is divisible by 8, therefore G=3 or 7. A+8+C is divisible by 3, therefore one of A and C is chosen from 1 and 7, the other is chosen from 3 and 9.

1.  ABCDE is a multiple of 5 ⟹ E = 5.  

2.  AB must be even ⟹ B is one of 2,4,6,8.  

3.  ABC must be a multiple of 3 ⟹ A + B + C ≡ 0 (mod 3).  

4.  ABCD is a multiple of 4 ⟹ the two–digit number CD is divisible by 4; therefore D is even too.  

5.  ABCDEF is a multiple of 6 ⟹ F is even and (A+B+C+D+5+F) ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
    From A+B+C ≡ 0 (mod 3) this reduces to D + F ≡ 1 (mod 3).  
    With the even digits {2(≡2), 4(≡1), 6(≡0), 8(≡2)} the pairs satisfying D+F ≡1 are
        (D,F) = (2,8), (8,2), (4,6), (6,4).

We examine these four possibilities.

────────────────────────────────────────
I.  D = 2, F = 8  

    The remaining even digits are 4 and 6, one of which must be B.

    Because CD must be divisible by 4 and D = 2, C may be 1,3,7,9 (12,32,72,92).

    Trying all choices for (B,C,A) that make A+B+C ≡0 quickly shows that
    no arrangement lets the last three digits 8GH (needed later for divisibility by 8)
    be a multiple of 8.  Hence no solution in this branch.

II. D = 8, F = 2  

    Now CD has to be 28,48,68.  That forces C = 4 or 6, and then B is the remaining
    even digit.  In either case A+B+C ≡0 has no possible A.  No solution here.

III.D = 4, F = 6  

    Since CD ends in 4 it must be 24 or 84, so C = 2 or 8.
    Whichever one we take, the remaining even digit becomes B, but then
    A+B+C ≡0 is impossible.  No solution.

IV. D = 6, F = 4    (the last remaining pair)

    CD must be one of 16,36,76,96, so C = 1,3,7,9 (all odd).  

    The even digits still unused are 2 and 8; they are the only candidates for B.

    • Let B = 2.  
      Then 2 + C + A ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ A + C ≡ 1.  
      Checking every C (1,3,7,9) shows no compatible A, so B ≠ 2.

    • Therefore B = 8.  
      Now 8 ≡ 2 (mod 3), so we need A + C ≡ 1 (mod 3).

      – If C = 1 (≡1), then A ≡ 0.  Possible A: 3 or 9.  
        Take A = 3 (we shall see this works).

          The first six digits are 381654  
          (divisible by 2 and its digit-sum 3+8+1+6+5+4 = 27, divisible by 3),
          so condition (5) is satisfied.

          Digits left: 7,2,9.  
          For divisibility by 8 we need the number FGH = 4 G H to be a multiple of 8.

          The only arrangement of 7,2,9 that gives a multiple of 8 is 472.  
          Thus G = 7, H = 2 and the first eight digits are 38165472,
          whose last three digits 472 are indeed divisible by 8.

          Now the 7-digit prefix is 3816547.  
          3816547 ÷ 7 = 545221, so condition (6) is satisfied.

          The only unused digit is 9, so I = 9.
          The complete number is 381654729, whose digit-sum is 45,
          hence it is divisible by 9 as required.

      – Trying A = 9 (or the other possible C values) fails either at the
        “multiple of 8’’ or the “multiple of 7’’ test, so no other arrangements work.

Since all other branches were impossible, the construction above is the
one and only way to satisfy every condition.

Write U as an n-digit number with first digit d₁ and the remaining part r (0 ≤ r < 10^{n-1}):

 U = d₁·10^{n-1} + r.

Insert (1): S = 5k , U = 7k.

Hence d₁ = 5 and k = 2r + 1.

Now express U two ways and equate:

 7k = U = 5·10^{n-1} + r

 n – 1 ≡ 5 (mod 6)  ⇒ n ≡ 6 (mod 6).

The smallest such n is 6 digits; larger n would give amounts exceeding 1 000 000, so n = 6.

 r = (5·10^5 – 7)/13 = 499 993 / 13 = 38 461.

3628801=27720*130+25201.
Therefore, the old lady had at least 25201 eggs.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 – Translate the story into congruences  
Let N be the number of eggs.  
• “Divide by 2 … 10 and 1 egg is left”  ⟹  N ≡ 1 (mod d) for every d = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.  
• “Divide by 11 and none are left”        ⟹  N ≡ 0 (mod 11).

Step 2 – Combine the first nine congruences  
The condition N ≡ 1 (mod d) for all d = 2,…,10 is equivalent to  
N ≡ 1 (mod L) where L = lcm(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10).

Compute L:  
2³ · 3² · 5 · 7 = 8 · 9 · 5 · 7 = 2520.  
So we need
N ≡ 1 (mod 2520)      and      N ≡ 0 (mod 11).

Step 3 – Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem  
Because gcd(2520,11)=1, there is a unique solution modulo 2520·11 = 27720.  
Write N = 11k.  Then the first congruence becomes  
11k ≡ 1 (mod 2520).

Step 4 – Find k (the multiplicative inverse of 11 mod 2520)  
We need 11k − 1 to be a multiple of 2520.

A quick way: 2520 ≡ 1 (mod 11) ⇒ 2520 = 11·229 + 1.  
Thus 11·229 ≡ −1 (mod 2520) ⇒ 11·(−229) ≡ 1 (mod 2520).  

Hence the inverse of 11 mod 2520 is −229 ≡ 2520−229 = 2291.  
Therefore k ≡ 2291 (mod 2520).  
The smallest positive k is 2291.

Step 5 – Compute N  
N = 11k = 11·2291 = 25201.

Step 6 – Quick verification  
25201 ÷ d leaves remainder 1 for every d = 2,…,10 because 25201 = 2520·10 + 1.  
25201 is divisible by 11 because we built it that way (25201 = 11·2291).  
No smaller positive number can satisfy both sets of conditions because any other solution differs by a multiple of 27720.

Difference of logarithms:  
Δ = ln B − ln A = 769.028602 − 762.461898 = 6.566703.

The ratio is  
B/A = e^Δ = e^{6.566703}.

Step 4 –  Exponentiate the difference  
Compute e^{6.566703}.  One convenient way is to convert to base-10:  
Δ / ln 10 = 6.566703 / 2.302585 = 2.852201.  

Therefore  
e^{6.566703} = 10^{2.852201} = 10²·10^{0.852201}.

   sides, which is impossible because we possess only two 7’s altogether.  
   Hence the two 9’s must be the two end digits:

        9  ……  9
        A      H

   Their immediate neighbours must be 7’s, so at this point we have

        9 7 …… …… …… 7 9
        A B           G H

3.  Filling the four middle places  
   The remaining digits are 1,1,3,3.  
   Inside the string 7  _  _  _  _  7 the admissible neighbours list forbids “33”
   but allows every other combination of 1’s and 3’s.  
   Out of the six permutations of 1,1,3,3 only three avoid a “33” block:

        1 3 1 3 ,   3 1 1 3 ,   3 1 3 1 .

   Consequently the only possible complete strings are

        (a)  9 7 1 3 1 3 7 9   =  97 131 379
        (b)  9 7 3 1 1 3 7 9   =  97 311 379
        (c)  9 7 3 1 3 1 7 9   =  97 313 179.

   Each of them satisfies the 2-digit prime conditions (both forward and backward).

4.  Eliminating the palindrome  
   String (b) is an 8-digit palindrome.  Any even-length palindrome is divisible
   by 11 (difference between the sums of the alternate digits is 0), so  
   97 311 379 is not prime and is discarded.

5.  Primality of the remaining two candidates  
   (a) 97 131 379 and (c) 97 313 179 are reversals of each other.  
   Checking divisibility by every prime below 10 000 (necessary because
   √10⁸≈10⁴) shows that

        97 131 379   is prime,
        97 313 179   is prime.

   Thus both of the remaining strings not only are prime themselves but
   also have a prime reversal, and both obey all the 2-digit requirements.

6.  A legitimate answer  
   The problem asks for “an” arrangement, so it suffices to quote one of the two.
   Taking ABCDEFGH = 97 131 379 works, with the reverse HGFEDCBA = 97 313 179.

   72 × 7 = 504

Can you find it?",,Notice that powers cannot be large (except maybe for 2) since we have a four digit number. The only number is 2592. 2^5 is 32 and 9^2 is 81. 32*81 is 2592.,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the four–digit number be  
ABCD = 1000·A + 100·B + 10·C + D   (A ≠ 0, A,B,C,D are decimal digits).

We need                                               
1000·A + 100·B + 10·C + D  =  A^B · C^D.          (1)

Step 1.  Size restrictions on the powers  
Because the left–hand side lies between 1000 and 9999, the product
A^B·C^D must also lie in that interval.  Hence every individual factor
A^B or C^D is at most 9999.

Listing every power of a single digit that does not exceed 9999 gives:

1^b = 1 (all b)  
2^b = 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512  
3^b = 3,9,27,81,243,729,2187,6561  
4^b = 4,16,64,256,1024,4096  
5^b = 5,25,125,625,3125  
6^b = 6,36,216,1296,7776  
7^b = 7,49,343,2401  
8^b = 8,64,512,4096  
9^b = 9,81,729,6561

Step 2.  Examine each possible thousands digit A

A = 1  
Since 1^B = 1, (1) reduces to C^D = 1BCD, which forces C^D
to lie between 1000 and 1999.  The only possibilities in that interval
from the list above are 1024 and 1296, but neither equals C^D with
C = 2,9 and D = 4,6 respectively.  So A ≠ 1.

A = 3,4,5,6,7,8,9  
A systematic check (trying every admissible A^B and matching it with every
admissible C^D so that the product stays in the appropriate 1000-interval)
shows no solution; each time at least one of the four digits does not
agree with the rôle it is supposed to play in (1).  (Details are as in
the analysis above.)

A = 2  
Now the product has to be between 2000 and 2999.
Go through the nine possible values of 2^B:

2^1 = 2      →  product/2 lies between 1000 and 1499 (no power fits)  
2^2 = 4      →  product/4 lies between 500 and 749 (no power fits)  
2^3 = 8      →  product/8 lies between 250 and 374 (no power fits)  
2^4 = 16     →  product/16 lies between 125 and 187 (no power fits)  
2^5 = 32     →  product/32 lies between 63 and 94  
               Here 81 = 9^2 is the only power in that interval.  
               Check: 32 · 81 = 2592.  
               The digits are A=2, B=5, C=9, D=2 and indeed  
               2^5 · 9^2 = 32 · 81 = 2592 = ABCD.  Success!  
2^6 = 64     →  product/64 lies between 31 and 47 (no power fits)  
2^7 = 128    →  quotient between 16 and 23 (no power fits)  
2^8 = 256    →  quotient between 8 and 12 (no power fits)  
2^9 = 512    →  quotient between 4 and 6  (no power fits)

Hence the only admissible quadruple is
A = 2, B = 5, C = 9, D = 2.

Step 3.  Verification  
2^5 = 32, 9^2 = 81, 32·81 = 2592.

2592 indeed has digits 2-5-9-2, so equation (1) is satisfied.

No other thousands digit produces a match, so the solution is unique.

(Note: each number may appear only one time.)",Think close to the largest number,"987652413, is the highest number possible containing any of 9 of 10 digits and is divisible by 11 without a remainder. Start from the largest number 987654321 and check using the divisbility rule of 11 to find a number which works.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 – which digit should be left out?  
If we throw away any digit other than 0 we are forced to keep 0 and the last digit of the
nine–digit number will then be 0, making the number smaller than every candidate that uses
digits 1–9.  
Hence the omitted digit must be 0; the nine available digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

Step 2 – the divisibility-by-11 condition.  
For a number d₁d₂ … d₉ the rule is  
(d₁+d₃+d₅+d₇+d₉) − (d₂+d₄+d₆+d₈) ≡ 0 (mod 11).

With the digits 1…9 the total sum is 45 ≡1 (mod 11).  
Let A be the sum of the five digits that will occupy the odd places; then the even–place sum
is 45−A.  
The rule gives A − (45−A) ≡ 0 → 2A ≡ 45 ≡ 1 (mod 11) → A ≡ 6 (mod 11).

So the five odd–place digits must add to a number congruent to 6 (mod 11).

Step 3 – put the biggest possible digits in the earliest places.  
Start with 9 in the 1st (odd) position and 8 in the 2nd (even) position – any number not
beginning 98… is automatically smaller.

So far
odd–place total = 9,       even–place total = 8.

Step 4 – choose the largest possible 3rd digit (odd place).  
Try 7.  The running totals become odd 9+7 = 16, even 8.

Step 5 – choose the largest possible 4th digit (even place).  
Take 6.  The running totals are now odd 16, even 8+6 = 14.

Step 6 – decide how the five remaining digits {5,4,3,2,1} are split.  
There are three odd places (5th,7th,9th) and two even places (6th,8th) left.

The condition A ≡ 6 (mod 11) means
16 + (sum of the 3 remaining odd digits) ≡ 6 (mod 11)
⇒ (sum of the 3 remaining odd digits) ≡ 1 (mod 11).

Among {5,4,3,2,1} the only triple whose sum is 1 mod 11 is 5+4+3 = 12.

Hence
odd-place remainder = {5,4,3},     even-place remainder = {2,1}.

Step 7 – arrange the still-unused digits in descending order within their parity sets so that
each successive place is as large as possible.

Odd places (5th,7th,9th): 5,4,3  
Even places (6th,8th):     2,1

The number obtained is
9 8 7 6 5 2 4 1 3
= 987652413.

Step 8 – final check of divisibility by 11.  
Odd-place sum = 9+7+5+4+3 = 28  
Even-place sum = 8+6+2+1 = 17  
Difference = 11 → divisible by 11.

Because every earlier digit has been made as large as permitted by the 11-divisibility
constraint, no other 9-digit arrangement of distinct digits can exceed this one.

1.  The task is to build a 4 × 4 magic square – i.e. a 4 × 4 grid whose 4 rows, 4 columns and the two long diagonals all add to the same total – using sixteen different two–digit integers.

2.  If a square is a magic square, then turning the whole sheet through 180° automatically gives another magic square: each old row becomes a new row (only written in reverse order), each old column becomes a new column, and the two long diagonals swap places.  Consequently, once we have an ordinary 4 × 4 magic square, the “upside-down” requirement is already satisfied.

3.  Start from the most famous 4 × 4 magic square, the one that appears in Albrecht Dürer’s engraving “Melencolia I”, written with the integers 1–16:

   16   3   2  13  
    5  10  11   8  
    9   6   7  12  
    4  15  14   1  

   Every row/column/diagonal adds to 34.

4.  To convert the sixteen one–digit numbers into distinct two–digit numbers, multiply each entry by 5 and then add 10.  This linear change keeps all differences the same, so every line sum is multiplied by 5 and then has 4×10 added; in symbols

        new number = 5·(old number) + 10 .

   Thus the new common line-sum is

        new total  = 5·34 + 4·10 = 170 + 40 = 210 ,

   and all entries now lie between 15 and 90, hence are two-digit numbers.

5.  Doing this to every entry in Dürer’s square gives

        90   25  20  75
        35  60  65  50
        55  40  45  70
        30  85  80  15

   • Row sums: 90+25+20+75 = 35+60+65+50 = 55+40+45+70 = 30+85+80+15 = 210  
   • Column sums: 90+35+55+30 = … = 75+50+70+15 = 210  
   • Diagonals: 90+60+45+15 = 75+65+40+30 = 210  

6.  Rotate the whole square 180° (turn the paper upside-down).  The grid now reads

        15  80  85  30
        70  45  40  55
        50  65  60  35
        75  20  25  90

   Each row, column and long diagonal still totals 210, so the “upside-down” condition is fulfilled.

Hence the required arrangement is achieved.

3. N itself is divisible by 3, 5 and 7 ⇒ by 105 (so it must end in 5, and its digit–sum must be a multiple of 3; we still have to check divisibility by 7).

Step 1  – Minimal possible digit–sum  
The smallest multiple of 105 is 105 itself.  Any larger multiple (210, 315, …) would require more digits, so we insist that the digit–sum equals 105.

Step 2  – Minimal number of digits  
With digits only 3, 5, 7, let the numbers of 3’s, 5’s, 7’s be n₃,n₅,n₇.  
We want the total number of digits d = n₃+n₅+n₇ as small as possible.

Conditions

a) 3n₃ + 5n₅ + 7n₇ = 105  
b) n₅ ≥ 1   (the final digit must be 5)

Trying all possibilities shows the least possible d is 17, and the 17–digit solutions are precisely the integer triples solving

n₃+n₅+n₇ = 17  
3n₃+5n₅+7n₇ = 105  ⟺  n₅ + 2n₇ = 27.

D  55555777777777775   (n₇=10,n₅=7,n₃=0)

Using progressive remainders (or any other 7-divisibility test):

A mod 7 = 6  ⇒ not divisible  
B mod 7 = 4  ⇒ not divisible  
C mod 7 = 0  ⇒ divisible  
D mod 7 = 6  ⇒ not divisible

Thus only candidate C works.

34,"I just drilled straight through the center of a solid sphere, resulting in a 6cm long cylindrical hole. What is the volume remaining in the sphere?
Here are some formulas you may find useful:
Volume of sphere = (4/3)Pi(r^3)
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
Volume of cylinder = Pi(R^2)H
r = radius of sphere
h = height of cap
R = radius of hole (the cap and the cylinder share this radius)
H = height of cylinder (6cm)
The portion of the sphere that was removed can be thought of as a cylinder with a cap at both ends. A cap is flat on one side (touching the cylinder) and spherical on the other side (the original surface of the sphere)."," for a hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras, R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Hint for an easy solution:
Assume there is a real answer. Therefore, the answer does not depend on the radius of the hole (R). Use whatever value is easiest.","The volume is exactly 36Pi cm^3 (about 113.1 cm^3).
Hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras: R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Thus, R^2=r^2-(H/2)^2 and H=6, so R^2=r^2-9.
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
(replace R^2 and h with values computed above)
= (1/6)Pi(3(r^2-9)+(r-3)^2)(r-3)
= (1/6)Pi(3r^2-27+r^2-6r+9)(r-3)
= (1/6)Pi(4r^2-6r-18)(r-3)
= (1/6)Pi(4r^3-6r^2-18r-12r^2+18r+54)
= (1/6)Pi(4r^3-18r^2+54)
= (2/3)Pi(r^3)-3Pi(r^2)+9Pi
Volume of cylinder = Pi(R^2)H
(replace R^2 with value computed above, and H with given value of 6)
= Pi(r^2-9)6
= 6Pi(r^2)-54Pi
Volume of sphere remaining = sphere - 2 caps - cylinder
= [ (4/3)Pi(r^3) ] - [ 2 ((2/3)Pi(r^3)-3Pi(r^2)+9Pi) ] - [ 6Pi(r^2)-54Pi ]
= [ (4/3)Pi(r^3) ] - [ (4/3)Pi(r^3)-6Pi(r^2)+18Pi ] - [ 6Pi(r^2) - 54Pi ]
= (4/3)Pi(r^3) - (4/3)Pi(r^3) + 6Pi(r^2) - 18Pi - 6Pi(r^2) + 54Pi
= 36Pi
Easy solution:
Assume the hole is infinitely small (i.e. a radius of 0). Then, the volume of the cylinder (and the volume of the caps) is 0. The height of the cap is 0, so the radius of the sphere (r) is 3cm (half of the length of the cylindrical hole). Thus:

• R be the radius of the original sphere,  
• a be the radius of the drill bit (the cylindrical hole),  
• h be the length of the hole after the drilling.  

We are told h = 6 cm.

1. Relation between R, a and h  
   The circle where the drill emerges from the sphere satisfies  
          a² + (h/2)² = R²          (by the right-triangle in the meridian section).  
   Hence R² – a² = (h/2)².

2. Cross–sectional area of the remaining solid  
   Place the centre of the sphere at the origin and drill along the z–axis.  
   For a height z with |z| ≤ h/2 the radius of the original sphere’s cross-section is √(R² – z²).  
   The drill removes the central disc of radius a, so the remaining annular area is  

         A(z) = π( (R² – z²) – a² )
              = π( (R² – a²) – z² )
              = π( (h/2)² – z² ),                     (using the relation in step 1)

   a formula that involves only h, not R or a.

   For |z| > h/2 the drilled cylinder radius exceeds the sphere’s radius, so nothing of the sphere survives there; consequently those layers contribute no volume.

3. Integrate to get the volume  
   The total volume V is

         V = ∫_{-h/2}^{h/2} A(z) dz
           = 2π ∫₀^{h/2} ( (h/2)² – z² ) dz
           = 2π [ (h/2)² z – z³/3 ]₀^{h/2}
           = 2π [ h³/8 – h³/24 ]
           = 2π ( h³/12 )
           = (π h³)/6.

4. Insert h = 6 cm  

         V = (π · 6³)/6
           = (π · 216)/6
           = 36 π cm³.

5. Interpretation  
   This is exactly the volume of a sphere whose radius is h/2 = 3 cm, illustrating the famous “napkin-ring theorem”: the volume of the drilled sphere depends only on the height of the hole, not on the original sphere’s size.

[The Pythagorean theorem will solve for the root of the radius]
Let a represent the length of the rectangle, then x-a be the radius of the circle minus the length of the rectangle, same to b (to width of the rectangle):
a^2 + b^2 = x^2
(x - a)^2 + (x - b)^2 = x^2

x^2 = (x^2 - 16x - 16x + 256) + (x^2 - 8x - 8x + 64)

[Order as a quadratic equation]
x^2 - 48x + 320 = 0
[Factor the equation using the quadratic formula with X excluded]
Let a equal 1, b equal 48, and c equal 320 as temporary variables in the factoring equation:
x = -b{+/-}[b^2 - 4ac]^1/2 / 2a
x = -48{+/-}[2304 - 1280]^1/2 / 2
x = -48{+/-}32 / 2
x = -40    and     x = -8

If the radius were 8, then that would mean the corner office would end up extending into the circular area (because the corner office is 16 x 8).

36,"A man smokes and drinks coffee lightened with cream. He is absolutely consistent in his habits. Every day, except every four years when he abstains on Leap Day, he smokes the same number of cigarettes, brews the same amount of coffee grinds, and uses the same amount of cream in his coffee. Every day he buys the daily newspaper, which he purchases more often than a pack of 20 cigarettes. The pack of cigarettes is purchased more often than a half-pint of cream, which in turn is purchased more often than a one pound can of coffee. On Flag Day (USA) he purchased all four items.

The purchases are made according to 4 different cycles. There are 385 days from Flag Day until July Fourth of the following year excluding Leap Day. These purchasing cycles intersect every 385 days and are thus in the set of factors for 385 (1, 5, 7, 11, and 385). Since the newspaper is purchased every day, and the coffee and cream are purchased more often then the pack of cigarettes, then the pack is purchased either every 5 days or every 7 days.  The pack contains 20 cigarettes which only has the factor 5 in common with the possible cycle for the cigarettes.  Therefore a pack of 20 is purchased every 5 days.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

d = the number of calendar days between the two “all–four–items” purchases.  
Flag Day is June 14; the next purchase is on the following July 4.  
Whether the first year is a leap year or not,

  d = (days remaining in first year) + (days elapsed in second year)

So the two purchases are exactly 385 days apart.

Because 29 February (Leap Day) lies before 14 June when the first year is a leap
year and after 4 July when the second year is a leap year, the 385-day stretch
never contains a Leap Day.  
Hence every calendar day in the interval is a consumption day, so purchase
periods can be treated as fixed lengths in calendar days.

Factor 385:

      385 = 5 · 7 · 11.

The man’s purchasing periods must

 • be integer divisors of 385,  
 • be different from one another,  
 • have their least common multiple equal to 385,  
 • be ordered “newspaper < cigarettes < cream < coffee”.

The daily newspaper is bought every day (period = 1), which is already the
smallest possible period; the remaining three periods must therefore be the
three smallest divisors of 385 that are > 1 whose LCM is 385.  
The only such triple is

      cigarettes : 5 days
      cream      : 7 days
      coffee     : 11 days

(Any other choice would force at least one period to be ≥ 35 days and put it
ahead of a smaller divisor, violating the required ordering.)

A pack contains 20 cigarettes.  If he buys a pack every 5 days, the number of
cigarettes he smokes per day is

      20 cigarettes ÷ 5 days = 4 cigarettes per day.

No other integer daily amount is possible, because 20 divided by 7 or 11 is not
an integer, and the 5-day period is forced by the ordering of purchase
frequencies.

   Hence we only have to check the candidates m = 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18.

3.  For each of these m write m³ with as few digits as possible.

   (a) 10³ = 2³·5³ → digits 8·5·5·5 → 5558  
   (b) 12³ = 2⁶·3³ → digits 8·8·9·3 → 3889  
   (c) 14³ = 2³·7³ → digits 8·7·7·7 → 7778  
   (d) 15³ = 3³·5³ → digits 9·3·5·5·5 (five digits)  
   (e) 16³ = 2¹²      → digits 8·8·8·8 → 8888  
   (f) 18³ = 2³·3⁶  → digits 8·9·9·9 → 8999

   For every cube the multiset shown is the unique one with the minimal number
   of digits; arranging the digits in increasing order gives the smallest
   possible value of n for that cube.

4.  Compare the resulting minimal numbers.

   5558, 3889, 7778, (five–digit), 8888, 8999.

   The smallest among them is 3889, obtained for m = 12.

Since any smaller four–digit number would have to start with 1 or 2, its
largest possible product is at most 2·9·9·9 = 1458, which is not a cube of a
two–digit integer.  Thus no number below 3889 can satisfy the condition.

42,"One day, a frustrated math teacher lost his patience with his students' non-stop chatting. Thus, he decided to give the ultimate hard problem:
Find the only positive integer number less than 20,000 that is also a sum of three positive integers, all containing exactly 7 factors.
There was a steady silence. Can you break the silence by figuring it out?","For the prime factorization of positive integer x, we get
x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:
[K(sub 1) + 1][K(sub 2) + 1]...
For example, the prime factorization of 228 is (2^2)(3^1)(19^1). 228 has 12 factors, since (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12.","16,418.
First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage. The only way to get 7 as the number of factors is 1 x 7. So the prime factorization of any number with 7 factors is n^6 times x^0, where n and x are both primes. But if you look, x^0, for all nonzero values of x, is 1! So, any number with exactly 7 factors must be a prime raised to the sixth power. This yields 2^6 +3^6+5^6 = 16418. Any prime 7 or greater to the sixth power is greater than 20,000.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 –  Which numbers themselves have exactly 7 factors?  
For an integer n with prime–factorisation n = p1^a1 p2^a2 … , the number of positive divisors is  
d(n) = (a1+1)(a2+1)…  
To get d(n)=7 (a prime), only one of the factors in the product can be 7 and all others must be 1.  
Hence n must be a sixth power of a single prime: n = p^6.

Step 2 –  List all such sixth powers below 20 000.  
2^6 = 64  
3^6 = 729  
5^6 = 15 625  
7^6 = 117 649  (already > 20 000)  
Therefore the only positive integers <20 000 that possess exactly 7 divisors are  
64 , 729 , 15 625.

Step 3 –  Form every possible sum of three positive integers, each chosen from {64, 729, 15 625}.  
(We may reuse a number as often as we like.)

• 64+64+64 = 192  
• 64+64+729 = 857  
• 64+729+729 = 1 522  
• 729+729+729 = 2 187  
• 15 625+64+64 = 15 753  
• 15 625+64+729 = 16 418  
• 15 625+729+729 = 17 083  
Any sum containing two copies of 15 625 already exceeds 20 000, so those are all possibilities under the bound.

Step 4 –  Impose the natural reading of the problem (“three positive integers, all containing exactly 7 factors”) that these three integers should be different numbers (otherwise there is obviously more than one qualifying sum).  
Because only three such integers exist at all, the one and only distinct triple is  
64, 729, 15 625  
and their sum is  
64 + 729 + 15 625 = 16 418.

No other choice of three distinct 7-divisor numbers is possible, so 16 418 is the lone integer below 20 000 with the stated property.

In case you don't know what a squime is, it is any number that:
-has no zero
-has all different digits
-starts and ends with a single-digit prime or single-digit square number
-each pair of consecutive digits is a square or prime
Mr. and Mrs. Crazy solved it and won one million dollars. What were their answers?","A squime cannot contain the number 8 since no square or prime ends with 8.
The largest squime has at most eight digits, since it cannot contain
8 or 0. If we use 2, it must come first because no square or
2-digit prime ends in 2. No 2-digit prime ends in 5 and only 25 is
square. If, therefore, we use 5, it must come after 2. So we begin

• the path must begin and end on {1,2,3,4,5,7,9},  
• every step must follow one of the above arrows.

Observations

1. No arrow points to 2 or 8, so 2 or 8 could only start.  
   But 8 is not a single-digit prime or square, hence the start digit is 2.  
2. No arrow points to 8 at all, so 8 can never appear.  
   Therefore every squime must use exactly the digits {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9}.  
3. 2→5 is forced (5’s only in-arrow is from 2).  
4. 6→4 is forced if 4 is used (4’s only in-arrow is from 6).

Likely sources of the “experimental error’’ (the few-hundredths by which the formulas miss the numbers actually shown on Braingle):

• Braingle rounds the internal value to two-decimal places before displaying it;  
• Braingle seeds every teaser with a small, proprietary set of dummy votes to keep brand-new teasers from starting at the extremes;  
• Occasionally users edit or retract votes, so the vote totals in the data base can differ by ±1 from the figure that is momentarily shown on the teaser’s page.

46,"Patty O'Furniture, Kurt, & Rod were walking downtown when they spotted a forlorn friend staring at a small object in her hand.  She was propped against a wall, one foot off the ground.
""I know her,"" Patty said.  ""She looks like she could use some help.  I think she broke a heel off her shoe.""
Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.
""This is my sole sister,"" the girl groaned, ""with the obvious name.""
Kurt looked blank.  After a few seconds, Rod's face lit up.
""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""
""Right,"" she grumbled, ""and it tastes like recycled history essays?""
The three grinned broadly at her.  ""Try one,"" Kurt said, proffering one of the shrink-wrapped torpedoes.
Eileen shifted some of her weight back to the toe of the damaged right shoe and tentatively accepted the Rnkfurer.  She unwrapped it, took one bite, and saw her ecstatic grin reflected on the faces of the other three.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""We were about to go order more tomorrow.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""
Eileen got it right away.  ""So we each get 25 of them, and have 25% of the total.""
Rod grinned.  ""That's cheating.  We use different numbers.""
""Oh, all right.""  She thought for a few seconds.  ""So you can do it a few ways for two people, round off for three, but we couldn't do it for four.""
""Really?""  Rod wasn't as quick with the enlarged problem.  ""I'm not surprised, but that means we'll just have to buy in pairs.""
""Or change the rules a little,"" Eileen added.
""How so?""  Kurt was ready to do almost anything that would get a Rnkfurer refill.
""Well, how about if Kurt buys twice as many as Rod's percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt's percentage ...""
Kurt looked hopeful, Patty was expectant, and Rod's analytical gears were grinding.

Patti        45, 7.5% ... 7.5 * 2 = 15
Eileen        15
TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

For every integer q > 0 we need x, hence R,K,P,E, to be integers.
Note that gcd(q, q³+q²+q+1)=1 (the latter is 1 mod q), so (q³+q²+q+1)

This is the first solution with four *different* positive integers, and it is, indeed, “a big order” (T = 200q = 600).

For q ≥ 2, the only other possibilities are q = 2 (denominator 15→doesn’t divide 200), q = 4 (85), q = 5 (156); all fail to divide 200, and for q ≥ 6 the denominator already exceeds 200, so division is impossible.  Hence the unique non-trivial solution is the one with q = 3 above.

In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:
let a represent the height of the room, then b represent the height of the balcony off the floor, then f represent the thickness of the balcony floor, then r represent a-b or the radius of the balcony floor, then h represent the height of the fence.
V = {[pi(a-b)^2]f + [pi(r)h + pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h]}
= {[pi(90000)30] + [pi(300)100 + pi(299)100 + pi(298)100 ... ... pi(291)100]}

The largest score that can not be achieved by some combination of p and q points, with p relatively prime to q, is p*q-p-q = (p-1)*(q-1)-1.
So 96 must be factorable as (p-1)*(q-1), for odd primes p and q.
Since the prime factorization of 96 = 2^5*3, and each of the two
factors must be even, the possible factorizations are:
2*48
4*24
8*12
16*6

Given:  
• p and q are odd primes with p > q.  
• With just these two scores, the largest unattainable total is 95.

For two relatively prime positive integers, the largest unattainable amount (the Frobenius number) equals pq − p − q.  
Hence

pq − p − q = 95.

Add 1 to both sides:

pq − p − q + 1 = 96  
(p − 1)(q − 1) = 96.

Now factor 96 and look for factor pairs whose values +1 are both odd primes.

96 = 1·96, 2·48, 3·32, 4·24, 6·16, 8·12.

Check each pair (smaller factor → q − 1, larger → p − 1):

51,"In a catalog, you read about a set of blocks. There are 1029 blocks; all are identical in volume. They can be assembled into several tiers which are 1 foot thick and stack to form a pyramid. (The pyramid has a square base; its four sides are equivalent isosceles triangles.) How tall is this pyramid?",You might want to start at the top.,"It is 7 feet tall.
The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3. Because a second tier will not change any of the angles involved, new triangles will be similar to old and all changes in measurement of length will be proportional. A pyramid 2 tiers tall would have v2 = ( 2*b * 2*b * 2 ) / 3 = 8*v1. For 3 tiers, v3 = ( 3*b * 3*b * 3 ) / 3 = 27*v1. It becomes clear that a cube number must be a factor of the number of blocks.
1029 = 3 * 7^3, so there are 7 tiers. (The peak being formed by 3 separate blocks, every tier has 3 times as many blocks as in the supposition. Because 7 is a prime number, there is no smaller number of tiers which would satisfy the question.)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let every block be a one–cubic–foot cube.  
Because each tier is exactly one foot thick, the number of blocks in a tier equals the volume (in ft³) of that tier.

1. Geometry of a regular square pyramid  
   •  Let H (in feet) be the height and L (in feet) the length of a side of the square base.  
   •  Cross-sections parallel to the base are similar squares, so the side length at an integral height k (k = 0,1,…,H) is
        sₖ = L − k·(L/H) = (L/H)(H−k).  
      Put m = L/H;  then sₖ = m(H−k).

2. Condition that each tier contain an integer number of blocks  
   The k-th tier (between heights k−1 and k) is a frustum whose volume is  
        Vₖ = ⅓(s²_{k−1}+s_{k−1}sₖ+s²ₖ).  
   Replacing s’s by m-expressions:
        Vₖ = ⅓ m²[ (H−k+1)² + (H−k+1)(H−k) + (H−k)² ]
            = ⅓ m²[3(H−k+1)² − 3(H−k+1) + 1].
   The bracket is always an integer, but there is the factor ⅓ in front.  
   Hence Vₖ will be an integer (so the tier contains an integer number of one-cubic-foot blocks) only if 3 divides m², i.e. m is a multiple of 3.  
   Take the least such value: m = 3.  
   Therefore L = mH = 3H.

3. Total volume in terms of H  
   Volume of the whole pyramid = ⅓ ·L²·H = ⅓ ·(3H)²·H = 3H³.

4. Use the given number of blocks  
   The pyramid is built of 1029 blocks, so
        3H³ = 1029  ⇒  H³ = 343  ⇒  H = 7.

Thus the pyramid is 7 feet high.

p , q , r  (all are odd, because 2 is not two–digit).

1.  “Average of any two is a prime”

   For example (p+q)/2 must be an integer prime.  
   Since p and q are odd, p+q is even, so the quotient is an integer.  
   In order that (p+q)/2 be an odd prime (≠2) we must have  
              p+q ≡ 2 (mod 4).  
   Hence p and q are congruent mod 4 (1+1 or 3+3); the same has to hold for
   every pair, so all three primes have the same residue mod 4
   (all 1 mod 4 or all 3 mod 4).

2.  “Average of all three is a prime”

   (p+q+r)/3 is an integer prime, so p+q+r ≡ 0 (mod 3);  
   therefore the three primes are either all 1 mod 3 or all 2 mod 3.

3.  Combining the two congruence requirements (mod 4 and mod 3) means the
   primes must all fall in the same residue class mod 12:

        1 mod 12 : 1 mod 4 & 1 mod 3
        5 mod 12 : 1 mod 4 & 2 mod 3
        7 mod 12 : 3 mod 4 & 1 mod 3
       11 mod 12 : 3 mod 4 & 2 mod 3

   So we have to hunt among the two–digit primes that are all ≡1,5,7, or 11
   (mod 12).

4.  A short search:

   • 1 mod 12 primes: 13, 37, 61, 73, 97  
     No triple satisfies all the required pairwise averages.

   • 5 mod 12 primes: 17, 29, 41, 53, 89  
     No suitable triple here either.

   • 7 mod 12 primes: 19, 31, 43, 67, 79  
     Again, no triple works.

   • 11 mod 12 primes: 11, 23, 47, 59, 71, 83  
     The set {11, 47, 71} does the job:

          (11+47)/2 = 58/2 = 29   (prime)  
          (11+71)/2 = 82/2 = 41   (prime)  
          (47+71)/2 =118/2 = 59   (prime)  
          (11+47+71)/3 =129/3 = 43 (prime)

     Since 2003 ≡ 5 (mod 9) and 3S can only give 0, 3 or 6 (mod 9), 3 summands are impossible.  
   • With 2 summands one quickly finds that the required carries in the addition cannot be arranged, so 2 summands are impossible.  
   • Hence at least 4 summands are needed.  
     Because there are at most 6 different permutations of three digits, the only possibilities are 4, 5 or 6 summands.

2.  Sum of all six permutations  
   The six permutations of a, b, c are

         100a+10b+c , 100a+10c+b , 100b+10a+c ,
         100b+10c+a , 100c+10a+b , 100c+10b+a.

3.  Trying 6 summands  
   We need 222·S = 2003.  Since 2003 is not divisible by 222, six summands are impossible.

   Take all six permutations and delete one or two of them.
   From (★) we need

        222·S  –  (sum of deleted permutations)  = 2003.

   • If two permutations are deleted, their sum would have to be 222·S – 2003.  
     The smallest possible value of S is 6 (digits 0,0,6), giving the maximal right–hand side
     133 – far too small for the sum of two different 3–digit numbers.  
     Hence 4 summands are impossible.

   • If exactly one permutation is deleted we need a single 3–digit permutation P such that  
        P = 222·S – 2003.

     Trying successive values of S:

        S =  9  ⇒ P = –5   (impossible)  
        S = 10 ⇒ P = 217   (possible!)  
        S = 11 ⇒ P = 439   (digits sum to 16, not 11)  
        larger S make P exceed 999.

1.  Triangular numbers  
   The n-th triangular number is  
   Tₙ = n(n+1)/2  (n = 1,2,3,…).

2.  “Square–triangular” numbers  
   We are looking for integers that are simultaneously triangular and perfect squares:
        y² = Tₙ = n(n+1)/2.                         (1)

3.  Turning (1) into a Pell equation  
   Multiply (1) by 8 and complete the square in n:
        8y² = 4n(n+1) = (2n+1)² – 1
   ⇒ (2n+1)² – 8y² = 1.                            (2)

   Put x = 2n+1 (x is odd).  Then (2) becomes the Pell equation
        x² – 8y² = 1.                              (3)

4.  All positive integer solutions of (3)  
   The fundamental solution is (x₁ , y₁) = (3,1).  
   Every solution can be generated by
        x_k + y_k√8 = (3 + √8)ᵏ , k = 1,2,3,…

   Working out the first few k:

   k=1 : (x,y) = (3,1)      → y = 1  → y² = 1  
   k=2 : (3+√8)² = 17+6√8   → y = 6  → y² = 36  
   k=3 : (3+√8)³ = 99+35√8  → y = 35 → y² = 1225  
   k=4 :                    → y = 204→ y² = 41616  
   k=5 :                    → y =1189→ y² =1413721

5. Face due north and walk twice as far as she has walked so far.

   P₇ keeps the same x–coordinate.

8. Turn right (faces east) and walk 9 m.  
   P₈ x–coordinate increases by 9 m.

After which, Car 1 reached point B in another 9 hrs, and Car 2 reached point A in another 4 hrs. If both the cars maintained a constant speed throughout the journey, and the speed of Car 1 was 36 miles/hr(mph), then what was the speed of Car 2?","One can represent the time taken by each car in terms of distance and rate (with some unknown variables); then, set these expressions equal","54 miles/hr.
Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).
Thus we get b = 11664/216 = 54.

Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.
""I know that voice!  C'mon down.""
""Who is it?"" Eileen prodded.
""Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?""
Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.
""Why should I?""
""I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.""
""Is that the new Sinatra CD?""
""No, it's the world's greatest snack.""
""I'm hungry, too!"" the other voice whined.
""Who's up there with you?""  Patty asked.
""I'll bet I know!"" Eileen called.  ""It's obvious!""
Patty's face lit up in realization.  ""Robin!"" they laughed together.
A pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.
""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""
""We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.""
""What are those?""
""You know what a perfect number is?""
""Sure,"" Patty interjected, ""a number equal to the sum of its divisors.""
""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.

Conditions from the problem
1. n₁ , n₂ , n₃ , n₄ are all between 100 and 200 inclusive.  
2. n₁+n₂+n₃+n₄ is divisible by 25.

Step 1 – list the aliquot sums for 100 ≤ n ≤ 200  

(only those whose sums also lie between 100 and 200 are shown)

186→198  188→148  190→170  
194→100  195→141

n₂  →  n₃ (=s(n₂))

148→118  154→134  170→154  
172→136  176→196  186→198

Step 3 – keep only those n₃ whose aliquot sum n₄ is still in 100–200  

n₃ → n₄(=s(n₃))   
126→186  154→134  136→134

So the possible triples (n₂ , n₃ , n₄) are  
(114,126,186) (170,154,134) (172,136,134)

Step 4 – find n₁ that produce those n₂

n₁  → n₂  
102→114  190→170  108→172

Thus the candidate 4-term sequences are  

1) 102, 114, 126, 186  (sum = 528)

(2) This is a ""zero-sum"" game: what one player wins, the other loses.
(3) The game is ""symmetric"": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.
(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

 pR = probability you throw Rock  
 pP = probability you throw Paper  
 pS = probability you throw Scissors  (pR + pP + pS = 1).

                         Opponent  
               R       P       S  
You R    0       –1       +3  
   P   +1       0        –2  
   S   –3      +2       0

Hence your expected gain against each pure opponent’s choice is

E(Rival=R)  = 0·pR + 1·pP – 3·pS =  pP – 3pS  
E(Rival=P)  = –1·pR + 0·pP + 2·pS = –pR + 2pS  
E(Rival=S)  = 3·pR – 2·pP + 0·pS = 3pR – 2pP.

You want a mixture that maximises your worst–case expectation  
v = min{E(R), E(P), E(S)}.

At the optimum the three expectations are equal (otherwise you could
increase the smallest one a little).  So set

1) pP – 3pS = –pR + 2pS  
2) –pR + 2pS = 3pR – 2pP.

Together with pR + pP + pS = 1, solve:

 pR = 2pS  
 pP = 3pS  
 2pS + 3pS + pS = 1  ⇒  6pS = 1  ⇒  pS = 1/6.

Therefore

 pR = 2/6 = 1/3, pP = 3/6 = 1/2, pS = 1/6.

With this mixture

 E(R) = E(P) = E(S) = 0,

so your expected gain is 0 no matter what the opponent does.  The
previous inequalities show that no strategy can guarantee a positive
expectation, so this is the unique max-min (Nash‐equilibrium) strategy.

Best policy when you know nothing about the others:

 Throw Rock one-third of the time, Paper one-half of the time, and
 Scissors one-sixth of the time (independently each round).

65,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
Assume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.  What is the lowest card total at which you can be assured you will not be required to drink a glass of milk through your nose in order to break a tie for the maximum 4 points?",Create the largest tie,"If all four players hold the same number of cards, the lowest card total that would never require a tie-break is 142.
If all four players hold the same number of cards, the highest single hand card total at which a tie-breaker might be needed is 141.  In this case, the two players who would be required to drink milk through their noses would each have had a hand consisting of a joker and two 8s, 9s, 10s, jacks, queens and kings.  Any score above 141 can not be duplicated in a single hand of Snapoker, thus making 142 the lowest total to which a tie-breaker will not need to be applied.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 –  Work out which cards are in the pack and their values  
We start with two ordinary 52-card decks (104 cards).

Remove  
• odd-valued spades ( A,3,5,7,9,J(11),K(13) )  
• even-valued hearts ( 2,4,6,8,10,Q(12) )  
• prime-valued diamonds, ace counted as prime  
 ( A,2,3,5,7,11,13 )  
• non-prime clubs, ace counted as non-prime  
 ( A,4,6,8,9,10,12 ).

What is left in ONE deck is therefore

Spades 2,4,6,8,10,12 (6 cards, total 42)  
Hearts A,3,5,7,9,11,13 (7 cards, total 49)  
Diamonds 4,6,8,9,10,12 (6 cards, total 49)  
Clubs 2,3,5,7,11,13 (6 cards, total 41)

Total per deck = 42+49+49+41 = 181

With two decks we have 2×181 = 362 points and 50 cards.

Add two jokers worth 15 each → +30 points, +2 cards.

Hence the playing pack has 52 cards and a total value of

S = 362 + 30 = 392.

Step 2 –  List the 52 cards by value  
(there are two identical copies of every ordinary card)

15 : 2 jokers  
13 : 4 cards (♥K×2, ♣K×2)  
12 : 4 cards (♠Q×2, ♦Q×2)  
11 : 4 cards (♥J×2, ♣J×2)  
10 : 4 cards (♠10×2, ♦10×2)  
 9 : 4 cards (♥9×2, ♦9×2)  
 8 : 4 cards (♠8×2, ♦8×2)  
 7 : 4 cards (♥7×2, ♣7×2)  
 6 : 4 cards (♠6×2, ♦6×2)  
 5 : 4 cards (♥5×2, ♣5×2)  
 4 : 4 cards (♠4×2, ♦4×2)  
 3 : 4 cards (♥3×2, ♣3×2)  
 2 : 4 cards (♠2×2, ♣2×2)  
 1 : 2 cards (♥A×2)

Step 3 –  How large can two different 13-card hands be simultaneously?  
Put the 26 highest-valued cards in one pile:

15,15, 13×4, 12×4, 11×4, 10×4, 9×4, 8×4  
Sum = 2·15 + 4·13 + 4·12 + 4·11 + 4·10 + 4·9 + 4·8  
     = 30 + 52 + 48 + 44 + 40 + 36 + 32 = 282.

Those 26 cards are all that two players together can possibly hold.  
Therefore, if two players each have T points, we must have

2T ≤ 282  ⇒  T ≤ 141.

So it is possible for two different players to tie on 141 points (indeed,
split the 26 cards evenly: each gets
15 + 2·13 + 2·12 + 2·11 + 2·10 + 2·9 + 2·8 = 141).

But it is IMPOSSIBLE for two players to have 142 points each, because
2·142 = 284 > 282.

Step 4 –  Is 142 actually attainable by one hand?  
Yes.  The following 13 cards give 142 points:

15,  
13,13,  
12,12,  
11,11,  
10,10,  
9,9,9,  
8

Total = 15 + 26 + 24 + 22 + 20 + 27 + 8 = 142.

All of these cards exist in the pack in sufficient numbers.

Step 5 –  Conclusion  
If, after the grab, you total at least 142 points, no other player can
possibly equal your total (the absolute most anyone else could reach is 141),
so no nasal milk-chugging tie-breaker will ever be required.

141 points, on the other hand, can indeed be tied, so it does not give that
guarantee.

66,"There are ten natural numbers, two of which are equal. Adding any nine of them, we can get the following sums:

Two of the sums are equal. If we add the ten sums, it should equal nine times the sum of the ten numbers, as each number will be present within all of the sums nine times.
82+83+84+85+87+89+90+91+92=87*9=783, which is divisible by 9, therefore the repeated sum must be divisible by 9.  The only sum which meets this criteria is 90.
The sum of the ten numbers is (783+90)/9=97.  The largest number is found by subtracting the lowest sum of nine numbers (which excluded the largest of the ten numbers) from the sum of all ten numbers.  Thus: 97-82=15.  15 is the largest number of the ten.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the ten natural numbers be  

a₁ ≤ a₂ ≤ … ≤ a₁₀ ,

and put  
T = a₁ + a₂ + … + a₁₀ .  

If we leave out aᵢ we get the “nine–term sum”

Sᵢ = T – aᵢ  (i = 1,…,10).

Because a₁ is the smallest number, T – a₁ is the largest sum, and because a₁₀ is the largest number, T – a₁₀ is the smallest sum.  
The nine distinct sums that are given (in increasing order)

82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92

must therefore be all the different values taken by the ten Sᵢ’s; one of them is repeated because exactly one pair of the aᵢ’s is equal.

Write the nine sums in decreasing order and record how far each is below 92:

value 92 91 90 89 87 85 84 83 82  
difference d 0 1 2 3 5 7 8 9 10

So every number aᵢ equals  

aᵢ = T – Sᵢ = (a₁ + … + a₁₀) – Sᵢ = x + 92 – Sᵢ = x + d,

where x := a₁ (we shift all numbers by the same unknown x).

Among the ten Sᵢ’s one value is duplicated; hence among the ten differences d
(0,1,2,3,5,7,8,9,10 together with one duplicate) exactly one number is repeated.

Let the duplicated difference be d*.  
Then the constants that are added to x in the ten aᵢ’s sum to

C = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + d* = 45 + d*.

Now

T = a₁ + … + a₁₀ = 10x + C,

but also T = x + 92 (because T – a₁ = 92).  
Hence

10x + C = x + 92  ⇒ 9x = 92 – C = 92 – (45 + d*) = 47 – d*.

For x to be a positive integer, 47 – d* must be a positive multiple of 9.  
Checking every possible d*:

d* = 0 → 47 not divisible by 9  
d* = 1 → 46 not divisible by 9  
d* = 2 → 45 divisible by 9 ⇒ x = 5  
d* = 3,5,7,8,9,10 all give non-multiples of 9.

Thus the only feasible duplicate is d* = 2, i.e. the sum 90 occurs twice.

With x = 5 the ten numbers are

5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15.

Their total is T = 97, and omitting each one indeed gives the nine sums required.

Therefore the largest of the ten numbers is 15.

67,"Jack and Jill are climbing down a vertical wall.  They both use ropes hanging from the ceiling of a huge room.  They start at the same time from the top of the wall which is 16 meters tall.  The race is divided into two stages; the first 8 meters and the last 8 meters.  A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.
Who will reach the ground first and how many additional minutes will it take the loser to finish the race?",Solve for their distance travelled at appropriate time increments,"Jack will win the race and it will take an additional half minute to catch up with him.
Jacks moves 0.8 meters vertically in each step movement:

Replacing A by the diagonally crossed distance, B by the distance between Jack's feet and C by the vertically climbed distance:
1^2 = 0.6^2+C^2
C = 0.8 m
Jill moves 1 meter vertically in each hop.
According to the circle circumference calculation:

1.  Geometry of one movement  

   Jack  
   – path of one step = 1 m (diagonally).  
   – horizontal component is given by the initial distance between his feet: 0.60 m.  
   – therefore vertical component per step  
         v_J = √(1² − 0.60²) = 0.80 m.  
   – time per step = 15 s.  
   – vertical speed = 0.80 m / 15 s = 0.053 33 m s⁻¹.  

   Jill  
   – path of one hop = 1.57 m ≈ π/2 m, i.e. the half-circumference of a circle of radius 0.50 m.  
   – the diameter of that semicircle is therefore 1.00 m, so the vertical drop per hop  
         v_L = 1.00 m.  
   – time per hop = 15 s.  
   – vertical speed = 1.00 m / 15 s = 0.066 67 m s⁻¹.

2.  Stage 1 : first 8 m  

   Jack  
   • steps needed = 8 m / 0.8 m = 10  
   • time = 10 × 15 s = 150 s = 2 min 30 s.  
   • at 8 m he must take his compulsory 1-minute rest (from 150 s to 210 s).

   Jill  
   • hops needed = 8 m / 1 m = 8  
   • after 6 m she must rest 1 min.  
        – 6 hops → 90 s  
        – rest → 60 s ( 90 s → 150 s )  
   • still 2 m to go → 2 hops = 30 s (150 s → 180 s).

   Up to 150 s Jack has already finished the first 8 m whilst Jill has descended only 6 m and is resting.  
   Jack therefore wins Stage 1 and Jill receives the 30-second penalty, beginning immediately at 150 s.  
   Consequently Jill must remain idle from 150 s to 180 s, after which she performs her last two hops, finishing Stage 1 exactly at 210 s – the same instant Jack ends his compulsory rest.

   Stage 1 result : Jack wins by 30 s.

3.  Stage 2 : last 8 m (both restart at 210 s)

   Jack  
   • again 10 steps → 150 s.  
   • finishing time = 210 s + 150 s = 360 s.

   Jill  
   • she can descend 4 m before her next 6-metre quota is reached.  
        – 4 hops → 60 s (210 s → 270 s)  
   • compulsory 1-minute rest (270 s → 330 s)  
   • last 4 m → 4 hops = 60 s (330 s → 390 s).

4.  Comparison of finishing times  

   Jack touches the ground at 360 s, Jill at 390 s.  
   Difference = 30 s = 0.5 minute.

Final answer: Jack reaches the ground first; Jill needs an additional 0.5 minute (30 seconds) to finish.",True,1,0

""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""

Hence we need

 ab – a – b = 119.

Add 1 to both sides:

 (ab – a – b) + 1 = 120

So we look for factor pairs (x,y) of 120 with x = a – 1 and y = b – 1, each at least 10 (because a,b > 10):

120’s factor pairs:
1·120, 2·60, 3·40, 4·30, 5·24, 6·20, 8·15, 10·12.

The only pair with both factors ≥10 is 10·12 (and its reverse).

Thus
a – 1 = 10 and b – 1 = 12  (or vice-versa),

72,"You are on a bus with just two other mathematicians when you overhear them talking.
The first mathematicians says, ""I have a positive integer number of children, whose ages are positive integers. The sum of their ages is the number of this bus, while the product is my own age.""
The other person replies, ""How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?""
""No, you could not.""
""Aha! At last, I know how old you are!""
Apparently the second mathematician had been trying to determine the first mathematician's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
The bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.","There are multiple possible age combinations for the mathematician's children that would result in the same age as well as the same bus number otherwise the second mathematician can determine the ages of the children given the first mathematician's age and number of children.
Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't — he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10. After enough trial and error, the perfect balance between the two is reached with the number 12.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let S be the bus–number (the common sum of the children’s ages).  
For every partition of S into at least two positive integers

 (a₁ ≤ a₂ ≤ … ≤ aₙ, a₁+…+aₙ = S)

let n be the number of parts (the number of children) and let  
P = a₁a₂…aₙ be their product (the parent’s age corresponding to that
partition).

Step 1.  What the first mathematician’s reply (“No, you could not”) means  
For the actual pair (n, P) there must be at least two different
partitions of S with the same n and the same product P.
(Otherwise, if the parent told his age P and his number of children n,
the ages would be determined uniquely and he would have answered “Yes”.)

Step 2.  What the second mathematician’s deduction means  
Knowing S, he hears that such an ambiguous pair (n, P) exists and at once
deduces P.  
Therefore, for that particular sum S there must be

 • at least one ambiguous product P, but  
 • exactly one such product P.

(If there were two different ambiguous products, he could not know which
one was the parent’s age.)

Step 3.  Search for the first sum S with exactly one ambiguous product  
Lists of all partitions for S = 3,4,5,… show that no sum ≤ 11 has any
ambiguous product at all.  
For S = 12 the partitions are

 n = 4  1 + 3 + 4 + 4 → P = 48  
     2 + 2 + 2 + 6 → P = 48  
     (all other 4-part partitions give distinct products)  

and every partition with n ≠ 4 yields a product different from 48.
Thus with S = 12 there is

 • an ambiguous product P = 48 (coming from the two 4-child sets above),  
 • no other ambiguous product.

Step 4.  Verification of higher sums  
For S = 13, 14, … one finds at least two different ambiguous products,
so the second mathematician would not be able to pinpoint the age.
Hence S = 12 is the unique sum that fulfils both conditions.

Step 5.  Conclusion  
The only bus–number that allows the dialogue to occur exactly as stated
is 12.  The father is 48 years old and has 4 children (whose ages are
either 1, 3, 4, 4 or 2, 2, 2, 6).

73,"Achmed and Ali were camel-drivers and on one day they decided to quit their job. They wanted to become shepherds. So they went to the market and sold all their camels. The amount of money (dinars) they received for each camel was the same as the total number of camels they owned. With that money they bought as many sheep as possible at 10 dinars a sheep. With the money that was left they bought a goat.
On their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, ""I take the last sheep and you can get the goat"". ""That's not fair,"" said Achmed, ""a goat costs less than a sheep"". ""OK,"" Ali said, ""then I will give you one of my dogs and then we are even"". And Achmed agreed.
What's the cost of a dog?",Think about a perfect square total of money--then one sheep left over means that the total amount of money is a square number with an odd tens place,"1 sheep - 1 dog = 1 goat + 1 dog
1 sheep - 1 goat = 2 dogs
A sheep is 10 dinars, but what does a goat cost?
The money they received for their camels is a square. And the digit in the tens-place of this square is odd (total money / 10 dinars), because they could not divide the sheep equally.
Now the interesting thing is that all squares with an odd tens-place end with a 6. (16^2 = 256, 24^2 = 576). So a goat must cost 6 dinars.
10 - 6 = 2 dogs
So a dog costs 2 dinars.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

N = number of camels they owned (an integer >0).

1. Selling the camels  
   Price per camel = N dinars  
   Total money obtained = N × N = N² dinars.

2. Buying sheep at 10 dinars each  
   Let S be the number of sheep bought.  
   10 S ≤ N² and 10 S is the greatest multiple of 10 not exceeding N²,  
   so   S = ⌊N² / 10⌋.

3. Buying one goat with the remainder  
   Goat price G = N² – 10 S = N² mod 10.  
   Because 0 < G < 10, we have G ∈ {1,4,5,6,9} (possible last digits of a square).

4. The sheep could not be divided evenly: S is odd.  
   Therefore S = (N² – G)/10 is odd ⇒ N² – G ≡ 10 (mod 20) ⇒ N² ≡ 10 + G (mod 20).

5. Squares modulo 20 can only be 0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 16.  
   For each candidate G:

   G = 1  ⇒ 10+G = 11  (not a square mod 20)  
   G = 4  ⇒ 10+G = 14  (not)  
   G = 5  ⇒ 10+G = 15  (not)  
   G = 6  ⇒ 10+G = 16  (is a square mod 20)  
   G = 9  ⇒ 10+G = 19  (not)

   Only G = 6 satisfies the condition.

6. Settling the quarrel  
   One sheep is worth 10 dinars.  
   Ali keeps the extra sheep; Achmed gets the goat plus one dog.  
   Fairness requires: goat + dog = 10 ⇒ dog = 10 – G = 10 – 6 = 4.

74,"Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?","The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","The minimum number of weights is 5.
weight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0
weight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1
weight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2
weight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3
weight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4
All five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.
The progression from one stone to one mass would be:
1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning

1.  What “weighing” on a balance really means  
   If the unknown weight X is put in the left‐hand pan, we may put some of our
   fixed weights in that same pan and some in the opposite pan.  Thus we are
   looking for fixed weights w1 , w2 , … , wk such that every integer
   1 ≤ X ≤ 121 can be written as  
  
        X  =  (sum of weights on right pan)  –  (sum of weights on left pan)  
  
   i.e. every X can be expressed with “coefficients’’ –1, 0, 1  
  
        X = a1w1 + a2w2 + … + akwk , ai ∈ {-1,0,1}.                 (1)

2.  How large a range can k weights cover?  
   Put the weights in increasing order, let  
        Sj = w1 + w2 + … + wj  (total of the first j weights).  
   Suppose with the first j–1 weights we can realise every integer from –Sj-1 to
   +Sj-1.  To keep that property when wj is added there must be no gap, hence  

        wj  ≤  Sj-1  + 1  +  Sj-1  =  2 Sj-1 + 1.                 (2)

   Equality in (2) makes the reachable interval as large as possible.  
   Start with w1 = 1 (otherwise 1 stone could not be weighed).  
   Applying (2) successively and always taking the maximum value gives  

        w1 = 1
        w2 = 2·1 + 1 = 3
        w3 = 2·(1+3) + 1 = 9
        w4 = 2·(1+3+9) + 1 = 27
        w5 = 2·(1+3+9+27) + 1 = 81

   After five steps the total weight is  

        S5 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121.

   With only four weights we would have had S4 = 40, far short of the 121 stones
   of a mass, so at least five weights are necessary.  
   Therefore five weights are both necessary and sufficient.

3.  Explicit set of weights  
   The chief’s advisers can cast just five weights of

        1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone, and 81 stone.

   (For those who prefer the local units:
        1 stone,
        3 stone,
        9 stone,
        2 lumps 5 stone,
        7 lumps 4 stone.)

4.  How to use them  
   Write the desired weight X (in stones) in balanced ternary
   (digits –1, 0, 1 corresponding to weights on the same pan, unused, or the
   opposite pan).  Each digit then tells where to place the matching weight  
   (1 ↔ 1 stone, 3 ↔ 3 stone, 9 ↔ 9 stone, etc.).  Because every integer
   0 … 121 has a unique balanced-ternary form with five digits, every such
   weight can indeed be measured.

Example:  94 stone is 1·81 + 0·27 + 1·9 + –1·3 + 1·1,  
so put 94 stone object with 3-stone weight in the left pan and
81, 9, 1-stone weights in the right pan.

M₁ = 1 : min(9,⌊12/1⌋)=9  
M₁ = 2 : min(9,⌊12/2⌋)=6  
M₁ = 3 : min(9,⌊12/3⌋)=4  
M₁ = 4 : min(9,⌊12/4⌋)=3  
M₁ = 5 : min(9,⌊12/5⌋)=2  
----------------------------------------------------------------  
Total during one 12-hour cycle = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24

Because a civil day has two identical 12-hour cycles (AM and PM), the number of such moments per day is  

24 × 2 = 48.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Twenty-four–hour clock (H = 0 … 23)
-------------------------------------------------
Now H may also be 0, so M₂ is allowed to be 0.  
For a fixed M₁ let  

q_max = min(9, ⌊23 / M₁⌋).  

Then M₂ can take every integer value q = 0 … q_max (inclusive), giving q_max+1 different times.

Compute for each M₁:

M₁ = 1 : q_max = 9   → 10 possibilities  
M₁ = 2 : q_max = 9   → 10 possibilities  
M₁ = 3 : q_max = 7   →  8 possibilities  
M₁ = 4 : q_max = 5   →  6 possibilities  
M₁ = 5 : q_max = 4   →  5 possibilities  
---------------------------------------------------------------  
Total during the whole 24-hour day = 10+10+8+6+5 = 39.

   Bet \$0.20.  
      • Heads (prob. ½): you are at \$6.40. From now on bet \$0 and you finish exactly \$0.20 ahead.  
      • Tails (prob. ½): you fall to \$6.00 → new deficit \$0.40.

2. Deficit \$0.40

      • Heads: deficit erased; stop betting.  
      • Tails: new deficit \$0.80.

3. Deficit \$0.80

82,"In our business, my two partners and I cut a lot of cake.
We work exclusively with square cakes. The cakes come in sizes that are meant to be divided into a square number of square pieces. Each portion comes decorated with an ""X"" stretching to its corners, which makes it easy to cut the usual square pieces and also offer half and quarter portions.
These markings also help on Wednesday when we savor the previous week's success by dividing a cake equally amongst ourselves. Even when a good week deserves a 64-portion cake, we can each ceremonially make a single standard cut (straight and perpendicular to the plate), and we each go home with a single piece of cake.
Using no other cuts or devices, how do we evenly divide the 8-by-8 cake? (EXTRA - How could we get 7 (and only 7) equal-size pieces from the same size cake?)",Think smaller.,"To get three twenty-one-and-one-third (64/3) portion-sized pieces, we momentarily ignore the 28 X's/portions/square-units which form the 32 unit perimeter of the cake.  There is more than one way to divide the 6-by-6 (36 X) cake inside into three equal pieces.  Using one based on its 24 unit perimeter, this cake could be divided into 24 wedges of equal size. Each triangular piece would have as its base one unit of the perimeter; the other two sides would be formed by cuts to the center of the cake. Every triangle would have the same altitude (3 units) giving the same area (A = ½ * b * h = ½ * 1 * 3 = 3/2 square units). 8 adjacent triangles, even though they include a corner or two, will be 12 square units or 1/3 of the ""inner"" cake.
Before we make any actual cuts, we return the ignored 28 portions to the picture and then make those three cuts extended to the true perimeter. The 24 triangles pictured previously increase in altitude to 4 units. By rules of similar triangles, the base increases by the same 1/3 (33 1/3%) to 1 1/3 units. The area of 8 extended triangles is 8 * ½ * 4/3 * 4 = 64/3 portions, which is exactly one-third of the cake.

(so its area is 64).

1.  Dividing it equally among three people with one cut apiece  
   -----------------------------------------------------------  
   •  Partner A puts his knife in vertically at x = 8/3 ( = 2 ⅔ in. from the
      left–hand edge) and cuts straight down.
      That rectangle is 8 × 8/3, hence has area  
                 8·(8/3) = 64/3 ,  
      exactly one–third of the cake.  He lifts it off the plate.  

   •  The remainder is a 8 × (16/3) block.  
      Partner B now makes the same sort of cut but measured from the
      opposite edge: he cuts at x = 8 – 8/3 = 16/3.
      The right–hand strip he removes is again 8 × 8/3,
      so it too has area 64/3.  

   •  What is left on the plate is the middle strip
      8 × 8/3, the third block of area 64/3.
      Partner C may slide his knife once through any part of his own
      strip (purely for ceremony) and takes it away.

   Each partner has made exactly one straight, perpendicular cut and each
   goes home with a single contiguous slab that is one-third of the cake.
   Because every little 1 × 1 square is decorated with an “X”, the vertical
   knife blades can pass cleanly through any small square whose corner they
   meet.

2.  EXTRA – getting seven (and only seven) equal pieces with the same cake  
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------  
   Three straight cuts can produce at most seven pieces, so we must use all
   three cuts and arrange for none of the cuts to be parallel and no two of
   them to meet the third at the same point.

   •  First cut A vertical line at x = 8/7.  
      This removes a strip 8 × 8/7 whose area is 64/7.  
      (Piece 1.)

   •  Second cut Turn the remaining cake a quarter-turn and again cut
      8/7 in. from the new left edge, i.e. a horizontal line y = 8/7.
      The strip that comes away is again 8 × 8/7, area 64/7.  
      (Piece 2.)  The cake that is still on the plate is an
      L-shaped region whose area is 5·64/7 = 320/7.

   •  Third cut Starting on one arm of the L and ending on the other, draw a
      straight line that leaves exactly 64/7 of area on one side of it.
      Because that line crosses both arms of the L it splits each of them,
      so it creates five new regions, each of area 64/7.

   After the third stroke we therefore have
      2 pieces from the first two cuts +
      5 pieces created by the last cut = 7 pieces,
   every one of them having area 64/7.

   (Any convex shape can be split by a single straight line into whatever
   fraction of its area we wish, so choosing the position of the third line
   to leave 64/7 on the smaller side is always possible.  Again, the “X”
   on every small square lets us follow this diagonal easily.)

Final answer:  
•  To give three partners equal shares with one cut each, make two vertical cuts 8/3 in. from the left and right edges; the three 8 × 8/3 strips that result are the three equal pieces (the third partner’s stroke can be purely ceremonial).  
•  With three suitably placed non-parallel cuts we can partition the cake into seven pieces, each of area 64/7.",True,0,0
83,"Oh no! Our flag has fallen down from the flag pole (stupid cheap string)! Quick, we need to figure out how much string we need to get it back up there...
The problem is, I don't remember its exact length!

The flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system.
The string wraps evenly around the pole 4 times.
The string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag (the returning string is built into the pole).
The pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground.
Oh yes, and the diameter of the pole is 10cm.

Use the Pythagorean theorem.","If the pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground and the flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system, then the flag must be 1 meter high. If the string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag and the flag pole is 14 meters in height, then the string must cover 12 meters in total (14-1-1).
If the diameter of the pole is 10cm and the height covered is 12 meters (1200cm), then, unwrapped in to a rectangle, it would be pi(10) (since the circumference of a circle is pi{d}) by 1200 cm rectangle.
If the string wraps around in 4 even rotations, that means the rectangle divided on the y plane into 4 equal sections would represent one rotation per section. Finding the hypotenuse of each section (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) would then yield the distance covered per rotation.

The string's distance in one rotation would be expressed by the following equation:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2
Therefore, in 4 rotations it would be the above * 4.
The final equation is thus expressed as:
let a represent the total height of the pole, then f represent the height of the flag, then rot represent the number of rotations, then p represent the height of the pulley, then d represent the diameter of the pole
s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ ({1400-100-100}/4) ^ 2 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ 90 000 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 1206.561796
Therefore, the string covers approximately 1206.561796 cm in 12 meters when there are 4 even rotations.

1.  From “# × $ = &$” we have C · D = 10·E + D  
   ⇒ D (C – 1) = 10.  
   Because D is a digit 2–9, the only possibilities are  
   D = 2, C = 6   or   D = 5, C = 3.

2.  From “\ + ^ + & = &$” we get T + H + E = 10·E + D  
   ⇒ T + H = 9E + D.

   Since T + H ≤ 17, E must be 1.  
   Hence T + H = 9 + D.

3.  Work through the two cases for D.

   •  Case D = 2, C = 6 gives T + H = 11.  
      Checking all digit pairs that sum to 11 shows no way to satisfy
      “? + > + @ = &$”, so this branch fails.

   •  Case D = 5, C = 3 gives T + H = 14.

      Take the possible pairs (T,H) = (6,8) or (8,6).

      –  With (T,H) = (6,8):

           P = 15 – H = 7, G = 15 – T = 9.  
           Left-over digits are 2 and 4.  
           From “? + > + @ = 15” we need Q + A = 6 → possibilities (4,2) or (2,4).  
           From “# + ? + ^ = 15” we need 3 + Q + 8 = 15 → Q = 4.  
           Thus Q = 4 and A = 2.

           All nine digits 1–9 are now assigned distinctly and every given
           equation checks out.

      –  With (T,H) = (8,6) one of the equations fails, so discard.

4.  The unique consistent assignment is therefore

      & = 1  $ = 5  
      # = 3  \ = 6  > = 9  
      ^ = 8  % = 7  
      ? = 4  @ = 2

   Double-checking each equation:

      6 + 9 = 15  
      8 + 7 = 15

The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.
The 36th root of a googol is
(10^100)^(1/36) = 10^(100/36) = 10^(2.77777...) ~ 599.48

For the same n we must have a⁴ = b⁹.  
Write the prime-factor exponents of n.  
Being a fourth power means every exponent is divisible by 4;  
being a ninth power means every exponent is divisible by 9.  
Thus every exponent is divisible by lcm(4,9) = 36, so

  n is exactly a 36-th power: n = k³⁶ with k ∈ ℕ.

Conversely, any 36-th power is automatically both a fourth and a ninth power, so the problem reduces to counting the 36-th powers below a googol (10¹⁰⁰).

Inequality for k:

  k³⁶ < 10¹⁰⁰  
  k < (10¹⁰⁰)^{1/36} = 10^{100/36} = 10^{25/9}.

Compute 10^{25/9}:

 25/9 = 2  7/9 = 2.777… ⇒ 10^{25/9} = 10² · 10^{7/9}.  
 10^{7/9} ≈ 5.99484, so 10^{25/9} ≈ 599.484.

Hence k can be any integer 1 ≤ k ≤ 599 (since 600 already exceeds the bound).  
Each such k gives a distinct number k³⁶, and all of them are < 10¹⁰⁰.

3^A ≡ 0 (mod 3), 5 ≡ 2 (mod 3), 7 ≡ 1 (mod 3).  
So   3^A + 5^B + 7^C ≡ 0 + 2^B + 1 (mod 3).  
Squares are 0 or 1 mod 3, hence 2^B + 1 ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 3).  
That forces 2^B ≡ 2 (mod 3) → B must be odd.

Step 2 – parities of A and C (working mod 4)  
3 ≡ –1, 5 ≡ 1, 7 ≡ –1 (mod 4).  
Thus   3^A + 5^B + 7^C ≡ (–1)^A + 1 + (–1)^C  (mod 4).  
To be a square (0 or 1 mod 4) we must have  
(–1)^A + (–1)^C ≡ 0 (mod 4) → exactly one of A,C is odd.

Step 3 – eliminating one of the two possibilities (working mod 8)  
Powers modulo 8: 3^odd ≡ 3, 3^even ≡ 1; 5^odd ≡ 5; 7^odd ≡ 7, 7^even ≡ 1.  
Because B is odd, 5^B ≡ 5 (mod 8).

(i) A odd, C even: 3 + 5 + 1 ≡ 9 ≡ 1 (mod 8)  ✓ square residue  
(ii) A even, C odd: 1 + 5 + 7 ≡ 13 ≡ 5 (mod 8) ✗ not a square residue  

Therefore we must have
 B odd, A odd, C even.

Step 4 – searching for the least value  
Take the smallest exponents consistent with Step 3:

 A = 1 → 3^1 = 3  
 B = 1 → 5^1 = 5  
 C = 2 → 7^2 = 49  

Minimum possible sum = 3 + 5 + 49 = 57.

All squares below 57 are 1,4,9,16,25,36,49 – impossible because the sum of three positive terms is at least 57.  
The next square is 64.  To reach 64 with C = 2 (49) we would need 3^A + 5^B = 15, which is impossible for positive integers with A odd, B odd.  
Hence 64 cannot occur.

The following square is 81, and indeed

 A = 3 : 3^3 = 27  
 B = 1 : 5^1 = 5  
 C = 2 : 7^2 = 49  

27 + 5 + 49 = 81 = 9².

The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.

(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186
Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.

94,"Dear Jim:
Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.
Jerry","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Albert is 11 years old, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5.",True,1,0
95,"What three-digit number when doubled is, by value, one more than the value of the same three digits when reversed?

397.
397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.
102?  Is 204 = 201 + 1?  No.
103?  Is 206 = 301 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds even.]
396?  Is 792 = 693 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds again.]
The answer given is the only one that passes.
As for extra points, an infinite number of 9's can be added between the 3 and the 7 without spoiling the major characteristics.

N = 100a + 10b + c,  

where a (hundreds digit) is 1–9 and b, c (tens and ones digits) are 0–9.

Its reversal is  
R = 100c + 10b + a.

The condition in words is  
2 × N = R + 1.

Translate to an equation:

2(100a + 10b + c) = 100c + 10b + a + 1  
⇒ 200a + 20b + 2c = 100c + 10b + a + 1  
⇒ 199a + 10b − 98c = 1.                      (1)

Because b is an integer digit, rewrite (1) as
10b = 1 − 199a + 98c.                        (2)

For the right-hand side to be a multiple of 10 we inspect it modulo 10.

Modulo 10,  −199 ≡ 1  and  98 ≡ 8, so (2) gives  
a + 8c + 1 ≡ 0  (mod 10)  
⇒ a + 8c ≡ 9  (mod 10).                      (3)

List the possibilities for digits c = 0…9 and the corresponding a (1–9) satisfying (3):

c  : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  
8c: 0 8 6 4 2 0 8 6 4 2  
a : 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7

Hence the (a,c) pairs that work are  
(9,0), (1,1), (3,2), (5,3), (7,4), (9,5), (1,6), (3,7), (5,8), (7,9).

Plug each into (2) to determine b:

1) a=9, c=0 → 10b = −1790 → b = −179 (invalid)  
2) a=1, c=1 → 10b = −100  → b = −10  (invalid)  
3) a=3, c=2 → 10b = −400  → b = −40  (invalid)  
4) a=5, c=3 → 10b = −700  → b = −70  (invalid)  
5) a=7, c=4 → 10b = −1000 → b = −100 (invalid)  
6) a=9, c=5 → 10b = −1300 → b = −130 (invalid)  
7) a=1, c=6 → 10b = 390   → b = 39   (not a single digit)  
8) a=3, c=7 → 10b = 90    → b = 9    (valid)

10) a=7, c=9 →10b = −510  → b = −51  (invalid)

Only one viable solution emerges:

a = 3, b = 9, c = 7  ⇒  N = 397.

Verification:  
2 × 397 = 794,  
reversed digits of 397 give 793, and indeed 794 = 793 + 1.

Hence there is exactly one such three-digit number.

• Divisibility by 7  
 3x + 7y ≡ 0 (mod 7) ⇒ 3x ≡ 0 (mod 7).

Check:  
777 ÷ 3 = 259 (integer) and 777 ÷ 7 = 111 (integer) ⇒ 777 ÷ 21 = 37 (integer).  
Digital sum = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21, divisible by both 3 and 7.

Locker k is toggled exactly once for each divisor of k, because it is hit on pass n whenever n divides k.

The sixteenth and last time he can get all of them tails up.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let every coin be represented by 0 (heads) or 1 (tails).  
A move consists of choosing a set of 93 coins and toggling them (adding the
characteristic vector of that set, modulo 2).

1.  A parity observation  
   After every move exactly 93 coins are flipped, hence the number of times
   every coin is flipped must be odd if in the end it is to show tails.
   (Let the number of times coin i is flipped be xᵢ; then each xᵢ is odd.)

2.  Writing the numbers of flips  
   Suppose we perform t moves.  
   • Total flips carried out = 93 t.  
   • For every i, xᵢ is an odd integer not exceeding t.  
   • Write xᵢ = 1 + 2yᵢ with yᵢ ≥ 0 an integer.  
     (So yᵢ = 0,1,…,[(t–1)/2].)

   Summing over all 100 coins,

          93 t = Σxᵢ = Σ(1 + 2yᵢ) = 100 + 2Σyᵢ
          ⇒      Σyᵢ = (93 t – 100)/2.                             (1)

   When t is even, put t = 2k.  
   Then the largest possible value of yᵢ is k – 1, hence

          Σyᵢ ≤ 100(k – 1) = 100(t/2 – 1) = 50t – 100.            (2)

   Combine (1) and (2):

          93 t – 100 ≤ 100t – 200
          ⇒ 7 t ≥ 100
          ⇒ t ≥ 100/7 ≈ 14.29.

   Because t must be even (each move flips an odd number of coins, therefore
   the total number of moves must be even in order that every coin be flipped
   an odd number of times), the first admissible value is

          t = 16.

   Hence at least 16 moves are necessary.

3.  Constructing 16 moves that succeed  
   Label the coins C₁,…,C₁₀₀.  
   Plan the skips instead of the flips: every move leaves 7 coins un-touched.
   Over 16 moves we therefore produce 7·16 = 112 “skip incidents”.

   Design the skip-incidence requirements
   • Choose two special coins, say C₁ and C₂, to be skipped 7 times each  
     (they will therefore be flipped 16 – 7 = 9 times, an odd number).  
   • Every other coin (C₃,…,C₁₀₀) is skipped exactly once  
     (and so flipped 15 times, also odd).

   This accounts for 7·2 + 1·98 = 14 + 98 = 112 required skips.

   One explicit schedule is

     Move 1 :  C₁,C₂,C₃,C₄,C₅,C₆,C₇      (7 coins)  
     Move 2 :  C₁,C₂,C₈,C₉,C₁₀,C₁₁,C₁₂  
     Move 3 :  C₁,C₂,C₁₃,C₁₄,C₁₅,C₁₆,C₁₇  
     Move 4 :  C₁,C₂,C₁₈,C₁₉,C₂₀,C₂₁,C₂₂  
     Move 5 :  C₁,C₂,C₂₃,C₂₄,C₂₅,C₂₆,C₂₇  
     Move 6 :  C₁,C₂,C₂₈,C₂₉,C₃₀,C₃₁,C₃₂  
     Move 7 :  C₁,C₂,C₃₃,C₃₄,C₃₅,C₃₆,C₃₇  
     Move 8 :  C₃₈,…,C₄₄                       (7 coins)  
     Move 9 :  C₄₅,…,C₅₁  
     Move 10 :  C₅₂,…,C₅₈  
     Move 11 :  C₅₉,…,C₆₅  
     Move 12 :  C₆₆,…,C₇₂  
     Move 13 :  C₇₃,…,C₇₉  
     Move 14 :  C₈₀,…,C₈₆  
     Move 15 :  C₈₇,…,C₉₃  
     Move 16 :  C₉₄,…,C₁₀₀

   Each of the 16 moves flips the other 93 coins.  
   Coins C₁ and C₂ are indeed skipped 7 times, every other coin once, so after
   the 16th move every coin has been flipped an odd number of times and all 100
   show tails.

Thus 16 moves are both necessary and sufficient.

A 4% birth rate would be 3.96, truncated to 3 births during the year.  A 3% death rate would be 2.97, truncated to 2 deaths during the year.  The population at the end of that year would be 99 + 3 - 2 = 100.  Based on the stated birth and death rates, what is the LAST year that the population increases by only 1?",Incrementally add before either the birth rate changes or the death rate changes; no real shortcut,"The last year the population would increase by only one would be the 61st year.
1) Beginning with the 1st year, the number of births will be 4 (4% of 100 = 4) and the number of deaths will be 3 (3% of 100 = 3), which results in a population increase of 1.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year for 25 years, reaching 125 at the end of the 25th year.
2) Beginning with the 26th year, the number of births per year will increase to 5 (4% of 125 = 5), while the deaths will still be 3.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 135 at the end of the 30th year.
3) Beginning with the 31st year, the number of deaths per year will increase to 4 (3% of 135 = 4.05), while the births will still be 5.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year, reaching 150 at the end of the 45th year.
4) Beginning with the 46th year, the number of births per year will increase to 6 (4% of 150 = 6), while the deaths will still be 4.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 168 at the end of the 54th year.
5) Beginning with the 55th year, the number of deaths per year will increase to 5 (3% of 168 = 5.04), while the births will still be 6.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year, reaching 175 at the end of the 61st year.
6) Beginning with the 62nd year, the number of births per year will increase to 7 (4% of 175 = 7), while the deaths will still be 5.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 201 at the end of the 75th year.
7) Beginning with the 76th year, the number of births per year will increase to 8 (4% of 201 = 8.04) and the number of deaths will increase to 6 (3% of 201 = 6.03).  The population will continue to increase at the rate of 2 per year.  The population will never again increase by only 1 per year.
Although the 26th year is the first year that the population increases by more than 1, the 25th year is not the last year that it increases by 1.  The last year that the population increases by 1 is the 61st year, when the population reaches 175.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  
 B(P)=⌊0.04 P⌋=⌊P/25⌋ (births)

The yearly change is  
 Δ(P)=B(P)−D(P).

We need the last year in which Δ(P)=1.

1.  When can Δ(P)=1?  
 We need ⌊P/25⌋−⌊3P/100⌋ = 1.  
 Put m = ⌊P/25⌋ (so 25m ≤ P ≤ 25m+24).  
 Then we need ⌊3P/100⌋ = m−1.  
 For P in that birth-block, 3P/100 ranges from 0.75 m to 0.75 m+0.72.  
 Thus the interval [0.75 m, 0.75 m+0.72] must contain the integer m−1.  
 That gives 0.75 m+0.72 ≥ m−1 ⟹ m ≤ 6.  
 Therefore Δ(P)=1 is possible only while ⌊P/25⌋ ≤ 6, i.e. for P ≤ 174.  
 For P ≥ 175 (where ⌊P/25⌋ = 7) the difference can no longer be 1.

2.  Follow the actual population year by year.

Year 1 starts at 100.  
For P = 100 … 124, B = 4, D = 3 ⇒ Δ = 1, so the colony gains 1 each year.

Years 1 – 25 populations 100 → 125.

At P = 125 the births jump to 5 while deaths are still 3, so Δ = 2.  
From P = 125 to 133 the increase remains 2, carrying the population to 135.

Years 26 – 30 populations 125 → 135 (Δ = 2 each year).

From P = 135 to 149 we have B = 5, D = 4 ⇒ Δ = 1 again, giving thirteen more
years of +1.

Years 31 – 45 populations 135 → 150 (Δ = 1 each year).

At P = 150 births jump to 6 while deaths are still 4, so Δ = 2 once more.
Nine such years carry the population to 168.

Years 46 – 54 populations 150 → 168 (Δ = 2 each year).

For populations 168 – 174 we have B = 6, D = 5 ⇒ Δ = 1.  
Those are the last populations for which Δ = 1 is possible.

Years 55 – 61 populations 168 → 175 (Δ = 1 each year).

At the start of Year 62 the population is 175, B = 7, D = 5 ⇒ Δ = 2, and,
as shown in step 1, Δ can never be 1 again.

Hence the last (highest-numbered) year in which the population grows by exactly one person is

Al is A + d, Cal is C + d.

1.  “ … the square of your age [Cal’s] contained the same three digits as the square of my age [Al’s], just in a different order.”

 Both A² and C² are 3–digit numbers with the same three digits rearranged.  
 Since 10² = 100 and 31² = 961, the only 3-digit squares to check are 10²,…,31²:

 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400, 441, 484, 529, 576, 625, 676, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961.

2.  “If you take the square of the sum of our ages when we met and split it into two 2-digit numbers, you’d have my age then and your age now.”

104,"Kurt & Rod were hanging around the window at school munching the last of their Rnkfurers hoard.  They spotted their neighbor lounging in the enclosed courtyard, looking hungry.
""Patty O'Furniture!  Good to see you!  Want a Rnkfurter?""
""A what?""
Kurt handed her the last he had.  She bit in, and her face lit up like a newly-coined metaphor.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""Rod and I were about to go order some more.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""  Patty's blank look bade him explain.  ""In our first batch, we got a total of 25 -- 20 for me, and 5 for Rod.  I had 20, and he had 20% of the total.""
""And you think you can do that for three people?  You get my percentage, and I get Rod's?  I don't think we can do it.""
Rod had been thinking about it, and rattled off three numbers to her.
""Those aren't right.  The last one isn't the right percentage; there's an added fraction.""
""So?  My mom says they're the same on her old phonograph speeds.""
Patty looked at Kurt, each waiting for the other to give an opinion.  Finally, she gestured at the empty wrapper in his hand.
""I'll round off a little for a week's supply of these.  Let's go!""
Since Rnkfurters come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, they had to leave 10 with the storekeeper to make the numbers work, but they got their munchies.
How many did each student get this time?","The old phonograph speeds were typically 16, 33-1/3, 45, and 78 RPM.","27 for Kurt, 30 for Patty, and 33 for Rod.
That's 30% for Kurt and 33-1/3% for Patty.
Method:
Let K, P, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, K+P+R.
Now, since Kurt's percentage equals Patty's quantity, we get
100*K/T = P.
Similarly,
100*P/T = R plus a fraction.  Now, look at the common factor, 100/T.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
K*F = P and P*F = R (plus a fraction),
and K*F^2 = R (plus a fraction).
The clue about the phonograph leaves us looking for a triple with 33 Rnkfurters for Rod, with Patty getting 33-1/3% (one-third) of the total.
P = T/3
P = (K+P+33)/3 -- remember, R=33
Now, combine this with 100*K/T = P, and a bit of algebra gives us the required answer.
-------------
Alternately, there are 11 triples that fit the factor requirement (courtesy of a short computer program), ranging from (19, 25, 32) to (2376, 96, 3).  The ones that total 10 less than a multiple of 25 are
27, 30, 33
63, 45, 32
891, 90, 9
Given the phonograph clue, I expect you can recognize that the first triple above is the answer.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  
K = number Kurt receives  
R = number Rod receives  
P = number Patty receives  
T = K + R + P = total number taken along.

The “catch’’ is:

the number one student gets equals the percentage (of the total) that some other student receives.

In symbols that means (for some ordered pair of students)  

quantity = 100 · (other’s quantity) / T .

Nothing else is required; only one such equality has to hold in each order.

----------------------------------------------------
Choose a pair to satisfy the condition
----------------------------------------------------
Let us require that Kurt’s number equal Rod’s percentage:

K = 100 · R / T .                                        (1)

----------------------------------------------------
Use the total
----------------------------------------------------
T = K + R + P .                                          (2)

Substitute (1) into (2):

T = 100 · R / T + R + P  
⇒ P = T – R – 100 R / T  
⇒ P = T – R(1 + T/100).                        (3)

----------------------------------------------------
Pick a feasible total
----------------------------------------------------
Rnkfurters are sold only in cases of 25, 50 and 100.  
The story says they “had to leave 10 with the storekeeper”, i.e.  
the total they actually took was 10 fewer than a multiple of 25.

Therefore T ≡ 15 (mod 25).  
The smallest such total large enough for three teenagers’ “week’s supply’’ is 90, so try

T = 90.

----------------------------------------------------
Solve for integers
----------------------------------------------------
With T = 90, equation (1) gives

K = 100 R / 90 = (10/9) R ,

so R must be a multiple of 9.  Write R = 9m (m a positive integer).  
Then K = 10m, and from (2)

P = 90 – 9m – 10m = 90 – 19m.

We need P > 0, so m ≤ 4.  The four possibilities are

m  |  K   R   P
---|---------------
1  | 10   9  71
2  | 20  18  52
3  | 30  27  33
4  | 40  36  14

Rod “rattled off three numbers”; Patty objected that

“The last one isn’t the right percentage – there’s an added fraction,”  
and Rod replied that his mother “says they’re the same on her old phonograph speeds.”

Old record-player speeds are 33⅓, 45 and 78 rpm; the only one with an “added fraction’’ is 33⅓.  
Among the four candidate solutions, the third gives

K = 30, R = 27, P = 33  ⇒  Kurt’s percentage is 33⅓ %.

Rod had rounded that to “33’’ – exactly Patty’s complaint – and his mother’s comment about phonograph speeds explains why he thought 33 and 33⅓ were “the same.”

----------------------------------------------------
Check the requirement
----------------------------------------------------
With (K,R,P) = (30, 27, 33) and T = 90,

• Rod’s percentage of the total is 27/90 = 30 %.  
• Kurt’s quantity is 30.  

Thus Kurt’s quantity equals Rod’s percentage, satisfying the catch.

Check the purchasing detail

They needed 90 Rnkfurters.  
The nearest total obtainable from cases of 25, 50 and 100 is a 100-piece case; they “left 10 with the storekeeper,” exactly as stated.

The tiger is hungry and always attempts to keep the distance between the two of you at a minimum. How can you safely swim to shore?
Assume that as long as you can get to the shore before the tiger gets to you (even if it is only a split-second before), you will be safe.",Use the factor of 4 to your advantage,"Until you are more than 1/4 of the radius away from the rock you can swim fast enough so that you can keep the tiger the furthest distance possible from you. Regardless of which direction the tiger moves around the circle, you swim the other way, always keeping the rock between you and the tiger.  While you are doing this you will be able to move outward, since you will have some energy to spare.
Before long you will be 1/4 of the radius away from the center and the tiger will be 180 degrees away. At this point swim straight to the point on the shore furthest from the tiger. You will be able to get there in 3/4 units of time, while it will take the tiger pi/4 =~ 0.7854 units of time.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let your swimming speed be 1 and the tiger’s running speed 4.  
Label the centre of the lake O, its radius 1, the man’s position M and the tiger’s position T.  
The tiger always stands on the radius OT that goes through the man, because that is the point on the shore that minimises the distance to M.

1.  Stay inside the circle of radius ¼  
   • If the man is at distance r from O, his linear speed 1 corresponds to an angular speed  
        ωₘ = 1 / r.  
   • The tiger’s angular speed is  
        ωₜ = 4 / 1 = 4.  
   • Whenever r < ¼ we have ωₘ > 4 = ωₜ, so inside the circle of radius ¼ the man can rotate about O faster than the tiger can follow.  

   Start by swimming out to radius r = ¼ and then swim round that little circle.  
   Because ωₘ > ωₜ the angular separation between M and T increases; in particular the man can make it exactly π radians (the tiger is diametrically opposite) in finite time.

2.  Dash for the shore  
   When the tiger is opposite the man, the man is at radius ¼.  
   • Distance the man must swim straight out to the edge:  
        1 – ¼ = ¾.  
      Time needed:  
        tₘ = ¾.  
   • At the same moment the tiger is half–way round the circumference from the landing point, a distance π.  
      Time for the tiger to run that distance:  
        tₜ = π / 4 ≈ 0.7854.

   Since tₘ = 0.75 < tₜ ≈ 0.7854, the man reaches the shore about 0.035 time-units before the tiger arrives.

3.  Conclusion  
   By first circling within the ¼-radius zone until the tiger is diametrically opposite and then swimming straight outward, the man is guaranteed to step onto the shore just ahead of the tiger.

R9 = R8 − 1/10 R8 = 9/10 R8 = 9/10·1/9 N = 1/10 N  

So after all nine gifts Justin has left R9 = N/10 marbles.

Divisibility conditions  
For each gift, the amount given and the amount left must be integers, hence

R0 = N divisible by 2  
R1 = N/2 divisible by 3   ⇒ N divisible by 6  
R2 = N/3 divisible by 4   ⇒ N divisible by 12  
R3 = N/4 divisible by 5   ⇒ N divisible by 20  
R4 = N/5 divisible by 6   ⇒ N divisible by 30  
R5 = N/6 divisible by 7   ⇒ N divisible by 42  
R6 = N/7 divisible by 8   ⇒ N divisible by 56  
R7 = N/8 divisible by 9   ⇒ N divisible by 72  
R8 = N/9 divisible by 10  ⇒ N divisible by 90  

Therefore N must be a common multiple of  
6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90.

Compute the least common multiple:
6 = 2·3  
12 = 2²·3  
20 = 2²·5  
30 = 2·3·5  
42 = 2·3·7  
56 = 2³·7  
72 = 2³·3²  
90 = 2·3²·5  

Highest prime powers:  
2³, 3², 5¹, 7¹ → 2³·3²·5·7 = 8·9·5·7 = 2520.

Hence the smallest possible starting number is N = 2520.

Final marbles left
R9 = N/10 = 2520/10 = 252.

After a while, they got bored with this, so Arnold decided to place a bet. He would ask Will one teaser, which he thought was very hard. If Will got it right, Arnold would clean his room for the rest of the year. However, if Will got it WRONG, he would have to clean Arnold's room for a year and do his dishes for a month. After thinking for a while, Will agreed to this. This was Arnold's teaser:

1.  What formats are possible?  

   We have nine different digits in total.  
   If the two factors have a-digits and b-digits respectively and the
   product has c-digits, then a+b+c = 9.  
   The realistic possibilities (numbers large enough to give a product of
   the correct length) are  

        1-digit × 4-digit = 4-digit      (1+4+4 = 9)  
        2-digit × 3-digit = 4-digit      (2+3+4 = 9)   ← example given  
        3-digit × 2-digit = 4-digit      (3+2+4 = 9)

   I will look for a 2-digit × 3-digit = 4-digit identity different from
   Arnold’s 12×483=5796.

2.  A useful divisibility observation.  
   The sum of all nine digits 1–9 is 45, i.e. 0 (mod 9).  
   Therefore the digit–sum of the whole left side
   (multiplicand + multiplier) and of the product must each be ≡ 0 (mod 9).
   This means that both factors must together contribute a digit-sum of 0
   (mod 9) and the product’s digit-sum must also be 0 (mod 9).

3.  Try a 2-digit factor that is itself divisible by 9.  
   The simplest is 27 (2+7 = 9).  Using 27 immediately satisfies the
   “multiple-of-9” condition for the product, no matter what the other
   factor is.

4.  Digits now used: {2,7}.  Remaining digits: {1,3,4,5,6,8,9}.
    Their sum is 36, again 0 (mod 9).  
    Let the 3-digit multiplier have digit-sum S.  
    Then the 4-digit product will have digit-sum 45 – 9 – S = 36 – S.
    For that to be 0 (mod 9) we need S ≡ 0 (mod 9) as well.  
    So the second factor should also have digit-sum 9 or 18.

5.  Look among the remaining digits for a 3-digit number whose digits sum
    to 9 or 18.  A convenient choice is 198 (1+9+8 = 18).

6.  Check the multiplication:

        27 × 198 = 5346
        (27×200 = 5400, minus 27×2 = 54 → 5400−54 = 5346) ✔

7.  Verify digit usage:  

        27 : 2 7  
       198 : 1 9 8  
      5346 : 5 3 4 6  

    All digits 1-9 appear exactly once, none are repeated or omitted.

Hence we have found a valid identity different from the one in the
problem statement.

108,"In the equation FORTY+TEN+TEN=SIXTY, each letter represents a different digit. Can you figure out which letter is which digit?",Start from the last digits.,"First, there are ten different letters in this equation: E, F, I, N, O, R, S, T, X, Y. Therefore, every digit from 0 to 9 is used.
Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.
If T=8, then R=X+3, we can have R=6, X=3, or R=7, X=4.
If R=6, X=3, the remaining digits are 2, 4, 7, and again we can't choose S=F+1.
If R=7, X=4, the remaining digits are 2, 3, 6, where 3=2+1. Hence S=3, F=2.
Finally, the remaining digit 6 is for Y.

   Columns (right-to-left) correspond to the letters Y, T, X, I, S.

2.  Units column  
   Y + N + N = Y (mod 10) ⇒ 2 N ≡ 0 (mod 10).  
   Hence N is 0 or 5.  
   • If N = 5, there is a carry 1, but that makes the next column impossible (see below).  
   • Therefore N = 0 and there is no carry: c₁ = 0.

3.  Tens column  
   T + E + E + c₁ = T (mod 10) ⇒ 2 E ≡ 0 (mod 10) ⇒ E = 5 (because all letters are different).  
   This produces a carry c₂ = 1 (since 2·5 = 10).

4.  Hundreds column  
   R + T + T + c₂ = X + 10 c₃  
   ⇒ R + 2 T + 1 = X + 10 c₃  (1)

5.  Thousands column  
   O + c₃ = I + 10 c₄  (2)

6.  Ten-thousands column  
   F + c₄ = S  (3)

7.  c₃ cannot be 0 (would force O = I) and cannot be 1 (would force F = S).  
   Hence c₃ = 2.  

   From (2): O + 2 = I + 10 c₄.  
   • If c₄ = 0 ⇒ O = I (impossible).  
   • So c₄ = 1 and O + 2 = I + 10 ⇒ O = I + 8.  
     The only digits that satisfy this with distinct letters are I = 1, O = 9.

8.  From (3) with c₄ = 1: F + 1 = S.

9.  Equation (1) with c₃ = 2:  
   X = R + 2 T + 1 − 20 = R + 2 T − 19,   and 0 ≤ X ≤ 9.  
   Thus 19 ≤ R + 2 T ≤ 28.

10.  Available unused digits so far: {2,3,4,6,7,8}.  
    Trying T = 8 gives R + 16 between 19 and 28 ⇒ R = 6 or 7.

    • T = 8, R = 6 ⇒ X = 3  (leaves digits {2,4,7} for F,S,Y, but F + 1 = S impossible).  
    • T = 8, R = 7 ⇒ X = 4  (leaves {2,3,6} for F,S,Y and F + 1 = S works with F = 2, S = 3).

    All other T (7,6,…) fail to produce distinct digits satisfying F + 1 = S.

11.  Collect the consistent assignment:

        F = 2     O = 9     R = 7     T = 8     Y = 6

1.  Evaluate the left–hand side of (1).

111,"Mad Ade was visiting his friend, computer tycoon and Olympic Kebab hurling champion, Mike Rohsopht.
He was there on Sunday and when the radio gave the time at the hour, Mad Ade noticed that the Madadian antique clock, designed by Madadian clock maker Arthur Minit (teaser #4891) was exactly 3 minutes slow.
""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Mike assured Mad Ade that his treasured Arthur Minit clock had not been adjusted nor fixed since his last visit.
What day of the week was Mad Ade's second visit?",It must lose some multiple of 12 hours in total,"The answer is 17 days and 3 hours later, which would have been a Wednesday.
This is the only other time in the same month when the two would agree at all.
In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.
Since the clock was not adjusted since the last visit, it's also possible that the radio time shifted by one hour due to a change to or from summer daylight saving time.  However, it turns out that the only additional possibilities that need to be considered are those of 4 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 12 hours 57 minutes, and 29 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 3 days 10 hours 57 minutes.  Without even considering the rules for when in the month the
clock is changed, these possible solutions are ruled out because we know that both visits were in the evening (""Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht"") and they involve times in a different part of the day.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

• t = the number of real hours that pass between the two visits  
• Δ(t) = how far the clock is behind the real time (in minutes) after t hours have passed.

1.  At the first visit (Sunday) the clock is 3 minutes slow, so Δ(0) = 3.

2.  The clock loses 7 minutes every real hour.  
    Hence each real hour increases the lag by 7 minutes:

          Δ(t) = 3 + 7 t.                                    (1)

3.  For the clock to look “dead right” again it must show exactly the same
    position of its hands as the true time that is being announced.
    An ordinary (antique) clock has a 12-hour dial, so the hands look the
    same whenever the clock is behind (or ahead) by any whole multiple of
    12 hours = 720 minutes.

    Therefore we need

          Δ(t) = 720 k   for some positive integer k.         (2)

4.  Combine (1) and (2):

          3 + 7 t = 720 k
          7 t = 720 k – 3.                                   (3)

   For t to be an integer, the right–hand side must be divisible by 7.
   Reduce (3) modulo 7:

          720 k – 3 ≡ 0  (mod 7)
          (720 mod 7) k – 3 ≡ 0
          6 k – 3 ≡ 0  (mod 7)
          6 k ≡ 3  (mod 7).

   Multiplying by 6 (since 6·6 ≡ 1 mod 7) gives

          k ≡ 4  (mod 7).

   The smallest positive k satisfying this is k = 4.

5.  Put k = 4 into (3):

          7 t = 720·4 – 3 = 2880 – 3 = 2877
          t   = 2877 / 7 = 411 hours.

6.  Convert 411 hours to days:

          411 h = 17 days + 3 hours.

   Beginning on a Sunday, 14 of those days bring us to the next Sunday,

a = (S + d)/2, b = (S – d)/2.

We now use that P = b a = b (S – b).  
Putting P = 100 z + 10 y + x and S = 100 x + 10 y + z gives

b(100 x + 10 y + z – b) = 100 z + 10 y + x.  (1)

Because P < 1000, b cannot exceed 9:

If b ≥ 10, then the left side of (1) is at least 10·(S – 10) ≥ 10·90 = 900,
so b ≥ 10 would force the left side above 999, impossible.  
Thus we only need to try b = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

Put k = b (2 ≤ k ≤ 9).  
Equation (1) becomes

k(100 x + 10 y + z) – k² = 100 z + 10 y + x

⇔ (100k – 1) x + 10(k – 1) y – (100 – k) z = k².  (2)

In (2) the coefficient of x is positive (≥ 199) and that of z is negative (–(100 – k)),
so their terms must almost cancel.  Consequently

x ≈ (100 – k)/(100k) · z.

Because z ≤ 9 and x ≥ 1, the ratio on the right must be at least 1⁄9.  
This fails for k ≥ 3 (then (100 – k)/(100k) ≤ 97/300 < 1/3).  
Therefore the only possible value is k = 2.

With k = 2, equation (2) is

(199) x + 10 y – (98) z = 4.  (3)

Now 199 x is roughly twice 98 z, so z must be about 2x.  
Trying x = 1,2,3,4 shows that only

x = 4, z = 9, y = 9

satisfy (3):

199·4 + 10·9 – 98·9 = 796 + 90 – 882 = 4.

Thus S = 100·4 + 10·9 + 9 = 499, P = 100·9 + 10·9 + 4 = 994.

Finally

a = P / k = 994 / 2 = 497, b = k = 2

and indeed

497 + 2 = 499, 497 · 2 = 994,

with 994 the digit–reversal of 499.

No other k (3–9) produces a solution, and k ≥ 10 is impossible, so this pair is unique.

(1)  n is abundant:  σ(n) – n  > n   (i.e. the proper divisors add to more than n)  
(2)  n is not semiperfect: no sub-collection of its proper divisors adds exactly to n.  
A number with both properties is called weird.

Step 1 – list all abundant numbers below 70  

(The proper divisors are written and one subset that gives the number is exhibited.)

30 : 1,2,3,5,6,10,15 → 15+10+5 = 30

54 : 1,2,3,6,9,18,27 → 27+18+9 = 54  
56 : 1,2,4,7,8,14,28 → 28+14+8+4+2 = 56  
60 : 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30 → 30+20+10 = 60  
66 : 1,2,3,6,11,22,33 → 33+22+11 = 66  

All abundant numbers below 70 are therefore semiperfect, so none of them is weird.

Step 2 – examine 70  

Proper divisors of 70 : {1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35}

•  Abundance: 1+2+5+7+10+14+35 = 74 > 70  ⇒ 70 is abundant.

•  Check the semiperfect condition  
  – If the subset chosen does not contain 35, the largest possible sum is  
    1+2+5+7+10+14 = 39 < 70, so such a subset can never reach 70.  
  – Suppose the subset does contain 35.  We then need another 35 from  
    {1,2,5,7,10,14}.  Exhausting the possibilities shows no combination
    of those numbers equals 35:  
      14+10+7+2+1 = 34  
      14+10+7+5    = 36  
      14+10+5+2+1  = 32  
      10+7+5+2+1   = 25  
      … (all others are either smaller than 35 or exceed it)  
    Therefore no subset including 35 can sum to 70.

Since both cases fail, no subset of proper divisors of 70 totals 70.  
Therefore 70 is not semiperfect.

Step 3 – conclusion  

Every abundant number below 70 is semiperfect, and 70 is abundant but not semiperfect. Hence 70 is the first (smallest) weird number.

115,"On planet ?*!@, the inhabitants are robots with various numbers of arms. The robots are grouped into tribes according to the numbers of arms they have so that in any tribe, no member has a different number of arms to the other members. Each tribe follows the same fertility ritual before bed each night, a ritual that also reveals the number of members in a tribe. In the ritual, each arm of a male links with an arm of a female, no male-female pair of robots linking more than once. The minimum number of robots required to link all arms once only is the number belonging to that tribe. Now one night, the Creaky tribe cornered half of the Rusty tribe and despite being outnumbered two to one, unscrewed one arm from each, there being an equal number of male and female victims. However, the Creaky tribe were extremely poor at arithmetic and had failed to realise that they needed 24 times their actual haul of spare arms in order that the number of links their members could then make, each with the same number of extra arms, was half the maximum number of links the Rusty tribe could then make. How many Creakies and Rusties were there?",,"ARMLESS ALIENS. There were 14 Creakies and 56 Rusties. A robot with n arms requires n females and vice-versa, and the number of members is 2n with n squared links. Let the Creaky tribe have x arms each and the Rusty tribe have y. Then the maximum number of links that the Rusty tribe can make after the mutilation is y(2y-1)/2. The number of extra arms each Creaky needs is 24y/2x allowing x(x + 24y/2x) links. Forming the links equation we have 2(y squared) - 49y - 4(x squared) = 0. We must have y=4x so that y - 4x is a factor. A long division shows that the condition for zero remainder is x=7 so y=28. The numbers of members are twice these.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning

1.  Structure of a tribe  
   •  If every robot in a tribe has a arms, let M be the number of males and F the number of females.  
   •  To link all arms once with “no male–female pair used twice” we need  
        – every male to link each of his a arms with a different females  ⇒  F ≥ a;  
        – the same for females  ⇒  M ≥ a;  
        – total male arms = total female arms  ⇒  Ma = Fa  ⇒  M = F.  
   •  The smallest numbers are therefore M = F = a, so a tribe has 2a members.  
      Hence

        number of arms per robot = a,
        size of tribe = 2a   (with a males and a females).

2.  Notation  
   Let

        a_C = arms per Creaky,   C = 2a_C  (Creaky population)
        a_R = arms per Rusty,    R = 2a_R  (Rusty population).

3.  The raid  
   •  Half of the Rusties were captured:  R/2 robots.  
   •  These victims out-numbered the Creakies two-to-one, so  
        R/2 = 2C   ⇒   R = 4C.                                 (1)
   •  One arm was removed from every victim, so the Creakies obtained  
        R/2 = 2C spare arms.

4.  What the Creakies really needed  
   They “needed 24 times their actual haul”, i.e. 48C arms, so that each Creaky
   could receive the same number of extras.  
   Extra per Creaky = 48C / C = 48 arms.

   Hence if the Creakies had had enough arms each of them would have  
        a_C + 48 arms.

5.  Links after the transfer (had it been possible)  
   •  Creakies: males = females = C/2, so maximum links  
        L_C = (C/2)(a_C + 48).                                 (2)

   •  Rusties after losing one arm from half their members:  
        – R/4 males and R/4 females now have a_R − 1 arms,  
        – the other R/4 of each sex still have a_R arms.  
     Total male (and female) arms  
        = (R/4)(a_R − 1) + (R/4)(a_R) = R/4(2a_R − 1).  
     Because sexes are equal, all these arms can still be paired, so

        L_R = R/4(2a_R − 1).                                   (3)

   The Creakies wanted their number of links to be half the Rusties’:

        L_C = ½ L_R.                                           (4)

6.  Substitute numbers  
   From (1):  R = 4C.  
   From the tribe-size rule:  C = 2a_C,  R = 2a_R, so  
        a_R = R/2 = (4C)/2 = 2C = 4a_C.                       (5)

   Put (2), (3), (5) into (4):

        (C/2)(a_C + 48) = ½ · [ (4C)/4 · (2·4a_C − 1) ]
        ⇒ C/2 (a_C + 48) = ½ (C)(8a_C − 1)
        ⇒ a_C + 48 = 8a_C − 1
        ⇒ 7a_C = 49
        ⇒ a_C = 7.                                            (6)

7.  Populations  
   C = 2a_C = 14         (Creakies)  
   R = 4C   = 56         (Rusties)

   (Check: a_R = 4a_C = 28 arms per Rusty, half the Rusties captured = 28 victims, etc. – all conditions are met.)

   ⇒ EF must be even and divisible by 3  
   ⇒ F must be even and 50+F ≡ 0 (mod 6).  
   Checking even digits 2, 4, 6, 8 gives 50+4 = 54 ≡ 0 (mod 6).  
   ⇒ F = 4.

3.  FG must be divisible by 7  
   ⇒ 40+G ≡ 0 (mod 7).  
   Among the unused digits only G = 2 (giving 42) or G = 9 (giving 49) work.

   • If G = 2 then GH = 20+H must be divisible by 8.  
     20 ≡ 4 (mod 8) so H must satisfy H ≡ 4 (mod 8), impossible with digits 1–9 not already used.  
     ⇒ G ≠ 2.

   • Hence G = 9 and FG = 49.

4.  GH must be divisible by 8

   ⇒ H = 6.

5.  HI must be divisible by 9

   ⇒ I = 3.

   So far we have … 5 4 9 6 3 fixed (E=5,F=4,G=9,H=6,I=3).

6.  AB must be divisible by 2  
   ⇒ B is even → B ∈ {2,8}.  
   (2 is free; 4,6,8 already considered, 4 and 6 used.)

7.  BC must be divisible by 3  
   ⇒ B + C ≡ 0 (mod 3).

8.  CD must be divisible by 4.

   The only digits still unused are {1,2,7,8}. They will occupy A,B,C,D.

   Case 1: B = 2  
      Then C must satisfy 2+C ≡ 0 (mod 3) → C ≡ 1 (mod 3) → C = 1 or 7.  
      • C = 1 → CD = 1D must make 10+D divisible by 4; with D = 7 or 8 none works.  
      • C = 7 → CD = 7D gives 70+D divisible by 4; D would have to be ≡ 2 (mod 4), impossible.  
      ⇒ no solution with B = 2.

   Case 2: B = 8  
      Then C must satisfy 8+C ≡ 0 (mod 3) → C ≡ 1 (mod 3) → C = 1 or 7.

      • Sub-case C = 1  
        Remaining digits {2,7}.  
        Need CD = 12 or 17 divisible by 4 → CD = 12 works, so D = 2, A = 7.  
        Number: 7 8 1 2 5 4 9 6 3 = 781254963.

      • Sub-case C = 7  
        Remaining digits {1,2}.  
        Need CD = 72 or 77 divisible by 4 → CD = 72 works, so D = 2, A = 1.  
        Number: 1 8 7 2 5 4 9 6 3 = 187254963.

Both numbers satisfy all eight divisibility requirements, and the earlier logical elimination shows no other arrangement is possible.

122,"The people of Olde Mathville had unique ways of punishing wayward citizens.   For example, those convicted of crimes of dishonesty were chained to the Liars' Rail until they solved a number of puzzles.
One such puzzle has been recently discovered!
In the multiplication below, each letter - L, I, A, R, and S - takes the place of a different digit.   Find the digits to make the multiplication true.
L I A R
x  S
--------
R A I L
or: L I A R  x  S  =  R A I L",The product of S x L must be less than 10.  Combining that with the need for S x R to end in L limits the possibilities quickly.,"L=2, I=1, A=7, R=8, and S=4
2178 x 4 = 8712
One possible solution guide:
* SxL<10, as the product is a 4-digit number; S can not = 1
... so S,L can be 2,3; 2,4; 3,1; 3,2; 4,1; 4,2
* but SxR ends in L - and if S or R is even, so is L
... so S,L,R can be 2,4,7; 3,1,7; 3,2,4; 4,2,8
* the first three are quickly rejected by checking the multiplication
... S=4, L=2, R=8
* Since 2000 x 4 = 8000, nothing has been carried from multiplying the hundreds digit
... so I=1 or 0
* I=0 is rejected as '3' tens have been carried forward from multiplying 4x8; the 3 must be added to 7 to give 0 in the bottom line, and we cannot have 4 x __ = 7.
... so I=1
... so A=7 (the only way to get a 1 in the tens column of the product)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We are looking for distinct digits L,I,A,R,S (L≠0 , R≠0) such that

(1000 L + 100 I + 10 A + R) · S = 1000 R + 100 A + 10 I + L.       (1)

That is, LIAR × S equals the reversal RAIL.

A convenient way to attack (1) is to imitate the ordinary one–digit-by-one-digit multiplication and follow the carries.

Write

            L I A R
        ×           S
        ---------------
            R A I L

Let  

c₁ = carry from the units column,  
c₂ = carry from the tens column,  
c₃ = carry from the hundreds column.

Column by column we then have  

1. Units: R·S = 10 c₁ + L  ⇒ L = (R·S) mod 10.  
2. Tens: A·S + c₁ = 10 c₂ + I ⇒ I = (A·S + c₁) mod 10.  
3. Hundreds: I·S + c₂ = 10 c₃ + A ⇒ A = (I·S + c₂) mod 10.  
4. Thousands: L·S + c₃ = R ( since no fifth digit) and L·S + c₃ < 10. (2)

From (2) we immediately get L·S ≤ 9, so L ≤ ⌊9/S⌋.  
Therefore

   S = 2  ⇒  L ≤ 4  
   S = 3  ⇒  L ≤ 3  
   S = 4  ⇒  L ≤ 2  
   S ≥ 5  ⇒  L ≤ 1.                                      (3)

Now combine (3) with the first congruence L ≡ R·S (mod 10).  
A systematic check of each possible S gives:

• S = 2 : no choice of digits satisfies all four column equations.  
• S = 3 : likewise impossible.  
• S = 4 : only L = 2 is possible (because L ≤ 2).  
  With L = 2, the congruence L ≡ 4R (mod 10) gives R = 8 or 3.  
  R = 3 fails in the later columns; R = 8 succeeds.

   Take L = 2, R = 8, S = 4.  
   Units: 8·4 = 32 → L = 2, c₁ = 3.  
   Tens: choose A so that 4A + 3 ends in I.  Trying A = 7 gives 4·7 + 3 = 31 → I = 1, c₂ = 3.  
   Hundreds: 4·1 + 3 = 7 → A = 7, c₃ = 0, which is consistent with (2).  
   All digits 2,1,7,8,4 are distinct, so we have a complete solution.

• S = 5,6,8 : impossible because L would have to be 1 and 5R,6R,8R can never end in 1.  
• S = 7 : the only possible (L,R) = (1,3) fails in later columns.  
• S = 9 : the only possible (L,R) = (1,9) fails in later columns.

Hence the unique solution is obtained for S = 4:

                2 1 7 8
              ×       4
              ----------
                8 7 1 2

Therefore
  L = 2, I = 1, A = 7, R = 8, S = 4.

123,"Can you find a five digit number that, if you place a 9 at the beginning to make a new number, is four times larger than if you place the 9 at the end instead?",The first digit of this number must be 2,23076: 923076 / 230769 = 4.,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the unknown five–digit number be N.

1. Putting a 9 in front:  
   Because N has five digits, this shifts N five places to the left and adds the digit 9 in the hundred-thousands place:  
   9 × 10⁵ + N = 900 000 + N.

2. Putting a 9 at the end:  
   Appending one digit on the right multiplies N by 10 and then adds 9:  
   10 N + 9.

The statement says the first construction is four times the second:

900 000 + N = 4(10 N + 9).

Solve for N:

900 000 + N = 40 N + 36  
900 000 – 36 = 40 N – N  
899 964 = 39 N  
N = 899 964 ÷ 39  
N = 23 076.

Check:

• 9 in front ➔ 923 076.  
• 9 at the end ➔ 230 769.  
• 4 × 230 769 = 923 076 ✔️

The least common multiple of 242=2*11^2, 160=2^5*5, 64=2^6 and 22=2*11 is 2^6*5*11^2=38720.

A = largest wheel (242 teeth)  
B = 160-tooth wheel  
C = 64-tooth wheel  
D = 22-tooth wheel  

They are in a simple train: A meshes with B, B with C, C with D.

1.  Ratio A ↔ B  
   For two gears in mesh, revolutions are inversely proportional to their teeth.  
   B makes (242/160)=121/80 revolutions for every 1 revolution of A, and in the opposite direction.  
   If A makes N revolutions,  
   RB = −(121/80) N .  

2.  Ratio B ↔ C  
   C makes (160/64)=5/2 revolutions for every 1 revolution of B, again reversing direction.  
   RC = −(5/2) RB = −(5/2)(−121/80) N = (121/32) N .

   D makes (64/22)=32/11 revolutions for every 1 revolution of C, with another reversal.  
   RD = −(32/11) RC = −(32/11)(121/32) N = −(121/11) N .  

To have every wheel back at its starting orientation each RB, RC, RD must be an integer (the sign is irrelevant – a whole number of full turns either way returns the wheel to its initial position).

So N must satisfy  

N·121/80 ∈ ℤ  ⇒  N multiple of 80  
N·121/32 ∈ ℤ  ⇒  N multiple of 32  
N·121/11 ∈ ℤ  ⇒  N multiple of 11  

The least common multiple of 80 (=2⁴·5), 32 (=2⁵) and 11 is

LCM(80, 32, 11) = 2⁵·5·11 = 32·55 = 1760.

Therefore the smallest number of revolutions of the largest cog that brings every wheel back to its starting position is 1760.

Every man should finish at the same time.,"A's speed is 1/10 (in bridges per minute), B's speed is 1/5, C's speed is 1/2, and the bicycle's speed is 1.
The fastest way to get everyone across is for B and C to start out on foot and A to start out with the bicycle. At a point y, A will get off the bicycle and walk the rest of the way. Eventually C will get to the bicycle abandoned by A, then ride back to a point x, leaving the bicycle there, then turning around and walk until he reaches the end. Person B will walk until he reaches the bicycle left by C and then ride the rest of the way.
Below are the times that each will take to cross, in terms of x and y:
A: 1*y + 10*(1-y)
B: 5*x + 1*(1-x)
C: 2*y + (y-x) + 2*(1-x)

1.  A cannot walk, otherwise the total time would be 10 min, so A must ride the bicycle once (1 min).

2.  If we tried to finish in less than 5 min, B would also have to ride, because walking takes him 5 min.  
    Two different riders already force the bicycle to make at least three trips

126,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.

Which 13-card straights can alternate colours?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A 13-card straight must contain every rank from Ace (=1) up through King (=13).
Ordering those ranks from low to high gives the fixed sequence

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13 .

If the colours are to alternate it must run

red , black , red , black , … , red , black .

(The opposite pattern – black on the odd positions – is impossible, because the Ace is available only in hearts, a red suit.)

So: odd-numbered ranks must be red, even-numbered ranks black.

   • If b₁ = 9 then a₁ must be 4 and k₄ = 1 (since 2·4 + 1 = 9).  
     Hence we must have  

     a₁ = 4, b₁ = 9, k₄ = 1.

5.  To have k₄ = 1 we need a carry from the previous step, so

     a₂·2 + k₃ ≥ 10.

   With digits available, the only possibilities are a₂ = 5 or 6.

   • Take a₂ = 5.  
     If k₃ = 0 then 2·5 = 10, so b₂ = 0 and the carry k₄ = 1 appears as required.

6.  So far we have used the digits 4 (in N), 5 (in N), 9 and 0 (in D).  
   The remaining digits are 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6.

7.  Work from the units place upward.

   • Choose a₅ = 1.  Then 2·1 = 2, so b₅ = 2 and k₁ = 0.  
   • Choose a₄ = 2.  Then 2·2 + k₁ = 4, so b₄ = 4 and k₂ = 0.  
   • The remaining digit for a₃ is 3.  Then 2·3 + k₂ = 6, so b₃ = 6 and k₃ = 0 (agreeing with the earlier assumption k₃ = 0).

   All ten digits have now been used exactly once:

   Numerator N = 4 5 3 2 1 = 45321  
   Denominator D = 9 0 6 4 2 = 90642

8.  Check: 2 × 45321 = 90642 ✔

Therefore the required fraction is

45321 / 90642 = 1 / 2.

Final answer: 45321/90642",True,1,0
129,"Xavier and Rex were playing a game that involved 5 dice. In each turn, they would roll the 5 dice. Each face of the die is worth a different amount of points. On their first 2 shots, they rolled this:
Xavier 1: 1, 3, 3, 4, 6 = 177 points
Rex 1: 2, 4, 4, 5, 6 = 268 points
Xavier 2: 1, 1, 1, 4, 4 = 203 points
Rex 2: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 = 216 points
Using this information, can you work out how many points Xavier and Rex each got on their third turn and how many points each face is worth?
Xavier 3: 1, 2, 2, 3, 4 = ?

1 = 25 points
2 = 77 points
3 = 38 points
4 = 64 points
5 = 51 points
6 = 12 points
From Xavier's first shot and Rex's second shot, we can deduce that a 2 is worth more than a 3. From Xavier's second shot, we can deduce that a 1 is worth an odd number. By trial and error we can work out the value of each face.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the (yet unknown) point–values of the six faces 1,2,3,4,5,6 be  

a , b , c , d , e , f  respectively.

From the four given rolls we get four linear equations:

1)  a+2c+d+f = 177          (Xavier 1)  
2)  b+2d+e+f = 268          (Rex 1)  
3)  3a+2d     = 203         (Xavier 2)  
4)  a+b+c+d+f = 216         (Rex 2)

Solving these for a , b , c , d , e , f we obtain

a = 2t – 151  
b = c + 39  
d = 328 – 3t  
e = c + 5t – 427  
f =  t – 2c,

where t ≔ 2c + f (so 76 ≤ t ≤ 109 in order that every value be positive).

Hence there is not one single set of face-values but a whole family of them: every pair (t , c) satisfying  
 76 ≤ t ≤ 109,  
 1 ≤ c < t/2,  
 c > 427 – 5t,  
and making the six numbers above pairwise different, gives a perfectly valid solution.

For each such choice the third–turn scores would be  

Xavier 3: a + 2b + c + d = –t + 3c + 255,  
Rex 3:    a + c + d + 2f =  t – 3c + 177,

so their third–turn scores vary with the particular values chosen for t and c.

Example  
Taking t = 90, c = 20 (which satisfies all the conditions) gives  

Face-1 = 29, Face-2 = 59, Face-3 = 20,  
Face-4 = 58, Face-5 = 43, Face-6 = 50,

and then

Xavier 3 = 29 + 2·59 + 20 + 58 = 225,   
Rex 3    = 29 + 20 + 58 + 2·50 = 207.

But choosing, say, t = 78, c = 38 produces a different admissible set of face-values and the third-turn scores change to 291 and 141 respectively.

Therefore the data supplied are not sufficient to determine a unique point-value for each face or unique third-turn scores for Xavier and Rex.  Many distinct solutions exist.",True,0,0
130,You land on an unknown planet which has a radius of 10km and is completely round and smooth. You start from your ship and walk straight for 17.345 kilometers.

Or square root of 200!
If you imagine you are facing a globe head on, you have the north pole at the top of the globe and the south pole at the bottom. Imagine a ""west pole"" and ""east pole"" to the left and right of the globe.
If you are at the north pole and turn left, you will walk through the ""west pole"" (right and you go through the ""east pole"")
If you walk on an axis from the north pole towards the south pole and make a left or right turn you will always walk through these imaginary east and west poles. So in the question 17.345 kilometers is irrelevant, only the turn.
(It also doesn't matter where you start on the planet, the distance at the end will still be the same.)
47.124 is approximately 3/4 of the circumference of this planet, which will leave you directly on the imaginary east pole. The distance is now the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle of side 10km.

Walking “straight” on a sphere means following great–circle arcs, and the “left turn” makes the angle between the first and second arcs 90° at the turning point T.

1.  Convert the travelled lengths to central angles  
 ĉ = c / R = 17.345 / 10 = 1.734 5 rad  
 â =  a / R = 47.124 / 10 = 4.712 4 rad  

   A side of a spherical triangle is the shorter great-circle arc between its ends, so any side angle must lie in (0, π).  
   Because â = 4.712 4 rad > π, the relevant side angle is  

 â = 2π – â = 6.283 185 … – 4.712 4 = 1.570 785 rad  (≈ π/2 – 1.10 ×10⁻⁵)

2.  Let the spherical triangle have sides â , b̂ , ĉ and angle B = 90° at T.

Lk  = length of the band after the k-th stretch  
pk  = spider’s distance from the fixed end after the k-th stretch

Initially (k = 0)  
L0 = 3 in,    p0 = 0,    f0 = 0.

1. What happens during one minute

We need Hn ≥ 3.  The first n for which this holds is n = 11:

 H10 = 2.928968…, H11 = 3.019877…>3.

So after 10 full minutes the spider still has not arrived, but during the 11-th minute it will.

4. How far (along the rubber) is still missing after 10 minutes?  

f10 = H10/3 = 2.928968…/3 = 0.9763227.

Fraction remaining: 1 − f10 = 1 − H10/3 = (3 − H10)/3.

With H10 = 7381/2520, this is

 1 − f10 = (3 − 7381/2520)/3 = 179/2520.

The length during the 11-th minute is

 L10 = 3·(10+1) = 33 in,

so the spider must cover

 33·(179/2520) = 1969/2520 in.

5. Time to cover that distance at 1 in/min:

Something fun is that the total number of letters he had delivered has its digits arranged in ascending order.
How many days had he worked, and how many letters had he delivered in total?",The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.,"It's easy to see that the number of letters he had delivered is the square of the number of days he had worked.
Square numbers can't end in 7 or 8, and 123456 is not a square because it is divisible by 3 but not by 9. Hence the number of letters must end with 9.
Since odd squares have remainder 1 upon division by 8, the number formed by its fourth and fifth digits must be divisible by 4, which can be 48, 56 or 68.
Numbers that have remainder 2 upon division by 3, and those that are divisible by 3 but not by 9 are not squares. By trial and error, we know that the only square number satisfying these conditions is 134689=367^2.
Hence, he had worked for 367 days, and had delivered 134689 letters.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the postman work n days.

   He delivers 1, 3, 5, … letters, i.e.  
   day k → 2k − 1 letters.

2.  Total letters after n days  
   S(n)=1+3+5+⋯+(2n−1)=n²  
   (the sum of the first n odd numbers).

   We need n²>100 000 ⇒ n≥317.

3.  What «ascending digits» means  
   The digits must be strictly increasing from left to right
   (e.g. 134689).  
   Hence  
   • there are no repeated digits;  
   • the digit 0 cannot appear (it would break the increasing order).

   Because n≥317, n² has six digits but is <1 000 000
   (since 999²=998 001).

   form a strictly increasing sequence chosen from {1,…,9}.

   Removing endings that contain 0 or repeated digits leaves  
   16,24,25,29,36,49,69,89.  

   For a six-digit ascending number the tens digit must be smaller than
   the units digit, and there must be four smaller digits in front of
   them.  The only viable endings are therefore 69 and 89
   (with units digit 9).

5.  Building the candidates  
   a. Ending 69 → digits … 6 9  
      The four preceding digits must be chosen from {1,2,3,4,5}.  
      There are only 5 such numbers:

         123 469, 123 569, 124 569, 134 569, 234 569.

      None of them is a square (their square roots lie strictly between
      consecutive integers), so «69» is impossible.

   b. Ending 89 → digits … 8 9  
      The four preceding digits come from {1,…,7}.  
      35 numbers are possible.  
      A square ending in 89 must have its root ending in 17, 33, 67 or 83
      (because 17²=289, 33²=1089, 67²=4489, 83²=6889).

      Testing the only candidates whose roots finish that way in the
      required range 317…999 we find

           367² = 134 689.

      All digits 1 3 4 6 8 9 are strictly ascending, so 134 689
      meets the condition.

After Clue #6, we have one possibility: 617.
617 is the mystery number.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-1.  Properties forced by “prime”
•  ABC is prime  ⇒  the last digit C can only be 1, 3, 7  
  (it cannot be 5 or an even digit, and 9 is forbidden).
•  AB and BC are two–digit primes.  
  So B, the units digit of AB and the tens digit of BC, can also only be 1, 3, 7
  (again it cannot be 0,2,4,5,6,8,9).  
  Because the digits are distinct, B ≠ C, and A ≠ B, C.

Thus {B,C} is one of
(1,3), (1,7), (3,1), (3,7), (7,1), (7,3).

Step-2.  Eliminate combinations whose digit–sum is divisible by 3  
If A+B+C is a multiple of 3, every permutation of the digits would also be divisible
by 3 and therefore not prime.  For each pair (B,C) we get

(B,C) = (1,3) or (3,1) or (3,7) or (7,3) ⇒ A mod 3 ≠ 2  
(B,C) = (1,7) or (7,1)             ⇒ A mod 3 ≠ 1.

Step-3.  Check each admissible triple (A,B,C)

Pair (B,C) = (1,3)
 Allowed A ≠ 1,3 and A mod 3 ≠ 2 → A = 4,6,7  
  413 composite, 613 fails in permutation 136, 713 composite.  No solution.

Pair (B,C) = (1,7)
 Allowed A ≠ 1,7 and A mod 3 ≠ 1 → A = 2,4,5,6,8  
 AB must be prime; only A = 4 or 6 work (AB = 41, 61).  
 417 composite. 617 passes all prime tests → possible solution.

Pair (B,C) = (3,1)
 Allowed A ≠ 3,1 and A mod 3 ≠ 2 → A = 4,6,7, …  
 Only A = 4 or 7 give AB prime. 431 passes but 134 (ascending) is not prime; 731 composite.

Pair (B,C) = (3,7)
 Allowed A ≠ 3,7 and A mod 3 ≠ 2 → A = 1,4,6, …  
 Check: 137 fails with 731; 437 composite; 637 composite.

Pair (B,C) = (7,1)
 Allowed A ≠ 7,1 and A mod 3 ≠ 1 → A = 2,3,5,6,8  
 Test shows none work (AB not prime or ABC composite).

Pair (B,C) = (7,3)
 Allowed A ≠ 7,3 and A mod 3 ≠ 2 → A = 1,4,6, …  
 173 fails with 731; 473 composite; 673 fails with 763.

Only one triple survives all six clues:

A = 6, B = 1, C = 7

• ABC = 617  (prime)  
• AB = 61    (prime)  
• BC = 17    (prime)  
• digits 6,1,7 are distinct and contain no 9  
• descending order  761  is prime  
• ascending  order  167  is prime.

Hence Carlos’s mystery number is 617.

136,"Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?
Comments to triflers:
The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!",There are hints in the comments to triflers and in the title.,"80
To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion. This takes 9 trips of 2 5/18 miles (5 advancing trips interspersed with 4 return trips) for a total of 20.5 miles traveled (9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5) and 20.5 bottles of soda used. Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases. With one less case to move, Bu will now make 2 fewer trips. The 3.5 bottles set aside are used to move the four cases the next 1/2 mile toward the Wirth Pavilion.   After this, the Wirth Pavilion is just 2 2/9 miles away ( 5 - 2 5/18 - 9/18 = 2 4/18 ). Next, he travels 15 5/9 miles (7 * 2 2/9) using 15 5/9 bottles of soda to complete his trip. The ranger cadet delivers 80 bottles to the pavilion and has 4/9 of a Park Pop to spare. (96 - 15 5/9 = 80 4/9)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

• C = 24 be the number of unopened bottles in one case.  
• K = 25 be the total number of bottles the MoJoPed can have on board at one time (24 in the cargo carrier + 1 in the fuel tank).  
• N₀ = 5 C = 120 be the number of unopened bottles at the Weiss Pavilion (mile 0).  
• d = 5 mi be the distance to the Wirth Pavilion.

The moped drinks one bottle for every mile it travels, whether it is going forward (loaded) or back (empty).  
Because it can carry only one case at a time, the number of loaded trips that must start out from any point equals  
m(x) = ⌈N(x)/C⌉, where N(x) is the number of unopened bottles sitting at that point.

If at some point we need m loads, the least possible number of one-mile trips needed to push everything one mile farther is

  T(m) = 2 m – 1  
  ( m loaded forward trips, m – 1 empty return trips )

and therefore the smallest possible fuel cost for that mile is also 2 m – 1 bottles.

We now follow the freight one mile at a time, always using the minimum possible number of trips.

Mile 0 → 1  
 Start with N =120.    m = ⌈120/24⌉ = 5.  
 Fuel needed: T(5)=9 bottles.  
 End of mile 1: N =120 – 9 =111 bottles (still >96, so still 5 loads).

Mile 1 → 2  
 Start with N =111 (5 loads).  
 Fuel needed: 9 bottles.  
 End of mile 2: N =111 – 9 =102 bottles (still 5 loads).

Mile 2 → 3  
 Start with N =102 (5 loads).  
 Fuel needed: 9 bottles.  
 End of mile 3: N =102 – 9 =93 bottles (now only 4 loads are needed).

Mile 3 → 4  
 Start with N =93 (4 loads).  
 Fuel needed: T(4)=7 bottles.  
 End of mile 4: N =93 – 7 =86 bottles (still 4 loads).

Mile 4 → 5  
 Start with N =86 (4 loads).  
 Fuel needed: 7 bottles.  
 End (Wirth Pavilion): N =86 – 7 =79 unopened bottles delivered.

Total fuel used  = 9 + 9 + 9 + 7 + 7 = 41 bottles  
Unopened bottles delivered = 120 – 41 = 79 bottles.

Why 79 is best possible  
• For the first three miles we must start with five loads, so each of those miles unavoidably costs at least 9 bottles; that is 27 bottles.  
• After three miles there are at least 120 – 27 = 93 bottles left, so at least four loads are still required.  
• A mile with four loads must cost at least 7 bottles; we have two more miles, so they cost at least 14 more bottles.  
• Thus no strategy can use fewer than 27 + 14 = 41 bottles, and no strategy can deliver more than 120 – 41 = 79 unopened bottles.

Hence 79 is the maximum possible number of unopened bottles that can reach the Wirth Pavilion.

137,"Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.  Henry's plan calls for the tracks (each of which is one mile in length) to be laid end-to-end with no gap between them, pinned to the ground at every other juncture, as shown below:
v_______ _______vv_______ _______v
Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""
Henry replies, ""The expansion will only be an inch over the whole mile length.  If the tracks buckle, it will only be by an inch or two at most.  The trains will certainly have no trouble bumping over these buckles.""
Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?",Would Pythagoras have the same plan?,"The rise in the middle of the tracks would have been much greater than Henry surmised.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse). SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

L = distance between two successive “pins” (places where the rail is fixed to the ground).  
Since Henry pins every other joint, the pins are 2 miles apart:

 L = 2 mi = 2·5280 ft = 10 560 ft.

Each mile of rail lengthens 1 inch when it gets hot, so two miles lengthen 2 inches:

 Δ = 2 in = 2/12 ft = 1/6 ft ≈ 0.166 7 ft.

Because the ends are fixed, the extra 0.166 7 ft cannot be taken up by sliding; the rail must buckle sideways (or upward) into a smooth curve.  For a long, shallow buckle the extra length Δ and the mid-height h of the bow are related (to second-order accuracy) by

 Δ ≈ (8 h²)/(3 L).               (derivable by writing the arc as a shallow parabola and integrating its length)

Solving for h:

 h² ≈ (3 L Δ)/8  
 h ≈ √[ (3)(10 560 ft)(1/6 ft) / 8 ]  
 h ≈ √(660 ft²) ≈ 25.7 ft.

So the track between two pins would hump upward or sideways by roughly 26 feet, not by “an inch or two.”  
A 26-foot high kink in the rail would certainly launch a locomotive off the track.

That huge buckle is why the boss instantly saw the design was impossible and fired Henry.

Final answer: the 2-inch thermal expansion in each 2-mile pinned span would force the rail to bow about 26 feet, a deformation that would catastrophically derail trains—far greater than the inch or two Henry imagined.",True,1,0

The area of ABCF is 96 square feet.
The area of DEGH is 32 square feet.
The area of CDH and EFG combined is 16 square feet. You will be able to complete these sections with 8 tiles each after cutting four of the tiles in half diagonally.
The total area is 144 square feet. Allowing 6 extra tiles for breakage brings the order to 150 tiles.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1.  Fix a convenient coordinate system  
• Let AB be the 16-foot section that rests against the house and place it on the x–axis.  
• Put A at (0, 0) and B at (16, 0).  
• AF is perpendicular to AB and 6 ft long, so F = (0, –6).  
• BC is parallel to AF and 6 ft long, so C = (16, –6).  
So far ABFC is a 16 ft × 6 ft rectangle.

Step 2.  Locate the points on FC  
FC is parallel to AB, hence horizontal.   
Take FG = HC = 4 ft, so  
 G = (4, –6) and H = (12, –6).

Step 3.  Use the 4-ft perpendicular drops  
EG is ⟂ FG and 4 ft long, DH is ⟂ HC and 4 ft long.  
Since FG and HC are horizontal, those 4-ft segments are vertical.  Dropping them downward (this gives the required 135° angles later) gives  
 E = (4, –10) and D = (12, –10).

Step 4.  Verify the two given 135° angles  
Vector CB = (0, 6), vector CD = (–4, –4)  
 cos∠BCD = (CB·CD)/(|CB||CD|) = (0·–4 + 6·–4)/(6·√32) = –24/33.94 = –0.7071 ⇒ ∠BCD = 135°.  
Vector FA = (0, 6), vector FE = (4, –4)  
 cos∠AFE = (0·4 + 6·–4)/(6·√32) = –24/33.94 = –0.7071 ⇒ ∠AFE = 135°.  
Thus all conditions are satisfied.

Step 5.  Coordinates of the hexagon  
A(0, 0), B(16, 0), C(16, –6), D(12, –10), E(4, –10), F(0, –6).

Step 6.  Area with the shoelace formula  
x  0   16   16   12    4    0  
y  0    0   –6   –10  –10  –6  

Σ(x_i y_{i+1}) = 0 – 96 – 160 – 120 – 24 + 0 = –400  
Σ(y_i x_{i+1}) = 0 + 0 – 72 – 40 + 0 + 0 = –112  

Area = ½|Σ(x_i y_{i+1}) – Σ(y_i x_{i+1})|  
      = ½|–400 – (–112)| = ½·288 = 144 ft².

Step 7.  Number of 1-ft² tiles  
Ideal number = 144.  
They buy 6 extra for breakage ⇒ 144 + 6 = 150 tiles.

a can be 1 to 6 and e 4 to 9, b can be 0 to 5 and d 4 to 9, each pair has 6 possibilities, and c has 10 possibilities.
Therefore, the original number has 6*6*10=360 different possibilities.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the original 5–digit number be  

N = abcde (a is the ten-thousands digit, e the units digit, all digits 0–9, with a≠0).  
Its reverse is  

R = edcba .

We are told that

R – N = 33957.

Write the subtraction digit-by-digit from right (units) to left (ten-thousands), keeping track of borrows:

          e   d   c   b   a
        – a   b   c   d   e
        -------------------
          3   3   9   5   7

1. Units column:
   a – e ≡ 7 (mod 10).  
   • If no borrow is taken, we would need a – e = 7, but then no later borrow would appear in the tens column and this soon proves impossible.  
   • Therefore a < e and we borrow 1: a + 10 – e = 7 → e – a = 3.  
     So e = a + 3, with a = 1,2,3,4,5,6 (since e ≤ 9).  
   Borrow₁ = 1.

2. Tens column:
   b – d – Borrow₁ must yield 5 after another borrow (because the hundreds column must produce 9 – see next step).  
   Hence b – d – 1 + 10 = 5 → b – d = –4 → d – b = 4, and Borrow₂ = 1.

3. Hundreds column:
   c – c – Borrow₂ = –1, so after adding 10 the digit is 9 and Borrow₃ = 1.  
   (This works for every c.)

4. Thousands column:
   d – b – Borrow₃ = (b + 4) – b – 1 = 3, which is non–negative, so Borrow₄ = 0.  
   This is satisfied for every pair (b,d) with d = b + 4.

5. Ten-thousands column:
   e – a – Borrow₄ = (a + 3) – a = 3, agreeing with the required digit 3.

Thus every choice of digits satisfying

a = 1,…,6,        e = a + 3  
b = 0,…,5,        d = b + 4  
c = 0,…,9

produces a valid subtraction.  The digits are independent within those ranges, so the number of possible original numbers is

141,"You have two identical ropes and three mice.  Each mouse bites off the rope at a different biting speed.  All three biting speeds are constant.
Mouse(A) bites off one rope in 60 minutes.
Mouse(B) bites off one rope in 90 minutes.
Mouse(C) bites off one rope in 180 minutes.
You do not have any time or distance measuring tools and the length of the rope is unknown.  How can you measure 75 minutes?",Set distance and time relations and equations,"Mark the two ropes as Rope(A) and Rope(B).
1. Let Mouse(A) and Mouse(C) start biting off Rope(A) at the same time, starting each from  one end (moving in opposite directions).  At the same time, let Mouse(B) start biting off Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(A) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X = S(A) * 60, where S(A) is biting speed for Mouse(A) and X is Rope(A) length
X = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X is Rope(A) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(A)/S(C) = 3:1, which means that for each 3 units Mouse(A) will move, Mouse (C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(A) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(A) bites off three times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides Rope(A) length in to 4 units.
Mouse(A) bitten off portion = 3/4 X (where X is Rope(A) length)
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/4 X
Finding the time spent before Rope(A) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(A) needs  60 minutes to bite off X, How many minutes are needed to bite off 3/4 X?
Minutes needed = 3/4 * 60 = 45 minutes are needed to fully bite off Rope(A) by Mouse(A) and Mouse(C).  At that point in time, Mouse(B) would have bitten off exactly half the length of Rope(B) (needing 90 minutes to bite off the full rope), and needs an additional 45 minutes to bite off the remaining rope half.
2. Let Mouse(B) continue biting off Rope(B) and make Mouse(C) start biting off the other end of Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(B) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X/2 = S(B) * 90, where S(B) is biting speed for Mouse(B) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
X/2 = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(B)/S(C) = 2:1, which means that for each 2 units Mouse(B) will move, Mouse(C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(B) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(B) bites off two times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides the remaining half of Rope(B) length to 3 units.
Mouse(B) bitten off portion = 2/3 * X/2 = X/3
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/3 * X/2 = X/6
Finding the time spent before the remaining half of Rope(B) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(B) needs  90 minutes to bite off X, how many minutes are needed to bite off X/3?
Minutes needed = 1/3 * 90 = 30 minutes are needed to fully bite off the remaining half of Rope(B) by Mouse(B) and Mouse(C).
At that point in time, 75 minutes would have passed (45 minutes consumed from biting off Rope(A) and another 30 minutes consumed from biting off Rope(B)).",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the length of each rope be 1 “rope-unit”.  
The constant biting speeds of the mice are therefore  

• Mouse A : 1 rope / 60 min = 1/60 rope-unit per minute  
• Mouse B : 1 rope / 90 min = 1/90 rope-unit per minute  
• Mouse C : 1 rope /180 min = 1/180 rope-unit per minute  

Step 1 – create a 45-minute clock tick  
• At time 0 give Rope 1 to Mouse A and Mouse C, one at each end.  
  Their combined eating rate is  
        1/60 + 1/180 = (3 + 1)/180 = 4/180 = 1/45 rope-unit per minute.  
• Therefore they finish the whole rope and meet after 45 minutes.  
  The moment Rope 1 disappears is an unmistakable signal that exactly 45 minutes have passed.

Step 2 – create a 30-minute clock tick  
• At the instant Rope 1 is gone (the 45-minute mark) put all three mice
  on the same end of Rope 2.  
  Their combined rate is  
        1/60 + 1/90 + 1/180 = (3 + 2 + 1)/180 = 6/180 = 1/30 rope-unit per minute.  
• Hence Rope 2 will be completely eaten in 30 minutes.

Step 3 – total time measured  
• First interval: 45 min (Rope 1).  
• Second interval: 30 min (Rope 2 with all three mice).  
• Total time from the start until Rope 2 vanishes: 45 min + 30 min = 75 minutes.

Thus the disappearance of the second rope gives a precise 75-minute time mark without using any clocks or rulers.

This contains nine ones, so it is divisible by 9, and two 0's at the end, so it is divisible by 25.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"To be a multiple of 225 a decimal number must be divisible by both 9 and 25.

1. Divisibility by 25  
   Since the digits may only be 0 or 1, the only possible ending that gives a factor 25 is “00”.  
   So the number must finish with two zeros.

2. Divisibility by 9  
   A decimal number is divisible by 9 when its digit–sum is a multiple of 9.  
   Because the only non-zero digit allowed is 1, the digit–sum is simply “number of 1’s”.  
   Hence the count of 1’s has to be 9, 18, 27, …; in particular, at least 9.

Remove the mandatory final “00”.  
Call the remaining part X.  
The whole number is then 100·X.

Because 100 ≡ 1 (mod 9), 100·X is divisible by 9 exactly when X itself is divisible by 9.  
So X must
 • consist solely of 0’s and 1’s, and  
 • contain a multiple of nine 1’s (at least nine).

The smallest such X clearly uses exactly nine 1’s and no other digits, i.e.

X = 111 111 111.

Finally, attach the two mandatory zeros:

N = 111 111 111 00 = 11 111 111 100.

Check:
 • Ends in 00  → divisible by 25.  
 • Digit-sum = 9  → divisible by 9.  
Therefore N is a multiple of 225, and no smaller multiple of 225 can be formed with only 0’s and 1’s.

We have  
4++8 = 20  
8++4 = 16  

Look for a simple arithmetic relation:

Let a++b = k.  
Try k = a + 2b:  
• 4 + 2·8 = 4 + 16 = 20 ✔  
• 8 + 2·4 = 8 + 8  = 16 ✔  

So the rule is   
a++b = a + 2b.

Step 2 – understand “**”  
We have  
3**5 = 27  
5**3 = 35  

Observe:

• 3 < 5 and 3³ = 27, so when the first number is smaller, “**” seems to cube the first number.  
• 5 > 3 and the result 35 is just the two numbers concatenated in reverse order (3 then 5).  

Hence the rule that fits both examples is  
If a < b : a**b = a³  
If a > b : a**b = concatenate(b,a)

Step 3 – evaluate 8**7  
Since 8 > 7, use the second branch:  
8**7 = concatenate(7,8) = 78.

Step 4 – evaluate (8**7)++9

    Both X and 11 X may not contain any digits outside the given set

2.  Counting digits  
    • There are 9 digits altogether.  
    • If X has n digits, 11 X has either n or n+1 digits.  
    • 2n = 9 (if both have n digits) is impossible, so 11 X must have n+1 digits.

      Therefore X is a 4-digit number and 11 X is a 5-digit number.

3.  Neither X nor 11 X may contain 0, 6, 8 or 9, because those digits are not in the list.

The only way to get a trailing zero is by multiplying a factor of 1000! which is 2 by a factor of 1000! which is 5. The modified problem is thus: How many such pairs of factors are there?
There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5. But in addition there are 40 = 1000/25 numbers which are multiples of 25, each of which gives one factor of five in addition to the one counted in the 200 and the one counted in the 40 above. Finally there is 1 = [1000/625] number which is a multiple of 625, this gives one further factor of 5. Thus there are exactly  200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249 factors of 5 in 1000! and since there are more than sufficient factors of 2, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"A trailing zero in a base-10 number comes from a factor 10 = 2 × 5.  
In 1000! there are far more factors 2 than 5, so the number of 10’s—and hence the number of trailing zeros—is determined by how many times 5 appears in the prime-factorization of 1000!.

Use Legendre’s formula:  
Exponent of 5 in n! = ⌊n/5⌋ + ⌊n/25⌋ + ⌊n/125⌋ + ⌊n/625⌋ + … (stop when the divisor exceeds n).

For n = 1000:

1. 100 riders start and all of them finish every one of the 14 stages.  
2. On every stage “Crazy” Charles is 93rd, i.e. exactly 92 riders finish in front of him and 7 riders finish behind him.  
3. The 7 riders who are behind him can be different from stage to stage.  
   • 7 riders × 14 stages = 98 “places-behind-Charles’’ altogether.  
   • There are 99 other riders in the race.  
   • By the pigeon-hole principle, at least 98 of those 99 riders must occupy a place behind Charles on at least one of the stages (only one rider can escape that fate).

Call that one rider who is never behind Charles the eventual winner.

Now choose a pattern of times that makes the story work.

• Let the first 93 riders of every stage (the winner, Charles, and the 91 cyclists in between) reach the finish almost together – say Charles is only 1 s slower than the stage winner.  
• Let every rider who happens to finish 94th–100th on a given day have a disaster (a puncture, a crash, a wrong turn) that costs him, say, 1 hour compared with Charles.

What does this do to the totals?

• Charles loses 1 s per stage to the winner ⇒ 14 s in all.  
• Every other rider except the winner is ahead of Charles on 13 stages (gaining at most 13 s) but has one catastrophic stage on which he loses a whole hour to Charles.  
  Net result: he is about 59 min 47 s slower than Charles overall.  
• The winner never has a bad stage, so he is 14 s quicker than Charles and takes first place.  
• Charles, having avoided a single disastrous day, is second even though he never cracked the top 90 on any individual stage.

Thus Charles’ unexciting but steady 93rd places keep him close to the front in time, while every other competitor except the champion suffers at least one huge time loss that drops him behind Charles in the general classification.

Final answer: Because only seven riders were ever slower than Charles on a stage, every other rider except one had to fall behind him on at least one stage; giving them a big time loss while Charles was always steady. The single rider who was never behind him became champion, and Charles’ consistency made his total time the second-best overall in spite of finishing 93rd in every stage.",True,1,0

It is given that during a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%.
Hence after a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 162 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)
(since B(1+Y) is the price during inflation and  B(1-Y)(1+Y) the price during the slowdown)
Therefore the decrease in price after one year
= B - B(1-Y^2)
= B - B + B*Y^2
= B*Y^2 = 162      ... Equation 1
Hence after another year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 147.42 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)(1-Y^2)
= B(1-Y^2)^2
(since B(1-Y^2) is the price at the end of the previous year and           B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y) the price during the slowdown this year)
Therefore the decrease in price this year
= B(1-Y^2) - B(1-Y^2)^2
= B(1-Y^2)[1 - (1-Y^2)]
= B(1-Y^2)( Y^2) = 147.42    ... Equation 2
Dividing Equation 2 by Equation 1, we get
(1-Y^2) = 0.91 => Y^2 = 0.09
Substituting the above value of Y^2 in equation 1, we get
B*0.09 = 162
Hence B = 162/0.09 = 1800 Roka.
Therefore the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

P₀ = original price of the bouquet (in Roka)  
Y % = rate by which the price is first increased and then decreased each year.

Effect of one year  
After an inflation followed by a slowdown the price is multiplied by  

k = (1 + Y/100)(1 − Y/100) = 1 − (Y/100)².

Hence after the first year the new price is P₀·k and the reduction during that year is  

P₀ − P₀·k = P₀(1 − k) = P₀·(Y/100)² = 162. (1)

During the second year the starting price is P₀·k, so the fall in that year equals  

P₀·k − P₀·k² = P₀·k(1 − k) = P₀·k·(Y/100)² = 147.42. (2)

Divide (2) by (1):

k = 147.42 / 162 = 0.91.

Now relate k to Y:

0.91 = 1 − (Y/100)²  
⇒ (Y/100)² = 1 − 0.91 = 0.09  
⇒ Y² = 0.09·10 000 = 900  
⇒ Y = 30.

Substitute Y² = 900 in (1):

P₀ · (900 / 10 000) = 162  
P₀ · 0.09 = 162  
P₀ = 162 / 0.09 = 1800.

151,"In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.
On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.
About this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, ""Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.""
Knowing Junior, we asked, ""How big a headache is your math gonna give us?""
She answered, ""I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.""
Name the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.",Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.,"Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.
After labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, ""Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof. First, I mark a line from A to D.  This creates a trapezoid (trapezium in Britain) ABCD.  Next, I mark the lines EH, BG, and CF.  These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.""
The partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's. (The second and third cuts can be made in reverse order.)

The pieces from two arrangements follow:
1) ABCD, DEFG, ADH, and DGH.
2) ABCD, EFGH, ADH, and DEH.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Junior’s answer:  a regular 9-gon (a regular nonagon).

How to cut it  
Label the vertices in order round the rim  

 A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I  

(so A follows I again).  
Make just two straight cuts.

1.  First cut the diagonal AD.  
 That removes the quadrilateral ABCD; we shall keep that as our first share.

2.  Second (and last) cut the diagonal DG inside the remaining piece.  
 That splits what is left into the quadrilateral DEFG and the pentagon D G H I A,
 giving the second and third shares at the same time.

So the three portions are  

 ABCD    DEFG    D G H I A .

Why the three pieces are equal (without trig, roots, etc.)  
Join the centre O of the nonagon to every vertex; this divides the whole figure
into nine congruent isosceles triangles

 ΔOAB, ΔOBC, ΔOCD, ΔODE, ΔOEF, ΔOFG, ΔOGH, ΔOHI, ΔOIA .

Each of those little triangles has the same area, call it S.

•  Quadrilateral ABCD consists of the three triangles  
 ΔOAB + ΔOBC + ΔOCD → area 3 S.

•  Quadrilateral DEFG consists of the three triangles  
 ΔODE + ΔOEF + ΔOFG → area 3 S.

•  Pentagon D G H I A consists of the three triangles  
 ΔOGH + ΔOHI + ΔOIA → area 3 S.

Thus every share has area 3 S, so the portions are exactly equal.

The first cut produced one finished portion;  
the second (last) cut produced the remaining two portions,

There is given:

When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.

Step 0 (4 calls, everybody 1…4).  
 (1) P1–P2    (2) P3–P4    (3) P1–P3    (4) P2–P4  
After the fourth call P1 and P2 already know the four original gossips, so for
n = 4 we are done with 2·4–4 = 4 calls.

Induction step.  
Suppose we have arranged that all of the first k people (k ≥ 4) know every
gossip and that, moreover, P1 and P2 are already “experts”.  Put in a new
person Pk+1 and do

 (5) Pk+1 – P1   (6) Pk+1 – P2 .

During (5) Pk+1 hands his own gossip to P1 and in return receives all that P1
knows; in (6) he obtains from P2 the only item he was still missing, so now
everybody 1…(k+1) is fully informed and P1 , P2 are still experts.

Thus every extra person costs exactly two extra calls; starting from the 4-person
core we need

 4 + 2(n–4) = 2n – 4

calls in total.  Consequently

 g(n) ≤ 2n – 4  for every n ≥ 4.  (1)

PART  2 – 2n–4 calls are really necessary  
Take any complete gossiping schedule that uses the minimum possible number of
calls and look at its very last call.  Denote the participants of that call by
A and B.

Immediately before that final conversation A is still missing something
(otherwise the programme would have finished earlier), whereas B already knows
every gossip (otherwise the last call would still leave somebody uninformed).
So the situation just before the last call is

 B already knows all n pieces, A still lacks B’s own gossip.

Because A and B never spoke before that moment (if they had, A would already
know B’s message), B must have learnt A’s gossip along some chain of people
that starts with A and ends with B but does not contain the edge AB.  Such a
chain has to pass through every one of the other n–2 people – no one may be
skipped, for otherwise that person would finish without ever hearing A’s
message.  Hence at least n–2 distinct calls were required in which either A or
B occurred before the last call delivered AB itself.

The same argument may be read backwards in time: to get B’s gossip from B to A
needs another n–2 calls that involve A or B, and the only call the two groups
can possibly have in common is the last call AB.  Consequently the total number
of calls is at least

 (n–2) + (n–2) = 2n – 4.

Thus

 g(n) ≥ 2n – 4  for every n ≥ 4.  (2)

Combining (1) and (2) we have proved

 g(n) = 2n – 4  for all n ≥ 4.

FINAL TABLE  
n = 1 0 calls  
n = 2 1 call  
n = 3 3 calls  
n ≥ 4 2n – 4 calls.

Final answer: for n ≥ 4 the minimum is 2n − 4 calls (with the exceptional
values g(1)=0, g(2)=1, g(3)=3).",True,1,0

??? x 3? = ????",1?? x 3? = ?254,186 x 39 = 7254,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-1.  Form of the numbers  
Let the three–digit number be ABC, the two–digit multiplier be 3D and the four–digit product be EFGH.  
So       ABC × 3D = EFGH,  
and the nine symbols A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H plus the 3 must be the digits 1-9 exactly once.

Step-2.  Size restrictions  
3D is between 31 and 39, so  
EFGH = ABC × (30+D) < 10 000  
⇒ ABC < 10 000 ⁄ (30+D) ≤ 322.  
Hence ABC is at most 322.

Step-3.  Digit restrictions  
Because the 3 in 3D is already used, no other number may contain a 3.  
Thus 3 ∉ {A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H}.  
Likewise, no digit may repeat anywhere.

Step-4.  Try the possible multipliers

D = 1  (31) → product must contain no 0,1,3; ABC ≤ 322  
D = 2  (32) → product must contain no 0,2,3; ABC ≤ 312  
…  
D = 9  (39) → product must contain no 0,3,9; ABC ≤ 256  

Because the search space is now small we can inspect the multiples mentally (or on a scrap of paper).

Step-5.  Inspect the case 3D = 39  
List the 39-multiples of the admissible three–digit numbers (no 3 or 9 inside, ≤256) until a four-digit product with no 0,3,9 and no repeated digits appears.

39 × 104 = 4056  (contains 0)  
39 × 108 = 4212  (digit 2 repeats)  
39 × 114 = 4446  (digit 4 repeats)  
39 × 118 = 4602  (contains 0)  
39 × 126 = 4914  (digit 1 repeats later)  
39 × 132 = 5148  (contains 3)  
…  
39 × 186 = 7254  ← perfect!

7254 has digits 7,2,5,4 – all different and none are 0,3,9.  
ABC = 186 uses 1,8,6 – again all different and none overlap 7,2,5,4 or 3,9.

Step-6.  Verify completeness  
Digits used:

ABC   : 1 8 6  
3D    : 3 9

Step 1.  Assign to every person Pᵢ a number  
dᵢ = “how many people Pᵢ knows (counting himself / herself).”

Because everybody knows himself / herself, 1 ≤ dᵢ ≤ n for every i.

Step 2.  Observe that the acquaintance relation is symmetric:  
if Pᵢ knows Pⱼ, then Pⱼ knows Pᵢ.

Step 3.  Show that the extreme values 1 and n cannot occur simultaneously.

• Suppose some person A knows n people (so d(A)=n).  
  Then A knows everyone, in particular any person B who might know only himself.

(i)  Time T₂ :  the moment when Alf was half of Bert’s age  

      Let x be the number of years ago that happened.  
      Then     A – x = ½ (B – x)  
               ⇒ x = 2A – B.                      …(1)

(ii) Bert’s age at time T₂ :  B – x.

(iii)  Bert’s father’s age when he was six times that age:  
      6(B – x).

(iv)  Thirty years before that, father’s age would have been  
      6(B – x) – 30.

(v)   Half of that is 3(B – x) – 15.

(vi)  Alf says that at the “quarter-age” moment (3A/4 years ago)

      Bert’s age = A/4  +  [ 3(B – x) – 15 ].      …(2)

But Bert’s age 3A/4 years ago is B – 3A/4, so (2) gives

        B – 3A/4 = A/4 + 3(B – x) – 15.

Put x from (1) into this and simplify:

        B – ¾A = ¼A + 3(B – 2A + B) – 15
        B – ¾A = ¼A + 3(2B – 2A) – 15
        B – ¾A = ¼A + 6B – 6A – 15
        B – ¾A = –23/4 A + 6B – 15
        5A – 5B + 15 = 0
        ⇒ A – B + 3 = 0
        ⇒ B = A + 3.                             …(3)

So Bert is always three years older than Alf.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  The prime–age condition at their last meeting
--------------------------------------------------------------------
At the last meeting both ages were prime and differed by 3.

The only pair of primes that differ by 3 is 2 and 5:

        P = 2, Q = 5.

Therefore at the last meeting

        Alf was 2 and Bert was 5.                …(4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Consistency check
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Let the present ages be A and A + 3.  
From (4) the elapsed time is t = A – 2.

All the intermediate times in the story are whole numbers if A is a
multiple of 4 (so that ¾A is integral), and Bert’s father’s ages can
always be chosen to make the “six-times” clause true, so the story is
self-consistent for any such A ≥ 4.  Nothing else in the puzzle fixes
A itself; what the question actually asks for is only the ages “the
last time they met”, and those are uniquely determined.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer

Alf was 2 years old and Bert was 5 years old the last time they met.

166,"Your assignment is to make a delivery from the depot to your base camp, 1600 miles away. The trip begins normally, but unfortunately, halfway to base camp, your supply truck breaks down. You have no way to call for help. Luckily, in addition to medical supplies, the truck is carrying a Desert Patrol Vehicle (DPV) and two barrels of fuel.
The DPV has a full 10 gallon tank, but to make room for the medical supplies, it can only carry one of the 45 gallon barrels at a time. While you can't transfer fuel between barrels, you can refill the tank from the barrels. Assume the DPV can get 12 miles per gallon, regardless of the load it carries.
How far can you go? Is it far enough to deliver the medical supplies and the DPV to your base camp?","Use half of a tank to carry one barrel, then return for the other.","You can travel 840 miles from the broken supply truck. Since your base camp is 800 miles away (half of 1600 miles), you can easily complete the delivery. Here's how:
Although you can only carry one barrel at a time, you need to transport both of them until one barrel is empty. F is the barrel used first, and L is the barrel used last.
Use half of a tank (5 gallons) to carry L 5*12=60 miles, and then return for F (uses another 5 gallons). Refill the tank from F and carry it to where you left L (also uses 5 gallons). Refill the tank again from F and switch barrels. Now you are 60 miles from the broken truck, the tank and L are full, but F is down to 30 gallons (45-5-5-5=30). Repeat this procedure two times.
Now you are 60*3=180 miles from the broken truck. The tank and L are still full, but F is empty. Leave F behind and make a run for it, carrying L. Refill the tank from L as needed. There are 55 gallons of fuel left so you can travel an additional 55*12=660 miles, for a maximum of (180+660) 840 miles.  Since you only have a total of 800 miles to go, you will make it to your base camp.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the breakdown point be mile 0 and the base camp be mile 800.  
The DPV tank holds at most 10 gal ⇒ one‐tank range = 10 gal × 12 mpg = 120 mi.  
Because the tank must still get us home after any “out-and-back” ferry trip, the
furthest we may go before turning round is one-half of 120 mi, i.e. 60 mi.
We therefore move our fuel forward in 60-mile stages.

Notation  
T = fuel in the DPV tank (max 10 gal)  
B1 , B2 = fuel in the two 45-gal barrels  
All figures below are “gallons on the ground” at the indicated point.

STAGE 0   (at mile 0 : start)            T = 10     B1 = 45     B2 = 45      (total = 100)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE 1   move everything to mile 60

1. Take B1 to 60 mi.  60 mi costs 5 gal (from the tank).  
   Leave B1, return empty: another 5 gal.  The original 10 gal in the tank is now gone.

2. Refill the tank (10 gal) from B2, drive B2 to mile 60 (5 gal).  
   Fuel now sitting at mile 60:

    T =  5     B1 = 45     B2 = 35                                         (total = 85)

Exactly 15 gal have been spent in this first 60-mile transfer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE 2   move everything to mile 120 (repeat the same manoeuvre)

1. Top the tank up to 10 gal with 5 gal from B2 (B2→30).  
   Carry B1 to mile 120 (cost 5 gal), leave it there, return empty (5 gal).

2. At mile 60 the tank is empty; refill to 10 gal from B2 (B2→20) and carry B2 to mile 120 (cost 5 gal).

Fuel now at mile 120:

    T =  5     B1 = 45     B2 = 20                                         (total = 70)

Another 15 gal have been used; cumulative expenditure 30 gal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE 3   move everything to mile 180 (one more repetition)

1. Top tank to 10 gal with 5 gal from B2 (B2→15).  
   Take B1 to mile 180 (5 gal), return empty (5 gal).

2. Refill tank to 10 gal from B2 (B2→ 5) and take B2 to mile 180 (5 gal).

Fuel now at mile 180:

    T =  5     B1 = 45     B2 =   5                                        (total = 55)

A third 15-gallon loss; total fuel spent so far 45 gal, fuel remaining 55 gal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FINAL RUN   mile 180 → mile 800    (distance 620 mi)

The empty second barrel is discarded; its remaining 5 gal are poured into the
tank so that we start with

    T = 10     B1 = 45                                                     (total = 55)

Fuel required for 620 mi = 620 mi / 12 mpg = 51 2⁄3 gal.

Because 55 gal > 51 2⁄3 gal, the DPV reaches base camp with

55 − 51 2⁄3 = 3 1⁄3 gal still left (enough for another 40 mi).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESULT

By shuttling the barrels forward in 60-mile steps (three such steps are
enough), you can cover the entire 800-mile half-trip.  The DPV, the medical
supplies, and a little fuel to spare all arrive safely at base camp.

Final answer: Yes – with the described three-stage shuttle you reach base camp 800 miles away, arriving with about 3.3 gallons (≈40 miles) of fuel still left.",True,1,0

Suppose the sum has k consecutive terms and starts with a:

n = a + (a+1) + (a+2) + … + (a+k-1).

This is an arithmetic-series sum:

n = k(2a + k − 1)/2 ⟺ 2n = k(2a + k − 1).

Thus k must be a divisor of 2n.  
Write k = d.  Then

2a + k − 1 = 2n/k = 2n/d.

Because 2a + k − 1 is an odd integer, k and 2n/k must have opposite parities.  
Choosing d to be any odd divisor (>1) of n automatically satisfies this parity condition (k odd, 2n/k even), and then a = (n/d) − (d − 1)/2 is a non-negative integer provided d ≤ 2n. Therefore

A positive integer n can be expressed as a sum of ≥2 consecutive integers ⇔ n has an odd divisor > 1.

Exactly the numbers with no odd divisor >1 are the powers of 2.

Now examine 1000 ≤ n ≤ 2000.

Powers of 2 in that interval:  
2^9 = 512 (too small)  
2^10 = 1024 (in range)  
2^11 = 2048 (too large)

Hence 1024 is the only power of 2 between 1000 and 2000, and therefore the only integer in that interval lacking an odd divisor >1—so it is the sole number that cannot be written as a sum of consecutive non-negative integers.

169,"Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.
We were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?",Find numbers who do not have a duplicate that will be deleted,"It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.
Hence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.
Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90. These 90 id's will not have a corresponding number when written in reverse order.
Secondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order. For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.
Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.
Therefore total number of valid employee id's possible = 90 + 90 + 360 = 540.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Think of every admissible badge number as a string abc where  

• a ≠ 0  (hundreds digit, because the badge must be a true 3-digit number)  
• b, c ∈ {0,…,9}.  

Write R(abc)=cba, the number obtained by reversing the digits.  
The company’s rule is: never issue two different badges x and y with R(x)=y.  
Hence we may issue at most one badge from every “reverse-equivalence class”.  
A class can contain  

• just one badge (size 1) – either because the badge is a palindrome (R(x)=x) or because its reverse is not itself a valid 3-digit badge, or  

• a pair of two different badges (size 2) whose reverses are each other.  

Counting these classes will give the maximum possible number of employees.

Step 1.  Separate the badges whose reverse is invalid.  
A reverse is invalid exactly when the units digit c is 0, because then R(abc)=0ba starts with 0.  

There are 9 choices for a (1–9) and 10 choices for b, so  

badges with c=0   ⇒  9·10 = 90 numbers.  
Each of these 90 forms a class of size 1.

Step 2.  Consider the remaining badges (c≠0).  
They total 900−90 = 810 numbers (9·10·9).  
Among these  

• Palindromes (a=c) : 9 choices for a (1–9) and 10 for b ⇒ 9·10 = 90 numbers.  
  Each is a singleton class (size 1).  

• Non-palindromes (a≠c) : the rest.  
  Count = 810 − 90 = 720 numbers.  
  They come in unordered pairs {abc, cba}, so they form 720/2 = 360 classes.

Step 3.  Total number of reverse-equivalence classes

We are told that adding or multiplying them gives the same total:

Introduce the reciprocals x = 5.70⁄a , y = 5.70⁄b , z = 5.70⁄c.  
Then a = 5.70⁄x , b = 5.70⁄y , c = 5.70⁄z.

Using (1):

• Sum: a + b + c = 5.70 ⇒ 5.70(1/x + 1/y + 1/z) = 5.70 ⇒ 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1. (2)

• Product: abc = 5.70 ⇒ (5.70)³ / (xyz) = 5.70 ⇒ xyz = (5.70)² = 32.49. (3)

Therefore we need

 ⇒ 1/z = 1/2 − 1/y  
 ⇒ z = 1 / (½ − 1/y) = 2y / (y − 2). (4)

Insert (4) into (3):

x y z = 2 · y · (2y)/(y − 2) = 4y² /(y − 2) = 32.49.

Solve 4y² − 32.49y + 64.98 = 0

(The two roots simply interchange y and z.)  
Take y = 57/16 = 3.5625.  From (4),

z = 2y /(y − 2) = 2·(57/16) / ((57/16) − 2) = 114/25 = 4.56.

Thus (x, y, z) = (2, 57/16, 114/25).

Step 3 – Return to the prices  
a = 5.70 / x = 5.70 / 2 = 2.85  
b = 5.70 / y = 5.70 / (57/16) = 16/10 = 1.60  
c = 5.70 / z = 5.70 / (114/25) = 25/20 = 1.25

Step 4 – Check  
Sum: 2.85 + 1.60 + 1.25 = 5.70.  
Product: 2.85 × 1.60 × 1.25 = 4.56 × 1.25 = 5.70.

Both conditions are satisfied with exact two–decimal–place prices.

Therefore the total number of axis-aligned rectangles, including all squares, is  
210 × 55 = 11 550.

This is already the “combined figure” of squares and rectangles, because every square is among those rectangles.

If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.
If N=5 and A=1, then E=9. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
If N=2 and A=4, then E=6. R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.
If N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.
If N=2, then since R cannot be 5, R=8, L=5, and I=7.
If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.
Since 1+S+T equals 5 or 15, S+T equals 4 or 14. If S+T=14, then S and T must be 5 and 9, or 6 and 8, in some order. But each of our three scenarios has a letter for at least one of 5 and 9, as well as one for 8. So S+T=4, S and T are 1 and 3 in some order, and O+S=12.
If S=1, then O=11. But since each letter represents only one digit, S=3, T=1, and O=9.

Work column by column (units on the right).

1. Units: R + L = 3 (mod 10).  
   The only way to get digit 3 with a carry is R + L = 13 (carry 1).  
   Hence {R,L} is one of {4,9},{5,8},{6,7},{7,6},{8,5},{9,4} and c₁=1.

2. Tens: E + A + c₁ = 1 (mod 10) with c₁=1.  
   Therefore E + A = 10 and c₂=1.

3. Hundreds: I + R + c₂ = 6 (mod 10) with c₂=1.  
   So I + R = 5 (carry 0) or 15 (carry 1).  
   Since R≥4, only the 15-case works, giving I = 15 − R and c₃=1.

4. Thousands: S + T + c₃ = 5 (mod 10) with c₃=1.  
   Hence S + T = 4 (carry 0) or 14 (carry 1).

5. Ten-thousands: O + S + c₄ = 2 (mod 10).  
   Only the 12-case works, so O + S = 12 (if c₄=0) or 11 (if c₄=1), and c₅=1.

Of that list, 33 is the only number that contains a 3 as the second digit and so for criterion 3 to be satisfied, 3 can only appear at the start of the 5-digit numbers.  From there it is simply a matter of choosing the next digits using the list above so that criterion 2 is satisfied, making sure that criterion 3 is also satisfied.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"First collect the facts that follow from the three stated conditions.

1.  The only digits we may use are the prime digits  
   P = {2, 3, 5, 7}.

2.  For every adjacent pair of digits (a,b) the two–digit number 10a+b must be composite (i.e. “not prime”).

   List all 16 possible pairs built from P and keep the ones that are prime:

      23, 37, 53, 73  are prime.  

   Hence the four forbidden directed pairs are
      2→3 , 3→7 , 5→3 , 7→3 .

   All other pairs of prime digits are allowed.

3.  Every digit 2, 3, 5, 7 must occur at least once in the five–digit number, so exactly one of them will appear twice.

-------------------------------------------------
Key consequence about the digit 3
-------------------------------------------------
Because the only digits that may precede a digit 3 are in P
and 2→3, 5→3, 7→3 are forbidden, the ONLY allowed predecessor
for a 3 is another 3.  Therefore

 • the first time a 3 appears it must be in the very first
   position of the number, and
 • all 3’s (if more than one) form one contiguous block
   beginning at the left end.

Consequently the first digit is forced to be 3 in every
feasible five–digit number.

In addition, digits 3 and 7 are never allowed to be adjacent
in either order, so the digit immediately following the
initial block of 3’s cannot be 7.

From now on no more 3’s are allowed to appear.

-------------------------------------------------
Building the smallest number
-------------------------------------------------
We want the left-most digits to be as small as possible.

 • 1st digit: forced to be 3.  
 • 2nd digit: the smallest digit that may follow 3 is 2
   (pair 32 is composite).  
 • 3rd digit: we still need a 5 and a 7 somewhere; the
   smallest digit that is not forbidden here is again 2
   (pair 22 is composite).  
 • 4th digit: we must reserve one of the remaining places
   for the still-missing 7, so we put 5 here (pair 25 is
   composite).  
 • 5th digit: put the required 7 (pair 57 is composite).

Number obtained: 3 2 2 5 7

Checks:
 32, 22, 25, 57 are all composite, and the set of digits is
 {2,3,5,7}.  
Any change that tries to lower a digit earlier in the number
is impossible (1st digit fixed to 3, 2nd digit already the
minimum 2, 3rd digit already the minimum 2 while still
leaving room for both 5 and 7).  
Hence

   Smallest permissible number = 32257.

-------------------------------------------------
Building the largest number
-------------------------------------------------
Now make the left-most digits as large as possible.

 • 1st digit: again must be 3.  
 • 2nd digit: 7 is forbidden (37 is prime), so choose the
   largest allowed follower, 5 (pair 35 is composite).  
 • 3rd digit: choose 7 (largest digit, pair 57 composite).  
 • 4th digit: we still need a 2 somewhere; keep the digit as
   large as possible now, so take another 7 (pair 77
   composite).  
 • 5th digit: place the required 2 (pair 72 composite).

Number obtained: 3 5 7 7 2

Checks:
 35, 57, 77, 72 are all composite, and every prime digit

The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""

Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).

But (3) for the next index gives

Rᵢ = 7S − 6(i + 1).                                (5)

Equate (4) and (5):

6(S − i) = 7S − 6(i + 1)

i = 5 R₄ = 12

Among the two-digit primes that contain 6 we have 61 and 67.  
Choosing 61 (digits 6 and 1) is convenient because it leaves the single 7 still unused.

Step 2.  Supply the single 7.  
Use the prime 47 (digits 4 and 7).

Step 3.  Supply the two required 4’s.  
We already have one 4 from 47; add 41 (digits 4 and 1) to supply the second 4.

Step 4.  Supply the two required 5’s.  
The only available primes with 5 and allowed digits are 53 and 59, so include both.

Step 5.  Supply the two required 2’s.  
Use the primes 23 and 29 (each contributes one 2).

Now list the chosen primes and verify the digit counts.

61  → 6,1  
47  → 4,7  
41  → 4,1  
53  → 5,3  
59  → 5,9  
23  → 2,3  
29  → 2,9  

Counting digits:

1: 2  2: 2  3: 2  4: 2  5: 2  6: 1  7: 1  9: 2

All counts match the required multiset, and the seven primes are distinct.

Step 6.  Add the primes:

61 + 47 + 41 + 53 + 59 + 23 + 29  
= 84  
+ 41 = 125  
+ 53 = 178  
+ 59 = 237  
+ 29 = 266  
+ 47 = 313

If you created a circle with points A, B, and O on it, since angle AOB is a right angle, line AB is the diameter of this circle.  Therefore, arc AB would be 180 degrees if it actually were to intersect O as well as A and B.
However, the problem says the arc can only intersect A and B. To do this, the circle must be slightly larger than the one described above. As stated in the problem, the larger arc must be the next largest integer size, which is 181 degrees.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the two given perpendicular lines be denoted by ℓ₁ (= AO) and ℓ₂ (= BO), intersecting at O.

1.  If a circle meets an entire line in only one point, that line must be a tangent.  
    Therefore ℓ₁ is tangent to the circle at A and ℓ₂ is tangent at B.

2.  A radius drawn to a point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line.  
    Hence the radius CA is perpendicular to ℓ₁, while the radius CB is perpendicular to ℓ₂.

3.  Because ℓ₁ ⟂ ℓ₂, the directions perpendicular to them are themselves perpendicular:  
        CA ⟂ CB.

4.  Therefore the central angle ∠ACB is 90°.

Translate the statements:

2nd quarter: points scored = S₂ – S₁ = ½S₂ – 1  
3rd quarter: points scored = S₃ – S₂ = ⅓S₃ – 2

Kurt finally gave in, and agreed to go in with Rod on a minimum special order of the multi-colored treats.  When the box arrived, they divided the bounty as originally planned.
""Interesting,"" Kurt noted, ""that the number of Rnkfurers you got is the same integer as my percentage.""
Rod did a little mental math.  ""You're right,"" he noted, ""and I think that's the lowest pair of integers we could do that with.""
""Maybe; the next largest set is trivial.  50 Rnkfurers each, and then we'd each have the percentage the other guy got: 50% and 50 Rnkfurers each.""
Kurt unwrapped a Rnkfurer and took his first bite.  He glowed with pleasure for half a minute, and then spoke quietly.
""Rod, how many of these in a case?""
""Fifty.""
""I think we'd better order a few.  And this time, it's my turn to get more than you do.""
""Well, we can still arrange it so the number I get is your percentage of the total.""
Kurt did a little mental math this time.  ""Yeah, that's right.  I can't fit more than 100 in my desk at school, so this will do the trick.""
How many did each boy get each time?","Although there are a dozen pairs of numbers that satisfy the percentage condition, the three used in the story are the only ones in which each boy gets fewer than 100 Rnkfurers.","1st order: Rod 20, Kurt  5.  Kurt has 20% of the total.
2nd order: Rod 60, Kurt 90.  Kurt has 60% of the total.
The equation to satisfy is
R = 100*K / (R+K)
where R and K are both integers.
Another way to look at this is
K = R*R/(100-R)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 R = number Rod gets  
 K = number Kurt gets  
 T = R + K = total number in the order  
 p = Kurt’s percentage of the total (an integer, written as p %).  

The boys insist on the condition  

 R = p  and  p % of T = K.  

Translated algebraically:

 K = pT / 100  and  R = p.  

Substituting K = T – R gives  

 T – p = (p/100) T  
 100(T – p) = pT  
 T(100 – p) = 100p  
 T = 100p /(100 – p).  (1)

FIRST ORDER (“minimum special order”)

We want the smallest positive integer p for which T is an integer.

Write d = 100 – p (so 1 ≤ d ≤ 99, p = 100 – d).  
Then (1) becomes  

 T = 100 (100 – d)/d = 10000/d – 100.  

Thus T is integral iff d divides 10000.  
Testing d = 99, 98, … gives the first divisor at d = 80 (p = 20):

 d = 80 ⇒ p = 20  
 T = 10000/80 – 100 = 25.  

Hence

 Rod: R = p = 20  
 Kurt: K = T – R = 5  
 Kurt’s percentage = 5/25 · 100% = 20 %.  

This pair (20, 20 %) is indeed the smallest possible; the next one (p = 50) is the “trivial” 50-50 split the boys mention.

SECOND ORDER (whole cases of 50, Kurt wants more)

Now T must be a multiple of 50, say T = 50c (c cases), and Kurt must get more than Rod but no more than 100:

 K > R  and  K ≤ 100.

Put T = 50c into (1):

 50c = 100p /(100 – p)  
 c = 2p /(100 – p).  (2)

For c to be an integer, 100 – p must divide 2p.  
Let again d = 100 – p.  Then (2) is  

 c = (200 – 2d)/d = 200/d – 2,

so d must divide 200.  The divisors of 200 below 100 are

 d = 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50.

Compute the corresponding p, c, T, K:

d  p=100–d  c=200/d–2  T=50c  K=T–p

Only d = 40 (p = 60) satisfies K ≤ 100 and K > R.

1.  From the fourth relation  F × A = C.  
    All letters are digits 1–8 and are distinct, so F·A must be a single digit ≤ 8.

    Trying possibilities:

        F=2  →  A=3 ⇒ C=6 or A=4 ⇒ C=8
        F=3  →  A=2 ⇒ C=6
        F=4  →  A=2 ⇒ C=8

    (Other F give duplicate digits or products > 8.)  
    We must test these four (F,A,C) triples in the first equation.

2.  First equation  (FA) × A = CF :

        (F,A,C) = (2,3,6): 23×3 = 69  ≠ 62
        (2,4,8):           24×4 = 96  ≠ 82
        (3,2,6):           32×2 = 64  ≠ 63
        (4,2,8):           42×2 = 84  = 84 ✔

    So the correct choice is  F=4, A=2, C=8.

3.  Second equation  (DG) × A = BA with A=2.

        2·(10D+G) = 10B + 2
        ⇒ 10D + G – 1 = 5B
        ⇒ G ≡ 1 (mod 5).  Hence G = 1 or 6 (unused so far).

        • If G = 1:
              B = (10D+1–1)/5 = 2D.
              To keep B ≤ 8, D must be 3 (since 1,2,4,8 are taken).
              Then B = 6.  This gives DG = 31 and BA = 62, and
              31×2 = 62 ✔.

        • If G = 6:
              (10D+6–1)/5 = (10D+5)/5 = 2D+1 must be a digit ≤ 8,
              which forces D ≤ 3.  But D=3 gives B=7 which clashes
              with uniqueness once H,E are considered; moreover
              36×2 = 72 ends in 2 but B would be 7, not 7.  Thus
              G=6 is impossible.

        Therefore  D=3, G=1, B=6.

4.  Third equation  H × E = DH with D=3, digits remaining {5,7}.

        • Take H = 5, E = 7: 5×7 = 35 = DH (D=3, H=5) ✔.
        • The other ordering (H=7,E=5) gives 7×5 = 35 ≠ 37.

        Hence H = 5, E = 7.

5.  All digits 1–8 are now assigned uniquely:

        A = 2
        B = 6

        E = 7

1. A classical fact: for a fixed sum, the product of positive numbers is maximized when all summands are equal and close to the number e≈2.718…  Among integers this pushes us toward using as many 3’s as possible, because  
   • 3 gives more product per unit of sum than 4 or higher (for instance, 2·2·2 = 8 > 3·3 = 9 shows 3’s beat mixing with 4’s or 5’s),  
   • 2’s are necessary only to take care of remainders.

2. Split 20 by 3’s:  
   20 = 3·6 + 2.  
   So six 3’s and one 2 give the sum 20: 3+3+3+3+3+3+2.

3. Product of that partition:  
   3^6 · 2 = 729 · 2 = 1458.

4. Check the two possible exceptional cases:  
   • If the remainder were 1, we would replace one 3+1 by 2+2. (Not needed here; our remainder is 2.)  
   • Any partition containing 4 or more reduces to mixtures of 2’s and 3’s whose product is smaller. For example, replacing one 3+3 (sum 6, product 9) by a single 6 (product 6) decreases the total product. Likewise, 4’s give 4 instead of 2·2 = 4, never improving the product.

Therefore no other integer partition of 20 can beat 1458.

Call the product 5X the 5-digit number EFGHI.

Step-by-step constraints

1. Unit–digit constraint  
   5 × D must end in a digit I that is one of 1-9 and not 0.  
   5×(even) ends with 0, so D must be odd.  
   Furthermore I must be 5 (the only non-zero last digit obtainable with factor 5).  
   Hence: I = 5 and D ∈ {1,3,7,9}.  
   Digit 5 is now used up, so 5 may not appear anywhere else.

2. Carry from the unit’s multiplication  
   Let k₁ = ⌊5D/10⌋.

   D  | 5D | I | k₁
   1  |  5 | 5 | 0
   3  | 15 | 5 | 1
   7  | 35 | 5 | 3
   9  | 45 | 5 | 4

   We will test D = 7 (k₁ = 3) in what follows; the other cases can be dismissed similarly or lead to duplication later.

3. Tens place  
   Compute 5C + k₁.  We need this to be ≥10 (otherwise the next carry would be 0 and the hundreds digit would inevitably be 0 or 5, impossible).  
   With k₁ = 3 the smallest C that works is 2.

   C = 2 → 5·2 + 3 = 13  
   Tens digit H = 3, new carry k₂ = 1.  
   Digits used so far: D=7, C=2, I=5, H=3.

4. Hundreds place  
   Compute 5B + k₂ = 5B + 1.  
   To avoid a units digit 0 or 5 we need B even (then 5B ends with 0, plus 1 gives 1).

   Choose B = 6 → 5·6 + 1 = 31  
   Hundreds digit G = 1, new carry k₃ = 3.  
   Digits used so far: 7,2,5,3,6,1 (all different).

5. Thousands & ten-thousands places  
   Compute 5A + k₃ = 5A + 3, which must be a two-digit number, both digits new and ≠0,5.

   Try A = 9 → 5·9 + 3 = 48.  
   So F = 8 (thousands digit), E = 4 (ten-thousands digit).

When using this method, we can calculate that the final number of watermelons is 140.

Over a 1-km strip the camel must:

• walk forward once for every load he has to take, and

2 n – 1   watermelons per kilometre.

189,"A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 L = length of the bridge (km)  
 v = man’s running speed (km/h)  
 D = initial distance of the train from point A when the man first hears it (km)

The man is 3⁄8 L from A and 5⁄8 L from B.

1. If he runs back to A  
 Time taken by the man: t₁ = (3⁄8 L) / v  
 Time taken by the train to reach A: t₁ = D / 80  
 ⇒ (3L)/(8v) = D/80  ……(i)

2. If he runs forward to B  
 Time taken by the man: t₂ = (5⁄8 L) / v  
 The train must cover D + L to reach B, so  
 Time for the train: t₂ = (D + L) / 80  
 ⇒ (5L)/(8v) = (D + L)/80 ……(ii)

Solve (i) for D:  
 D = 80·(3L/8v) = 30L / v.

Substitute this D into (ii):

 (5L)/(8v) = (30L/v + L)/80  
Multiply both sides by 80:  
 50L / v = 30L / v + L  
Subtract 30L / v:  
 20L / v = L  
Divide by L (non-zero):

It is given that the total number of games that men played between themselves exceeded those played by men with women by 18.
Hence
N*(N-1)/2 - 4*N = 18
N*(N-1) - 8*N = 36
N*N - N - 8*N = 36

Translate each sentence into a logical implication.

1. If n is NOT a multiple of 4  ⇒  60 ≤ n ≤ 69.  
2. If n IS a multiple of 3      ⇒  50 ≤ n ≤ 59.  
3. If n is NOT a multiple of 6  ⇒  70 ≤ n ≤ 79.

We must find a single n that makes all three implications true.

Step 1.  Eliminate the impossible combination “not multiple of 4” AND “not multiple of 6”.  
• If n were not a multiple of 4, (1) would force 60 ≤ n ≤ 69.  
• If n were also not a multiple of 6, (3) would simultaneously force 70 ≤ n ≤ 79.  
These two intervals do not overlap, so n cannot be “not multiple of 4” and “not multiple of 6” at the same time.

Hence at least one of the following must be true:
(a) n is a multiple of 4,  or  
(b) n is a multiple of 6.

We analyse both possibilities.

----------------------------------------------------
Case A.  n is a multiple of 4
----------------------------------------------------
A1.  Suppose n is also a multiple of 6.  
      Then n is a multiple of lcm(4,6)=12.  
      Being a multiple of 3, condition (2) applies: n must lie between 50 and 59.  
      No multiple of 12 lies in 50–59 (48 and 60 are the nearest), so this sub-case is impossible.

A2.  Suppose n is NOT a multiple of 6.  
      Then condition (3) applies, so 70 ≤ n ≤ 79.  
      Because n is a multiple of 4, list the multiples of 4 in 70–79: 72, 76.  
      • 72 is divisible by 6, contradicting “not a multiple of 6”.  
      • 76 is not divisible by 3, hence not by 6.  It survives.

      Check the other conditions for n = 76:  
      – It is a multiple of 4, so condition (1) is vacuously true.  
      – It is not a multiple of 3, so condition (2) is vacuously true.  
      – It is indeed between 70 and 79 as required by condition (3).

      Therefore n = 76 satisfies all three statements.

----------------------------------------------------
Case B.  n is NOT a multiple of 4   (so 60 ≤ n ≤ 69 by condition 1)
----------------------------------------------------
To keep condition (3) from forcing 70–79, n must be a multiple of 6.
Within 60–69 the multiples of 6 are 60 and 66; but 60 is a multiple of 4, leaving only 66.
Yet 66 is a multiple of 3, so condition (2) would require n to be in 50–59, contradiction.
Hence Case B yields no solution.

----------------------------------------------------
The only integer that satisfies all three implications is 76.

so that the units, tens, …, hundred-thousands columns are compared with the result E F F O R T.

2. Write the column equations (c₁, c₂, … are carries, right to left).

   Units:     T + S + A + E = T + 10 c₁  
         ⇒ S + 16 = 10 c₁ → S = 4, c₁ = 2.  

   Tens:      I + E + L + c₁ = R + 10 c₂  
         ⇒ I + 15 = R + 10 c₂.  

   Hundreds: K + T + c₂ = O + 10 c₃.  

   Thousands: 9 + T + c₃ = F + 10 c₄.  

   Ten-thousands: T + I + c₄ = F + 10 c₅.  

   Hundred-thousands: L + c₅ = E (=7).

3. From the last equation L + c₅ = 7 and the size of a carry,
   c₅ must be 1 → L = 6.

4. Since 9 + T + c₃ ≥ 10 (T ≠0), c₄ = 1 and F = 9 + T + c₃ − 10 = T + c₃ − 1.

5. Also, T + I + c₄ = F + 10 with c₄ = 1 gives F = T + I − 9.

   Therefore T + c₃ − 1 = T + I − 9 → I = c₃ + 8.

   If c₃=1 then I=9, but A=9 already, impossible.  
   Hence c₃=0 and I=8; so F = T − 1 and c₄ still = 1.

6. Tens column: I + 15 = R + 10 c₂ with I=8 → 23 = R + 10 c₂.

   Thus c₂ = 2 and R = 3 (distinct new digit).

7. Hundreds column: K + T + c₂ = O (because c₃=0).  
          ⇒ K + T + 2 = O < 10.

8. Digits used so far: 9(A), 7(E), 8(I), 6(L), 4(S), 3(R).
   Remaining digits: 0,1,2,5.

   Because F = T − 1 and both must come from the remaining set:
   Two possibilities: (T,F) = (1,0) or (2,1).

   • If T=2, F=1 then K+2+2=O → K+4=O, but {K,O} would have to be {0,5}; neither works.  
   • If T=1, F=0 then K+1+2=O → O = K+3, which is satisfied by K=2, O=5.

   Hence the consistent assignment is  
   T=1, F=0, K=2, O=5.

Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence.

Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result.

b = number of \$5 bills  
c = number of \$10 bills  
d = number of \$20 bills  
e = number of \$50 bills  
f = number of \$100 bills  

1.  Danny always hands over exactly 100 bills

2.  Their total value must be \$230  
   1a + 5b + 10c + 20d + 50e + 100f = 230. …(2)

3.  Subtract (1) from (2):  
   (5–1)b + (10–1)c + (20–1)d + (50–1)e + (100–1)f = 130  
   4b + 9c + 19d + 49e + 99f = 130. …(3)

-------------------------------------------------
Searching integral solutions of (3) with 0 ≤ a,b,c,d,e,f and a = 100 – (b+c+d+e+f):

•  f can only be 0 or 1 (because 2·99 > 130).  

-------------------------------------------------
A.  f = 0

Equation (3) becomes 4b + 9c + 19d + 49e = 130.

Trying e = 0, 1, 2 produces many arithmetic solutions, but every one of them leaves at least two of the six quantities equal to 0.  
With two zeros present, we could form infinitely many true sentences of the form  
0 × x = 0,  
so they all violate the “one-and-only-one triplet’’ condition.

Hence no admissible solution with f = 0 may have more than one zero among the six quantities; that leaves only one candidate:

 b = 1, c = 1, d = 1, e = 2, f = 0  
 (then a = 95)

-------------------------------------------------
B.  f = 1

Equation (3) becomes 4b + 9c + 19d + 49e = 31.

The unique non-negative solution is b = 3, c = 0, d = 1, e = 0.  
That still leaves two zeros (c and e), so again there would be many 0 × x = 0 sentences.  
Thus no acceptable solution exists when f = 1.

-------------------------------------------------
Examine the sole surviving candidate

a = 95,  b = 1,  c = 1,  d = 1,  e = 2,  f = 0.

•  Equation (1): 95+1+1+1+2+0 = 100 ✔  
•  Equation (2): 95·1 + 1·5 + 1·10 + 1·20 + 2·50 + 0·100  
         = 95 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 100 = 230 ✔  

Now list the six quantities: 95, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0  

Possible multiplication triplets:

– With only one zero present, no sentence of the form 0 × x = 0 can be written.  
– 1 × 1 = 1 is true, and we do have three separate “1’’s to realize it.  
– Any other pair of numbers (1,2,95) produces a product not on the list, or would require a repeated number we do not have twice (e.g. 1 × 2 = 2 would need two “2’’s).  

Hence the single distinct true sentence is 1 × 1 = 1, fulfilling the “exactly one triplet’’ requirement.

Mad Ade then used up six of the matches, and found that with the remainder he could again construct another triangle whose area was just as many square inches as there were matches.
And using another six matches Mad Ade could again do precisely the same.
How many matches were there in the box originally?
Note that the match-box can hold maximum of 50 matches.",There are two possible answers!,"Initially, there were either 42 or 36 matches in the match-box.
There are 42 matches in the box with which he could form a triangle 20, 15, 7, with an area of 42 square inches. After 6 matches had been used, the remaining 36 matches would form a triangle 17, 10, 9, with an area of 36 square inches. After using another 6 matches, the remaining 30 matches would form a triangle 13, 12, 5, with an area of 30 square inches. After using another 6, the 24 remaining would form a triangle 10, 8, 6, with an area of 24 square inches.
Thus, there are two possible answers. There were either 42 or 36 matches in the match-box.
Also it is interesting to know that there are just 5 such triangles for which the perimeter and the area is the same (assuming all sides are integers) and they are :
24 (10, 8, 6)
30 (13, 12, 5)
36 (17, 10, 9)

Write s = P/2 (the semi-perimeter).  
Heron’s formula gives the area A :

 A² = s(s–a)(s–b)(s–c).

The condition “area equals number of matches” is

 A = P  ⇔  s(s–a)(s–b)(s–c) = P² = (2s)² = 4s²
 ⇔  (s–a)(s–b)(s–c) = 4s.                     (1)

Put  
 x = s–a,   y = s–b,   z = s–c.  
Then x, y, z are positive integers, and

 x + y + z = s  and  xyz = 4s.             (2)

Thus we must find all integers s ≤ 25 (because P ≤ 50) satisfying (2).

A short search gives

 s = 12 → (x,y,z) = (4,2,6)     P = 24   (triangle 6, 8, 10)  
 s = 15 → (x,y,z) = (3,2,10)    P = 30   (triangle 5, 12, 13)

 s = 21 → (x,y,z) = (6,1,14)    P = 42   (triangle 7, 15, 20)

198,"Detective Grant was inspecting the scene of the crime. The 50-year-old victim, Joe, had been poisoned by a candy containing cyanide. On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table. John, 46, was found with 5 candies the day after a 4-yr sentence had been turned over a week ago. Jim, 35, had gotten off a 5-yr sentence a few days ago, only to be found dead with 6 candies yesterday.
Grant puzzled over these cases for days, and then -boom- it hit him. There was a pattern in these murders! What pattern did Grant spot?
Each suspect ate a candy before they died.
Life expectancy when the murders were committed was 70 years.
(It was also curious that many criminals had been let off their sentences too, but had not been killed. 23, in fact, had gotten off.)","SUSPECT--AGE--SENTENCE--CANDIES
Joe--------50----2 years-------9
Jeff--------30----10 yrs--------3
John-------46----4 yrs---------5
Jim--------35----5 yrs----------6","The killer was a prosecutor (George) who thought that the criminal deserved a chance to live outside of jail. When the case came before him, he dismissed it. He then went to the criminal's house, and offered him a chance to gamble his life, or go to jail. George offered him a certain number of candies, one of which was poisoned. If the criminal chose a poisoned candy, he died. If he chose a pure candy, he lived.
The criminal's remaining life expectancy divided by his prison sentence would be the number of candies George would bring him, one of which might kill him. In the case of Joe:
His remaining life expectancy at age 50 was 20. 20 divided by 2(his sentence) is 10. George brought him 10 candies, one of which was poisoned. Joe ate the poisoned one, and left nine on the table.

Jeff A = 30 S = 10 T = 4  
John A = 46 S = 4 T = 6  
Jim   A = 35 S = 5 T = 7

He then noticed the same equality in every case:

  m = s1 w1 + s2 w2 + s3 w3 + s4 w4, where each coefficient si is –1, 0, or +1.

(“+” means the weight is placed on the same pan as the wheat, “–” means on the opposite pan, “0” means the weight is not used.)

Let the weights be ordered 1 ≤ w1 ≤ w2 ≤ w3 ≤ w4 and let
Sn = w1 + … + wn (the total of the n smallest weights).

Step-by-step construction (greedy argument).

1. To weigh exactly 1 kg we must have w1 = 1.

2. With weight 1 alone we can create the net differences –1, 0, +1, so the largest positive mass we can reach so far is 1 kg.  
   To extend the range without gaps, the next weight must satisfy  
  w2 ≤ 2·1 + 1 = 3.  
   Choosing the largest possible value gives w2 = 3.  
   Now S2 = 1 + 3 = 4, and every mass from 0 to 4 can be formed.

3. Using ±1 and ±3 we can create net differences up to 2·4 = 8 kg.  
   Therefore the third weight must satisfy  
  w3 ≤ 2·4 + 1 = 9.  
   Take the largest possible value: w3 = 9.  
   Now S3 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, and every mass from 0 to 13 can be obtained.

4. With ±1, ±3, ±9 we can create net differences up to 2·13 = 26 kg.  
   Hence the fourth weight must satisfy  
  w4 ≤ 2·13 + 1 = 27.  
   Again choose the largest possible value: w4 = 27.

5. The total of the four weights is S4 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40,  
   and with coefficients –1, 0, 1 each distinct “balanced-ternary” combination produces every integer from –40 to +40.  In particular every positive integer 1, 2, …, 40 can be weighed.

Because at every stage we picked the greatest value allowed without creating a gap, any other choice would either leave some masses unmeasurable or make the total < 40.  Thus the set {1, 3, 9, 27} is not only sufficient but unique.

2) w       + 4f     = 2.48  
3) w       +  f + 3a = 2.99  

Step 1 – Eliminate w

""He's wrong,"" the other one insisted.  ""My answer is right!""

""Yours, probably.  Mr. Collins is at a conference for the weekend, and Monette took his math class.  It looks like she handed back an exam.""
""I teach math.  Can I help?""
All three talked at once; Monette was as frustrated as the two students.  While they jabbered, Corman managed to read the problem in question:
""My house is built on a strangely-shaped lot, so my back yard is a right triangle with an area of 840 square feet.  Each of the three sides measures an integral number of feet.  If I want to stake my dog so that he can reach the entire yard, how long must his rope be?""
Monette finally pulled rank on the adolescents.  ""It's not really your problem, but I'd be glad of some help.  Mr. Collins marked their papers wrong; their answers don't match his.

There are three triangles that fit the given hints, having sides
40, 42, 58

From the students' comments, we know that the Collins yard has the middle-sized hypotenuse.
A right triangle inscribes neatly into a semicircle, with the hypotenuse forming a diameter.  The shortest rope needed to reach all points is one staked at the midpoint of the hypotenuse, forming a radius of the circle.  74/2 = 37 feet.
The blond student found the first answer above, and would have used a rope of 29 feet.  The other student figured it at 113/2, or 56.5 feet.
Historical note:
Lewis Carroll searched for the answer to the basic mathematical problem, sent to him by a reader.  He found two right triangles with the same area, but couldn't discover a set of three.  Somewhat ironically, Carroll had found 20-21-29 and 12-35-37.  Had he doubled their dimensions, he would have had the first two triangles above, and quite likely would have found the third.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the two legs of the right–triangle yard be a and b (a ≤ b), and let the hypotenuse be c.  
Because it is a right triangle

a² + b² = c² ,  a, b, c ∈ ℤ ,

and because the area is 840 ft²,

½·a·b = 840    ⇒    a·b = 1 680.                (1)

------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  How long a rope is needed?

   If the stake is placed at the midpoint of the hypotenuse (the
   circumcentre of a right triangle), the distance to every point of the
   triangle is at most half the hypotenuse.  
   Thus the shortest rope that lets the dog reach the whole yard is

       r = c / 2.

   Applying this to the three admissible triangles gives

       c = 58 ⇒ r = 29 ft  
       c = 74 ⇒ r = 37 ft  
       c = 113 ⇒ r = 56.5 ft

3.  Interpreting the story.

   The teacher’s key held the middle value (37 ft).  
   One student’s answer was 8 ft shorter (29 ft), the other’s 
   “a lot longer” (56.5 ft); all three are legitimate because

206,"Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

P = selling price per box (dollars)  
C = cost per box (dollars)  
Q = boxes sold per week  
W = weekly profit  

1. Find the cost per box.  
At the given data point  
price  = 5.95  
profit per box = 1.75  

So C = 5.95 − 1.75 = 4.20 dollars.

2. Express quantity as a function of price.  
Every $0.20 cut raises sales by 25 boxes ⇒ slope = 25 / 0.20 = 125 boxes per $1.  

Starting from (P , Q) = (5.95 , 100) we have  

Q = 100 + 125 (5.95 − P).

3. Write the weekly profit function.  
Profit per box = P − C = P − 4.20.  

Hence  

W(P) = (P − 4.20) · [100 + 125 (5.95 − P)].  

4. Simplify W(P).  
Let x = number of $0.20 reductions from $5.95, i.e. x = (5.95 − P) / 0.20.  
Then  

P = 5.95 − 0.20x  
Q = 100 + 25x  
Profit per box = 1.75 − 0.20x  

So  

W(x) = (1.75 − 0.20x)(100 + 25x)  
      = −5x² + 23.75x + 175.

5. Maximize the quadratic.  
For W(x) = ax² + bx + c with a = −5, b = 23.75, the vertex is at  

x* = −b/(2a) = −23.75 / (2·−5) = 2.375.

6. Convert back to price.  

P* = 5.95 − 0.20·x*  
    = 5.95 − 0.20·2.375  
    = 5.95 − 0.475  
    ≈ $5.475.

7. Interpret the answer.  
• If price may vary continuously, the maximum weekly profit occurs at about $5.48 per box (to the nearest cent).  
• If the owners insist on changing price only by exact $0.20 steps, check the two nearest integral x-values:

x = 2 ⇒ P = 5.55, W = $202.50  
x = 3 ⇒ P = 5.35, W = $201.25  

so the best discrete choice would be $5.55.

Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.
Suppose D=7. Then L is 0 or 1, and since S=1, L=0. A must be 1 or 2, but since S=1, A=2.
Suppose D=8. Then L is 1 or 2, and since S=1, L=2. A must be 2 or 3, but since L=2, A=3.
Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.
Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.
If D=7, then L=0. But since 10-7=3, D cannot be 7.
If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.
If E=4, then N=3. But if D=8, A=3, and if D=9, L=3 and A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=5, then since 1I-E=6, I=1. But since S=1, this cannot work.
If E=7, then I=3. But if D=8, then A=3, and if D=9, then L=3. So this cannot work.
If E=8, then I=4, and D cannot be 8. But if D=9, then A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=9, then N=8, and D cannot be 8 or 9. So this cannot work.

   thous: L – D – b₃ = 3 ( mod 10) (borrow b₄ to ten-thousands)  
   10 th: S – b₄     = 0  (because the result is only 4 digits)

   Therefore b₄ = 1 and S = 1.

2.  Thousands column  
   Because b₄ = 1, the thousands column must have borrowed:  
   L – D – b₃ = 3 – 10 = –7.  
   Hence D = L + 6 + b₃.

   The only possibilities with distinct digits are

3.  Examine each possibility

   a) L = 0, D = 6 gives contradictions in the tens column.  
   b) L = 2, D = 8 also leads to contradictions.  
   c) L = 3, D = 9 works, as shown below.

4.  Fix L = 3, D = 9, b₃ = 1.

   Tens column with b₂ = 0 (no borrow into hundreds):

   Hundreds column (b₂ = 0, b₃ = 1):
        I – E – 0 = –4  ⇒  I = E – 4.

   Choose N so that all digits are distinct and 0 ≤ digits ≤ 9:

        N = 5 ⇒ E = 6 ⇒ I = 2.

   All digits {1,2,3,4,5,6,9} are distinct, so:

b) How far (to the nearest inch) do you have to walk to return to your starting position?","Do it on paper, unless you need the exercise!","a) You have walked 1060 feet.
b) You have to walk 73 feet, 9 inches
Explanation
There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100, neither of which is prime.  (No, 1 is not prime.)  So you will walk in an expanding square with sides of length 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 feet.  This is a total of 1060 feet.
The net result of your turns will be that you are 56 feet ahead of your starting position.
(2+11+23+41+59+73+97)
- (5+17+31+47+67+83)
You will also be 48 feet to the left of your starting position.
(7+19+37+53+71+89)
- (3+13+29+43+61+79)
To calculate the distance back to the starting position, calculate the length of the hypotenuse of the right angle triangle with legs that are 56 and 48 feet long.

214,"Alec, Brett and Chris each purchased parts for their skateboards at the sports store. Alec and Brett wanted to build new skateboards, so they each needed to purchase a deck, trucks, bearings and wheels. Chris only needed new wheels. The store offers a 10% discount for purchases over $250, so the boys decided to pay for all the parts together to qualify for the discount. Altogether, the boys spent $266.40. The clues below reflect the price of the items before the discount is applied.
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
They each bought the same kinds of wheels. Together they spent $75 for the 3 sets of wheels. Each set contained 4 wheels.
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.

less 10% discount $12.60 $14.50 $2.50 $29.60
Amount spent $113.40 $130.50 $22.50 $266.40
Explanation:
First find the original price of all the items combined. $266.40 is the price after the 10% discount was applied.
That means $266.40 is equal to 90% of the original price.
Write an equation and then cross multiply:
266.40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x   =   9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)
Let x = the amount Alec spent on trucks.
x + (x+5) = 75
2x + 5 = 75
2x = 70
x = 35
Alec spent $35 on trucks. Brett spent $5 more than Alec. Therefore, Brett spent $40 on trucks.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51
x + (2x + 3) = 51
3x + 3 = 51
3x = 48
x = 16

Evaluation is strictly left-to-right, ignoring normal operator precedence.

Try putting “=” just before the last three digits; the right–hand side will then be 333.

The number of sanding machines limit the combination of chairs and tables to 1080=5c+20t.
Next graph these three lines. It should be expected that the answer will lie on the intersection of two of these lines or to make all chairs or all tables. The intersection of the saw and sanding machine line occurs outside of how many chairs the lathe can make so this combination is not a viable answer.

Finally, take the factorial of this 5:

(0! + 0! + 0! + 0! + 0!)! = 5! = 120.

221,"Assuming you have enough coins of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 cents, how many ways are there to make change for a dollar?",There are more than 200.,There are 292 ways.,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

1·a + 5·b + 10·c + 25·d + 50·e = 100 ,   a,b,c,d,e ≥ 0  

denote a way to make a dollar with 1-, 5-, 10-, 25- and 50-cent coins.

Step 1 – Fix the number e of 50-cent coins  
e can be 0, 1, 2.

Case e = 2  
The whole dollar is already reached: 1 way.

Case e = 1  
Fifty cents remain.  We now need the number of solutions of  
1·a + 5·b + 10·c + 25·d = 50.  
Call this number f(50).

Case e = 0  
We need the number of solutions of  
1·a + 5·b + 10·c + 25·d = 100.  
Call this number f(100).

Thus total ways = f(100) + f(50) + 1.

Step 2 – Evaluate f(n) for n = 50 and 100  
Let d be the number of quarters (25-cent coins).  
After choosing d, the remaining amount is n − 25d, which must be made with 10-, 5- and 1-cent coins.

Write g(m) for the number of solutions of  
1·a + 5·b + 10·c = m.

Then f(n) = Σ_{d=0}^{⌊n/25⌋} g(n − 25d).

Step 3 – Evaluate g(m)  
Fix c (number of dimes).  The remainder is m − 10c, to be made with nickels and pennies.  
For that remainder, the number of possibilities is  

h(k) = ⌊k/5⌋ + 1 (k = m − 10c),

because we may take 0,1,…,⌊k/5⌋ nickels, the rest pennies.

Hence  

g(m) = Σ_{c=0}^{⌊m/10⌋} (⌊(m − 10c)/5⌋ + 1).

Because m is always a multiple of 5 here, (m − 10c)/5 = m/5 − 2c is an integer, and letting k = ⌊m/10⌋ gives a closed form:

g(m) = (k + 1)·(m/5 + 1 − k), where k = ⌊m/10⌋.

Step 4 – Compute the needed values

g(0)  = 1.
m = 25: k = 2  ⇒ g(25) = (2+1)(25/5+1−2) = 3·4 = 12.
m = 50: k = 5  ⇒ g(50) = 6·6 = 36.
m = 75: k = 7  ⇒ g(75) = 8·9 = 72.
m = 100: k = 10 ⇒ g(100) = 11·11 = 121.

Now

f(50)  = g(50) + g(25) + g(0) = 36 + 12 + 1 = 49,
f(100) = g(100) + g(75) + g(50) + g(25) + g(0)
        = 121   + 72   + 36   + 12   + 1 = 242.

Step 5 – Assemble all cases

222,"Homer had always contemplated the size of the old oak tree in the field behind his house.  Standing 5 feet away from the 8 foot high fence in the back of the yard, he could just barely see the top leaves of the tree over the top of the fence.  He knew that the tree was 200 feet from the fence.  Homer was 6 feet tall, making his line of vision, 67 inches from the ground.
Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.","TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches
Tree height from eye level = TAN (25.80 deg) * 2460 inches = 1189 inches
Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.  With the measurement capabilities available to any lumberjack (or any average Homer) precise measurements are not possible.  Thus the need to clarify these calculations as estimates.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

• eye-level height = 67 in = 67/12 = 5.5833 ft  
• fence height = 8 ft  
• distance eye → fence = 5 ft  
• distance fence → tree = 200 ft  
• distance eye → tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 205 ft

Because the sight line from Homer’s eye just grazes the top of the fence and then meets the top of the tree, the line of sight is straight.  Hence the vertical “rise” is proportional to the horizontal “run”:

(height of tree – eye height) / (distance eye→tree) = (fence height – eye height) / (distance eye→fence)

Let H be the tree’s height.

(H – 5.5833) / 205 = (8 – 5.5833) / 5

H – 5.5833 = 205 × (2.4167 / 5)  
H – 5.5833 = 41 × 2.4167 ≈ 99.0833  
H ≈ 5.5833 + 99.0833 ≈ 104.6666 ft

11 calls at 30 seconds each = 5.5 minutes, plus 90 seconds for the last people to exit the building gives 7 minutes.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1.  Calling pattern  
   • Each person makes two calls, one after the other.  
   • Each call lasts 30 s, so the two calls take 60 s in total.  
   • Only after the two calls are finished does the person start the 90 s trip out of the building.

2.  How long until someone is phoned?  
   A parent finishes the first call 30 s after starting, and the second call 60 s after starting.  
   So a child can be phoned as early as 30 s (first child) or as late as 60 s (second child) after the parent got the news.

   If we follow the “latest” branch (everyone is the second child), every generation adds 60 s before the next person is reached.  
   Thus a person at depth k (k edges below Dave) can be phoned as late as  

  latest-call time = 60 k  seconds.

3.  How many generations are needed?  
   A complete binary tree of depth k (Dave is depth 0) contains  
  1 + 2 + 4 + … + 2^k = 2^{k+1} – 1   people (including Dave).

   We must warn 375 residents (Dave does the warning).  
   Up through depth 7 we have 2^{8} – 1 = 255 people (including Dave), which is not enough.  
   Up through depth 8 we have 2^{9} – 1 = 511 people, which is more than enough, so some residents at depth 8 must be called.  
   Hence the deepest person who needs warning is at depth 8.

4.  Last person to leave  
   • Latest time anyone is phoned = 60 × 8 = 480 s.  
   • A depth-8 resident has no one left to phone, so leaves after an additional 90 s.  
     Time out of building = 480 s + 90 s = 570 s.

   • A depth-7 resident who is the last of his generation to be phoned gets the news at 60 × 7 = 420 s, then spends 60 s phoning two children and 90 s leaving:  
     420 s + 60 s + 90 s = 570 s.  
     Thus no one can leave later than 570 s.

   570 s = 9 minutes 30 seconds.

142857 * 3 = 428571

142857 * 5 = 714285
142857 * 6 = 857142",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let N be the required six–digit integer.

1. 5 N.  
The last digit of 5 N is either 0 (if N is even) or 5 (if N is odd).   
If N were even, the digit 0 would obligatorily appear in 5 N, hence the digit 0 would have to be contained in N itself.  
But then 2 N, 3 N or 4 N would inevitably contain the digit 0 in a different place (because every carry that produces a 0 in the units position also produces a non–zero carry into the tens position), forcing some other new digit to appear.  
Consequently N cannot be even; N must be odd and therefore the units digit of 5 N is 5 – so the digit 5 is definitely present in N.

2. 2 N.  
Since N is odd, 2 N is even and its units digit is an even digit that must already lie among the digits of N.  
Thus N possesses at least one even digit as well as the digit 5.

3. The size of N.  
Because N is six–digit while 6 N must not exceed seven digits (an eight–digit product would have to contain a 1 followed exclusively by zeros, which would introduce a new digit 0 if it were absent from N), we get  
6 N ≤ 1 000 000 ⇒ N ≤ 166 666.  
Hence 2 N, 3 N, 4 N, 5 N, 6 N are all six– or seven–digit numbers whose first digits can only be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 8 – all of which must therefore also be present in N.

4. Collecting the compulsory digits.  
From the preceding points we have already forced the six different digits {1,2,4,5,7,8} to be contained in N, and there is room for no further different digit (N has only six places).  
Therefore N must use each of those six digits exactly once and no others.

5. Determination of the order of the digits.  
Write the unknown number as abcdef with {a,b,c,d,e,f} = {1,2,4,5,7,8}.  
Because 5 N ends with 5, f must be 7 or 9 (the only digits whose product with 5 ends in 5). 9 is impossible, hence f = 7.  
Then 5 N ends in 5 and the second–to–last digit of 5 N is produced by the carry 3 coming from 5·7 = 35; hence the tens digit of 5 N equals the units digit of N plus 3 (mod 10).  This forces the units digit of N to be 2, making the tens digit of 5 N equal to 5.  
Continuing that carry analysis through the whole multiplication by 5 fixes the successive digits uniquely; the only permutation that works is

          N = 1 4 2 8 5 7.

6. Verification.  
142 857 × 2 = 285 714  
142 857 × 3 = 428 571  
142 857 × 4 = 571 428  
142 857 × 5 = 714 285  
142 857 × 6 = 857 142  

Every product contains only the six digits {1,2,4,5,7,8}; no new digit ever appears.

Hence N = 142 857 and, by the uniqueness arguments above, it is the only six–digit number with the stated property.

All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We want the least positive integer whose decimal representation

• uses only the digits 0 and 1, and  
• is divisible by 225.

Because 225 = 9 × 25, the number must be divisible by 9 and by 25.

1. Divisibility by 25  
   A decimal number is divisible by 25 iff its last two digits are 00, 25, 50 or 75.  
   Since only the digits 0 and 1 are allowed, the only possible pair is 00.  
   Hence the number must end in the two digits 00.

2. Divisibility by 9  
   A decimal number is divisible by 9 iff the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  
   The final two digits contribute 0 to this sum, so the sum of all the other digits
   (all of which are 0 or 1) must itself be a multiple of 9.  
   Therefore the number must contain 9, 18, 27, … ones.

3. How many digits are needed?  
   If the number has n digits, exactly n − 2 of them precede the mandatory trailing “00”.  
   We need at least 9 ones, so n − 2 ≥ 9 ⇒ n ≥ 11.  
   Thus any candidate must have at least 11 digits.

4. Constructing the smallest 11-digit candidate  
   • The first digit cannot be 0, so it is 1.  
   • Among the first 9 digits (those before the final “00”) we need exactly 9 ones and 0 zeros, otherwise we would not reach the required total of 9 ones.  
   Hence every one of those 9 positions must be a 1.

   The unique 11-digit number that meets these conditions is
        11111111100.

5. Verification  
   Sum of digits = 9 ⇒ divisible by 9.  
   Last two digits = 00 ⇒ divisible by 25.  
   Therefore it is divisible by 225.  

   Any shorter number is impossible (needs at least 11 digits), and within 11 digits no smaller value exists (all first nine digits must be 1’s), so this is indeed the smallest.

• 3 × N has to be a 3–digit number, so N ≤ 329.  
• Hence the hundreds-digit of N can only be 1, 2 or 3.  
• Altogether the nine digits 1-9 occur exactly once, therefore no 0 is allowed in N, 2 N or 3 N.  
• The nine digits 1-9 split into three groups of three digits.  
  Their total sum is 45, which is 0 (mod 3).

  one digit ≡0 (mod 3) (3,6,9), one digit ≡1 (mod 3) (1,4,7) and one digit ≡2 (mod 3) (2,5,8).  
  Consequently N itself is divisible by 3; we only have to test the multiples of 3 whose
  hundreds-digit is 1, 2 or 3.

Step 2.  Hundreds-digit 1  
N = 1 b c with {b,c} ⊂ {3,6,9}×{2,5,8}.

digit is repeated when we form 2 N and 3 N.  
The single survivor is

 N = 273 → 2 N = 546, 3 N = 819.

Now N must contain one digit from {1,4,7} and one from {2,5,8}.  
Put N = 3 x y with x∈{1,4,7} and y∈{2,5,8} (again in either order).

Fast clock: gains 1 minute every hour ⇒ it advances 60 + 1 = 61 clock-minutes per real hour.  
Slow clock: loses 2 minutes every hour ⇒ it advances 60 – 2 = 58 clock-minutes per real hour.

1.  When do the two clocks next agree with each other?

The difference between their readings after t hours is  
(61 – 58)t = 3t clock-minutes.

Because an analog dial repeats every 12 hours = 720 minutes, the two readings coincide when this difference is a multiple of 720:

3t ≡ 0 (mod 720)  ⇒  3t = 720 k  ⇒  t = 240 k.

The smallest positive k is 1, so  
t = 240 hours = 10 days.

Thus the clocks next show the same time 10 days after they were set, i.e. at 12∶00 a.m. on Wednesday, 10 January (they will both read 4 o’clock).

2.  When do the two clocks both show the correct time?

For the fast clock to read correctly we need its gained minutes to equal an integral number of full revolutions:

(+1 minute per hour) t ≡ 0 (mod 720)  ⇒  t ≡ 0 (mod 720).

For the slow clock:

(–2 minutes per hour) t ≡ 0 (mod 720)  ⇒  t ≡ 0 (mod 360).

The smallest t satisfying both congruences is the least common multiple of 720 and 360, namely 720 hours.

720 hours = 30 days.

Therefore both clocks return to the correct time together 30 days after being set, i.e. at 12∶00 a.m. on Tuesday, 30 January.

• Smallest sum: w₁ + w₂ = 80.  
• Largest sum:  w₄ + w₅ = 91.

Step 2 – use the second largest sum  
The second–largest pair must be w₃ + w₅, so

w₃ + w₅ = 90.

Step 3 – solve for w₄ and relate weights  
Subtract the equations from Steps 1–2:

(w₄ + w₅) − (w₃ + w₅) = 91 − 90  
w₄ − w₃ = 1  ⇒  w₄ = w₃ + 1.         (1)

produce exactly {82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88} with no repeats.

Four of those seven numbers are even and three are odd.  
Among the seven expressions above, exactly

• one of (2) and (3) is odd,  
• one of (5) and (6) is odd,  
• (8) is always odd,  
• the other three are even.

Hence expression (2) must be even. So x+y is even.  
Put x+y = 82, the smallest unused even number (it should be second-smallest overall).

Step 6 – narrow x and y
x+y = 82  ⇒  y = 82 − x.

Because all weights are different and increasing:

x < 80−x < y < y+1 < 90−y,

and from y ≤ 44 (so that w₄ ≤ w₅) we get x ≥ 38.  
Thus the only possibilities are x = 38, 39 (x = 40 would repeat w₁ = w₂).

Case x = 38 → y = 44 gives pair-sums
80, 82, 83, 84, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91 (contains 89, lacks 85) – reject.

Case x = 39 → y = 43 gives the five weights

w₁ = 39, w₂ = 41, w₃ = 43, w₄ = 44, w₅ = 47,

and the ten pair-sums

39+41 = 80  
39+43 = 82  
39+44 = 83  
39+47 = 86  
41+43 = 84  
41+44 = 85  
41+47 = 88  
43+44 = 87  
43+47 = 90  
44+47 = 91.

These are exactly the ten recorded numbers.  
Since the construction forced all choices, this solution is unique.

2. Heights of successive bounces  
   After each impact the ball rises to 2⁄3 of the height from which it just fell.

a) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Lavi's and my age considered during any one year right since she was a year old.
b) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Fred's and my ages considered during any one year right since I was a year old.

247,"The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?","Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74
Lemp 47 94
Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =

d₁ , d₂ , d₃ , d₄ , d₅ , d₆ = numbers that get ​down at

2.  The dᵢ are prime and lie in the indicated intervals

3.  |u_{i+1} – uᵢ| ≥ 20  ⇒  |d_{i+1} – dᵢ| ≥ 10.

4.  Σdᵢ is even.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – force the only possible sequence of dᵢ.

• Between Maver and Willow : d₂ – d₁ ≥ 10  
  – If d₁ = 2 → d₂ ∈ {13,17,19}  
  – If d₁ = 3 → d₂ ∈ {13,17,19}  
  – If d₁ = 5 → d₂ ∈ {17,19}  (if 13, diff = 8)  
  – If d₁ = 7 → d₂ ∈ {17,19}

• Between Willow and Wonderland : d₃ – d₂ ≥ 10.  
  Checking the pairs above shows that the only possible d₃ is 23, and then we must have d₂ = 13 (because 23 – 13 = 10; with d₂ = 17 or 19 the difference is too small).

• Between Wonderland and Doku : d₄ – d₃ ≥ 10.  
  With d₃ = 23 the only candidate that works is d₄ = 37 (31 – 23 = 8 < 10).

• Between Doku and Lemp : d₅ – d₄ ≥ 10.  
  d₄ = 37 forces d₅ = 47 (41 – 37 = 4, 43 – 37 = 6).

• Between Lemp and Rudolf : d₆ – d₅ ≥ 10.  
  d₅ = 47 forces d₆ = 59 (53 – 47 = 6).

Up to now we have two possibilities for d₁, but all the other dᵢ are fixed:

 d₁   d₂  d₃  d₄  d₅  d₆  
  2    13  23  37  47  59   or  3 13 23 37 47 59

Step 2 – use the parity condition.

Sum of the fixed five primes 13+23+37+47+59 = 179.  
Therefore Σdᵢ is either 179+2 = 181 (odd) or 179+3 = 182 (even).  
Because the problem states the total must be even, d₁ = 3.

Thus the numbers of passengers that get down at the six stations are

d₁ = 3,  d₂ = 13,  d₃ = 23,  d₄ = 37,  d₅ = 47,  d₆ = 59.

Their sum is

Σdᵢ = 3 + 13 + 23 + 37 + 47 + 59 = 182.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 – relate the totals to the number of passengers on board.

Let N₀ be the number of passengers on the train just before it reached Maver.

At any station, because twice as many board as alight, the net gain is exactly dᵢ.  
Hence after passing through all six stations the train has

N₀ + Σdᵢ = N₀ + 182 passengers.

The puzzle tells us that after all happenings at Rudolf the train contained 227 passengers.

The condition is  

  n² – m² = 73.

Recall the difference–of–squares factorisation:

  n² – m² = (n + m)(n – m).

So we need two integers whose product is 73.  
Because 73 is prime, its only factor pairs (in positive integers) are 1 × 73.  
Therefore we must have

  n + m = 73,  
  n – m = 1.

Add the two equations:

  (n + m) + (n – m) = 73 + 1  
  2n = 74  
  n = 37.

Substitute back to find m:

  37 – m = 1  ⇒  m = 36.

Check: 37² – 36² = (37 + 36)(37 – 36) = 73 × 1 = 73.

Thus the only whole-number solution (up to swapping the sign of both numbers) is 37 and 36.

0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.

A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2

M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3

There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.

Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1

There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)

A “route’’ is a sequence of villages that

• ends at the bride’s village,  
• at every step moves along a straight jungle path joining two villages, and  
• at every step lands strictly nearer to the bride’s village than the place just left.

Because every pair of villages is joined by a straight path, the only thing that restricts a route is this “strictly-closer’’ condition.

From these tables we list all sequences that are strictly descending.

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)
10,15 (2,3)

Notice that 2352941176470588 can be rotated TWICE, yielding 1.5 times the number each time since the 4->6->9 n digits are in order.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the sought integer be  

N = a·10^{n-1} + R,

where  
• n is the number of digits (n ≥ 2),  
• a (1 ≤ a ≤ 9) is the first digit,  
• R is the remaining n–1–digit string (0 ≤ R < 10^{n-1}).

Rotating N one place to the left yields  

N′ = 10 R + a.

The condition of the problem is

10 R + a = 3/2 · N = 3/2·(a·10^{n-1} + R). (1)

Eliminate the fraction by doubling:

20 R + 2a = 3a·10^{n-1} + 3R.

Collect like terms:

17 R = a(3·10^{n-1} – 2). (2)

-------------------------------------------------
1.  The first-digit restriction

Because 0 ≤ R < 10^{n-1}, equation (2) gives

0 < 17 R = a(3·10^{n-1} – 2) < 17·10^{n-1}
 ⇒ a(3 – 2·10^{-(n-1)}) < 17
 ⇒ 3a < 17.02…
 ⇒ a ≤ 5.                                     (3)

Hence the leading digit can only be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  A congruence that determines n

Because 17 is prime and does not divide a (a ≤ 5), equation (2) requires

17 | (3·10^{n-1} – 2)  
⇔ 3·10^{n-1} ≡ 2 (mod 17).                   (4)

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 3 modulo 17 (3^{-1} ≡ 6 mod 17):

10^{n-1} ≡ 12 (mod 17).                       (5)

Compute successive powers of 10 mod 17:

10^1≡10, 10^2≡15, 10^3≡14, 10^4≡4, 10^5≡6,
10^6≡9, 10^7≡5, 10^8≡16, 10^9≡7, 10^10≡2,
10^11≡3, 10^12≡13, 10^13≡11, 10^14≡8, 10^15≡12.

The first time 12 appears is at the 15th power, so

n – 1 = 15  ⇒  n = 16.                        (6)

Thus any solution must have exactly 16 digits.

-------------------------------------------------
3.  Determining R and N

Set

S = (3·10^{15} – 2)/17.

Because of (4), S is an integer:

3·10^{15} – 2 = 2 999 999 999 999 998  
S = 176 470 588 235 294.

From (2) we have R = a S.  Since S ≈ 0.176 47·10^{15},
for every a ≤ 5 we still have R < 10^{15}, so all five
choices of a are admissible.  The smallest N is obtained
with the smallest a, namely a = 1:

R = 1·S = 176 470 588 235 294,  

N = 1·10^{15} + R  
  = 1 176 470 588 235 294.                     (7)

-------------------------------------------------
4.  Verification

Rotate N left:

10 R + a = 1 764 705 882 352 941.

Compute 3/2·N:

(3/2)·1 176 470 588 235 294

""Take the sum of the number, the number rotated one to the left, the number rotated one to the right, the number with the first three and last three digits swapped, the number with the digit pairs rotated to the left, and the number with the digit pairs rotated to the right.

Ralph then asks, ""If each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs in the number is prime, then what is the number?""
Rex looks confused, and for a moment Ralph thinks he's finally gotten him. Then Rex smiles, scribbles a few things down on a pad of paper and then says, ""Very nice, Ralph!""
Rex then tells Ralph his number.
What did Rex say?
(See the hint for an explanation of the terminology.)","The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number. The digital sum of 247 is 2+4+7 = 13.

Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the left gives 789056;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the right gives 905678.","416723
Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13.

4.  Prime‐pair condition  
 10a + b, 10c + d, 10e + f are all two–digit primes.                          (5)

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Step 1.  Bounding e  

The left–hand side of (4) is a sum of three different digits, at most 9 + 8 + 7 = 24.  
Hence 8e ≤ 24  ⇒  e ≤ 3,  and e ≠ 0.  So e ∈ {1, 2, 3}.

Step 2.  Testing e = 1  

With e = 1, (4) gives c + d + f = 8.  
But 10e + f = 10 + f must be prime, so f ∈ {3, 7, 9}.  

• If f = 3, then c + d = 5; the only possibilities (14, 41, 23, 32, 05, 50) are not two–digit primes.  
• If f = 7, then c + d = 1 (impossible).  
• If f = 9, then c + d = −1 (impossible).  

Therefore e ≠ 1.

Step 3.  Testing e = 3  

Then (4) gives c + d + f = 24, attainable only with the digits {7, 8, 9}.  
Because 10e + f = 30 + f must be prime, f can only be 7 (→ 37 prime).  
Thus {c, d} = {8, 9} giving c + d = 17.

Now (2) gives a + b = e + f = 3 + 7 = 10,  
but the only unused pair of distinct digits summing to 10 is (4,6) or (6,4), and 46 or 64 is not prime.  
Hence e ≠ 3.

Step 4.  e = 2  

Now (4) is c + d + f = 16.  
Because 10e + f = 20 + f must be prime, f ∈ {3, 9}.  

––––––  4.1  f = 9  

Then c + d = 7.  The unordered pairs {1,6}, {3,4} are the only ones with distinct digits.

 •  c = 6, d = 1 gives 61 prime, but (2) forces a + b = 11; the only ways are 83 or 47, and in each case the special sum (see step 5) starts with 3, not 2.  
 •  c = 4, d = 3 gives 43 prime, but a + b = 11 is now impossible with unused digits.

So f ≠ 9.

––––––  4.2  f = 3  

Then c + d = 13.  The only distinct pairs are {5,8} and {6,7}.  
58 and 85 are not prime, but 67 is.

Take c = 6, d = 7 (→ 67 prime).  
Equation (2) now gives a + b = e + f = 2 + 3 = 5.  
The only way with unused digits is a = 4, b = 1, and 41 is prime.

So far we have found one candidate:

a = 4 b = 1 c = 6 d = 7 e = 2 f = 3 → the number 416 723.

All conditions (1)–(5) are satisfied:

•  Digital sum 4+1+6+7+2+3 = 23 = ef.  
•  a + b = 4 + 1 = 5 = 2 + 3 = e + f.  
•  41, 67, 23 are prime.

Step 5.  The “rotation–sum” condition  

Form the six required rearrangements

   416723, 167234, 341672, 723416, 672341, 234167  

Their sum is  

   2 555 553.

Its first digit is 2, its last digit is 3 – exactly the digits e and f, in some order, as demanded.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

No other choice of e is possible, and for e = 2, f = 3 is the only value that survives every test.  
Hence the number is unique.

Final answer: 416723",True,1,0
6,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Rex did not have to “hunt’’ for dimensions – the numbers that Ralph gave can be satisfied by one and only one regular polygon, so once that polygon is identified every other measurement is forced.

1.  Let n be the number of sides of the regular polygon that is the lot and let  
    s be the length of one side (the length of the irrigation pipe).  
    Because the pipe is used as a gate on one side only, the other n–1 sides
    were fenced:

            (n – 1) s = 400 ft     (1)

2.  The house is a smaller, concentric, similar regular n-gon that is
    inscribed in a circular foundation of radius R.  
    The nearest distance from the foundation to any side of the lot is
    the diameter 2R, hence the in–radius ρ of the lot equals

            ρ = R + 2R = 3R.                              (2)

3.  For a regular n-gon with in-radius ρ and circum-radius R we have
        (side)  s = 2ρ tan(π/n)    and   ρ = R cos(π/n).

    Combining these with (2) gives the side length of the lot in terms of R:

            s = 2(3R) tan(π/n) = 6R tan(π/n).            (3)

4.  The irrigation pipe bisected the area of the house and its ends lay on two
    sides of the house.  
    A line through the centre of any regular polygon meets two (parallel)
    sides and its length varies continuously from the minimum 2r  
    (r = in-radius of the house) to the maximum 2R.
    Consequently s must lie between 2r and 2R.
    Using r = R cos(π/n) and (3) this condition is

            2R cos(π/n)  ≤  6R tan(π/n)  ≤  2R.          (4)

    Write θ = π/n.  Inequalities (4) reduce to

            cos θ  ≤  3 tan θ  ≤  1.

    The left inequality fails for n < 10 and the right one fails for n > 10,
    so the only integer n that satisfies (4) is

            n = 10.

    Therefore both the lot and the house are regular decagons and (1) gives  
            s = 400 / (10 – 1) = 400/9 ft.

5.  All remaining dimensions now follow automatically.

    House circum-radius:
        R = s / (6 tan 18°) = (400/9) / (6 tan 18°) ≈ 22.80 ft.

    Floor-area (one storey) of a regular decagon:
        A₁ = ½·n·R²·sin (2π/n)
            = ½·10·R²·sin 36°
            ≈ 1 526.8 ft².

6.  Square footage of the two-storey house.
    The central circular atrium has diameter one-tenth the longest dimension
    of the lot.  
    The circum-radius of the lot is

            R_lot = ρ / cos 18° = 3R / cos 18° ≈ 72.0 ft,

    so the longest dimension is 2 R_lot ≈ 144 ft and the atrium diameter is
    14.4 ft (radius 7.2 ft).

    Atrium area A_atrium = π·7.2² ≈ 162.5 ft².

    The upper floor lacks this circular area, so the total square footage
    (both storeys) is

            A_total = 2·A₁ – A_atrium
                     ≈ 2·1 526.8 – 162.5
                     ≈ 2 890 ft².

Hence Rex could answer immediately:

7,Find the radius of the inscribed and circumscribed circles for a triangle.,Try to use the area of the triangle,"Let a, b, and c be the sides of the triangle. Let s be the semiperimeter, i.e. s = (a + b + c) / 2. Let A be the area of the triangle, and let x be the radius of the incircle.
Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.
We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).
The radius of the circumscribed circle is given by R = abc/4A.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let a, b, c be the side-lengths of an arbitrary (non-degenerate) triangle, and let Δ denote its area.

1.  Inradius r (radius of the inscribed circle).  
    The incircle is tangent to each side, so its radius times the perimeter equals twice the area:
            Δ = r · (a + b + c)/2.
    Solving for r gives
            r = 2Δ / (a + b + c).

2.  Circumradius R (radius of the circumscribed circle).

9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin.

1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.

And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Call the two integers (both larger than 1) x and y,  
put  

  S = x + y  (the sum whispered to Sachin)  
  P = xy    (the product whispered to Prashant).

Throughout we assume that every mathematician is a perfect logician and that what
he states is certainly true.

────────────────────────
1.  What Sachin’s first remark tells us
────────────────────────
Sachin says:  “Prashant, I don’t think that we know the numbers.”

•  Sachin himself obviously does not yet know the numbers; therefore S can be
   written in at least two ways as a sum of two integers > 1.

•  More important, he is SURE that at this moment Prashant, who knows only P,
   cannot know the numbers either.  
   Prashant could already know the numbers only if his product P were
   factorisable in one single way (into two factors larger than 1).
   A positive integer possesses exactly one such factor-pair iff it has
   exactly four positive divisors, i.e. iff it is
   – a product of two distinct primes (2·5 = 10, 2·7 = 14, 3·11 = 33, …), or
   – the cube of a prime (2³ = 8, 3³ = 27, 5³ = 125, …).

Hence:

For every decomposition S = a + b (a, b > 1) the product ab must have
MORE than four divisors.  
If S possessed even one decomposition whose product had only four divisors,
Prashant MIGHT have received this precise product and would have known the
numbers immediately – contradicting Sachin’s certainty.

A direct examination gives the smallest “admissible” sums

  11, 17, 23, 29, 35, …                       (1)

For instance, S = 11 works, because the products 18, 24, 28, 30 all have at
least six divisors; S = 13 does not, because the decomposition 2 + 11 gives the
product 22 = 2·11, which has only four divisors.

────────────────────────
2.  What Prashant’s “Aha!” means
────────────────────────
Prashant has just learnt that S is contained in the set (1).  
He now inspects all factor pairs of his product P
and writes down their sums; among those sums he keeps only the admissible ones
from (1).  
Prashant is able to exclaim “Now I know the numbers” only if among
ALL factorisations of P there is EXACTLY ONE whose sum is admissible.
So P must have precisely one admissible sum.

A systematic inspection (no computer is required – the admissible sums are
few and small) shows that there is only one product with this property:

  P = 52 = 4·13, whose factor pairs are  
  (2,26)  (sum 28, not admissible)  
  (4,13) (sum 17, admissible).

Every other product that can be written as the sum of two admissible numbers
turns out to possess at least two admissible sums and would therefore leave
Prashant in doubt.  Consequently

  P = 52 and S = 17.                           (2)

────────────────────────
3.  Why Sachin can now determine the pair
────────────────────────
Sachin already knows S.
From (2) he now knows that Prashant’s product has exactly one admissible sum.
He lists all decompositions of 17:

  17 = 2+15, 3+14, 4+13, 5+12, 6+11, 7+10, 8+9.

  7·10 = 70  (admissible sums 17,37)  
  8·9  = 72  (admissible sums 17,27,33).

Only the product 52 possesses a SINGLE admissible sum (namely 17 itself);
therefore the unique possibility is

  x = 4, y = 13.                              (3)

All Nakul has heard is the public conversation; repeating the above reasoning
he sees that the ONLY pair that fits every spoken sentence is (4, 13).

10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

N₀  = number of coconuts in the common pile when night falls,  
N₁  = pile just after the 1st survivor has finished,  
N₂  = pile just after the 2nd survivor has finished, … ,  
N₅  = pile that remains on the beach at day-break.

What happens each time a survivor acts is identical:

“divide what you see into 5 equal piles, 1 coconut is left over, give that 1 to the monkey, hide one of the five equal piles, and heap the other four back together”.

Thus, if S is the size of the pile a survivor sees when he arrives, the size T he leaves behind satisfies  

4 · (S – 1)/5 = T,            (because he removes 1 for the monkey and keeps one fifth).

Re-arranged, S and T are connected by  

S = (5/4) T + 1.            (★)

Begin with the size everybody sees in the morning:

Because, in daylight, the five survivors divide what is left exactly (no coconut for the monkey),

N₅ is a multiple of 5.  
Write N₅ = 5q, q ∈ ℕ.                                               (1)

Work backwards with (★).

( i )  The 5ᵗʰ survivor

S = N₄ , T = N₅ = 5q

N₄ = (5/4)(5q) + 1 = 25q/4 + 1 = (25q + 4)/4.  
For N₄ to be an integer, 25q + 4 must be divisible by 4.  
Because 25 ≡ 1 (mod 4), this means q + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) → q = 4k – 1.  
Put q = 4k – 1 (k ∈ ℕ).

With that,

N₄ = 25(4k – 1)/4 + 1 = 25k – 25/4 + 1 = 25k – 5 + 1 = 25k – 4.   (2)

( ii ) The 4ᵗʰ survivor  

S = N₃, T = N₄ = 25k – 4

N₃ = (5/4)(25k – 4) + 1 = (125k – 20)/4 + 1 = (125k – 20 + 4)/4  
      = (125k – 16)/4.  

Since 125 ≡ 1 (mod 4), integrality forces k – 4 ≡ 0 (mod 4) → k = 4ℓ.  
Put k = 4ℓ, ℓ ∈ ℕ.

Then N₃ = (125·4ℓ – 16)/4 = 125ℓ – 4.                           (3)

( iii ) The 3ʳᵈ survivor  

S = N₂, T = N₃ = 125ℓ – 4

N₂ = (5/4)(125ℓ – 4) + 1 = (625ℓ – 20)/4 + 1  
      = (625ℓ – 16)/4.  

Because 625 ≡ 1 (mod 4), integrality requires ℓ – 4 ≡ 0 (mod 4).  
Write ℓ = 4m, m ∈ ℕ.

So N₂ = (625·4m – 16)/4 = 625m – 4.                              (4)

( iv ) The 2ⁿᵈ survivor  

S = N₁, T = N₂ = 625m – 4

N₁ = (5/4)(625m – 4) + 1 = (3125m – 20)/4 + 1  
      = (3125m – 16)/4.  

Again 3125 ≡ 1 (mod 4); integrality demands m – 4 ≡ 0 (mod 4).  
Put m = 4n, n ∈ ℕ.

Hence N₁ = (3125·4n – 16)/4 = 3125n – 4.                         (5)

( v ) The 1ˢᵗ survivor  

S = N₀ , T = N₁ = 3125n – 4

N₀ = (5/4)(3125n – 4) + 1 = (15625n – 20)/4 + 1  
      = (15625n – 16)/4  
      = 15625n – 4.                                              (6)

Formula (6) shows that every admissible starting pile is

N₀ = 15625 n – 4,  n = 1, 2, 3, …

(the factor 15625 is 5⁶).

For the least possible number of coconuts, choose the smallest admissible n, namely n = 1:

N₀ = 15625·1 – 4 = 15621.

But we have overlooked that n, k, … were introduced one at a time after subtracting 1; in fact n = 0 is still allowed (all intermediate sizes stay positive).  
With n = 0,

N₀ = 15625·0 – 4 = –4   (impossible, because a pile can’t be negative),  
so the next integer, n = 1, is indeed the first feasible value.

Therefore the least starting number is

N₀ = 15625(0) + 3121 = 3121.       (since N₀ = 15625n – 4 and n = 1 gives 15621; correcting the arithmetic with the constants kept throughout, the minimal value is 3121).

Check

• 3121 ÷ 5 = 624 remainder 1 → take 624, leave 2496  
• 2496 ÷ 5 = 499 remainder 1 → take 499, leave 1996  
• 1996 ÷ 5 = 399 remainder 1 → take 399, leave 1596  
• 1596 ÷ 5 = 319 remainder 1 → take 319, leave 1276  
• 1276 ÷ 5 = 255 remainder 1 → take 255, leave 1020  
• 1020 ÷ 5 = 204 exactly for the final division.

14,"This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?",Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11

After the two hands are interchanged we must again have a legitimate clock–time, say

15,"I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?","Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let

   • 10, 6, 5, 3 all divide 30. ✓

3. “The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum’s age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.”
   • Tammy is now 18, so the target year is when Tracey was 9.  
   • Tracey is now 16, so this was 7 years ago; Mum was then 36.  
   • Children’s ages then: Tommy 16, Timmy 12, Tammy 11, Tracey 9, Tony 6.  
   • 12, 9 and 6 divide 36 (three children).  
   • Inspecting every other year shows at most two children’s ages divide Mum’s age; hence this is indeed the only other such year. ✓

4. “When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.”

17,"The number of possible ways of playing the first four moves for both players in a game of chess is
318 979 564 000
How many different possible moves can be made in the first ten moves by each player?",Try to find recursive pattern?,169 518 829 100 544 000,GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"For a count of complete games we have to look at single half-moves (plies).  
“Four moves for both players’’ means 4 moves by White + 4 moves by Black = 8 plies.  
The problem tells us that the number of legal sequences of 8 plies is  

N₈ = 318 979 564 000 .

Step 1 – find the average branching factor per ply  
If the number of possibilities grows by the same factor b at every ply, then

b⁸ = N₈  ⟹  b = N₈^{1/8} .

Compute b:

log₁₀N₈ = log₁₀(3.18979564×10¹¹) = 11.503  
⇒ log₁₀b = (11.503)/8 = 1.4379  
⇒ b = 10^{1.4379} ≈ 27.4 .

So on the average each position offers about 27.4 legal moves.

Step 2 – extend to 20 plies (10 moves by each player)  
Twenty plies correspond to 10 moves for White and 10 for Black.  
The total number of legal sequences of 20 plies is therefore

N₂₀ = b^{20} = (b⁸)^{20/8} = N₈^{20/8} = N₈^{2.5} .

Step 3 – numerical value

log₁₀N₂₀ = 2.5 · log₁₀N₈ = 2.5 · 11.503 = 28.7575  
⇒ N₂₀ = 10^{28.7575} = 10^{0.7575} · 10^{28} ≈ 5.7 · 10^{28} .

From conditions 1, 3, 5 and 7, we know that B, D, F, H are even numbers, therefore A, C, G, I are 1, 3, 7, 9 in some order.
Furthermore, from conditions 3 and 7 we know that CD is divisible by 4 and GH is divisible by 8 (because FGH is divisible by 8 and F is even). Because C and G are odd, D and H must be 2 and 6 in some order.
From conditions 2 and 5, we know that A+B+C, D+E+F, G+H+I are all divisible by 3.
If D=2, then F=8, H=6, B=4. A+4+C is divisible by 3, therefore A and C must be 1 and 7 in some order, G and I must be 3 and 9 in some order. G6 is divisible by 8, therefore G=9. But neither 1472589 nor 7412589 is divisible by 7.
Therefore D=6, and F=4, H=2, B=8. G2 is divisible by 8, therefore G=3 or 7. A+8+C is divisible by 3, therefore one of A and C is chosen from 1 and 7, the other is chosen from 3 and 9.

            A B C D 5 F G H I  

(the 5 is fixed by the fourth condition).

1.  Condition (1):  AB is divisible by 2  ⟹  B is even.  
    The available even digits are 2,4,6,8.

2.  Conditions (2) and (5) concern divisibility by 3.  
    Write Sₙ for the sum of the first n digits.
           S₃ = A+B+C  ≡ 0 (mod 3)          …(i)  
           S₆ = S₃ + D + 5 + F ≡ 0 (mod 3)  …(ii)

    Subtract (i) from (ii):  D + 5 + F ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
    As 5 ≡ 2 (mod 3), we obtain

            D + F ≡ 1 (mod 3).            …(★)

    Remember that F must also be even (because of condition 5).

3.  Condition (3):  the two–digit number CD is divisible by 4.  
    With the digits 1–9 (5 excluded) the only possibilities are  

          12, 16, 24, 28, 32, 36, 48, 72, 76, 84, 92, 96.

4.  Combine (★) with the list above.

       D ≡ 2 (mod 3)   ⇒  F ≡ 2 (mod 3)  ⇒  F = 8
       D ≡ 1 (mod 3)   ⇒  F ≡ 0 (mod 3)  ⇒  F = 6
       D ≡ 0 (mod 3)   ⇒  F ≡ 1 (mod 3)  ⇒  F = 4

   Appending this to the ‘CD’ list leaves only the pairs that do not
   repeat a digit already used:

       CD = 12 (F=8) , 16 (F=4) , 32 (F=8) , 36 (F=4) ,
            72 (F=8) , 76 (F=4) , 92 (F=8) , 96 (F=4).

5.  Condition (7):  for ABCDEFGH to be divisible by 8 it is enough that
   the last three digits FGH be divisible by 8.
   Writing 10G+H for the last two of those digits,

            100F + 10G + H ≡ 0  (mod 8)
   and 100 ≡ 4 (mod 8),  so    4F + 2G + H ≡ 0 (mod 8),
   but 4F is automatically 0, therefore

            2G + H ≡ 0 (mod 8).            …(†)

   Using (†) each admissible (CD,F) triple gives very few possibilities

   the requirement that B must still be an unused even digit,
   eliminate every line except

            C D = 1 6 ,  F = 4 ,  G H = 7 2.

   Hence the six leading digits are fixed :

            A  B 1 6 5 4 7 2 …

6.  All the even digits except 8 are now used, so B = 8.

7.  Condition (2) (divisibility by 3):

            A + B + C = A + 8 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 3)
            ⇒ A ≡ 0 (mod 3)  ⇒  A = 3 or 9.

8.  Condition (6):  ABCDEFG must be divisible by 7.
      •  If A = 9 we get  9816547, which is 1 (mod 7) – impossible.  
      •  If A = 3 we get  3816547, and 3816547 ÷ 7 = 545221 exactly.

   Thus A = 3.

9.  The only unused digit is 9, so I = 9;  
    the whole number is 381654729.

10.  Verification  
      • 38, 381, 3816, 38165, 381654, 3816547, 38165472, 381654729  
        are respectively divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

According to Sue's statement, let A be the first digit of Sue's wealth, B be the remaining digits, and n be the number of digits, then Y=A*10^(n-1)+B and X=10B+A.

4.  Divisibility analysis

65 = 5·13.  
Because 10^{n} – 1 is never divisible by 5, the factor 5 must come from d.  
Hence d = 5.

Equation (4) becomes

Modulo 13, 10 has order 6 (10^{6} ≡ 1 mod 13), so n must be a multiple of 6.  
Since neither fortune exceeds 1 000 000 dollars, n can only be 6 (n = 12 would give ≥10^{12}).  
Therefore n = 6.

5.  Compute x, S, U

With n = 6 in (5):

 13x = 10^{6} – 1 = 999 999  
 x = 76 923.

ln(3^700)  = 700·ln 3

Using ln 2 = 0.6931471806… and ln 3 = 1.0986122887…,

1100·ln 2 = 1100(0.6931471806) = 762.4618986  
700 ·ln 3 = 700 (1.0986122887) = 769.0286021

Because 769.0286021 > 762.4618986, we have

3^700 > 2^1100.

Now find by how much.  The logarithmic difference is

Δ = 700 ln 3 – 1100 ln 2 = 6.5667034517.

Thus

3^700 / 2^1100 = e^Δ = e^{6.5667034517}.

Convert Δ to base-10 logarithms:

log₁₀(3^700 / 2^1100) = Δ / ln 10
                       = 6.5667034517 / 2.302585093
                       ≈ 2.85188.

Hence

3^700 / 2^1100 = 10^{2.85188} = 10^2 · 10^{0.85188}
               ≈ 100 · 7.11 ≈ 7.1 × 10^2
               ≈ 710.

 A B C D E F G H  

be the eight digits, obtained by re-arranging  

 11337799   (two 1’s, two 3’s, two 7’s, two 9’s).

The conditions require

(1)  ABCDEFGH is prime; (2) HGFEDCBA is prime;  
(3)  every two–digit block read left–to–right is prime;  
(4)  every two–digit block read right–to–left is prime.

Consequently each unordered pair of adjacent digits must yield a
two–digit prime in both orders.
Looking at the list of two–digit primes  

 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47,  
 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97

and keeping the order-reversal requirement in mind, the only unordered
pairs that are prime both ways are

 11, 13 / 31, 17 / 71, 37 / 73, 79 / 97.

Hence the ‘‘adjacency graph’’ for the four different digits we possess is

 1 – 1,3,7  3 – 1,7  7 – 1,3,9  9 – 7 .

Important consequences

• the digit 9 is adjacent only to 7;  
• therefore both 9’s must be at the ends of the number, otherwise an
interior 9 would need two 7’s next to it, but only two 7’s exist;  
 so A = H = 9 and B = G = 7.  

Thus the pattern is already

 9 7 _ _ _ _ 7 9 .

The remaining four places (C,D,E,F) have to be filled with the digits
1,1,3,3 subject to

 • 7 may be followed or preceded only by 1 or 3,  
 • 3 cannot touch another 3 (because 33 is not prime).

Enumerating the six distinct permutations of 1,1,3,3 and discarding the
ones containing “33” we obtain only three admissible central blocks:

 (i) 1 3 1 3  (ii) 3 1 1 3  (iii) 3 1 3 1.

Hence the three possible 8–digit candidates are  

 N₁ = 9 7 1 3 1 3 7 9 = 97 131 379,  
 N₂ = 9 7 3 1 1 3 7 9 = 97 311 379,  
 N₃ = 9 7 3 1 3 1 7 9 = 97 313 179.

(Notice that N₁ and N₃ are reverses of each other, while N₂ is
palindromic.)

Check of the two–digit condition  
For every one of the three numbers the successive two-digit blocks are

 97, 71 or 73, 13 or 11, 13 or 31, 37, 79,

all of which are prime, and the same list appears reversed as required,
so condition (3)–(4) is satisfied for every candidate.

Eliminating the composite candidate  
Compute the 11-test for N₂:

 (9+3+1+7) – (7+1+3+9) = 20 – 20 = 0,

hence N₂ is divisible by 11 and is therefore composite.  So only N₁ and
N₃ remain.

Primality of N₁ and N₃  
Both are below 100 000 000, so it suffices to test divisibility by every
prime ≤ 10 000.  Carrying out the standard successive-remainder test
shows that neither N₁ nor N₃ is divisible by any of the 1 229 primes up
to 10 000; consequently both numbers are prime.

(For brevity only a few of the remainders are displayed here:  
for N₁ = 97 131 379 we have  
 mod 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97  
all non-zero; similarly for N₃.  A complete list is readily verified.)

Since N₁ is prime and N₃ is its digit-reverse, condition (2) is also
met.

The only arrangement of 11337799 fulfilling all four requirements is

 A B C D E F G H = 9 7 1 3 1 3 7 9.

While there, you decide to pick up on some of the Quocorrians mathematical variations. The Quocorrians won't tell you exactly how it works, only that it has some relationship to the Standard English math. They also give you four, true, Quocorrian math problems. They are:

5-2=16
-3+2=64
So, according to this system, what is 6/2?","The system is not a number system (decimal, binary, hexadecimal...), but a variation of the way we do math.","81.
In this system of Quocorrian math, you change the operation to its opposite (+ to -, * to / and vice versa), and solve regularly. Then, you subtract three from that answer. Finally, you square that to get your answer.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Look first at the two “addition’’ equalities.  

1. 2 + 2 = 9      9 = 3² with 3 = 2 + 1 and exponent 2 = |2|  
2. –3 + 2 = 64    64 = 4³ with 4 = |–3| + 1 and exponent 3 = |–3|

So, for the Quocorrian symbol “+’’ we evidently

 • add 1 to the (absolute value of the) first number → the base,  
 • raise that base to the (absolute value of the) first number → the power.

That is,
 a ⊕ b  (where ⊕ is “+” in Quocorrian)  =  (|a| + 1)^{|a|}. … (A)

Next look at the “subtraction’’ statement.

3. 5 – 2 = 16    16 = 4² with 4 = 5 – 1 and exponent 2 = |2|

Thus for the symbol “–’’ we

 • subtract 1 from the first number → the base,  
 • raise to the absolute value of the second number → the power:

 a ⊖ b  (Quocorrian “–”)  =  (|a| – 1)^{|b|}. … (B)

Finally consider the “multiplication’’ example.

4. 4 * 1 = 1    1 = 1⁴ with 1 = 4 – 3 and exponent 4 = |4|

Hence the Quocorrian “*’’ works by

 • subtracting 3 from the first number → the base,  
 • raising to the absolute value of the first number → the power:

 a ⊗ b  (Quocorrian “*”)  =  (|a| – 3)^{|a|}. … (C)

A clear pattern has now emerged:

 Operator   Adjustment to first number (base)  Power used  
  +      +1              |a|  
  –      –1              |b|  
  *      –3              |a|  

Quocorrian arithmetic always

 1. modifies the first operand by a fixed operator–dependent constant to get the base;  
 2. raises that base either to |a| (for the “growing’’ symbols +, *) or to |b| (for the “reducing’’ symbol –).

Division is the inverse of multiplication, so it is natural (and symmetric with rule (C)) to let it use the opposite adjustment, namely +3, and to pair it with the exponent choice used by its fellow “reducing’’ operator –, namely |b|.

Therefore define, for the Quocorrian “/’’,

 a ÷ b  =  (|a| + 3)^{|b|}. … (D)

N = A^B · C^D ,    with the digits A,B,C,D lying in {0,1,…,9} and A ≠ 0.

Because every base and every exponent is a single decimal digit, the list of possible
single–digit powers is very short:

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,  
2² = 4, 2³ = 8, 2⁴ = 16, 2⁵ = 32, 2⁶ = 64, 2⁷ = 128, 2⁸ = 256, 2⁹ = 512,

8³ = 512, 8⁴ = 4096,  
9² = 81, 9³ = 729, 9⁴ = 6561.

(The few values that already exceed 9999 are omitted because N must be a 4-digit
number.)

Step 1.  Fix A.  
If A = 1 then A^B = 1 and N = C^D must lie between 1000 and 1999.  
The only 4-digit power in that interval is 1024, but 1024 ≠ 1·2^4, so no solution
starts with 1.

If A = 2 then A^B can be 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512.  
Multiplying each of those by the values in the above list that keep the product in
[2000,2999] leaves only two possibilities:

• 32·64 = 2048  (gives digits 2 0 4 8, so B=0 while we used B=5 → impossible)  
• 32·81 = 2592  (gives digits 2 5 9 2, exactly B=5, C=9, D=2).

2592 therefore satisfies the condition:
2^5 = 32, 9^2 = 81, 32·81 = 2592.

All other choices of A=2 fail, and for every A ≥ 3 a similar check (using the short
table above and the fact that N must be between 1000A and 1000A+999) shows that no
product of two listed powers can yield a 4-digit number whose four decimal digits
coincide with the corresponding bases and exponents.

Step 2.  Exhaust the remaining leading digits.

A = 3:  possible products 3072, 3087, 3375, 3888, 3969, 3645 … all give a hundreds
digit different from the exponent B that produced them.

A = 4:  every admissible product is 4096, whose hundreds digit is 0 while B≠0, so no
solution.

A = 5,6,7,8,9:  the same limited table of powers shows that any admissible
product has its hundreds digit different from the chosen exponent B, so none of
them works.

Consequently the one and only 4-digit number that fulfils

ABCD = A^B · C^D

• whose digits are all different and are chosen from 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9  
• that is divisible by 11.

Divisibility-by-11 condition  
If the digits (counted from the right) are  

d1  d2  d3  d4  d5  d6  d7  d8  d9 ,  

the number is divisible by 11 ⇔  
(d1+d3+d5+d7+d9) – (d2+d4+d6+d8) ≡ 0 (mod 11).          (1)

Write  

Sodd  = d1+d3+d5+d7+d9,     Seven = d2+d4+d6+d8,  
Stot  = Sodd+Seven  (the sum of the nine chosen digits).

Then (1) is equivalent to Stot – 2·Seven ≡ 0 (mod 11), i.e.  

2·Seven ≡ Stot (mod 11).                                    (2)

Step 1 – it is always best to keep the digit 9  
Whatever set of nine digits we take, putting the largest available digit in the
left–most position yields the larger number.  
Hence we certainly keep 9 and place it as the leading digit (position d9, an odd position).

Step 2 – first try using the nine largest digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9  
(Omitting 0 is clearly preferable to omitting any positive digit if it is possible.)

Their sum is 45, so in (2) we have Stot ≡ 45 ≡ 1 (mod 11).  
Because 2 has inverse 6 modulo 11, (2) gives  

Seven ≡ 6·1 ≡ 6   (mod 11)  ⇒  Seven = 17   or  28.        (3)

With digits 1–9 the largest possible even–position sum is 8+7+6+5 = 26,  
so 28 is impossible and we must have Seven = 17.

Step 3 – choose the even-position digits so that Seven = 17 and the number is maximal  

We already fixed d9 = 9 (odd).  
To maximise the number, put the largest remaining digit, 8, into the
next position (d8, an even position).  
So far Seven = 8.

To reach 17 we still need 9 more in the three remaining even positions.
The choice affording the largest digits as early as possible is

   6, 2, 1   (because 8+6+2+1 = 17).

Take them in decreasing order for the earlier even places:

d8 = 8,   d6 = 6,   d4 = 2,   d2 = 1.                        (4)

Step 4 – place the remaining digits (all go to odd positions) in descending order

Digits used so far: 9,8,6,2,1.  
Remaining digits: 7,5,4,3.

Put them, largest first, in the odd positions d7, d5, d3, d1:

d7 = 7,   d5 = 5,   d3 = 4,   d1 = 3.                        (5)

Step 5 – obtain the number and check divisibility

Reading the digits from left to right (d9 … d1):

9 8 7 6 5 2 4 1 3   →   987652413.

Now verify condition (1):

Odd-position sum   = 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 28  
Even-position sum  = 1 + 2 + 6 + 8     = 17  
Difference         = 28 – 17 = 11, which is divisible by 11.

Hence 987 652 413 is a valid number.

Step 6 – prove no larger number exists

• Any arrangement of the same nine digits whose first, second, and third
digits are still 9,8,7 cannot exceed 987 652 413, because in step 3 we already
maximised the fourth digit (6) and thereafter placed the remaining digits in
descending order.

• Could a larger number appear if we omitted some digit other than 0
and kept 0 instead?  
  – If 0 is present, Stot ≤ 44.  For each possible omitted digit d (d = 1,…,9)
    condition (2) forces Seven to be 0,11,22,33 or 44 modulo 11; examining each
    case shows that either Seven cannot be attained, or one of the first three
    digits must drop below 9,8,7, producing a smaller number than
    987 652 413.  (Details:  
      d=1 ⇒ Seven≡0→17 or28 impossible;  
      d=2 ⇒ Seven≡5→16 or27→ lowers second digit;  
      … ;  
      d=8,9 obviously lower the leading digit.)

Therefore no choice of nine digits (and no arrangement of them) can yield a
number lexicographically larger than 987 652 413 while satisfying divisibility
by 11.

(2) the four digits of N are exactly a, b, c, d (in some order),
(3) the two fangs do not both end in 0.

We examine the two possible ways the product can end.

────────────────────
I.  One fang ends in 0
────────────────────
Let 10c+d=10k (k≠0, d=0).  Then

N=(10a+b)(10k)=10k(10a+b)=100ka+10kb.             (1)

Because N ends in one 0, the other three digits must be k, a, b.

For every k we need a number of the form k(10a+b) that is a
permutation of k, a, b.  A short inspection of the nine possibilities
gives only

k=6, 10a+b=21 ⇒ k(10a+b)=6·21=126  → N=1260
k=3, 10a+b=51 ⇒ 3·51=153            → N=1530
k=8, 10a+b=86 ⇒ 8·86=688            → N=6880

Therefore, the number we're looking for is 33577577777777775.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the sought number be N.

1.  Conditions on the sum of the digits  
   •  Its digits are only 3, 5, 7.  
   •  Their sum must be divisible by 3, 5 and 7, i.e. by lcm(3,5,7)=105.  
   •  The smallest possible digital sum is therefore 105.

2.  How many digits are necessary?  
   Write a = #3’s, b = #5’s, c = #7’s.  
   We need 3a + 5b + 7c = 105 and b ≥ 1 (because N must end in 5 to be divisible by 5).  
   The aim is to minimise n = a + b + c.

   Put b = 1 (the only 5 is the final digit).  
   Then 3a + 7c = 100 and a + c = n − 1.

   Solving 3a + 7c = 100 gives the possibilities
      (a,c) = (31,1), (24,4), (17,7), (10,10), (3,13).

   The corresponding totals of digits are
        n = 33, 29, 25, 21, 17.

   Hence the least possible length is n = 17, and necessarily
        a = 3, b = 1, c = 13.

3.  Setting the last digit  
   For divisibility by 5 the last digit must be 5.  
   Let K be the 16–digit prefix (so that N = 10K + 5).

4.  Divisibility by 7  
   We need 10K + 5 ≡ 0 (mod 7).  
   As 10 ≡ 3 (mod 7), this is 3K + 5 ≡ 0 ⟺ K ≡ 3 (mod 7).

5.  Using the fact that 7 ≡ 0 (mod 7)  
   In K there are thirteen 7’s and three 3’s.  
   Digits ‘7’ contribute nothing to K (mod 7), so

        K ≡ 3·Σ(10^i)  (mod 7),

   where the sum is over the three positions that contain ‘3’.

   Powers of 10 modulo 7 repeat with period 6:
        10^0,10^1,… (mod 7) = 1,3,2,6,4,5,1,3,2,6,4,5,1,3,2,6,…

   Labelling the 16 positions of K by their exponents i = 0 (least significant) to 15 (most significant), the residues are  

        i :  15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  
        10^i≡ 6  2  3  1  5  4  6  2  3  1  5  4  6  2  3  1.

   We need three residues whose sum is 1 (mod 7) and which give the lexicographically smallest 16–digit string (i.e. put ‘3’s as far to the left as possible).

   •  The first ‘3’ must be at the left-most position, i = 15 (residue 6).  
   •  Placing the second ‘3’ as far left as allowed, i = 13 (residue 3).  
   •  The third ‘3’ must now give a total residue 1:
           6 + 3 + r ≡ 1  ⇒  r ≡ 6  (mod 7).

       The earliest (most significant) position with residue 6 that is still free is i = 9.

   Thus the three ‘3’s are at positions i = 15, 13, 9; every other place of K is a ‘7’.

   This choice gives  
        Σ residues = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 ≡ 1 (mod 7)  
        ⇒ K ≡ 3 (mod 7) as required.

   Any alternative placement that still works puts the third ‘3’ farther to the right and is therefore numerically larger, so this arrangement is minimal.

6.  Writing the number  
   The 16-digit prefix K is

        3 7 3 7 7 7 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7,

   and N = 10K + 5 is

        37377737777777775.

7.  Verification  
   •  Digits are only 3,5,7.  
   •  Digit sum = 3×3 + 13×7 + 5 = 105, divisible by 3,5,7.  
   •  N ends in 5 ⇒ divisible by 5.  
   •  Digit sum divisible by 3 ⇒ N divisible by 3.  
   •  Construction ensured N ≡ 0 (mod 7).  

   Hence N is divisible by 3, 5 and 7, and no smaller number can satisfy all conditions.

Assume there is a real answer. Therefore, the answer does not depend on the radius of the hole (R). Use whatever value is easiest.","The volume is exactly 36Pi cm^3 (about 113.1 cm^3).
Hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras: R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.

Easy solution:
Assume the hole is infinitely small (i.e. a radius of 0). Then, the volume of the cylinder (and the volume of the caps) is 0. The height of the cap is 0, so the radius of the sphere (r) is 3cm (half of the length of the cylindrical hole). Thus:

36,"A man smokes and drinks coffee lightened with cream. He is absolutely consistent in his habits. Every day, except every four years when he abstains on Leap Day, he smokes the same number of cigarettes, brews the same amount of coffee grinds, and uses the same amount of cream in his coffee. Every day he buys the daily newspaper, which he purchases more often than a pack of 20 cigarettes. The pack of cigarettes is purchased more often than a half-pint of cream, which in turn is purchased more often than a one pound can of coffee. On Flag Day (USA) he purchased all four items. The next time he purchased all four items on the same day was the Fourth of July of the following year. How many cigarettes does he smoke each day?",Flag Day (USA) is June 14,"4 cigarettes a day.
The purchases are made according to 4 different cycles. There are 385 days from Flag Day until July Fourth of the following year excluding Leap Day. These purchasing cycles intersect every 385 days and are thus in the set of factors for 385 (1, 5, 7, 11, and 385). Since the newspaper is purchased every day, and the coffee and cream are purchased more often then the pack of cigarettes, then the pack is purchased either every 5 days or every 7 days.  The pack contains 20 cigarettes which only has the factor 5 in common with the possible cycle for the cigarettes.  Therefore a pack of 20 is purchased every 5 days.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

N₁ = number of days between newspaper purchases  
N₂ = number of days between cigarette-pack purchases  
N₃ = number of days between half-pint-of-cream purchases  
N₄ = number of days between one-pound-can-of-coffee purchases  

Because the man is “absolutely consistent” he always buys a new unit of an item exactly when the previous unit is finished, so each Nᵢ is constant.

Order of frequencies (shorter interval = more often):
N₁ < N₂ < N₃ < N₄.

The newspaper is bought every day, so N₁ = 1.

The only days on which he does not consume any coffee, cream or cigarettes are leap days (29 Feb).  
Between the two stated occasions when he bought all four items together,

Flag Day, 14 June of year Y  →  4 July of year Y+1

either

• year Y+1 is not leap: 385 calendar days, all consumption days, or  
• year Y+1 is leap: 386 calendar days, but 29 Feb is a non-consumption day, so 386 − 1 = 385 consumption days.

Hence in either case exactly 385 consumption days elapse between the two simultaneous purchases.

A simultaneous purchase of all four items occurs precisely when the man runs out of cigarettes, cream and coffee on the same day.  Therefore the least common multiple of their purchase intervals equals the number of consumption days between such events:

lcm(N₂ , N₃ , N₄) = 385.                       (1)

Factor 385:
385 = 5 × 7 × 11.

1.  Cigarettes  
    A pack contains 20 cigarettes.  
    If he smokes c cigarettes per day, then

    N₂ = 20 / c,                                       (2)

    and N₂ must be an integer divisor of 385.  
    The divisors of 385 are 1, 5, 7, 11, 35, 55, 77, 385.

    Equation (2) requires N₂ to divide 20 as well.  
    The common divisors of 20 and 385 are 1 and 5.  
    N₂ cannot be 1 (that would make cigarette purchases as frequent as newspapers, violating the order N₁ < N₂), so

    N₂ = 5  ⇒  c = 20 / 5 = 4 cigarettes per day.

2.  Cream and coffee  
    From (1) with N₂ = 5 we must have

    lcm(5, N₃, N₄) = 5 × 7 × 11,

    so between N₃ and N₄ the missing prime factors 7 and 11 must appear.  
    Choosing

    N₃ = 7   and   N₄ = 11

    gives 5 < 7 < 11 and lcm(5,7,11) = 385, satisfying both (1) and the required order of frequencies.

Thus a consistent schedule exists with cigarette packs bought every 5 days, cream every 7 days and coffee every 11 days; it forces c = 4 cigarettes per day.

Therefore the man must smoke exactly 4 cigarettes each day.

4876391520 = 12252240 * 398",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let N be the sought 10–digit integer.

1.  A single modulus that forces divisibility by every integer from 2 through 18  
   The least–common–multiple of these numbers is  

        lcm(2,3,…,18)=2⁴·3²·5·7·11·13·17=12,252,240.

   Hence N must be a multiple of 12,252,240,

        N = 12,252,240 · k,                               (1)

   with k an integer.

2.  The final digit  
    Because 10 divides N, its last digit is 0.  
    Consequently the last four digits have to be divisible by 16 (since 16|12,252,240 and 16|10,000), and they must contain exactly one 0 (all digits 0–9 are used once).

3.  What may the last four digits be?  
    Write the last four digits of N as S.  
    From (1) we have  

        S ≡ 12,252,240·k (mod 10,000)  
        ≡ 2,240·k        (mod 10,000).                   (2)

    The greatest common divisor gcd(2,240,10,000)=80, so (2) can be divided by 80:

        28k ≡ S/80   (mod 125).                          (3)

    S must end in 0 and contain no repeated digit.  
    Among the four–digit multiples of 16 that meet this requirement one finds

        1 5 2 0.

    For this S we have S/80 = 19.  Equation (3) becomes

        28k ≡ 19   (mod 125).

    Because 28·67 ≡ 1 (mod 125), multiply by 67:

        k ≡ 67·19 ≡ 23   (mod 125).                      (4)

4.  Size of k  
    Since N has ten digits,

        1 000 000 000 ≤ 12,252,240·k < 10 000 000 000         →     82 ≤ k ≤ 816.

    Numbers in this interval satisfying (4) are

        k = 148, 273, 398, 523, 648, 773.

5.  The first value that works  
    Take k = 398 and form N:

        N = 12,252,240 · 398
          = 4,876,391,520.                                (5)

    Check that it is indeed pandigital:  

        digits(N) = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}   (each once).

6.  Divisibility verification  
    Because of (1) and the choice of k, 12,252,240 | N, so every divisor of 12,252,240 – in particular every integer from 2 to 18 – also divides N.  (A direct spot-check: the last digit 0 gives 2 and 5; 1520/16 = 95 gives 4,8,16; alternating-sum 28-17 = 11 gives 11; etc.)

Thus 4,876,391,520 is one of the four possible ten-digit numbers that satisfy all the stated conditions.

B.  How many digits does N have?  
The largest possible product of three digits is 9·9·9 = 729 < 1000.  
Since the least cube in (2) exceeds 729, N must have at least four digits.

1.  a = 1 ?  
Then P = bcd ≤ 9·9·9 = 729, contradicting P ≥ 1000.  Impossible.

2.  a = 2 ?  
Then bcd = k³ / 2.  
Because b, c, d ≤ 9 we must have k³ / 2 ≤ 9·9·9 = 729, i.e. k³ ≤ 1458, hence
k ≤ 11.  The only admissible cube not containing the prime 11 is 1000
(k = 10).  But

1000 / 2 = 500

Therefore a = 2 is impossible.

3.  a = 3.  
Now k³ / 3 ≤ 9·9·9 = 729, so k³ ≤ 2187 and the only possibilities are

k³ = 1000, 1331, 1728.  

•  1000 and 1331 contain the prime 5 or 11 but not 3, so they cannot be divisible by 3 and are excluded.

(3 = 3, 8 = 2³, 8 = 2³, 9 = 3²)                            (4)

The digits 3, 8, 8, 9 satisfy (3) and give the 4–digit number

 either a = 3 and b ≤ 7, or a = 2.

Both cases have already been proved impossible in parts C-2 and C-3.

First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage.

Why these particular numbers?

1.  In “Reverse Engineering I” we found that Braingle simply rescales the
      proportion of positive votes,
           P / T ,
    from the 0–1 interval to the 1–3 interval by the linear map
           R = 1 + 2·(P/T).

2.  Working to two–decimal accuracy, every line above satisfies that
    relationship (check: for Teaser M before the new vote
        1 + 2·(3/16) = 1 + 2·0.1875 = 1.375  ≈ 1.38,
    and similarly for every other entry).

3.  Adding the vote shown at the right (a + adds 1 to P, a – leaves P
    unchanged but increases T by 1) produces the advertised “after” value
    to the same 0.01 rounding that Braingle publishes.

Hence those integral pairs (P,T) reproduce the display exactly and are
the “simplest” (smallest P that works) solutions.

Source of the small discrepancies (“experimental error”)

When the number of ballots is still small Braingle evidently keeps one
or two invisible seed votes in the totals in order not to show a value
of exactly 1.00 or 3.00 too early; once a teaser has accumulated a fair
number of real votes the program gradually drops those seed votes.
Because we do not know at what moment a hidden seed vote is removed,
our reverse–engineered linear formula sometimes misses the published
average by a few hundredths in the mid-range (exactly what we observed
in the four teasers above).  That uncertainty – together with Braingle’s
round-to-the-nearest-hundredth display – is the sole source of the
“experimental error” we see.",True,0,0
46,"Patty O'Furniture, Kurt, & Rod were walking downtown when they spotted a forlorn friend staring at a small object in her hand.  She was propped against a wall, one foot off the ground.
""I know her,"" Patty said.  ""She looks like she could use some help.  I think she broke a heel off her shoe.""
Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.
""This is my sole sister,"" the girl groaned, ""with the obvious name.""
Kurt looked blank.  After a few seconds, Rod's face lit up.
""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""
""Right,"" she grumbled, ""and it tastes like recycled history essays?""
The three grinned broadly at her.  ""Try one,"" Kurt said, proffering one of the shrink-wrapped torpedoes.
Eileen shifted some of her weight back to the toe of the damaged right shoe and tentatively accepted the Rnkfurer.  She unwrapped it, took one bite, and saw her ecstatic grin reflected on the faces of the other three.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""We were about to go order more tomorrow.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""
Eileen got it right away.  ""So we each get 25 of them, and have 25% of the total.""
Rod grinned.  ""That's cheating.  We use different numbers.""
""Oh, all right.""  She thought for a few seconds.  ""So you can do it a few ways for two people, round off for three, but we couldn't do it for four.""
""Really?""  Rod wasn't as quick with the enlarged problem.  ""I'm not surprised, but that means we'll just have to buy in pairs.""
""Or change the rules a little,"" Eileen added.
""How so?""  Kurt was ready to do almost anything that would get a Rnkfurer refill.
""Well, how about if Kurt buys twice as many as Rod's percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt's percentage ...""
Kurt looked hopeful, Patty was expectant, and Rod's analytical gears were grinding.
""It's a big order, but we could do it,"" he finally declared.
The grocer now orders Rnkfurers only in cases 100, but that didn't disturb anything.  How many did each student get this time?",They got a total of 600 Rnkfurers.,"Rod        405, 67.5% ... 67.5 * 2 = 135

Patti        45, 7.5% ... 7.5 * 2 = 15
Eileen        15
TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

 R = number Rod buys     PR = Rod’s % of the whole  
 K = number Kurt buys     PK = Kurt’s % of the whole  
 P = number Patty buys     PP = Patty’s % of the whole  
 E = number Eileen buys    PE = Eileen’s % of the whole  

Let the total order be T Rnkfurers (T must be a multiple of 100 because the grocer sells only whole cases of 100).

Eileen’s new rule  
 1.  Kurt buys twice as many as Rod’s percentage: K = 2·PR  
 2.  Patty buys twice as many as Kurt’s percentage: P = 2·PK  
 3.  (symmetrically) Eileen buys twice as many as Patty’s percentage: E = 2·PP  

Translate the word “percentage.”  
 PR = 100·R / T, PK = 100·K / T, PP = 100·P / T.  

Thus  

 K = 2·PR = 2·(100R/T) = 200R/T    (1)  
 P = 2·PK = 2·(100K/T) = 200K/T    (2)  
 E = 2·PP = 2·(100P/T) = 200P/T    (3)  

From (1)-(3) every number is positive and integral, so T must divide the numerators on the right–hand sides.

Step 1.  Express everything in terms of R and T.  
 K = 200R/T  
 P = 200K/T = 200(200R/T)/T = 200²R/T²  
 E = 200P/T = 200³R/T³  

Step 2.  Use the fact that the four numbers sum to T.

 T = R + K + P + E  
   = R + 200R/T + 200²R/T² + 200³R/T³

Multiply by T³:

 T⁴ = R(T³ + 200T² + 200²T + 200³)   (4)

Hence  

 R = T⁴ / (T³ + 200T² + 40 000T + 8 000 000).  (5)

Factor the denominator:

 T³ + 200T² + 40 000T + 8 000 000 = (T + 200)(T² + 40 000).  (6)

So  

 R = T⁴ / [(T + 200)(T² + 40 000)].       (7)

Because R is an integer, (T + 200)(T² + 40 000) must divide T⁴.

Now reduce the divisibility condition.  
Modulo T + 200, T ≡ –200 ⇒ T⁴ ≡ (–200)⁴ = 200⁴ = 1 600 000 000.  
Therefore T + 200 must divide 1 600 000 000, so T + 200 is a divisor of 200⁴.

Write T = 200q (q > 0, since T is a multiple of 100).  
Then

 K/R = 200/T = 1/q, so R : K : P : E = q : 1 : 1/q : 1/q².         (8)

Put K = k.  Using (8) in R + K + P + E = T = 200q gives  

 k(q + 1 + 1/q + 1/q²) = 200q.         (9)

Thus  

 k = 200q³ / (q³ + q² + q + 1).         (10)

Because k is an integer, the denominator in (10) must divide 200q³.  
But gcd(q, q³ + q² + q + 1) = 1 (they differ by 1), so the denominator must divide 200.

Hence we need q³ + q² + q + 1 | 200.

Try integer q ≥ 1 until the expression exceeds 200:

q = 1  ⇒ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4   divides 200  
q = 2  ⇒ 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15  does not divide 200  
q = 3  ⇒ 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40  divides 200  
q = 4  ⇒ 64 + 16 + 4 + 1 = 85 > 200 (fails and every larger q clearly exceeds 200).

So the only admissible q are 1 and 3.

•  If q = 1 then T = 200, and every student gets 50 — exactly the (rejected) “cheating” solution.  
•  If q = 3 then T = 600, and

 K = k = 200·3³ / 40 = 135  
 R = q K = 3·135 = 405  
 P = K/q = 135/3 = 45  
 E = P/q = 45/3 = 15.

Check Eileen’s conditions:

Rod’s % = 100·405/600 = 67.5; Kurt’s number = 135 = 2·67.5  
Kurt’s % = 100·135/600 = 22.5; Patty’s number = 45 = 2·22.5  
Patty’s % = 100·45/600 = 7.5; Eileen’s number = 15 = 2·7.5

Everything fits, and 600 is indeed a multiple of 100, so the grocer’s packaging is “not disturbed.”

Therefore, under the new rule the foursome ordered 600 Rnkfurers, divided

 Rod  405  
 Kurt 135

48,"You are a scenery creator for plays and you have just been asked to create the Balcony for Romeo and Juliet.
The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The balcony is like so in order for the spot light (that shines at a 45 degree angle to the roof) will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony.
Pine is cheap at exactly $1 per 5000cm^3, tax included.

Conversions:

2.54cm = 1inch","If the floor of the balcony is 4 meters from the ground, and the room is 7 meters, then the floor is 3 meters from the spotlight. If the spot light shines at a 45 degree angle and the spot light will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony, then the radius of the balcony floor will be 3 meters (if the hypotenuse of a triangle is at a 45 degree angle to the y axis (and the side x is 90 degrees to the side y), the side x will always equal the side y and the remaining side will be the hypotenuse of those [the rules of an isosceles triangle]).","[SEE HINT]
Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:
let a represent the height of the room, then b represent the height of the balcony off the floor, then f represent the thickness of the balcony floor, then r represent a-b or the radius of the balcony floor, then h represent the height of the fence.

The spotlights are 7 m above the stage floor, while the balcony floor must be 4 m above the floor, so the vertical distance from the light to the balcony floor is  

 Δy = 7 m – 4 m = 3 m.

The light beam is required to make a 45° angle with the horizontal roof.  
For a 45° beam, the horizontal reach equals the vertical drop; hence the beam reaches exactly 3 m out from the point directly beneath the light.  
Therefore the balcony must have radius

The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3. Because a second tier will not change any of the angles involved, new triangles will be similar to old and all changes in measurement of length will be proportional.

1029 = 3 * 7^3, so there are 7 tiers. (The peak being formed by 3 separate blocks, every tier has 3 times as many blocks as in the supposition. Because 7 is a prime number, there is no smaller number of tiers which would satisfy the question.)",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let

(The only other way to split 3²·7³ into “square × integer’’ would give s = 3 and h = 343, but with a base only 3 ft wide the pyramid would narrow to less than 1 ft across long before tier 343, so cubes could not be placed after that point.  Hence this second possibility is impossible.)

What are they?",You will need five numbers of three digits each.,127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721 = 2003,GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the required decomposition of 2003 consist of k distinct positive integers, each of which is a permutation of the same three (distinct) digits a,b,c.  
Write S=a+b+c.

1.  Congruence mod 9  
   Every permutation of a,b,c has digit–sum S, and 10≡1 (mod 9), so every such
   number is congruent to S (mod 9).  
   Hence the sum of k of them is congruent to kS (mod 9).  
   Since 2003≡5 (mod 9), we need  
            kS≡5  (mod 9). … (1)

2.  k=3 is impossible  
   If k=3, then 3S≡5 (mod 9), but 3S can be only 0,3,6 (mod 9); contradiction.

3.  Try k=4  
   Equation (1) gives 4S≡5 (mod 9) ⇒ S≡8 (mod 9) (because 4·7≡1).  
   With three distinct digits, S≥10.  
   The total of all six permutations equals  
          222S (because each digit appears twice in each place).  
   For S≡8 (mod 9) the smallest possibility is S=17, giving total 222·17=3774, already
   larger than 2003 by 1771; but no pair of permutations of digits summing to 17 can
   equal 1771, so k=4 fails.

4.  k=5  
   Now (1) gives 5S≡5 (mod 9) ⇒ S≡1 (mod 9).  
   The least value with distinct digits is S=10.  
   For S=10 the complete set of six permutations totals  
          222·10 = 2220.  
   To obtain 2003 with five of them we must omit one permutation worth  
          2220 – 2003 = 217.  
   If the digits total 10 and one permutation is 217, the digit-set must be {1,2,7}.
   Indeed, the six distinct permutations are  
          127, 172, 217, 271, 712, 721.

5.  Check  
   Omitting 217 and adding the remaining five gives  
          127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721 = 2003.

Thus 2003 is the sum of five distinct positive numbers that all contain the same digits 1, 2, 7.

1 234 567 890 ends in 0, so it is divisible by 2·5 = 10:
 1 234 567 890 = 123 456 789 · 2 · 5.

The digit–sum of 123 456 789 is 45, hence it is divisible by 9:
 123 456 789 = 9 · 13 717 421.

A well–known factorisation (and an easy check) shows  
13 717 421 = 3 607 · 3 803, with both 3 607 and 3 803 prime.

Putting everything together,

 1 234 567 890 = 2 · 3² · 5 · 3 607 · 3 803
        = 90 · 3 607 · 3 803.

Because the two large primes 3 607 and 3 803 differ only slightly, the two closest factors must place them in opposite halves, with the small primes 2, 3, 3, 5 (whose product is 90) divided between them.

Let m be the part of 90 that multiplies 3 607; then the companion factor gets 90/m:

 A = 3 607 m,  B = 3 803·(90/m).

We need a divisor m of 90 that minimises |A − B| = |3 607 m − 3 803·90/m|.  
The twelve divisors of 90 give:

m |A − B|
1 338 663
2 163 921
3 103 269
5  50 419
6  35 403
9   5 567

15 31 287
18 45 911
30 96 801
45 154 709
90 320 827

Thus m = 10 is optimal.

Therefore

A = 3 607·10 = 36 070,
B = 3 803·(90/10) = 3 803·9 = 34 227,

and indeed 36 070 · 34 227 = 1 234 567 890.

No other factor pair is nearer, so the two closest whole numbers whose product is 1 234 567 890 are

55,"There was a famous mathematician named Karl Friedrich Gauss. When he was young, he entered Gotinga University. One day he met an old professor, and spoke to him. They chatted, and the professor asked Gauss about his age.
Gauss said: ""The cube and the fourth power of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
The professor said: ""Very good. It's good coincidence because the square and the cube of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
How old was Gauss, and how old was the professor?","Eliminate the impossibilities, such as their ages can't end with 0.","Their ages can't end with 0, 1, 5 or 6, and must be either a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 9 minus 1 because the sum of its square and its cube or its cube and its fourth power is divisible by 9.
Gauss's age is easy. Since 17^3=4913, 17^4=83521, 22^3=10648, 22^4=234256, Gauss's age is between 18 and 21. The only possibility is 18. 18^3=5832, 18^4=104976.

We need the ten decimal digits 0,1,2,…,9 to occur **once altogether** when we write g³ and g⁴.

1.  Number of digits.  
   If g has k digits then  
      digits(g³)+digits(g⁴) ≈ 3k+1 + 4k+1 = 7k+2.  
   Setting this equal to 10 gives k≈1, so g is a two–digit number in the teens.

2.  Exact possibilities.  
   For 10≤g≤21 the number of digits is

      g   digits(g³)   digits(g⁴)   total
      10–17        4            5          9

   Hence g is one of 18,19,20,21.

3.  Testing the four candidates (only four short calculations):

      18³ =   5832   ,  18⁴ = 104 976  → 5832104976
      19³ =   6859   ,  19⁴ = 130 321  → 6859130321
      20³ =   8000   ,  20⁴ = 160 000  → 8000160000
      21³ =   9261   ,  21⁴ = 194 481  → 9261194481

   Only 18 produces the ten different digits exactly once; the other three contain repetitions.

We now need p² and p³ to contain all ten digits once.

1.  Number of digits.  
      digits(p²)+digits(p³)=10.  
   Because digits(p³) is one more power of p than digits(p²), we have
      digits(p³) – digits(p²) ≈ log₁₀p.  
   That difference must be 2 (since 4+6=10 or 3+7=10, etc.), so log₁₀p≈2, giving p a value in the forties to nineties.

2.  More precisely:  
      32² = 1024 already has 4 digits, and 46³ = 97 336 still has 5 digits, so:
      • for 32 ≤ p ≤ 46 :  digits(p²)+digits(p³)=4+5 = 9  (<10)  
      • for 47 ≤ p ≤ 99 :  digits(p²)+digits(p³)=4+6 = 10 (=10)

   Hence 47 ≤ p ≤ 99.

3.  Necessities for 47–99.  
   – p² must be a four‐digit number with **no repeated digit**.  
   – p³ must be a six‐digit number with **no repeated digit**.  
   – The two digit sets must be disjoint so that together they furnish all ten digits.

   Examining the 53 numbers 47–99 is still feasible by hand because the square immediately shows if a candidate fails (any repeated digit in the square eliminates it).

   The squares with all different digits are:

      48²=2304, 49²=2401, 51²=2601, 52²=2704, 53²=2809,
      54²=2916, 55²=3025, 57²=3249, 59²=3481, 61²=3721,
      64²=4096, 66²=4356, 69²=4761, 71²=5041, 72²=5184,
      73²=5329, 74²=5476, 78²=6084, 79²=6241, 82²=6724,
      84²=7056, 86²=7396, 87²=7569, 89²=7921, 93²=8649,
      95²=9025, 96²=9216, 98²=9604, 99²=9801.

   Now we check each of their cubes; as soon as a cube either repeats a digit or shares a digit with its square we discard the candidate.  Performing those (few) checks shows that all fail **except** p = 69:

      69² = 4761  (digits 4,7,6,1 – all different)  
      69³ = 328 509  (digits 3,2,8,5,0,9 – all different)  

      The two sets {4,7,6,1} and {3,2,8,5,0,9} are disjoint and together give every digit 0–9 exactly once.

   Hence the professor’s age is

      p = 69.

We are looking for positive integers that are simultaneously triangular and perfect squares; i.e. we want

        m(m + 1)/2 = n²     (1)

for some integers m, n.

Step 1.  Convert (1) to a Pell equation  
Multiply (1) by 8 and add 1:

        4m(m + 1) + 1 = 8n² + 1
   ⇒   (2m + 1)² – 8n² = 1.                         (2)

Let x = 2m + 1 and y = n; then (2) becomes the classical Pell equation

        x² – 8y² = 1.                                (3)

Step 2.  All positive solutions of (3)  
The minimal positive solution is (x₁, y₁) = (3, 1).  If
        (x_k , y_k)    solves (3),
then every further solution is obtained from

        x_{k+1} + y_{k+1}√8 = (3 + √8)(x_k + y_k√8).        (4)

Thus

  (x_k , y_k) = (3 + √8)ᵏ  written in the form a + b√8, with x_k = a, y_k = b.

Step 3.  Extract the square–triangular numbers  
For each k ≥ 1 we have n_k = y_k and the square–triangular number is

        S_k = n_k² = y_k².                               (5)

Using (4):

k = 1 : (x,y) = (3, 1)  → n = 1    → S = 1  
k = 2 : (17, 6)         → n = 6    → S = 36  
k = 3 : (99, 35)        → n = 35   → S = 1225  
k = 4 : (577, 204)      → n = 204  → S = 41616  
k = 5 : (3363, 1189)    → n = 1189 → S = 1413721  
k = 6 : (19601, 6930)   → n = 6930 → S = 48024900  
k = 7 : (114243, 40391) → n = 40391→ S = 1631432881 (> 50 000 000).

Step 4.  Numbers ≤ 50 000 000  
The sixth value, 48 024 900, is already below 50 000 000, while the seventh exceeds the bound.  Therefore the only integers in the range 1 … 50 000 000 that satisfy (1) are

   Writing numbers,  

        (10H + I)(10T + O) = 1000J + 110R + O.            (1)

3.  Work modulo 100  
   Compute the product mod 100 directly:

        (10H+I)(10T+O) ≡ 10(HO + IT) + I·O  (mod 100).

   Substitute I·O = 10k + O (k = ⎣IO/10⎦):

   Write S = HO + IT + k; then (3) is

5.  Fix the thousands digit J

     For equality we would need H·T = 81 (impossible with different digits H ≠ T).  
     So J ≠ 9.  
   • If J = 8 we need 10(H·T) close to 800; the only possibility with distinct digits is H·T = 72 giving 10(H·T) = 720.  
     Then (4) forces S = 80 + 11R, that is S ∈ {80,91,102,…,179}.  
     Exhausting the admissible pairs (O , I) shows none make S equal to 80 + 11R.

        700 + 11R = 10(H·T) + S.                         (5)

6.  Force H·T  
   The right–hand side of (5) must lie between 700 and 799.  
   The only possible value for 10(H·T) is again 720 (the next smaller, 630, would demand S ≥ 70 more than its maximum 166).  
   Thus H·T = 72, i.e. the ordered pairs (H , T) are (9 , 8) or (8 , 9).

7.  Determine S from (5)  
   With 10(H·T) = 720,

        S = 700 + 11R – 720 = 11R – 20.                 (6)

   Since S ≥ 0, R ≥ 2, and the possible values are  

        R : 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  
        S : 2,13,24,35,46,57,68,79.

8.  Test the two possibilities for (H , T)

   a)  H = 9, T = 8  
       S = 9O + 8I + k must be one of the numbers in the last line above.

       Try the admissible (O , I) list:

            O  I  k  S = 9O + 8I + k
            3  1  0        27 + 8 = 35   ← matches S = 35

       For (O , I) = (3,1) we have S = 35, hence from (6) R = 5.

       All digits are now

            H = 9,  I = 1,  T = 8,  O = 3,  R = 5,  J = 7

       All six digits are distinct, leading digits non–zero, so this is consistent.

   b)  H = 8, T = 9  
       Here S = 8O + 9I + k; checking the (O , I) pairs never yields a value of S in the required list (2, 13, 24, 35, 46, 57, 68, 79) without forcing R = J, which is forbidden.  
       Hence this branch gives no solution.

   Therefore the only solution is the one found in (a).

9.  Verify in ordinary arithmetic

          9 1
       ×  8 3
       -------
          7 5 5 3

   91 × 83 = 7553, whose digits indeed read J R R O with J = 7, R = 5, O = 3.

All conditions are satisfied and the assignment is unique.

61,"Car 1 started from Point A towards point B. At the same time Car 2 started from point B towards A. They crossed each other at point C. After which, Car 1 reached point B in another 9 hrs, and Car 2 reached point A in another 4 hrs. If both the cars maintained a constant speed throughout the journey, and the speed of Car 1 was 36 miles/hr(mph), then what was the speed of Car 2?","One can represent the time taken by each car in terms of distance and rate (with some unknown variables); then, set these expressions equal","54 miles/hr.
Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).
Thus we get b = 11664/216 = 54.
Thus speed of Car 2 = 54 miles/hr",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

 v₁ = speed of Car 1 = 36 mph

1.  Distance relationships up to the meeting point

 Car 2 travels B→C: v₂t

Each of the reversed numbers is a perfect square:  

16 = 4² , 196 = 14² , 361 = 19² , 784 = 28² , 1024 = 32².

Thus, if we denote by r₁ , r₂ , … the square-roots

r₁ = 4 , r₂ = 14 , r₃ = 19 , r₄ = 28 , r₅ = 32 ,

the given sequence is obtained by writing rᵢ² backwards.

Look at the successive increments of the roots:

14 – 4  = 10  
19 – 14 =  5  
28 – 19 =  9

These increments come in pairs (10, 5) then (9, 4);  
in each pair the second number is 5 less than the first,

Hence the next pair must be (8, 3).  
We therefore need the next increment 8:

63,"Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.
""I know that voice!  C'mon down.""
""Who is it?"" Eileen prodded.
""Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?""
Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.
""Why should I?""
""I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.""
""Is that the new Sinatra CD?""
""No, it's the world's greatest snack.""
""I'm hungry, too!"" the other voice whined.
""Who's up there with you?""  Patty asked.
""I'll bet I know!"" Eileen called.  ""It's obvious!""
Patty's face lit up in realization.  ""Robin!"" they laughed together.
A pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.
""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""
""We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.""
""What are those?""
""You know what a perfect number is?""
""Sure,"" Patty interjected, ""a number equal to the sum of its divisors.""
""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.  What are the four quantities in the sequence?",You can leave out numbers that are primes (sum of proper divisors is 1) or the product of two primes (sum of divisors will be less than 100).  This will shorten your search somewhat.,"108, 172, 136, and 134.
Method:
This one really requires a brute-force approach.  The sigma function (sum of a number's divisors) does not lend itself to 3rd-order analysis (3 numbers past the first one).  Most of the remaining numbers will leave the 100-200 range on the first or second iteration.  I used a small computer program.  The only sequence that stays in bounds for 4 terms is the one given.
Side notes:
The name ""Desire Creek"" is a nod to ""Desire Under the Elms"" and the ""Elm Creek Quilt"" books.
There are 4-cycles of amicable numbers.  However, the least quadruple is a little large, even for Patty's appetite: 1264460, 1547860, 1727636, 1305184.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let s(n) denote the sum of the proper divisors of n (the “aliquot‐sum’’
function).  
We need four successive values

 a₁ , a₂ = s(a₁) , a₃ = s(a₂) , a₄ = s(a₃)

all lying between 100 and 200, and we also need  
a₁+a₂+a₃+a₄ to be a multiple of 25.

Step 1 – Which numbers can start the chain?  
For any n between 100 and 200 compute s(n) and write it down only
when s(n) is again between 100 and 200.  
Doing the divisor sums by hand (or with σ(n) = ∏(p^{k+1}-1)/(p-1) and
then subtracting n) gives the following list:

102→114  104→106  108→172  112→136  114→126  
118→  64  120→240  124→100  126→186  128→127  
130→122  136→134  148→118  152→148  154→134  
164→130  170→154  172→136  174→186  176→196  
184→176  186→198  190→170  194→100.

Every arrow keeps us in the desired interval for one more step.

Step 2 – Continue each promising chain until it leaves the
interval, recording only those whose first FOUR terms stay between 100
and 200:

(a) 102 → 114 → 126 → 186 (leaves interval next step)  
(b) 108 → 172 → 136 → 134 (leaves interval next step)  
(c) 112 → 136 → 134 →  70 (fails at 4th term)  
(d) 114 → 126 → 186 → 198 (leaves interval next step)  
(e) 190 → 170 → 154 → 134 (leaves interval next step).

So there are exactly three candidate 4-term sequences:

 102, 114, 126, 186  sum = 528  
 108, 172, 136, 134  sum = 550  
 114, 126, 186, 198  sum = 624.

Step 3 – Impose the “multiple of 25’’ condition.  
Only 550 is divisible by 25 (550 = 25×22); the other sums give remainders 3
and −1 mod 25.

Therefore the unique aliquot sequence satisfying all the stated
conditions is

64,"The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.

Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with ""rock"", 2 points with ""scissors"", and 1 point with ""paper"".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one ""throw"", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.

Knowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?","(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.
(2) This is a ""zero-sum"" game: what one player wins, the other loses.
(3) The game is ""symmetric"": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.
(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let

     Paper  +1    0    −2

 E(Rock by foe)     E₁ =  pP − 3 pS  
 E(Paper by foe)    E₂ = −pR + 2 pS  
 E(Scissors by foe) E₃ = 3 pR − 2 pP

Because you “know nothing” about the opponent, you should choose a
strategy that maximises your guaranteed (minimum) gain: the minimax
strategy.  In a zero-sum 3×3 game such a strategy makes the opponent
indifferent, i.e. sets

Set E₂ = E₃:

 −pR + 2 pS = 3 pR − 2 pP ⇒ −2 pR + pP + pS = 0 ⇒ pP = 2 pR − pS …………(B)

Insert (B) in (A):

 (2 pR − pS) + pR = 5 pS  ⇒ 3 pR = 6 pS  ⇒ pR = 2 pS

Put this back into (B):

 pP = 2 (2 pS) − pS = 3 pS

Thus the probabilities are in the ratio

 pR : pP : pS = 2 : 3 : 1.

Normalising (sum = 1):

 pS = 1/6, pR = 2/6 = 1/3, pP = 3/6 = 1/2.

Check the value:

 E₁ = ½ − 3·(1/6) = 0  
 E₂ = −1/3 + 2·(1/6) = 0  
 E₃ = 3·(1/3) − 2·(½) = 0.

• Paper one-half of the time,

65,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
Assume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.  What is the lowest card total at which you can be assured you will not be required to drink a glass of milk through your nose in order to break a tie for the maximum 4 points?",Create the largest tie,"If all four players hold the same number of cards, the lowest card total that would never require a tie-break is 142.

Any score above 141 can not be duplicated in a single hand of Snapoker, thus making 142 the lowest total to which a tie-breaker will not need to be applied.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"First, determine exactly what cards are in a Snapoker deck.

For one ordinary deck (before duplication)

Spades – keep even-ranked cards  
{2,4,6,8,10,Q(12)}  values 2+4+6+8+10+12 = 42 (6 cards)

Hearts – keep odd-ranked cards  
{A(1),3,5,7,9,J(11),K(13)}  1+3+5+7+9+11+13 = 49 (7 cards)

Diamonds – keep the non-prime ranks  
{4,6,8,9,10,Q(12)}  4+6+8+9+10+12 = 49 (6 cards)

Clubs – keep the prime ranks  
{2,3,5,7,J(11),K(13)}  2+3+5+7+11+13 = 41 (6 cards)

Hence one deck contributes 25 cards whose total value is 181.
Two such decks therefore give 50 cards whose total value is 362.

Two Jokers (value 15 each) are then added:

total number of cards = 52 , total value of all cards = 362 + 30 = 392.

(Each of the 52 cards listed below occurs twice except the two jokers.)

          value : multiplicity
          15 : 2
          13,12,11,10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 : 4 each
          1 : 2


1.  Equal allocation of cards  
The 52 cards are snatched evenly; each of the four players therefore ends with exactly 13 cards.

2.  How large can the two best hands be simultaneously?  
Order the whole deck from largest downwards and take the highest 26 cards (the most two players could jointly possess):

     15(×2) + 13(×4) + 12(×4) + 11(×4) + 10(×4) + 9(×4) + 8(×4)

Their combined value is  

     2·15 + 4·(13+12+11+10+9+8)
   = 30  + 4·63
   = 30  + 252
   = 282.

Consequently, for any possible deal the sum of the two largest 13-card totals is at most 282.

3.  Threshold guaranteeing uniqueness  
If your own total is T and another player ties or exceeds you, the two of you together are worth at least 2T.  
To make that impossible we need 2T > 282, i.e.

          T > 141.

Thus a total of 142 is sufficient.

4.  Sharpness of the bound  
It must be shown that 141 does not guarantee uniqueness.  
Split the 26 highest cards listed above evenly:

     {15, 13,13, 12,12, 11,11, 10,10, 9,9, 8,8}  (13 cards)

Both halves contain the same multiset, hence each hand totals

     15 + 2·(13+12+11+10+9+8) = 15 + 2·63 = 141.

So two players can indeed tie at 141, and a milk-through-the-nose contest would be required.

Therefore the least total that ensures you will stand alone at the top (and hence never have to break a tie) is

66,"There are ten natural numbers, two of which are equal. Adding any nine of them, we can get the following sums:

Two of the sums are equal. If we add the ten sums, it should equal nine times the sum of the ten numbers, as each number will be present within all of the sums nine times.
82+83+84+85+87+89+90+91+92=87*9=783, which is divisible by 9, therefore the repeated sum must be divisible by 9.  The only sum which meets this criteria is 90.
The sum of the ten numbers is (783+90)/9=97.  The largest number is found by subtracting the lowest sum of nine numbers (which excluded the largest of the ten numbers) from the sum of all ten numbers.  Thus: 97-82=15.  15 is the largest number of the ten.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the ten natural numbers be  
a₁ , a₂ , … , a₁₀ ,  with a₁ = a₂ (these two are the equal ones).  
Denote their total sum by   
S = a₁ + a₂ + … + a₁₀.

1.  Sums obtained by omitting one term  
   Omitting aₖ gives the sum S – aₖ.  
   Because there are 10 numbers, there are 10 such “nine-term” sums, but two of them are equal (omitting a₁ or a₂ gives the same value).  
   Hence the multiset of the 10 sums has exactly nine distinct values, with one of them occurring twice.  
   The nine distinct values listed in the statement are  
   82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92.

2.  The duplicate value  
   Let d be the value that occurs twice.  
   Then the ten sums are the nine listed values plus an extra d, so

       9S = 82 + 83 + 84 + 85 + 87 + 89 + 90 + 91 + 92 + d.     (∗)

3.  Determining d  
   First add the nine distinct numbers:

       82 + 83 + 84 + 85 + 87 + 89 + 90 + 91 + 92 = 783.

   Equation (∗) becomes 9S = 783 + d, i.e. S = (783 + d)/9.  
   Because S is an integer, 783 + d must be divisible by 9.  
   Now reduce each candidate d modulo 9:

       82→1, 83→2, 84→3, 85→4, 87→6, 89→8, 90→0, 91→1, 92→2.

   Only 90 is congruent to 0 mod 9, so the duplicated sum is

       d = 90.

4.  The total sum S  
   Substitute d = 90 into (∗):

       9S = 783 + 90 = 873  ⇒  S = 873 / 9 = 97.

5.  Recovering the ten numbers  
   Each number equals S minus the corresponding nine-term sum:

       97 – 82 = 15
       97 – 83 = 14
       97 – 84 = 13
       97 – 85 = 12
       97 – 87 = 10
       97 – 89 = 8
       97 – 90 = 7   (occurs twice, since 90 is duplicated)
       97 – 91 = 6
       97 – 92 = 5

   Thus the multiset of the ten natural numbers is  
   5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15.

67,"Jack and Jill are climbing down a vertical wall.  They both use ropes hanging from the ceiling of a huge room.  They start at the same time from the top of the wall which is 16 meters tall.  The race is divided into two stages; the first 8 meters and the last 8 meters.  A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.
Who will reach the ground first and how many additional minutes will it take the loser to finish the race?",Solve for their distance travelled at appropriate time increments,"Jack will win the race and it will take an additional half minute to catch up with him.
Jacks moves 0.8 meters vertically in each step movement:

Replacing A by the diagonally crossed distance, B by the distance between Jack's feet and C by the vertically climbed distance:

C = 0.8 m
Jill moves 1 meter vertically in each hop.

PART 1 ‑ The size of one move  

Jack  
•  Each step is a straight 1 m diagonal.  
•  The two feet are 0.60 m apart horizontally, so the horizontal component of the diagonal is 0.60 m.  
•  Hence the vertical component of the step is, by Pythagoras,  
  vJ = √(1² – 0.60²) = √(1 − 0.36) = √0.64 = 0.80 m.  
⇒ One step lowers Jack 0.80 m and takes 15 s.

Jill  
•  One hop follows a perfect half–circular arc 1.57 m long.  
 (1.57 m ≈ π/2, so L = π r gives r = 0.50 m if the arc is a semicircle.)  
•  The diameter of that semicircle is therefore 1.00 m, which is the vertical drop.  
⇒ One hop lowers Jill 1.00 m and takes 15 s.

PART 2 ‑ The first 8 m (stage 1)  

Jack: 8 m / 0.80 m = 10 steps → 10·15 s = 150 s.  
(No rest is due until after the first 8 m.)

Jill: 8 m / 1 m = 8 hops → 8·15 s = 120 s of motion.  
But after 6 m she must rest 60 s:  
 6 hops = 90 s; rest 60 s; last 2 hops = 30 s.  
Total = 90 s + 60 s + 30 s = 180 s.

Thus Jack wins the first stage (150 s < 180 s).  
By the rules Jill, the loser, must wait an additional ½ min = 30 s beginning the instant Jack finishes (t = 150 s).

What each climber is doing at t = 150 s  
Jack has just reached 8 m and starts his compulsory 1 min rest (150 s → 210 s).  
Jill has finished the 60 s rest at 6 m but is forced to stand still for the 30 s penalty (150 s → 180 s).

At t = 180 s Jill resumes hopping and needs two more hops (30 s) to reach 8 m, so she is at the halfway point at t = 210 s – exactly when Jack’s rest ends.

PART 3 ‑ The last 8 m (stage 2) – both start together at t = 210 s  

Jack: again 10 steps → 150 s → finishes at 210 s + 150 s = 360 s.

Jill:  

 •  hops 9-12 (4 m) → 4·15 s = 60 s → t = 270 s, total descent 12 m.  
 •  mandatory 1 min rest (270 s → 330 s).  
 •  hops 13-16 (4 m) → 4·15 s = 60 s.  

Finishing instant: 330 s + 60 s = 390 s.

PART 4 ‑ Comparison  

Jack reaches the ground at 360 s (6 min).  
Jill reaches the ground at 390 s (6 min 30 s).

Hence Jack wins, and Jill, the loser, takes 30 s = ½ minute longer to finish.

Final answer: Jack reaches the ground first; Jill arrives ½ minute later.",True,1,0
68,"Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.
""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""
Assuming everything has integer weights, what were the two types of weights that Joseph suggested?",Try it out with small numbers. What is the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of 3s and 4s? The answer is 5. Try it out with other numbers. You'll find a pattern eventually.,"The two weights are 11 and 13.
If you played around with the hint, you'll realize that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of Xs and Ys is equal to (X-1)(Y-1) - 1.
We are told that the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of a combination of the two weights is 119.
Thus,
119 = (x-1)(y-1) - 1
120 = (x-1)(y-1)
From here, we only have to list 120's factors: (1,120), (2,60), (3,40), (4,30), (5,24), (6,20), (8,15), (10,12).  There are 8 possible combinations.
However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.
Try it out. You can't make 119 using only 11s and 13s but you can make 120 and above using only 11s and 13s.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the two (integral) weights be a pounds and b pounds, with a<b, both greater than 10.  
Since every integer weight ≥120 is attainable while 119 is not, the largest unattainable weight (the Frobenius number) equals 119.

For two coprime positive integers a and b the Frobenius number is
 F = ab – a – b.

Thus we require
 ab – a – b = 119  
⇔ ab – a – b + 1 = 120  
⇔ (a – 1)(b – 1) = 120.

Because a, b > 10, we need both factors (a – 1) and (b – 1) to be at least 10.

The factor pairs of 120 with each factor ≥10 are only 10 × 12.

Hence  
a – 1 = 10 and b – 1 = 12  
⇒ a = 11, b = 13.

These two numbers are coprime (gcd = 1) and exceed 10, satisfying all the conditions. Moreover, ab – a – b = 11·13 – 11 – 13 = 143 – 24 = 119, confirming that 119 is the largest unattainable weight, while every weight ≥120 is attainable (e.g. 120 = 5·11 + 5·13).

Product of the digits = 240","5328   is the number.

1.  The ratio condition  
    sum / product = 3 / 40  
    ⇔ 40 · (sum of digits) = 3 · (product of digits).   (1)

2.  Consequences of (1)

    •  The right–hand side of (1) is divisible by 3, so the left–hand side is also; hence  
      the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3.

    •  The right–hand side is divisible by 40, so the product of the digits is divisible by 40.  
      Consequently the digits must supply the prime factors 2³·5, i.e.  
      – at least one digit 5,  
      – altogether at least three factors 2 (for instance a digit 8, or a 4 together with another even digit,…).

    •  Write
          product = 40k, sum = 3k   (k a positive integer).  (2)

      Because each digit is at most 9, if there are n digits then  
      3k = sum ≤ 9n, so k ≤ 3n.

3.  Trying to satisfy (2) with the fewest digits (so as to obtain the smallest number)

    •  n = 2 is impossible: the only two–digit multiple of 37 is 74, whose digits do not
      satisfy (1).

    •  n = 3.  Put one digit equal to 5 and call the other two b,c.
      Equation (1) becomes  
         8(5+b+c) = 3bc,  
      which has no solutions with digits 1–9.  
      Therefore no 3–digit number works.

    •  n = 4.  We look for k with 1 ≤ k ≤ 12 (because 3k = sum ≤ 36).
      Systematic inspection of k = 1,2,3,4,5 shows that the required factors 5 and 2³ force the
      sum to be too large.  
      For k = 6, however,

          sum = 3k = 18, product = 40k = 240.

      A 4–digit set that gives product 240 and sum 18 is

          2 · 3 · 5 · 8 = 240,  2+3+5+8 = 18.

      Thus the only possible digits are 2,3,5,8 (in some order).  
      (Any extra digit 1 would increase n to at least 5 and hence the size of the number, so four
      digits are preferable.)

4.  Forming the number

    •  The number must be even, so it must end in 2 or 8.  
    •  It must be divisible by 37.

      Enumerating the 24 permutations of 2,3,5,8 and testing divisibility by 37:

      2358, 2538, 3258, 3528, 3582, 3852, 5238, 5328, 5382, 5832, 8352, 8532, …  

      All those that are smaller than 5328 fail the test “divisible by 37”.
      The first (hence smallest) permutation that is both even and a multiple of 37 is

          5328  = 37 × 144.

5.  Verification

    •  Even:  last digit 8 ⇒ yes.  
    •  Divisible by 37:  5328 ÷ 37 = 144 ⇒ yes.  
    •  Ratio:  sum = 5+3+2+8 = 18, product = 5·3·2·8 = 240,  
      18 : 240 = 3 : 40 ⇒ satisfies the given ratio.

J ≡ −E (mod 10)  ⟺ J + E = 10. (2)


2.  Use the middle equation DEF/6 = JE

E ≡ 6J + T₂  (mod 10). (3)

But T₂ = ⌊6E/10⌋, so (3) becomes

The other person replies, ""How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?""
""No, you could not.""
""Aha! At last, I know how old you are!""
Apparently the second mathematician had been trying to determine the first mathematician's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
The bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.","There are multiple possible age combinations for the mathematician's children that would result in the same age as well as the same bus number otherwise the second mathematician can determine the ages of the children given the first mathematician's age and number of children.
Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't — he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10.

Our task is to find the value(s) of S for which exactly one ambiguous age P occurs.

n = 2 : 11, 20, 27, 32, 35, 36  (all different)  
n = 3 : 10, 18, 24, 28, 30, 32, 42, 48, 50, 54, 60, 64  (all different)  
n = 4 : 9, 16, 21, 24, 25, 28, 36, 40, 45, 48, 48, 60, 64, 72, 81  
    Only the product 48 occurs twice:  
     1 + 3 + 4 + 4 → 48  
     2 + 2 + 2 + 6 → 48  
n = 5 : 8, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30, 32, 36, 40, 48, 54, 64, 72 (all single)  
n = 6 : 7, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 27, 32, 36, 48, 64 (all single)  
n ≥ 7 : only single products appear.

Hence the only ambiguous pair for S = 12 is 

 (P , n) = (48 , 4).

So if the sum is 12 the first mathematician must be 48 years old and have
4 children; with every other age the children’s ages would be uniquely
determined once n were known, contradicting his statement.

S = 13  
Do the same analysis.  For n = 3 the product 36 occurs twice  
(1,6,6) and (2,2,9); for n = 5 the product 48 occurs twice  
(1,1,3,4,4) and (1,2,2,2,6).  Thus two different ambiguous ages (36 and 48)
exist, so P would not be uniquely determined.  Therefore S ≠ 13.

S ≥ 14  
Already for S = 14 two different ambiguous ages (40 and 72, both with n = 3)
appear, and the number of possibilities only grows with larger S.  Hence
for every S ≥ 13 the second mathematician could not single out a unique age.

Conclusion  
The only bus number that leaves exactly one possible age consistent with the
conversation is

 S = 12.

(With that bus number the mathematicians’ ages are uniquely forced to be 48,
with children 1,3,4,4 or 2,2,2,6, so the father’s statement “No, you could not”
is correct.)

73,"Achmed and Ali were camel-drivers and on one day they decided to quit their job. They wanted to become shepherds. So they went to the market and sold all their camels. The amount of money (dinars) they received for each camel was the same as the total number of camels they owned. With that money they bought as many sheep as possible at 10 dinars a sheep. With the money that was left they bought a goat.
On their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, ""I take the last sheep and you can get the goat"". ""That's not fair,"" said Achmed, ""a goat costs less than a sheep"". ""OK,"" Ali said, ""then I will give you one of my dogs and then we are even"". And Achmed agreed.
What's the cost of a dog?",Think about a perfect square total of money--then one sheep left over means that the total amount of money is a square number with an odd tens place,"1 sheep - 1 dog = 1 goat + 1 dog
1 sheep - 1 goat = 2 dogs
A sheep is 10 dinars, but what does a goat cost?
The money they received for their camels is a square. And the digit in the tens-place of this square is odd (total money / 10 dinars), because they could not divide the sheep equally.
Now the interesting thing is that all squares with an odd tens-place end with a 6. (16^2 = 256, 24^2 = 576). So a goat must cost 6 dinars.
10 - 6 = 2 dogs
So a dog costs 2 dinars.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

C  = number of camels they owned (an integer)  
10 dinars = price of one sheep  
G dinars = price of the goat (<10)  
D dinars = price of one dog (what we must find)

1.  Selling the camels  
   Each camel brings C dinars, so the total money obtained is  
        C · C = C²  dinars.

2.  Buying sheep and a goat  
   With 10 dinars per sheep they buy as many sheep as possible, say S sheep, and spend the rest on one goat:  
        C² = 10S + G with 0 < G < 10. (1)

   Hence G is the remainder when C² is divided by 10, i.e.  
        G ≡ C² (mod 10).

3.  Trying to divide the sheep  
   When the two men share the S sheep, one sheep is left over, so S is odd:  
        S = 2k + 1 for some integer k ≥ 0. (2)

4.  The final settlement  
   Each man first takes k sheep.  
   Ali keeps the extra sheep; Achmed receives the goat instead, which is cheaper, so Ali adds one dog to Achmed’s share.  
   Fairness means the total values they receive are equal:

        Achmed’s value = k·10 + G + D  
        Ali’s value    = (k + 1)·10.

   Therefore  
        k·10 + G + D = (k + 1)·10 ⇒ G + D = 10. (3)

   Consequently  
        D = 10 − G. (4)

5.  Determining G

   From (1) and (2):  
        C² = 10(2k + 1) + G = 20k + 10 + G  
   so  
        C² ≡ 10 + G (mod 20). (5)

   Compute all quadratic residues mod 20:

        n² (mod 20) for n = 0,…,19 are 0,1,4,5,9,16.

   The only residue of the form 10 + G (with 1 ≤ G ≤ 9) that appears in this list is 16, obtained when G = 6.

   Hence  
        G = 6 dinars. (6)

6.  Price of the dog

   Substitute (6) into (4):

        D = 10 − 6 = 4.

74,"Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?","The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","The minimum number of weights is 5.
weight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0
weight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1
weight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2
weight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3
weight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4
All five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.
The progression from one stone to one mass would be:
1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the desired load be put on the left‐hand pan of a balance and the available counterweights be distributed between the two pans.  
If the counterweights have masses  

 w₁ < w₂ < … < w_k   (all expressed in stone),

each of them can be in three possible places:  
on the left pan (counted as −w_i), on the right pan (+w_i) or not used (0).  
With k weights this gives at most 3^k different total differences; the positive
differences that can actually be obtained are therefore at most

 (3^k − 1)/2 .                                                        (1)

To be able to weigh every integral load from 1 stone up to one mass (= 121 stone)
we must have

 (3^k − 1)/2  ≥  121  ⟺  3^k ≥ 243. 

Hence k must be at least 5.  
So five weights are absolutely necessary; it only remains to find a set of five
that really works.

The way to reach the upper bound (1) with equality is to choose the weights so
that every new weight is just big enough to “fill the gap” left by the smaller
ones, i.e.

 w₁ = 1,   w₂ = 1 + 2·1 = 3,  
 w₃ = 1 + 2(1 + 3) = 9,  
 w₄ = 1 + 2(1 + 3 + 9) = 27,  
 w₅ = 1 + 2(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 81.

Thus the optimal set is

 1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone, 81 stone.

Because 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121, equation (1) is satisfied with equality, so
every whole number of stone from 1 to 121 can indeed be expressed as a
combination of ±1, ±3, ±9, ±27 and ±81; in other words any load in that range
can be weighed by putting some of these weights with the load and the rest on
the opposite pan.

(In the people’s own units this is:  
1 stone; 3 stone; 9 stone; 2 lumps 5 stone (27 stone); and 7 lumps 4 stone
(81 stone).)

Since five weights are necessary and these five suffice, they constitute the
minimal solution.

Final answer: Five weights of 1, 3, 9, 27 and 81 stone enable weighing every whole number of stone from 1 up to one mass (121 stone).",True,1,0

Step 1 – decide the range that has to be examined  
If S < 1729 then, because 12³ = 1728, no term 12³ can occur in such a sum—
otherwise the other addend would have to be 0, which is not allowed.

One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.

He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.",divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.,"Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.

This is basically 50% * 50% * 50% * 50% * 50% = 3.125% chance of losing.

• exactly five bets may be made and the stake of each bet may be chosen adaptively, never exceeding the capital on hand.

1.  An absolute upper bound   
   To fail to reach 6.40 dollars you must certainly fail if every one of the five bets loses, because then your capital is below 6.20.

   Net gain after that win:

   0.20·2^{k-1} – 0.20(2^{k-1} – 1) = 0.20.

We work exclusively with square cakes. The cakes come in sizes that are meant to be divided into a square number of square pieces. Each portion comes decorated with an ""X"" stretching to its corners, which makes it easy to cut the usual square pieces and also offer half and quarter portions.
These markings also help on Wednesday when we savor the previous week's success by dividing a cake equally amongst ourselves. Even when a good week deserves a 64-portion cake, we can each ceremonially make a single standard cut (straight and perpendicular to the plate), and we each go home with a single piece of cake.

There is more than one way to divide the 6-by-6 (36 X) cake inside into three equal pieces.  Using one based on its 24 unit perimeter, this cake could be divided into 24 wedges of equal size. Each triangular piece would have as its base one unit of the perimeter; the other two sides would be formed by cuts to the center of the cake. Every triangle would have the same altitude (3 units) giving the same area (A = ½ * b * h = ½ * 1 * 3 = 3/2 square units). 8 adjacent triangles, even though they include a corner or two, will be 12 square units or 1/3 of the ""inner"" cake.

If the string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag and the flag pole is 14 meters in height, then the string must cover 12 meters in total (14-1-1).
If the diameter of the pole is 10cm and the height covered is 12 meters (1200cm), then, unwrapped in to a rectangle, it would be pi(10) (since the circumference of a circle is pi{d}) by 1200 cm rectangle.
If the string wraps around in 4 even rotations, that means the rectangle divided on the y plane into 4 equal sections would represent one rotation per section. Finding the hypotenuse of each section (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) would then yield the distance covered per rotation.

The string's distance in one rotation would be expressed by the following equation:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2
Therefore, in 4 rotations it would be the above * 4.
The final equation is thus expressed as:
let a represent the total height of the pole, then f represent the height of the flag, then rot represent the number of rotations, then p represent the height of the pulley, then d represent the diameter of the pole
s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½

Hf = height of the flag (m)  
Hp = height of the pole (m)  
R  = radius of the pole (m)  
n  = number of complete turns the rope makes round the pole  

1.  Determine Hf from the information about the pulley.  
   “The flag’s height is equal to the ground-to-pulley distance” and  
   “The pulley system is attached 1 m off the ground”, hence  

            Hf = 1 m.  

2.  Determine Hp from the pole/flag ratio.  
   “The pole was built to be exactly 14 times the height of the flag”, so  

            Hp = 14 Hf = 14 × 1 m = 14 m.  

3.  Locate the bottom of the flag when the flag is fully hoisted.  
   When raised, the top edge of the flag reaches the top of the pole (14 m).  
   The flag’s own height is 1 m, therefore its bottom edge is  

            14 m – 1 m = 13 m above ground.

   Each turn is the hypotenuse of a right‐triangle with sides C and p:  

            L₁ = √(C² + p²)

total marks of girls = g·b  
total marks of boys = b·g  
total marks of class = 2bg  
total students = g + b = S

Class average = 2bg / S.

The statement

2bg / S = [(g) + (b)]/2 – 4 = S/2 – 4.

Multiply by S:

4bg = S² – 8S  
4bg = S(S – 8).          (1)

But S = g + b and P = gb, so (1) is

P = S(S – 8)/4.          (2)

For fixed S=g+b, the pair (g,b) are roots of

Thus 8S must be a perfect square.

Then S = (4m)²/8 = 2m².                         (3)

Using (3) in the quadratic roots:

g, b = (S ± √Δ)/2 = (2m² ± 4m)/2 = m² ± 2m  
⇒ { g = m(m + 2),  b = m(m – 2) }.

Positivity of b requires m ≥ 3.

Hence the numbers of students possible are S = 2m² with m ≥ 3:

m = 3  ⇒  S = 2·9 = 18  
m = 4  ⇒  S = 2·16 = 32

The problem asks for the minimum two-digit total.  
For m = 3,

g = 3·5 = 15,  b = 3·1 = 3,  S = 18.

Check:
girls’ average = b = 3  
boys’ average  = g = 15  
class average  = (15·3 + 3·15)/(15+3) = 90/18 = 5

• Pages 100–999: 900 × 3 = 2 700 digits  
• Pages 1000–N: (N – 1000) × 4 digits

Total number of digits  
D(N)=9+180+2 700+4(N−1000)=4N−1 111.

We are told that this total is an exact multiple of the number of pages, i.e.

N divides D(N) ⇔ N | (4N−1 111).

But 4N−1 111 ≡ −1 111 (mod N), so the divisibility condition reduces to

N | 1 111.

The positive divisors of 1 111 are 1, 11, 101 and 1 111.  
Among these, only 1 111 lies between 1000 and 10 000.

Hence N = 1 111 is the unique possible page count, and it indeed works:

Total digits = 4·1 111 − 1 111 = 3 333 = 3·1 111.

T = &$ = 10c + d .

The six relations in the statement translate to

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  A key consequence of the sums  

Subtract (1) from (4): (a + e + c) – (a + b) = 0 ⇒ e + c − b = 0  
so                                                     b = e + c.   (7)

Because b is a single digit,  e + c ≤ 9.                      

Similarly, subtract (2) from (5):

(n + g + e) – (e + f) = 0  ⇒  n + g − f = 0  ⇒  f = n + g.        (8)

And subtract (1) from (3):

(g + b + h) – (a + b) = 0  ⇒  g + h − a = 0  ⇒  a = g + h.        (9)

2.  Information from the product

Equation (6):  n·d = 10c + d  
      ⇔  d(n – 1) = 10c.                                  (10)

The left‐hand side is at most 9·8 = 72, so d(n – 1) can only be  
10, 20, 30, 40 or 60.  Listing all possibilities with digits 1–9 and

             40       8   6        4

So only six (c,d,n) triples are possible:
(1,2,6), (1,5,3), (2,4,6), (3,5,7), (4,5,9), (4,8,6).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Eliminating five of the six triples

Equation (4) gives a + e + c = 10c + d.  
Because a and e are digits ≤ 9, the left side is at most 18 + c.

• If c ≥ 2 then 18 + c ≤ 10c + d is impossible (right side ≥ 20).  
  Therefore c = 1.  

That immediately discards the four triples with c = 2, 3 or 4 and
leaves only

 (c , d , n) = (1,2,6)  or  (1,5,3).

Take c = 1.  Then (7) tells us  b = e + 1.  
Because b ≤ 9 and all digits are different, e can be 2,4,6 or 8.

• Case (c,d,n) = (1,2,6).  
  Here T = 12.  Equation (5) gives 6 + g + e = 12 ⇒ g + e = 6,
  but with e ≥ 2 this forces g ≤ 4 and repeats a digit that is
  already used; contradiction.  Hence this case fails.

• Case (c,d,n) = (1,5,3).  
  Now T = 15 and d = 5.  We try e = 2,4,6,8 successively:

   e = 2 ⇒ b = 3 (already used for n) – impossible  
   e = 4 ⇒ b = 5 (already used for d) – impossible  
   e = 6 ⇒ b = 7  but (5) would give g = 12 – 6 = 6 (repeats e)  
   e = 8 ⇒ b = 9  works !

So choose e = 8, b = 9.

From (5):  3 + g + 8 = 15 ⇒ g = 4.  
From (8):  f = n + g = 3 + 4 = 7.  
From (9):  a = g + h ⇒ 6?  To find h, use (3):
4 + 9 + h = 15 ⇒ h = 2, hence a = 4 + 2 = 6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  The unique assignment

The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.
The 36th root of a googol is
(10^100)^(1/36) = 10^(100/36) = 10^(2.77777...) ~ 599.48
so 599 is the largest integer N such that N^36 < 10^100.
Checking this finds that

1.  “Square of a square.”  
    There is an integer x with  
          N = (x²)² = x⁴.  
    So N is a perfect fourth power.

2.  “Cube of a cube.”  
    There is an integer y with  
          N = (y³)³ = y⁹.  
    So N is a perfect ninth power.

3.  Intersection of the two conditions.  
    In the prime–factor-exponent form of N, every exponent must be divisible by 4 (to make a 4th power) and by 9 (to make a 9th power).  
    Therefore each exponent is divisible by lcm(4,9)=36, and conversely any 36th power meets both conditions.  

    Hence  
          N = k³⁶   for some positive integer k.

4.  Bounding k.  
    We need k³⁶ < 10¹⁰⁰.  
    Taking base-10 logarithms:

          36·log₁₀k < 100
          log₁₀k < 100/36 = 25/9.

    So

          k < 10^(25/9) = 10^(2 + 7/9) = 100 · 10^(7/9).

    Since log₁₀6 ≈ 0.7781513 and 7/9 = 0.777777…, we have  
          10^(7/9) ≈ 5.995.  
    Thus  

          k < 100 · 5.995 ≈ 599.5.

    The largest integer k satisfying the inequality is 599.

5.  Counting the numbers.  
    k can be any of the 599 positive integers 1, 2, … , 599, and each gives a distinct N = k³⁶ < 10¹⁰⁰.

Therefore there are 599 natural numbers less than a googol that are both the square of a square and the cube of a cube.

90,What is the 1000th prime number?,It is smaller than 10000,7919,GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"For convenience denote by π(x) the number of primes not exceeding x.

Step 1.  Rough location of the 1000-th prime  
Rosser’s explicit bounds (valid for every n ≥ 6)

  n (ln n+ln ln n−1) < pₙ < n (ln n+ln ln n)

place the 1000-th prime between

  1000(ln 1000+ln ln 1000−1) ≈ 1000·7.8404 = 7840

and  

  1000(ln 1000+ln ln 1000)   ≈ 1000·8.8404 = 8840.

Hence   7840 < p₁₀₀₀ < 8840.

Step 2.  Counting primes up to 7000  
A straightforward Legendre (or Meissel–Lehmer) count, using only the primes ≤√7000 = 83, gives  

  π(7000) = 900.

(Each of the intermediate counts—π(1000) = 168, π(2000) = 303, π(3000) = 430, π(4000) = 550, π(5000) = 669, π(6000) = 783—can be verified the same way; adding the primes in the interval (6000,7000] gives 900.)

Thus the 1000-th prime lies somewhere in (7000, 8840).

Step 3.  Listing and counting the primes from 7001 upward  
Using nothing more than trial division by the primes ≤89 (because 89² = 7921 > 7919) one finds all the primes between 7000 and 7919.  
There turn out to be exactly 100 of them; they are

Since π(7000)=900 and exactly 100 further primes appear up to and including 7919,

  π(7919)=900+100=1000.

Step 4.  Verifying primality of 7919 itself  
7919 has no prime divisor ≤√7919 = 89 (division by every prime up to 89 leaves a non-zero remainder), so 7919 is prime.

Step 5.  Confirming minimality  
The very next integer is 7920 = 2⁴·3²·5·11; it is composite, so no prime lies between 7919 and 7920.  
Therefore the prime that brings the running total to exactly 1000 is 7919.

Consequently, the 1000-th prime number is 7919.

2.  Parity of B (mod 8).

 A square can be 0,1,4 (mod 8); therefore 5^B must be 1 ⇒ B is even.

•  If A is odd and C is even (case (1)), the residue is  
 3 + 5^B + 1 ≡ 4 + 5^B (mod 8).  
 For a square residue we need 4 + 5^B ≡ 1 (mod 8) ⇒ 5^B ≡ 5 ⇒ B is odd.

Thus we have exactly two possible parity patterns:

I.  A even, B even, C odd  
II. A odd, B odd, C even.  (2)

3.  Smallest value under each pattern.

Pattern I (A even ≥2, B even ≥2, C odd ≥1):

Smallest choice A=2, B=2, C=1 gives  
3² + 5² + 7¹ = 9 + 25 + 7 = 41.

41 < 49 = 7², and increasing any exponent raises the sum by at least 72, so the next possible totals already exceed 81.  
Hence no square ≤ 81 occurs in pattern I.

Pattern II (A odd ≥1, B odd ≥1, C even ≥2):

Smallest choice A=1, B=1, C=2 gives  
3¹ + 5¹ + 7² = 3 + 5 + 49 = 57 (not a square).

The next possibility is to raise the smallest base‐3 exponent from 1 to 3:

A=3, B=1, C=2 ⇒ 3³ + 5¹ + 7² = 27 + 5 + 49 = 81 = 9².

Any other raise (B from 1→3 or C from 2→4) makes the sum exceed 81.

Therefore 81 is the first square obtained in pattern II, and no square was possible in pattern I below that value.

The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.

(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186
Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.

Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.
Jerry","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

 A = Albert’s present age,  
 B = Bill’s present age,  
 C = Charles’ present age  

(all in years, all different positive integers).

Write s(n) for “the sum of the decimal digits of n”.

The three sentences in the letter translate to  

(1) A = s(B) + s(C)  

(2) B – 1 = s(A – 1) + s(C – 1)  

(3) C + 6 = s(A + 6) + s(B + 6)

Step 1 – getting good upper bounds

Because the digit–sum of any positive integer is at most 9, we have from (1)

 A ≤ 9 + 9 = 18.                                                            (4)

Consequently A – 1 ≤ 17, so s(A – 1) ≤ 1 + 7 = 8.  
Using this in (2) gives

 B – 1 ≤ 8 + (C – 1) ⇒ B ≤ C + 8.                                 (5)

Again from (4), A + 6 ≤ 24, so s(A + 6) ≤ 2 + 4 = 6.  
Put this and (5) into (3):

 C + 6 = s(A + 6) + s(B + 6) ≤ 6 + s(B + 6).

Now B ≤ C + 8; hence B + 6 ≤ C + 14 ≤ 10 + 14 = 24, whence s(B + 6) ≤ 2 + 4 = 6.  
Therefore

 C + 6 ≤ 6 + 6 ⇒ C ≤ 6.                                                (6)

Step 2 – a relation involving only B and C

Rewrite (1) as A = C + s(B).

Insert this in (2):

 B – 1 = s(A – 1) + (C – 1)  
    = s(C + s(B) – 1) + C – 1

and rearrange to obtain

 s(C + s(B) – 1) = B – C.                                          (7)

Because of (6), C can only be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, and (5) now tells us that
B ≤ C + 8 ≤ 14; so B is at most 14.  
All possibilities therefore satisfy 1 ≤ B ≤ 14.  
We next list the digit–sums s(B):

B : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  
s(B):1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   1   2   3   4   5

Step 3 – solving (7)

For every admissible pair (B, C) we evaluate the two sides of (7).

 • C = 1,2,3,4 give no match.  
 • C = 6 forces B ≤ 14, but no choice satisfies (7).  
 • C = 5 with B = 6 does satisfy (7):

  left side s(5 + s(6) – 1) = s(5 + 6 – 1) = s(10) = 1,  
  right side B – C = 6 – 5 = 1.

Hence C = 5 and B = 6.  

Then (1) gives A = s(6) + s(5) = 6 + 5 = 11.

Step 4 – checking the final condition

With (A, B, C) = (11, 6, 5):

 C + 6 = 11, s(A + 6) = s(17) = 8, s(B + 6) = s(12) = 3,

and indeed 8 + 3 = 11.

Thus all three original equations are fulfilled and the ages are all different.  
No other pair (B, C) passes condition (7), so the solution is unique.

Albert is 11 years old, Bill is 6 years old, and Charles is 5 years old.

95,"What three-digit number when doubled is, by value, one more than the value of the same three digits when reversed?
If this is too easy, go for extra points included with hint.","A wrongheaded guess would say 123, because 123 * 2 = 321 + 1.  The title hints you can easily go on to find for a ten-digit number that otherwise has same characteristics.","Answer-
397.
397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.
102?  Is 204 = 201 + 1?  No.
103?  Is 206 = 301 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds even.]
396?  Is 792 = 693 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds again.]
The answer given is the only one that passes.
As for extra points, an infinite number of 9's can be added between the 3 and the 7 without spoiling the major characteristics.

2N = 100C + 10B + A + 1.  

Substituting N and simplifying:

2(100A + 10B + C) = 100C + 10B + A + 1  
200A + 20B + 2C = 100C + 10B + A + 1

A = 7 ⇒ 28 ≡ 3 ⇒ 3 + 2C ≡ 1 ⇒ 2C ≡ 3 ⇒ C ≡ 4 (mod 5) ⇒ C = 4 or 9  
A = 9 ⇒ 36 ≡ 1 ⇒ 1 + 2C ≡ 1 ⇒ 2C ≡ 0 ⇒ C ≡ 0 (mod 5) ⇒ C = 0 or 5.

Step 3.  Solve for B.  
Rewrite (★) as 10B = 1 − 199A + 98C.  
The right–hand side must be a multiple of 10 and lie between 0 and 90 inclusive (because B is a single digit).

Check each pair (A, C) obtained in Step 2:

A=1, C=1: 1 −199 + 98 = –100  (negative)  
A=1, C=6: 1 −199 + 588 = 390  (gives B = 39)  ✗

A=3, C=7: 1 −597 + 686 = 90   → B = 9 ✓  
A=5, C=3: 1 −995 + 294 = –700 (negative)  
A=5, C=8: 1 −995 + 784 = –210 (negative)  
A=7, C=4: 1 −1393 + 392 = –1000 (negative)  
A=7, C=9: 1 −1393 + 882 = –510  (negative)  
A=9, C=0: 1 −1791 = –1790  (negative)  
A=9, C=5: 1 −1791 + 490 = –1300 (negative)

Only the combination (A, B, C) = (3, 9, 7) satisfies all conditions.

Verification:  
Original number N = 397.  
Double: 2N = 794.  
Reversed digits value: 793.  
Indeed, 794 = 793 + 1.

Therefore the unique three–digit number with the stated property is 397.

1.  Condition on the digital sum

   •  Mod 3: 3k + 7ℓ ≡ 7ℓ ≡ ℓ (mod 3) ⇒ ℓ ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
      Hence the number of 7’s must be a multiple of 3.

   •  Mod 7: 3k + 7ℓ ≡ 3k (mod 7) ⇒ 3k ≡ 0 (mod 7) ⇒ k ≡ 0 (mod 7).

   •  Divisibility by 3: sum of digits = 7+7+7 = 21, divisible by 3.  
   •  Divisibility by 7: 777 = 7 × 111 = 21 × 37, so it is divisible by 7.

   Hence 777 is divisible by 3 and by 7, i.e. by 21.

4.  Smaller possibilities?  
   •  1–digit numbers (3 or 7) fail because one of the required divisibilities (by 3 or by 7) is missing.  
   •  2–digit numbers (33, 37, 73, 77) all have digital sums not divisible by both 3 and 7.

99,"Tom has 100 coins on the table with their heads up. Each time he flips 93 coins, turning heads to tails or vice versa.
What is the least number of times he must do this in order to get all of them tails up?","Maybe you have seen the ""flip 7 in 10"" problem and think this one is also 4, but it isn't, because the logic is a little different.","If you have seen the ""flip 9 in 10"" problem, you know that you have to leave one coin unflipped each time, and it will require 10 times.
In this problem, the first time leaves 7 coins heads up, the second time leaves at most 14 coins TAILS up, the third time leaves at most 21 coins HEADS up, the fourth time leaves at most 28 coins TAILS up, ..., and the fourteenth time leaves at most 98 coins tails up.
The fifteenth time, he flips 1 of the 2 coins that is heads up, and 92 of the coins that are tails up, leaving 93 coins heads up.
The sixteenth and last time he can get all of them tails up.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let a “move’’ mean: choose exactly 93 of the 100 coins and turn each chosen coin over.

1.  Parity of the total number of moves  

   •  In one move 93 coins are turned over, so after k moves the total number of individual flips equals  
     93 k.  
   •  At the end every coin must show tails.  Since every coin started heads-up, each coin has been
     flipped an odd number of times.  Hence the 100 coins have been flipped a total of
     “odd + odd + … + odd’’ (100 terms) = an even number of times.  
     Therefore 93 k is even, so k itself must be even.

2.  How often each coin may be left untouched in a move  

   During one move 7 coins are *not* flipped.  
   Call a coin “skipped’’ in a move when it is one of these 7 untouched coins.  
   For coin i let sᵢ be the number of moves in which it is skipped.  
   In k moves the coin is flipped k – sᵢ times, and this number has to be odd.  
   Because k is even, k – sᵢ is odd ⇔ sᵢ is odd.  
   Hence every coin must be skipped an odd (therefore at least one) number of times.

3.  A lower bound for k  

   The total number of skip–occurrences in k moves equals 7k, and this must cover at least one
   skip for each of the 100 coins:

        7k  ≥  100   ⇒   k ≥ 100⁄7 > 14.

   With k forced to be even, the first possible value is k = 16.  
   Thus at least 16 moves are necessary.

4.  Constructing 16 moves that work  

   Label the coins 1,2,…,100.  
   Designate the six coins 1-6 to be skipped three times each; the remaining 94 coins
   will be skipped once each.  
   Then

        (6 coins)·3  +  (94 coins)·1  = 18 + 94 = 112 = 7·16

   so the numbers of skips fit exactly into 16 moves.

   Arrange the moves as follows (each line lists the 7 coins **not** flipped in that move).

        Move 1 :  1 ,  7  8  9 10 11 12
        Move 2 :  1 , 13 14 15 16 17 18
        Move 3 :  2 , 19 20 21 22 23 24
        Move 4 :  2 , 25 26 27 28 29 30
        Move 5 :  3 , 31 32 33 34 35 36
        Move 6 :  3 , 37 38 39 40 41 42
        Move 7 :  4 , 43 44 45 46 47 48
        Move 8 :  4 , 49 50 51 52 53 54
        Move 9 :  5 , 55 56 57 58 59 60
        Move10 :  5 , 61 62 63 64 65 66
        Move11 :  6 , 67 68 69 70 71 72
        Move12 :  6 , 73 74 75 76 77 78
        Move13 :  1 , 79 80 81 82 83 84
        Move14 :  2 , 85 86 87 88 89 90
        Move15 :  3  4 , 91 92 93 94 95
        Move16 :  5  6 , 96 97 98 99 100

   Check of the skip–counts  
   •  Coins 1-6 are each skipped three times (once in two single-coin moves and once in a
      double-coin move).  
   •  Every other coin, 7-100, is skipped exactly once.  
   Therefore every coin is skipped an odd number of times, complying with the requirement.

   Consequently each coin is flipped

        coins 1-6 : 16 – 3 = 13 times  (odd)  
        coins 7-100 : 16 – 1 = 15 times  (odd),

   so all 100 coins finish tails-up.

Since 16 moves are achievable and fewer than 16 are impossible, the least number of moves required is 16.

1) Beginning with the 1st year, the number of births will be 4 (4% of 100 = 4) and the number of deaths will be 3 (3% of 100 = 3), which results in a population increase of 1.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year for 25 years, reaching 125 at the end of the 25th year.
2) Beginning with the 26th year, the number of births per year will increase to 5 (4% of 125 = 5), while the deaths will still be 3.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 135 at the end of the 30th year.

so the change in population is  

 Δ(P​n ) = ⌊0.04 P​n ⌋ − ⌊0.03 P​n ⌋.  

We must discover (i) for which integer populations P the value Δ(P) equals 1, and
(ii) in what year such a population is last encountered.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  When is Δ(P) = 1 ?

Write P = 25m + r with 0 ≤ r ≤ 24 (m = ⌊P/25⌋).

Then  
 ⌊0.04 P⌋ = ⌊(25m+r)/25⌋ = m,  
 ⌊0.03 P⌋ = ⌊(75m+3r)/100⌋.

Hence Δ(P)=1 iff

 m − ⌊(75m+3r)/100⌋ = 1
 ⇔ m–1 ≤ (75m+3r)/100 < m
 ⇔ 25m−100 ≤ 3r < 25m.                (★)

Because 0 ≤ 3r ≤ 72, (★) can hold only while 25m−100 ≤ 72, i.e. m ≤ 6.
Examining m = 4,5,6 we obtain the r that satisfy (★):

 m = 4 ⇒ 25·4−100 = 0   0 ≤ 3r < 100  (all r = 0…24)
   P  = 100 … 124

 m = 5 ⇒ 25·5−100 = 25  25 ≤ 3r < 125  (r = 9…24)
   P  = 134 … 149

 m = 6 ⇒ 25·6−100 = 50  50 ≤ 3r < 150  (r = 17…24)
   P  = 167 … 174

For m ≥ 7 no r satisfies (★).  
Thus

 Δ(P) = 1 precisely for

2.  Follow the population year by year

Starting with P₁ = 100:

• Years 1–25 (P = 100→124): Δ = 1 each year  
 After 25 years P = 125.

• P = 125–133: Δ = 2 (check one value: for P = 125,  ⌊0.04·125⌋=5, ⌊0.03·125⌋=3)  
 125 → 127 → 129 → 131 → 133 → 135.  
 This takes 5 years (years 26–30).

• Years 31–45 (P = 135→149): Δ = 1 each year (15 years).  
 After year 45 P = 150.

• P = 150–166: Δ = 2 each year.  
 150 → 152 → 154 → 156 → 158 → 160 → 162 → 164 → 166 → 168.  
 That is 9 years (years 46–54).

• Years 55–61 (P = 168→174): Δ = 1 each year (7 years).  
 At the end of year 61 P = 175.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  What happens after P = 174 ?

Because 174 is the largest population for which Δ = 1, every year that starts with
P ≥ 175 has Δ ≥ 2.  Indeed, for P = 175 we have

 ⌊0.04·175⌋ = 7, ⌊0.03·175⌋ = 5, Δ = 2.

Hence year 61 (which began with 174 people) is the very last year in which the colony grows by exactly one person.

""You know what occurred to me the other day, Cal?"" asked Professor Gebra.
""What's that?"" said Professor Culus.

t = years since they met = A – a = C – c.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  The “same three digits” condition
--------------------------------------------------------------------
At the time they met the squares of their ages had the same three
digits in a different order.  
Hence a² and c² are both three–digit numbers containing the same
digits.  
Thus 10 ≤ a, c ≤ 31 (because 10² = 100 and 31² = 961).

List of three–digit perfect squares in this range, together with the
multisets of their digits:

10² = 100  → {0,0,1}  
11² = 121  → {1,1,2}  
12² = 144  → {1,4,4}  
13² = 169  → {1,6,9}  
14² = 196  → {1,6,9}  
15² = 225  → {2,2,5}  
16² = 256  → {2,5,6}  
17² = 289  → {2,8,9}  
18² = 324  → {2,3,4}  
19² = 361  → {1,3,6}  
20² = 400  → {0,0,4}  
21² = 441  → {1,4,4}  
22² = 484  → {4,4,8}  
23² = 529  → {2,5,9}  
24² = 576  → {5,6,7}  
25² = 625  → {2,5,6}

27² = 729  → {2,7,9}  
28² = 784  → {4,7,8}  
29² = 841  → {1,4,8}  
30² = 900  → {0,0,9}  
31² = 961  → {1,6,9}

From the list, the only distinct squares sharing the same three digits
are

12² = 144 and 21² = 441,  
13² = 169, 14² = 196, 31² = 961,  
16² = 256 and 25² = 625.

Therefore the possible (a, c) pairs are

(12, 21), (21, 12), (13, 14), (14, 13), (13, 31), (31, 13),
(14, 31), (31, 14), (16, 25), (25, 16).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  The “square-of-the-sum” condition
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Cal says: “If you take the square of the sum of our ages when we met
and split it into two two-digit numbers, you’d have my age then and
your age now.”

Hence (a + c)² is a four-digit number whose first two digits are c and
whose last two digits are A.  Symbolically,

(a + c)² = 100·c + A,          (1)

with 10 ≤ c ≤ 31 and 10 ≤ A ≤ 99.

Test each candidate pair:

1. (12, 21): (12 + 21)² = 33² = 1089  → 10|89 (first two digits 10 ≠ 21)  
2. (21, 12): (21 + 12)² = 33² = 1089  → 10|89 (10 ≠ 12)  
3. (13, 14): (13 + 14)² = 27² = 729   (three-digit, impossible)  
4. (14, 13): same failure  
5. (13, 31): (44)² = 1936 → 19|36 (19 ≠ 31)  
6. (31, 13): same failure  
7. (14, 31): (45)² = 2025 → 20|25 (20 ≠ 31)  
8. (31, 14): same failure  
9. (16, 25): (41)² = 1681 → 16|81 (first two digits 16 = c)  ✓  
10.(25, 16): (41)² = 1681 → 16|81 (16 ≠ 25)  ✗

The only pair satisfying (1) is

a = 25, c = 16,  (a + c)² = 1681 = 100·16 + 81.

Thus Cal’s age at their first meeting was 16 and Al’s present age is 81.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Consistency check
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Time elapsed: t = A – a = 81 – 25 = 56 years.  
Cal’s present age: C = c + t = 16 + 56 = 72.

Everything is plausible: two elderly professors, aged 81 and 72,
reminiscing about meeting 56 years ago when they were 25 and 16, and
the numerical conditions are exactly met.

Therefore Professor Al Gebra’s present age is 81.

Kurt handed her the last he had.  She bit in, and her face lit up like a newly-coined metaphor.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""Rod and I were about to go order some more.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""  Patty's blank look bade him explain.  ""In our first batch, we got a total of 25 -- 20 for me, and 5 for Rod.  I had 20, and he had 20% of the total.""
""And you think you can do that for three people?  You get my percentage, and I get Rod's?  I don't think we can do it.""
Rod had been thinking about it, and rattled off three numbers to her.
""Those aren't right.  The last one isn't the right percentage; there's an added fraction.""
""So?  My mom says they're the same on her old phonograph speeds.""
Patty looked at Kurt, each waiting for the other to give an opinion.  Finally, she gestured at the empty wrapper in his hand.
""I'll round off a little for a week's supply of these.  Let's go!""
Since Rnkfurters come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, they had to leave 10 with the storekeeper to make the numbers work, but they got their munchies.
How many did each student get this time?","The old phonograph speeds were typically 16, 33-1/3, 45, and 78 RPM.","27 for Kurt, 30 for Patty, and 33 for Rod.
That's 30% for Kurt and 33-1/3% for Patty.
Method:
Let K, P, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, K+P+R.
Now, since Kurt's percentage equals Patty's quantity, we get
100*K/T = P.
Similarly,
100*P/T = R plus a fraction.  Now, look at the common factor, 100/T.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
K*F = P and P*F = R (plus a fraction),
and K*F^2 = R (plus a fraction).
The clue about the phonograph leaves us looking for a triple with 33 Rnkfurters for Rod, with Patty getting 33-1/3% (one-third) of the total.
P = T/3
P = (K+P+33)/3 -- remember, R=33

 P = number Patty gets  
 T = K + R + P = total they really want to take home  

The boys’ “percentage game” now has to work for three people.

1.  Patty is to receive exactly the number that equals Rod’s percentage of the total  
   P = (R∕T)·100 .   (†)

2.  Kurt is to receive the number that equals Patty’s percentage of the total.  
     Patty’s percentage is generally not an integer (e.g. 33⅓ %), but Patty agrees to
     “round off a little”; i.e. Kurt will take the nearest whole number to that
     percentage:  
   K = round ( (P∕T)·100 ).   (‡)

3.  The shop packs Rnkfurters only in lots of 25, 50 or 100.  
    They finally buy the next larger multiple of 25 and leave 10 with the
    store-keeper, so
   T ≡ –10 (mod 25) ⟺ T ≡ 15 (mod 25).   (§)

──────────────────────────
Working with the exact condition (†)

From (†) P = 100R/T  ⇒ T divides 100R.  
Choose the smallest total that also satisfies (§).  
The least positive integer ≡ 15 (mod 25) is 90, and 90 | 100R as soon as R is a
multiple of 9.

Write R = 9n.  
Then P = 100·9n / 90 = 10n.

──────────────────────────
Now impose the “rounded” condition (‡)

Patty’s percentage is

  (P∕T)·100 = (10n/90)·100 = (100/9)n = 11 1⁄9 n .

The nearest integer to 11 1⁄9 n is 11 n, so

  K = 11n.

Thus

  K : P : R = 11n : 10n : 9n
  T = 30n.

But we already fixed T = 90, so 30n = 90 ⇒ n = 3.

Therefore

  K = 11·3 = 33,  P = 10·3 = 30,  R = 9·3 = 27,
  T = 33 + 30 + 27 = 90.

──────────────────────────
Checking the conditions

•  Rod’s percentage of 90 is 27⁄90·100 = 30 %.  
   Patty indeed gets 30 Rnkfurters. ✓

•  Patty’s percentage of 90 is 30⁄90·100 = 33⅓ %.  
   Rounded to the nearest whole number this is 33, which is what Kurt gets. ✓  
   (Patty’s quibble about “the added fraction” is the extra ⅓ %, i.e. the
   phonograph-speed “33 1⁄3”.)

•  Total wanted is 90; the boys can only buy in case lots.  
   The next multiple of 25 is 100, so they buy 100 and leave 10 behind. ✓

Hence the only possible distribution that fits every remark in the story is

 Kurt 33   Patty 30   Rod 27.

Final answer: Kurt gets 33, Patty gets 30, and Rod gets 27 Rnkfurters.",True,0,0
105,"A man is standing on a rock in the middle of a circular lake of radius 1. There is a tiger on the shore of the lake that can run four times as fast you can swim, however the tiger cannot swim. The tiger is hungry and always attempts to keep the distance between the two of you at a minimum. How can you safely swim to shore?
Assume that as long as you can get to the shore before the tiger gets to you (even if it is only a split-second before), you will be safe.",Use the factor of 4 to your advantage,"Until you are more than 1/4 of the radius away from the rock you can swim fast enough so that you can keep the tiger the furthest distance possible from you. Regardless of which direction the tiger moves around the circle, you swim the other way, always keeping the rock between you and the tiger.  While you are doing this you will be able to move outward, since you will have some energy to spare.
Before long you will be 1/4 of the radius away from the center and the tiger will be 180 degrees away. At this point swim straight to the point on the shore furthest from the tiger. You will be able to get there in 3/4 units of time, while it will take the tiger pi/4 =~ 0.7854 units of time.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let your swimming speed be v = 1 and the tiger’s running speed 4v = 4.  
The lake is a circle of radius 1 with centre O.  You start at O, the tiger is somewhere on the circumference.

1.  Choose a radius  
        r such that 1 – π⁄4 < r < ¼.  
    Numerically, 1 – π⁄4 ≈ 0.2146 and ¼ = 0.25, so you may take, for instance,  
        r = 0.23.

2.  Reach the circle |OP| = r.  
    From the centre swim straight out until your distance from O is r (this takes the
    tiger no closer to you, because while you are moving directly away from O the
    tiger, who is outside the lake, can do nothing better than stay where he is).

3.  Swim round O on the circle |OP| = r until the tiger is diametrically opposite you.  

    •  Your angular speed about O is ω_m = v/r = 1/r.  
       With r = 0.23, ω_m ≈ 4.35.  
    •  The tiger, running on the bank of radius 1, has angular speed  
       ω_t = 4v/1 = 4.  

    Because ω_m > ω_t you can increase the angle between you and the tiger; in
    particular you can make that angle exactly π (180°).  
    While you are doing this the tiger continually adjusts his position, but the
    distance between you and the tiger (across the water) never falls below 1 – r > ¾,
    so you are in no immediate danger.

4.  Dash straight for the shore along the radius on which you now lie.  

    •  Distance you must swim: 1 – r.  
      Time you need: T_m = (1 – r)/v = 1 – r.  
      With r = 0.23, T_m = 0.77.  

    •  The tiger is on the opposite side of the lake; to reach your landing point
      it has to run half the circumference, a distance π.  
      Time the tiger needs: T_t = π/(4v) = π/4 ≈ 0.7854.

    Because 1 – r < π/4 by the choice of r, we have T_m < T_t.  
    Numerically, 0.77 < 0.7854, so you reach the bank a few hundredths of a time-unit
    before the tiger.

Hence the tiger arrives too late to catch you, and you are safe.

The essential facts are

•  If you keep inside the circle of radius ¼ your angular speed exceeds the tiger’s,
   so you can place him where you want on the rim.

•  Choosing any r with 1 – π/4 < r < ¼ guarantees that the radial dash to the shore
   is completed sooner than the tiger can cover the required half-circumference.

Final answer: Swim in a small circle of radius slightly less than ¼ until the tiger is exactly opposite you, then swim straight to the bank; you reach land before the tiger can run halfway round the shore, so you escape.",True,1,0

Divisibility conditions for the process to use whole marbles

1. N must be divisible by 2 (for the ½ to be integral).  
2. R₁ = N/2 must be divisible by 3  ⇒ N divisible by 2·3 = 6.  
3. R₂ = N/3 must be divisible by 4  ⇒ N divisible by 3·4 = 12.  
4. R₃ = N/4 must be divisible by 5  ⇒ N divisible by 4·5 = 20.  
5. R₄ = N/5 must be divisible by 6  ⇒ N divisible by 5·6 = 30.  
6. R₅ = N/6 must be divisible by 7  ⇒ N divisible by 6·7 = 42.  
7. R₆ = N/7 must be divisible by 8  ⇒ N divisible by 7·8 = 56.  
8. R₇ = N/8 must be divisible by 9  ⇒ N divisible by 8·9 = 72.  
9. R₈ = N/9 must be divisible by 10 ⇒ N divisible by 9·10 = 90.

Therefore N must be a common multiple of
2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90.

Compute their least common multiple:

2 = 2  
6 = 2·3  
12 = 2²·3  
20 = 2²·5  
30 = 2·3·5  
42 = 2·3·7  
56 = 2³·7  
72 = 2³·3²  
90 = 2·3²·5  

The highest powers of the primes involved are  
2³, 3², 5¹, 7¹.

So LCM = 2³·3²·5·7 = 8·9·5·7 = 2520.

Thus the smallest possible initial number of marbles is 2520; consequently the smallest possible number Justin can still have is

R₉ = N/10 = 2520/10 = 252.

If Will got it right, Arnold would clean his room for the rest of the year. However, if Will got it WRONG, he would have to clean Arnold's room for a year and do his dishes for a month. After thinking for a while, Will agreed to this. This was Arnold's teaser:

48 , 159 , 7632",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"We must build three positive integers that

• together use every digit 1-9 exactly once (no zeros), and  
• satisfy “first × second = third”.

How many digits can the three numbers have?

Let the two factors have a and b digits and the product have c digits.  
We need a + b + c = 9.

Because the product of two numbers having at least two digits already exceeds 99, c cannot be 2; if both factors had three digits, their product would have at least five digits; hence the only feasible split is

a = 2, b = 3, c = 4.              (2-digit) × (3-digit) = (4-digit)

Step 1.  Use divisibility by 9  
The sum of the nine different digits 1+2+…+9 = 45 is divisible by 9, so the product itself must be divisible by 9.  Therefore at least one of the two factors must be a multiple of 9.  It is simplest to make the 2-digit factor a multiple of 9.

Among the two-digit multiples of 9 that do not repeat a digit and contain no 0 we have  
18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81.

Step 2.  Choose the final digit of the product  
Since no factor may contain a 0 or a 5, the only convenient way to obtain a final digit 5 or 0 in the product is impossible, so let the product end in 6 (a very common final digit: 2×3, 2×8, 4×4, 7×8 … all give 6).

If the 2-digit factor ends in 7, multiplying by a number that ends in 8 gives the desired last-digit pattern 7 × 8 ≡ 6 (mod 10).  
Hence pick the 2-digit factor 27 and let the 3-digit factor end in 8.

Step 3.  Finish the 3-digit factor  
The digits 2 and 7 are used, leaving 1,3,4,5,6,8,9.  To ensure the 3-digit factor is divisible by 9 (so the whole product is divisible by 81), its digit-sum must be a multiple of 9.  With the ending 8, selecting 1 and 9 gives 1+9+8 = 18, indeed a multiple of 9.  Thus choose the 3-digit factor 198.

Step 4.  Verify the multiplication and digit-usage  
27 × 198 = 5346

Digits used:  
27 → 2,7  
198 → 1,9,8  
5346 → 5,3,4,6  

All nine digits 1-9 appear exactly once, with none repeated and none omitted.  Therefore the construction is valid.

We have produced the required new pandigital identity.

Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.

Their relative speed is |v₁ − v₂|, and one full circumference of gain is needed
for an overtaking to occur.

Period between consecutive overtakes  
 T₂ = L / |v₁ − v₂|.

Given that they meet every 120 s,

 L / |v₁ − v₂| = 120  
 ⇒ |v₁ − v₂| = L / 120 = 1800 / 120 = 15 m s⁻¹. (2)

Without loss of generality let v₁ > v₂, so v₁ − v₂ = 15.

-------------------------------------------------
3. Solving for the individual speeds
-------------------------------------------------
From (1): v₁ + v₂ = 60  
From (2): v₁ − v₂ = 15

Add: 2v₁ = 75 ⇒ v₁ = 37.5 m s⁻¹  
Substitute: v₂ = 60 − 37.5 = 22.5 m s⁻¹

-------------------------------------------------
4. Expressing the answers
-------------------------------------------------
37.5 m s⁻¹ = 37.5 × 3.6 = 135 km h⁻¹  
22.5 m s⁻¹ = 22.5 × 3.6 = 81 km h⁻¹

Final answer: Car 1 travels at 37.5 m/s (135 km/h) and Car 2 travels at 22.5 m/s (81 km/h).",True,1,0
110,A man has nine children born at regular intervals. The sum of the square of their ages is equal to the square of his own age. What are the ages of his children?,The youngest children are very young,"You can basically use two parameters--the age of the youngest child and the age difference. Then, toggle with these two things and see if the sum of squares is a square. The ages are 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23 and 26. The man's age is 48.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the nine children be  

a , a+d , a+2d , … , a+8d  (d>0, the common interval, a≥0).  

Let the father’s present age be F.  
According to the statement  

(1) (a)^2+(a+d)^2+⋯+(a+8d)^2 = F^2 .

1.  Write the left–hand side in closed form.  
 Σ_{k=0}^{8}(a+kd)^2  
 = 9a^2+72ad+204d^2 .

2.  Complete the square in a.  
 9a^2+72ad+204d^2 = 9(a+4d)^2 + 60d^2.  
Put  

 p = a+4d  (so a = p−4d).  

Then

(2) F^2 = 9p^2 + 60d^2 .

3.  Factor (2).  
 F^2 – (3p)^2 = 60d^2  
 ⇒ (F−3p)(F+3p) = 60d^2.                    (3)

4.  Determine the parity of the factors.  
The two factors on the left differ by 6p, hence they have the same parity.  
Because their product is divisible by 3, each is divisible by 3; write  

 F−3p = 6u, F+3p = 6v  (u,v positive, v>u).  

Then from (3)

 6u·6v = 60d^2  ⇒ uv = 15d^2.            (4)

5.  Remove the square–free part.  
Because 15 = 3·5 is square–free, (4) implies that d itself must contain the factor 3; write d = 3e (e>0).  
Then (4) becomes  

 uv = 15e^2.                                                 (5)

6.  Solve (5).  
The positive divisors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, 15.  Hence the possibilities for {u,v} (with u≤v) are

 {1,15}, {3,5}.  

(The larger sets that appear when e≥2 give rise to father’s ages far beyond the children-bearing span and will be discussed later.)

7.  Use the first possibility u = 1, v = 15, with e = 1.  
Then

 d = 3e = 3,  
 F = 3(u+v) = 3·16 = 48,  
 p = v−u = 14,  
 a = p−4d = 14 − 12 = 2.

Thus the children are

 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26 years old.

A check:

 2^2+5^2+8^2+11^2+14^2+17^2+20^2+23^2+26^2  
 = 4+25+64+121+196+289+400+529+676  
 = 2304 = 48^2 = F^2.

8.  Why the other formal solutions are rejected.  
With d = 3e = 6, 9, … (obtained by taking e ≥ 2 or the second factor-pair {3,5}) one gets father’s ages 96, 144, … and intervals of 6, 9, … years between births; the nine births would have to extend over 48, 72, … years, which is biologically impossible for a single set of parents.  Hence the only admissible integral solution is the one just found.

Therefore the ages of the nine children are

2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23 and 26 years.

111,"Mad Ade was visiting his friend, computer tycoon and Olympic Kebab hurling champion, Mike Rohsopht.
He was there on Sunday and when the radio gave the time at the hour, Mad Ade noticed that the Madadian antique clock, designed by Madadian clock maker Arthur Minit (teaser #4891) was exactly 3 minutes slow.
""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Mike assured Mad Ade that his treasured Arthur Minit clock had not been adjusted nor fixed since his last visit.
What day of the week was Mad Ade's second visit?",It must lose some multiple of 12 hours in total,"The answer is 17 days and 3 hours later, which would have been a Wednesday.
This is the only other time in the same month when the two would agree at all.
In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.
Since the clock was not adjusted since the last visit, it's also possible that the radio time shifted by one hour due to a change to or from summer daylight saving time.  However, it turns out that the only additional possibilities that need to be considered are those of 4 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 12 hours 57 minutes, and 29 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 3 days 10 hours 57 minutes.  Without even considering the rules for when in the month the
clock is changed, these possible solutions are ruled out because we know that both visits were in the evening (""Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht"") and they involve times in a different part of the day.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the radio give the exact hour at the moment of the first visit (on a Sunday).  
At that instant the Arthur Minit clock is 3 minutes slow.

1.  How the error grows  
   The clock loses 7 minutes every real hour.  
   After n real hours its total loss is  

            loss = 3 min + 7 n min.                       (1)

2.  When can the clock read the correct time again?  
   The hands of an ordinary 12-hour dial repeat every 12 hours = 720 minutes.  
   Thus the loss in (1) must equal an integer number k of full 12-hour turns:

            3 + 7 n = 720 k,    with k ∈ ℤ.              (2)

3.  Solving for n  
   Because gcd(7, 720)=1, equation (2) has a unique solution for n modulo 720.  
   Multiplying by the inverse of 7 modulo 720 (7·103 = 721 ≡ 1) gives  

            n ≡ 3·103 ≡ 309   (mod 720).

   The smallest positive integral n is therefore  

            n = 309 hours.                                (3)

4.  Converting 309 hours  
            309 h = 12 days + 21 hours.

   So the second coincidence of clock and radio occurs exactly 12 days 21 hours after the first.

5.  What day of the week is that?  
   Twelve days advance the calendar by 1 week + 5 days:  

            Sunday → Friday.                              (4)

   The extra 21 hours do not reach a full additional day provided the first observation was made no later than 2 a.m., and the story tells us the second meeting was “rather late in the evening”.  
   (If the first check had been after 3 a.m., the 21-hour surplus would push the time into Saturday morning, contradicting the “late evening” description.)

   Hence the second visit took place on the same civil day reached in (4).

Solving for x:
x= 42.985 degrees",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

Tₕ = 105 °F  (hot–water temperature, faucet fully open)  
T𝚌 = 45 °F   (cold–water temperature)  

Denote by H the (fixed) volumetric flow rate of the hot water when its faucet is wide-open, and by C the flow rate of the cold water.  When the cold faucet is turned from shut-off to fully open it can rotate 360°, and we assume its flow rate is directly proportional to the angle θ (in degrees) through which it is turned.  Hence

C = (θ / 360°) H.

(The constant of proportionality is H because at θ = 360° both faucets would deliver the same maximum flow rate H.)

The mixed water temperature T that comes out of the shower is the weighted average of the two streams:

T = (H Tₕ + C T𝚌) / (H + C).

Substitute C = (θ/360) H and the numerical temperatures:

T = [H·105 + (θ/360)H·45] / [H + (θ/360)H]
   = (105 + 45 θ/360) / (1 + θ/360).

We want T to equal normal body temperature, 98.6 °F:

(105 + 45 θ/360) / (1 + θ/360) = 98.6.

Let x = θ/360.  Then

105 + 45x = 98.6(1 + x)  
105 + 45x = 98.6 + 98.6x  
105 – 98.6 = 98.6x – 45x  
6.4 = 53.6x  
x = 6.4 / 53.6 = 8 / 67.

Therefore

θ = 360 x = 360·(8/67) = 2880/67 ≈ 42.99°.

So the cold-water handle must be opened by roughly 43 degrees from the shut-off position.

Final answer: about 43° of rotation of the cold-water faucet.",True,1,0

497 * 2 = 994",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the two positive integers be x ≥ y.

1.  Denote their sum by  
       S = x + y   ( three–digit : 100 ≤ S ≤ 999 )

    and let R be the reversal of S, i.e.  
       R = rev(S).

    The condition of the problem is  

          x + y = S ,      x · y = R .                (1)

2.  A first bound for y  
    Since R ≤ 999 and x ≥ y we have y² ≤ xy = R ≤ 999, so y ≤ 31.  
    A sharper bound is obtained from (1):

          y(S – y) = R ≤ 999  ⇒  y(100 – y) ≤ 999 .

    For y = 12 the left–hand side is 12·88 = 1056 > 999,  
    hence y ≤ 11.  Thus

          1 ≤ y ≤ 11.                                     (2)

3.  Writing S with its digits  
       S = 100a + 10b + c  (a ≠ 0 , a,b,c ∈ {0,…,9}) ,

    its reversal is  
       R = 100c + 10b + a.

    Substituting these expressions in (1) gives

          y(100a + 10b + c) – (100c + 10b + a) = y².      (3)

    Rearranging,

          a(100y – 1) + b·10(y – 1) + c(y – 100) = y².    (4)

    For every integer y in the range (2) we must decide whether
    (4) admits digits a,b,c.

4.  Eliminating the impossible values of y  

    y = 1 :   99(a – c) = 1      impossible.  

    y = 2 :   199a + 10b – 98c = 4.  
              Trying a = 4 (even, necessary for parity) gives  
              199·4 + 10b – 98·9 = 4 → 796 + 10b – 882 = 4 → 10b = 90 → b = 9.  
              Digits (a,b,c) = (4,9,9) satisfy the equation.  
              Hence S = 499,   R = 994, and the numbers are

    y = 4 :   399a + 30b – 96c = 16 ; the left side is divisible by 3,
              the right side is not  ⇒  impossible.

    y = 5 :   499a + 40b – 95c = 25 ; modulo 5 forces a = 5,
              which leads to b negative  ⇒  impossible.

    y = 6 :   599a + 50b – 94c = 36 ; divisibility by 50 fails  ⇒  impossible.

    y = 7 :   699a + 60b – 93c = 49 ; left side ≡ 0 (mod 3), right side ≡ 1  ⇒  impossible.

    y = 8 :   799a + 70b – 92c = 64 ; divisibility by 70 fails  ⇒  impossible.

    y = 9 :   899a + 80b – 91c = 81 ; modulo 10 gives c = 9a – 1,
              which leads to b non-integral  ⇒  impossible.

    y = 10 :  999a + 90b – 90c = 100 ; left side ≡ 0 (mod 9), right side ≡ 1  ⇒  impossible.

    y = 11 :  1099a + 100b – 89c = 121 ; modulo 10 gives a – c ≡ 9,
              no admissible b  ⇒  impossible.

5.  Conclusion  
    The only value of y that works is y = 2, giving S = 499 and R = 994, i.e.

          497 + 2 = 499 ,    497 × 2 = 994 ,

1.  Definitions  
   – n is abundant ⇔ σ(n) > n.  
   – n is weird      ⇔ n is abundant and no sub-collection of its proper
     divisors has sum n.

2.  The candidate 70  

   Proper divisors of 70 : 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 14 , 35  
   Their total is 74 > 70, so 70 is abundant.

   We must show that no subset of {1,2,5,7,10,14,35} adds up to 70.

   (i)  If 35 were present, the remaining divisors would have to
        contribute 35.  
        The largest sum obtainable from {1,2,5,7,10,14} is  
        14+10+7+5+2+1 = 39, and every one of its subsums is
        39–k with k≥1, hence strictly below 35.
        Therefore no subset containing 35 totals 70.

   (ii) Hence 35 is absent.  
        If 14 were present (with 35 absent) the biggest possible total
        would be 14+ (1+2+5+7+10)=39 < 70.  
        Therefore 14 is absent.

   (iii)  If 10 were present (with 35,14 absent) the largest possible
          total is 10+ (1+2+5+7)=25 < 70, so 10 is absent.

   (iv)  With 35,14,10 already excluded, the remaining divisors are
         {1,2,5,7}.  Their whole sum is 15 < 70.

   Consequently no subset of the proper divisors of 70 gives 70.
   Therefore 70 is weird.

3.  No smaller number can be weird  

   Every abundant integer below 70 has a subset of its proper divisors
   whose sum equals the number itself (a short exhibit is given).

In the ritual, each arm of a male links with an arm of a female, no male-female pair of robots linking more than once. The minimum number of robots required to link all arms once only is the number belonging to that tribe. Now one night, the Creaky tribe cornered half of the Rusty tribe and despite being outnumbered two to one, unscrewed one arm from each, there being an equal number of male and female victims. However, the Creaky tribe were extremely poor at arithmetic and had failed to realise that they needed 24 times their actual haul of spare arms in order that the number of links their members could then make, each with the same number of extra arms, was half the maximum number of links the Rusty tribe could then make.

 x = number of arms on each Creaky robot  
 y = number of arms on each Rusty robot  

Because every tribe contains the least possible number of robots that allows all arms to be linked once (no pair of robots linking more than once), a tribe with k-armed robots must contain exactly 2k robots (k males, k females).

The raid  
Half of the Rusty tribe (R/2 robots) was cornered.  
Creakies were “out-numbered two to one”, so

Using (1) in (2):

The haul of arms

Condition given in the problem  
Creakies’ links (7) must equal one half of Rusties’ links (8):

Verification  
• Half the Rusties = 28, twice the 14 Creakies.  
• Arms captured S = 28; 24S = 672 arms give each Creaky 48 extras (672/14 = 48).

They agreed that each should cut one-half of the area. Junior went first, and cut a border 2 metres wide all the way around.
After doing a few sums, Little Miss agreed that exactly one-half had been cut and happily cut the rest.

Junior mows a strip 2 m wide all round the edge.

Hence

 = original area – inner square area  
 = s² – (s – 4)².

We are told this area is exactly one-half of the lawn, i.e.

 s² – (s – 4)² = ½ s².

Expand and simplify:

s² – (s² – 8s + 16) = ½ s²  
8s – 16 = ½ s²  
Multiply by 2: 16s – 32 = s²  
Bring all terms to one side: s² – 16s + 32 = 0.

The pieces do not need to be of equal size.","After j cuts, how many additional pieces can you cut with the (j+1)-th cut?","The answer is n*(n+1)/2 + 1.
With every cut you should cut through every previous cut. As long as you keep doing this you will always be able to do so again with your next cut. The number of additional pieces formed on cut x will always be x. The sum of all integers from 1 to n is n*(n+1)/2. So the sum of additional pieces cut will be n*(n+1)/2.
Finally add 1 because we start with 1 piece: n*(n+1)/2 + 1.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let P(n) be the greatest possible number of pieces a circular pizza can be cut into with n straight cuts.

Step 1.  Base case  
With 0 cuts the pizza remains whole, so  
P(0)=1.

Step 2.  How the nth cut can add pieces  
Assume we already have performed n−1 cuts in such a way that they produced the maximum number P(n−1) of pieces; in particular:  
• no two previous cuts are parallel, and  
• no three previous cuts meet at a single interior point.  

Place the nth cut so that it is not parallel to any earlier cut and does not pass through any earlier intersection point.  
Because of these two conditions the nth line meets every one of the n−1 previous lines in a distinct interior point, hence it is divided into n separate segments.  
Each of those segments lies inside a single existing piece of pizza and splits that piece into two.  
Consequently the nth cut increases the piece count by exactly n.

Therefore
P(n)=P(n−1)+n.       (recurrence relation)

Step 3.  Solve the recurrence  
Starting from P(0)=1,

P(1)=P(0)+1 = 2  
P(2)=P(1)+2 = 4  
P(3)=P(2)+3 = 7  
⋯  

Summing the increments gives
P(n)=1+1+2+3+⋯+n

One less complex method is to imagine the axis of the cone form a right triangle. This triangle shares the dimensions of the cone, so it is 12 by 5. We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.
Next we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x. If we add 10x on both sides, we get 22x=60, and dividing 22 from both sides yields x=60/22=30/11.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let

Put the cone so that its apex is at the origin and its base is the plane z = 12.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  A bound for S

From (4) we need L S + c₃ ≤ 9.  As c₃ ≥ 0,  
  L S ≤ 9 ⇒ S ≤ ⌊9/L⌋.  

Hence

 L = 2  ⇒ S ≤ 4   
 L = 3  ⇒ S ≤ 3   
 L ≥ 4 ⇒ S ≤ 2.

Because all letters are different, S ≠ L and S ≠ 0.

2.  The case L = 1

For L = 1 the congruence obtained from (1) and (4) is

Trying S = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 shows no value of c₃ (0 ≤ c₃ ≤ 9 − S)

 R = 2·3 + c₃ = 6 + c₃ ≤ 9 ⇒ c₃ ≤ 3.   
 Equation (1): 3R ≡ 2 (mod 10) ⇒ 3(6 + c₃) ≡ 2 (mod 10)

 So S ≠ 3.

•  S = 4  

 R = 2·4 + c₃ = 8 + c₃ ≤ 9 ⇒ c₃ = 0 or 1.  
 Equation (1): 4R ≡ 2 (mod 10).

 If c₃ = 1, R = 9 and 4·9 ≡ 6 ≠ 2 (mod 10).  
 If c₃ = 0, R = 8 and 4·8 = 32 ≡ 2 (mod 10) – works.  
 Thus L = 2 , S = 4 , R = 8 , c₃ = 0.

4.  Determining I, A and the remaining carries

 16I + 4c₂ + 3 = 10c₂ + I  
 15I + 3 = 6c₂  
 2c₂ = 5I + 1.                       (★)

Because 5I + 1 is even, I must be odd.  Testing odd digits ≠ 2,4,8:

 I = 1 ⇒ 2c₂ = 6 ⇒ c₂ = 3 (satisfies c₂ ≤ 3)  
 I = 3 ⇒ 2c₂ = 16 ⇒ c₂ = 8 (too large)  
 I ≥ 5 leads to c₂ ≥ 13 (impossible).

Hence I = 1 and c₂ = 3.

Step 2 – revolutions of the 64-tooth wheel  
r₃ = – N₂ / N₃ · r₂  
     = –160/64 · (–121/80 · x)  
     = (160·121)/(64·80) · x = 121/32 · x.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 3 – revolutions of the 22-tooth wheel  
r₄ = – N₃ / N₄ · r₃  
     = –64/22 · (121/32 · x)  
     = –(64·121)/(22·32) · x = –11 · x.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 4 – condition for all wheels to return to their starting
positions  

Each wheel must turn an integer number of revolutions:

• r₂ = –121x/80 ∈ ℤ ⇒ 121x divisible by 80.  
• r₃ = 121x/32 ∈ ℤ ⇒ 121x divisible by 32.  
• r₄ = –11x      is integral whenever x is integral.

Because 121 is coprime to both 80 and 32, the divisibility
conditions reduce to

x divisible by 80 and by 32.

The least common multiple of 80 (2⁴·5) and 32 (2⁵) is  
LCM(80,32) = 2⁵·5 = 160.

Hence the smallest positive integer x satisfying the two conditions is

x = 160.

-------------------------------------------------
Conclusion  

After 160 revolutions of the 242-tooth cog, every wheel in the train
has completed an integral number of revolutions and is therefore back
in the exact orientation it had at the start.

125,"Three people (A, B, and C) need to cross a bridge. A can cross the bridge in 10 minutes, B can cross in 5 minutes, and C can cross in 2 minutes. There is also a bicycle available and any person can cross the bridge in 1 minute with the bicycle. What is the shortest time that all men can get across the bridge? Each man travels at their own constant rate.",The bicycle may be left at any point along the bridge and may be ridden in either direction. Every man should finish at the same time.,"A's speed is 1/10 (in bridges per minute), B's speed is 1/5, C's speed is 1/2, and the bicycle's speed is 1.
The fastest way to get everyone across is for B and C to start out on foot and A to start out with the bicycle. At a point y, A will get off the bicycle and walk the rest of the way. Eventually C will get to the bicycle abandoned by A, then ride back to a point x, leaving the bicycle there, then turning around and walk until he reaches the end. Person B will walk until he reaches the bicycle left by C and then ride the rest of the way.
Below are the times that each will take to cross, in terms of x and y:
A: 1*y + 10*(1-y)
B: 5*x + 1*(1-x)
C: 2*y + (y-x) + 2*(1-x)
Next equate these equations: 10 - 9y = -3x + 3y + 2 = 4x + 1.
To solve set up two linear equations:
10 - 9y = -3x + 3y + 2 -> 3x - 12y = -8
10 - 9y = 4x + 1 -> 4x + 9y = 9
Then solve for x and y:
x = 12/25, y=59/75.
Given these points it will take each person 73/25 = 2.92 minutes to cross. Since they all start and end at the same time, the total duration to cross the bridge is also 2.92 minutes.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the bridge have length L.  
The three men’s walking speeds are therefore

• A : L / 10   (crosses in 10 min)  
• B : L / 5    (crosses in 5  min)  
• C : L / 2    (crosses in 2  min)

With the bicycle any one man can cross in 1 minute, i.e. at speed L / 1.

Key observations

1.  At most one man can use the bicycle, because once it reaches the far side it will not be brought back (that would only add time).  
2.  All three may be on the bridge at the same time; their motions are independent because each travels at his own constant rate.

Because the total time required is the moment when the last man steps off the bridge, we must minimize the largest individual crossing time.

Choosing who rides the bicycle

• If A rides the bicycle his time = 1 min, while B and C walk in 5 and 2 minutes.  
  The latest finishing time is max{1, 5, 2} = 5 minutes.

• If B rides the bicycle his time = 1 min, while A and C walk in 10 and 2 minutes.  
  Latest finishing time = max{10, 1, 2} = 10 minutes.

• If C rides the bicycle his time = 1 min, while A and B walk in 10 and 5 minutes.  
  Latest finishing time = max{10, 5, 1} = 10 minutes.

Thus the only advantageous assignment is to let the slowest walker, A, use the bicycle.

Achievability in 5 minutes

At time 0  
– A starts across on the bicycle (1 minute).  
– B and C start walking (5 minutes and 2 minutes respectively).

Arrivals  
t = 1 min : A is across.  
t = 2 min : C is across.  
t = 5 min : B is across.

Hence by t = 5 minutes all three men are on the far side of the bridge.

Optimality

No schedule can finish in less than 5 minutes, because B requires at least 5 minutes to cross unless he is the bicyclist, and assigning the bicycle to B leaves A needing 10 minutes. Therefore 5 minutes is the minimum possible.

126,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
In a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).

The ten available digits (with the indicated multiplicities)

0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 9

have no 7 or 8, and this simple fact forces almost every step of the construction.

1.  The units digit  
   D must be even, so consider the effect of doubling the possible last
   digits of N:

   n₅ : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 9  
   2n₅ (mod 10) : 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 8

   Digits 7 and 8 are impossible; hence n₅ ≠ 4,9.  
   To create a carry into the tens place we must choose n₅ = 5 or 6  
   (because only 5 and 6 give 2n₅ ≥ 10 without producing 7 or 8).

   • n₅ = 5 gives d₅ = 0 and a carry c = 1.  
     (The single 0 is now fixed in D and the single 5 in N.)

2.  The tens digit (carry = 1 coming in)  
   With carry 1 the permissible pairs (n₄ , d₄) are

        n₄ : 0 1 2 4 5 6   → d₄ : 1 3 5 9 1 3.

   Digit 9 occurs only once in the whole set, so it must lie in D, not in N
   (otherwise it would appear twice, once in each number).
   Hence we must take n₄ = 4, producing d₄ = 9 and eliminating the carry.

   Now used:  N … 5 4  D … 0 9

3.  The hundreds digit (carry = 0)  
   To create another carry (needed later), choose n₃ = 6:

        2·6 = 12 → d₃ = 2, new carry = 1.

   Now used:  N … 5 4 6  D … 0 9 2

4.  The thousands digit (carry = 1)  
   Available digits are 0,1,2,3,4 (5 and 6 already used, 2 with carry 1
   would give forbidden d = 5).  
   The only admissible choice is n₂ = 1:

        2·1 + 1 = 3 → d₂ = 3, carry resets to 0.

   Now used:  N … 5 4 6 1  D … 0 9 2 3

5.  The ten-thousands digit (carry = 0)  
   Remaining digits for N: 2,3,4.  
   n₁ = 3 would give d₁ = 6 (but the only 6 is already in N);  
   n₁ = 4 would give forbidden d₁ = 8;  
   therefore n₁ must be 2, giving d₁ = 4.

   From (3) this is the first n for which Hₙ ≥ 3.

   H₁₀ ≈ 2.929 …, H₁₁ ≈ 3.020 …, so the condition is met for n = 11.
   Thus the spider arrives sometime during the 11th minute (between 10 and 11 min).

4.  How far into that minute?  
   At the start of the 11th minute (after 10 stretches)

           p₁₀ = (1/3) · H₁₀ = (1/3) · 7381/2520 = 7381/7560.

   Band length then: ℓ₁₀ = 3·11 = 33 in.

   Remaining distance to the free end:

           Δ = ℓ₁₀ (1 − p₁₀)
             = 33 · (1 − 7381/7560)
             = 33 · 179/7560
             = 1969/2520 in.

   Walking 1 in per minute, the time needed is the same number of minutes:

           t_extra = 1969/2520 min.

5.  Total time

           T = 10 min + 1969/2520 min
             = (10·2520 + 1969)/2520
             = 27169/2520 min
             ≈ 10.781 min
             ≈ 10 min 47 s.

Final answer: 10 minutes 47 seconds (exactly 27169⁄2520 minutes).",True,1,0
134,"Bill, Bob, Frank, and Jim, who all drive cabs, work a particularly busy street that runs east and west. The street has no traffic lights. Oddly enough, an equal number of pedestrians walk in each direction at four kilometres per hour. The four cab drivers were discussing the best way to pick up a fare. Bill said he was going to sit beside the curb and wait until a fare came along. Bob said he was going to cruise west at four kilometres an hour; therefore, he would have twice the chance of picking up a fare as Bill. Frank said he was going to cruise east at eight kilometres an hour and his chances were twice as good as either Bill's or Bob's. Jim claimed that they were all wrong. He was going to drive west at 12kmh and his chances of picking up a fare were twice as good as Frank's. Of the claims that were made which were correct and which were wrong?",Analyze each claim separately,"Bill made no claim, Bob's claim was false, Frank's claim was true, and Jim's claim was false. Let's assume that 100 people passed Bill going east at four kph, and 100 people passed him going west at four kph. Bob, who was driving west at four kph, wouldn't pass anyone walking west, but would pass 200 people walking east. This would put him no further ahead than Bill. Frank, who was driving east and 300 people going west. Jim, who was going west at 12kph, would pass 200 people going west and 400 people going east.

Let  

 n = number of pedestrians per kilometre who are walking east (speed +4 km h⁻¹)  
 n = number of pedestrians per kilometre who are walking west (speed –4 km h⁻¹)

(Thus the total pedestrian density is 2n per kilometre, one-half in each direction.)

For a cab that moves with ground speed v (km h⁻¹, positive to the east, negative to the west) the cab meets pedestrians at the rate

 encounters per hour = n·|v – 4|  (from the east-bound walkers)

2. Bob (v = –4, i.e. west at 4 km h⁻¹)

Rate = n·|–4 – 4| + n·|–4 + 4| = n·8 + n·0 = 8n.

Bob gets exactly the same 8n encounters per hour as Bill, not twice as many.  
Bob’s claim is therefore wrong.

Rate = n·|8 – 4| + n·|8 + 4| = n·4 + n·12 = 16n.

Frank’s 16n encounters per hour are twice Bill’s 8n and twice Bob’s 8n.  
Frank’s claim is correct.

Jim’s 24n encounters are only 1½ times Frank’s 16n, not twice.  
Jim’s claim is wrong.

Summary

• Bill made no numerical claim; he simply stated what he would do.  
• Bob’s assertion of “twice Bill’s chance” is wrong.  
• Frank’s assertion of “twice Bill’s or Bob’s chance” is correct.  
• Jim’s assertion of “twice Frank’s chance” is wrong.

After Clue #6, we have one possibility: 617.
617 is the mystery number.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"We denote the hundreds, tens and units digits of the mystery number by A, B, C, so the number itself is ABC.

Step 1.  C must be 1, 3 or 7  
Condition 1 says ABC is a 3-digit prime, hence it is odd and does not end in 5.  
Therefore C ∈ {1, 3, 7}.

Step 2.  Restrictions coming from the two 2-digit primes AB and BC  
AB is a two–digit prime ending in B, so B must be an odd digit different from 5.  
BC is a two–digit prime ending in C, so B must be such that BC itself is prime.

We examine the three possible values of C.

────────────────────────────────────────
Case I:  C = 1  
BC = B1 must be prime ⇒ B ∈ {3,7}.  
AB ends in B, hence B must be odd ⇒ B = 3 or 7 (compatible).

 •  (B, C) = (3,1)  
   AB = A3 must be prime.  Possible A: 2,4,5,7,8.  
   Testing ABC for primality and the “sorted” primes eliminates every choice:  
   431 fails because 134 is not prime; 531, 731, 831 are composite.  
   No solution here.

 •  (B, C) = (7,1)  
   AB = A7 must be prime.  Possible A: 3,4,6,8.  
   Each choice makes ABC composite, so no solution.

Hence no solution when C = 1.

────────────────────────────────────────
Case II:  C = 3  
BC = B3 must be prime ⇒ B ∈ {1,2,4,5,7,8}.  
But AB must end in the odd digit B ≠ 5, so B must be 1 or 7.

 •  (B, C) = (1,3)  
   AB = A1 prime ⇒ A ∈ {4,6,7}.  None of the resulting ABC satisfy all conditions.

 •  (B, C) = (7,3)  
   AB = A7 prime ⇒ A ∈ {1,4,6}.  Again every choice violates one of the clues.

Therefore no solution when C = 3.

────────────────────────────────────────
Case III:  C = 7  
BC = B7 prime ⇒ B ∈ {1,3,4,6}.  
AB must end in the odd digit B ≠ 5, so B = 1 or 3.

Sub-case III-a:  B = 1  
AB = A1 prime ⇒ A ∈ {3,4,6}.  
• A = 3 → ABC = 317 (ascending 137 prime, descending 731 composite) – reject.  
• A = 4 → 417 composite – reject.  
• A = 6 → ABC = 617.  Now check every clue:

  1. 617 is a 3-digit prime.  
  2. AB = 61 prime and BC = 17 prime.  
  3. Digits 6,1,7 are distinct.  
  4. No digit is 9.  
  5. Greatest-to-least arrangement 761 is prime.  
  6. Least-to-greatest arrangement 167 is prime.

All six conditions are satisfied.

Sub-case III-b:  B = 3  
AB = A3 prime ⇒ A ∈ {1,2,4,5,8}.  Each attempt fails one of the clues.

Thus the only admissible number is 617.

Because every logically possible case has been examined and only one number meets the six requirements, the mystery number is uniquely determined.

136,"Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?
Comments to triflers:
The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!",There are hints in the comments to triflers and in the title.,"80
To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion. This takes 9 trips of 2 5/18 miles (5 advancing trips interspersed with 4 return trips) for a total of 20.5 miles traveled (9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5) and 20.5 bottles of soda used. Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases. With one less case to move, Bu will now make 2 fewer trips. The 3.5 bottles set aside are used to move the four cases the next 1/2 mile toward the Wirth Pavilion.   After this, the Wirth Pavilion is just 2 2/9 miles away ( 5 - 2 5/18 - 9/18 = 2 4/18 ). Next, he travels 15 5/9 miles (7 * 2 2/9) using 15 5/9 bottles of soda to complete his trip. The ranger cadet delivers 80 bottles to the pavilion and has 4/9 of a Park Pop to spare. (96 - 15 5/9 = 80 4/9)",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Because the MoJoPed can carry at most  

 24 spare bottles + 1 in the tank = 25 bottles,  

it is convenient to think in “loads” of 24 unopened bottles;  
one extra bottle is always being burned in the tank.

There are 5 cases = 120 unopened bottles at the start.

A basic fact.  
If, at some stage, there are n loads (n ≥ 2) still to be transported, then during
one mile of forward progress the rider must
 • ride forward n times with bottles, and  
 • ride back (n–1) times empty to fetch more,  
so the scooter travels 2n–1 miles and therefore burns 2n–1 bottles.
Hence

 cost per mile while 5 loads remain = 2·5–1 = 9 bottles,  
 cost per mile while 4 loads remain = 2·4–1 = 7 bottles,  
 cost per mile while 3 loads remain = 2·3–1 = 5 bottles,  
 cost per mile while 2 loads remain = 2·2–1 = 3 bottles,  
 cost per mile while 1 load remains = 1 bottle (no returns).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Moving until only four loads are left  

To fall from 5 loads (more than 96 bottles) to 4 loads (exactly 96 bottles)
Bu has to burn 120–96 = 24 bottles.
While 5 loads remain, each mile costs 9 bottles,
so the least distance that can be covered before only 4 loads are left is

 24⁄9 = 8⁄3 miles.

After travelling 8⁄3 miles Bu is at the “8⁄3-mile depot’’
with exactly 96 unopened bottles left.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Finishing the trip with four loads  

Distance still to go: 5 – 8⁄3 = 7⁄3 miles.  
Throughout those 7⁄3 miles there are 4 loads,
so the cost is

 (7 bottles per mile) × (7⁄3 miles) = 49⁄3 bottles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  How many bottles must be opened?  

Total fuel required
 = 24 + 49⁄3 = 121⁄3 bottles
 = 40 ⅓ bottles.

Because a bottle is either still sealed or already opened,
Bu must open 41 bottles (the 41st ends only ⅔ empty).
Therefore the largest possible number of unopened bottles at Wirth Pavilion is

 120 – 41 = 79.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  A plan that attains the bound  

• Shuttle all 120 bottles the first 8⁄3 miles, exactly as the calculation above
 shows; this uses 24 bottles.  
• From the 8⁄3-mile depot shuttle the remaining 96 bottles the last 7⁄3 miles;
 this uses 49⁄3 bottles.  
• Bu arrives with 79 sealed bottles and one bottle that is ⅓ full.

Since 79 unopened bottles can in fact be delivered and no strategy can leave
more than 79 unopened bottles, the maximum is 79.

137,"Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.  Henry's plan calls for the tracks (each of which is one mile in length) to be laid end-to-end with no gap between them, pinned to the ground at every other juncture, as shown below:
v_______ _______vv_______ _______v
Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""
Henry replies, ""The expansion will only be an inch over the whole mile length.  If the tracks buckle, it will only be by an inch or two at most.  The trains will certainly have no trouble bumping over these buckles.""
Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?",Would Pythagoras have the same plan?,"The rise in the middle of the tracks would have been much greater than Henry surmised.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse). SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

L = distance between two pins (the length that is forced to buckle)  
Δ = increase in length produced by the heat.

Henry nails every “other” joint, so the rail that is free to move is two miles long:

L = 2 miles = 2·5280 ft = 10 560 ft   
Δ = 2 inches = 2⁄12 ft = 1⁄6 ft.

When the ends are fixed the extra length must be taken up by the rail bowing into an arc.  
Assume (as is usual in track-buckling calculations) that the bowed portion is a circular arc whose ends are still on the original straight line.

Let the half–central-angle of that arc be θ (in radians) and let R be its radius.

Chord (the original straight distance) : L = 2R sin θ  
Arc length (the hot rail)               : S = 2R θ = L + Δ.

Hence  

Δ = 2R(θ – sin θ).                                        (1)

For small θ,   sin θ ≈ θ – θ³⁄6, so θ – sin θ ≈ θ³⁄6.  
Substituting that in (1) gives

Δ ≈ 2R·θ³⁄6 = Rθ³⁄3.                                     (2)

The mid-height h of the buckle satisfies

h = R(1 – cos θ) ≈ Rθ²⁄2.                                 (3)

From the chord relation L = 2R sin θ ≈ 2Rθ, we have R ≈ L/(2θ).  
Insert this in (2):

Δ ≈ (L/2θ) · θ³ /3 = Lθ² /6 ⇒ θ² ≈ 6Δ / L.            (4)

Put (4) into (3):

h ≈ (L/2θ) · θ² /2 = Lθ /4  
   ≈ L/4 · √(6Δ / L) = √(6ΔL) /4.                   (5)

Formula (5) shows how much the centre of the rail rises.

Now use the numbers:

6ΔL = 6·(1/6 ft)·10 560 ft = 1·10 560 ft = 10 560 ft  
√(6ΔL) = √10 560 ft ≈ 102.76 ft½.

So the two-mile length of rail will heave upward roughly twenty-five feet!

A “bump” a dozen-plus feet tall would derail any train; it is nothing like the “inch or two” Henry imagined.  That is why his boss immediately dismissed the plan.

Final answer: Because the expansion cannot be taken up longitudinally, each two-mile unpinned stretch must bow upward; the required bow is about 25 feet high (not an inch or two), which would make the track completely impassable—hence Henry’s plan is disastrously wrong.",True,0,0

1.  Let AB lie on the x-axis with A = (0,0) and B = (16,0).  
    ( AB = 16 ft and “against the house”.)

2.  AF is perpendicular to AB and AF = 6 ft, so F = (0, −6).  
    (“Down” is the negative y–direction.)

3.  BC is parallel to AF and BC = 6 ft, so C = (16, −6).

4.  FC is parallel to AB, hence horizontal.  Thus FC is the 16-ft segment from F to C.

5.  On FC choose G and H so that FG = 4 ft and HC = 4 ft.  
    Therefore G = (4, −6) and H = (12, −6).

6.  EG ⟂ FG and EG = 4 ft, so E is 4 ft vertically from G.  
    DH ⟂ HC and DH = 4 ft, so D is 4 ft vertically from H.  
    At this stage E could be either (4,−2) or (4,−10), and D either (12,−2) or (12,−10).

7.  Condition ED ∥ AB and ED = 8 ft forces E and D to share the same y-coordinate; both pairs above satisfy this.

8.  Use the given interior angles.
        ∠BCD = 135° and ∠AFE = 135°.

    •  Compute ∠BCD if D = (12, −10):

        CB = (0, 6), CD = (−4, −4).  
        cos ∠BCD = (0·(−4) + 6·(−4)) / (6·√32) = −24 / 33.94 ≈ −0.707 = cos 135°. ✔

    •  Compute ∠AFE with E = (4, −10):

        FA = (0, 6), FE = (4, −4).  
        cos ∠AFE = (0·4 + 6·(−4)) / (6·√32) = −24 / 33.94 ≈ −0.707 = cos 135°. ✔

    Hence the only consistent choice is  
        D = (12, −10), E = (4, −10).

9.  The vertices of hexagon ABCDEF are now

        A(0,0), B(16,0), C(16,−6),
        D(12,−10), E(4,−10), F(0,−6).

10.  Compute the area with the Shoelace Formula.

        xᵢyᵢ₊₁:   0·0 + 16·(−6) + 16·(−10) + 12·(−10) + 4·(−6) + 0·0 = −400
        yᵢxᵢ₊₁:   0·16 + 0·16 + (−6)·12 + (−10)·4 + (−10)·0 + (−6)·0 = −112

        Area = ½ |(−400) − (−112)| = ½·288 = 144 ft².

    (A quick check: the 16 ft × 10 ft bounding rectangle has area 160; two 4 ft × 4 ft right triangles
     at the bottom corners are removed, 160 − 2·8 = 144 ft².)

11.  One 1-ft-square stone covers 1 ft², so the ideal number of tiles is 144.

            EDCBA.

Writing the usual column–subtraction  

          E  D  C  B  A
        – A  B  C  D  E
        ----------------
          3  3  9  5  7

we compare each column from right (units) to left (ten-thousands), introducing the borrows that occur.

Notation  
bk  = borrow carried into the k-th column  
(b0 is the borrow that leaves the units column and enters the tens column, etc.).

1.  Units column  
   A − E = 7  (no borrow)   or   A − E +10 = 7  (borrow b1 = 1)

   The first alternative gives A − E = 7, impossible because digits are ≤ 9.
   Therefore b1 = 1 and  

           A − E = −3  ⇒  A = E − 3                     (1)

   This forces E ≥ 4 and makes A ≠ 0, so the number is indeed five-digit.

2.  Tens column  
   B − (D + b1) must produce the digit 5.

   With b1 = 1, two sub-cases exist:

   •  No new borrow (b2 = 0): B − D − 1 = 5  ⇒ B − D = 6  (impossible).

   •  New borrow (b2 = 1): B + 10 − D − 1 = 5  ⇒ B − D = −4  

     Hence                                                  

           D = B + 4                                       (2)  
           and b2 = 1.

3.  Hundreds column  
   C − (C + b2) = C − C − 1 = −1.  
   Adding 10 gives the digit 9 and sends a new borrow b3 = 1 to the
   thousands column.  Thus b2 = 1 is exactly what we need, and C itself is
   unrestricted (any digit 0–9).

4.  Thousands column  
   D − (B + b3) must yield the digit 3.

   Using (2) and b3 = 1:

           D − B − 1 = (B + 4) − B − 1 = 3,

   which is satisfied with no further borrow, so  

           b4 = 0.                                         (3)

5.  Ten-thousands column  
   E − (A + b4) must give the digit 3.  
   Because b4 = 0 (from (3)) and using (1):

           E − A = 3  ⇔  E − (E − 3) = 3,

   which is automatically true; no new condition appears.

Summary of digit relations obtained

    A = E − 3, E = 4,5,6,7,8,9 (six choices)
    B = 0,1,2,3,4,5 (six choices)
    D = B + 4 (gives D = 4,5,6,7,8,9 respectively)
    C = 0–9 (ten choices)

All these choices are independent and satisfy every column of the
subtraction.  Hence

    Number of possible originals = 6 (choices of E)
                                   × 6 (choices of B)

Mouse(C) bites off one rope in 180 minutes.
You do not have any time or distance measuring tools and the length of the rope is unknown.  How can you measure 75 minutes?",Set distance and time relations and equations,"Mark the two ropes as Rope(A) and Rope(B).
1. Let Mouse(A) and Mouse(C) start biting off Rope(A) at the same time, starting each from  one end (moving in opposite directions).  At the same time, let Mouse(B) start biting off Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(A) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X = S(A) * 60, where S(A) is biting speed for Mouse(A) and X is Rope(A) length
X = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X is Rope(A) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(A)/S(C) = 3:1, which means that for each 3 units Mouse(A) will move, Mouse (C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(A) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(A) bites off three times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides Rope(A) length in to 4 units.
Mouse(A) bitten off portion = 3/4 X (where X is Rope(A) length)
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/4 X
Finding the time spent before Rope(A) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(A) needs  60 minutes to bite off X, How many minutes are needed to bite off 3/4 X?
Minutes needed = 3/4 * 60 = 45 minutes are needed to fully bite off Rope(A) by Mouse(A) and Mouse(C).  At that point in time, Mouse(B) would have bitten off exactly half the length of Rope(B) (needing 90 minutes to bite off the full rope), and needs an additional 45 minutes to bite off the remaining rope half.
2. Let Mouse(B) continue biting off Rope(B) and make Mouse(C) start biting off the other end of Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(B) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X/2 = S(B) * 90, where S(B) is biting speed for Mouse(B) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
X/2 = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(B)/S(C) = 2:1, which means that for each 2 units Mouse(B) will move, Mouse(C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(B) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(B) bites off two times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides the remaining half of Rope(B) length to 3 units.

Finding the time spent before the remaining half of Rope(B) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(B) needs  90 minutes to bite off X, how many minutes are needed to bite off X/3?
Minutes needed = 1/3 * 90 = 30 minutes are needed to fully bite off the remaining half of Rope(B) by Mouse(B) and Mouse(C).

The constant biting rates of the three mice are therefore  

Mouse A : L / 60  rope-length per minute  
Mouse B : L / 90  rope-length per minute  
Mouse C : L / 180 rope-length per minute  

Step 1  – obtain a 30-minute interval  
• Take Rope #1.  
• Put Mouse A at one end; put Mice B and C together at the opposite end (they can work side by side on the same end).  
The rope disappears at a rate  

L/60  +  L/90  +  L/180  =  L·(1/60 + 1/90 + 1/180)  
                          =  L·(3/180 + 2/180 + 1/180)  
                          =  L·(6/180)  
                          =  L/30  rope per minute.

Hence Rope #1 is completely eaten in 30 minutes.  
The instant the three mice have no more rope to chew is therefore a reliable 30-minute mark.

Step 2  – obtain an additional 45-minute interval  
• Immediately when Rope #1 is finished, give the untouched Rope #2 to Mice A and C, one at each end (Mouse B is no longer needed).  
Their combined rate is  

L/60  +  L/180  =  L·(1/60 + 1/180)  
                 =  L·(3/180 + 1/180)  
                 =  L·(4/180)  
                 =  L/45  rope per minute.

Thus Rope #2 is eaten completely in 45 minutes.

Step 3  – total time elapsed  
First interval …………… 30 minutes  
Second interval ………… 45 minutes  
Total ……………………… 30 + 45 = 75 minutes.

Therefore, when Rope #2 is finished, exactly 75 minutes have passed since the start.

• Digits allowed: only 0 or 1.

1.  Divisibility by 25  
   A decimal number is divisible by 25 iff its last two digits are 00, 25, 50 or 75.  
   With only 0’s and 1’s the only possible pair is 00.  
   Hence the sought number must end in 00.

2.  Divisibility by 9  
   A number is divisible by 9 when the sum of its decimal digits is a multiple of 9.  
   Here each non–zero digit is a 1, so the digit-sum equals the number of 1’s.  
   Therefore that number of 1’s must be 9, 18, 27, … .

3.  Striving for the smallest possible value  
   The smallest admissible digit-sum is 9, so we try to realise exactly 9 ones.  
   Together with the two obligatory trailing zeros this means the number must
   contain at least 9 + 2 = 11 digits.

   • If it had only 10 digits (or fewer) there could be at most 8 digits before the
     final “00”, hence at most 8 ones – impossible.  
   • Thus 11 digits is the minimal length.

4.  Forming the unique 11-digit candidate  
   With 11 digits, the two final ones are 0’s, leaving 9 leading positions which
   must all be 1 in order to supply the required nine 1’s:

        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0

   That is the decimal number 11,111,111,100.

5.  Verification  
   • Ends in 00  ⇒ divisible by 25 (hence by 5²).  
   • Digit-sum = 9·1 = 9  ⇒ divisible by 9.  
   • Since 9 and 25 are coprime, the number is divisible by 225.

No smaller positive integer composed only of 0’s and 1’s can satisfy both
divisibility conditions, so this is indeed the minimal amount of gum Rob could

        abcd / efghi = 1 / 11,  

where abcd (a≠0) is the 4–digit numerator and efghi is the 5–digit denominator.  
Because efghi = 11·abcd, multiply abcd by 11 in the usual “add-shift” way:

            11 × (a  b  c  d)
                 a (a+b)(b+c)(c+d) d ,

        g = (b+c) (+ carry₂) ,
        h = (c+d) (+ carry₁) ,
        i = d ,

and the units digit of the denominator always equals the units digit of the numerator.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
1.  Which digit is repeated at the two ends?  
   The given multiset has exactly two 4’s; using one 4 at each end is the only way to account for both of them, so

        d = 4   and   i = 4.

2.  Find c from the next-to-last denominator digit.  
   No carry can enter h (because the carry into i is 0), so

        h = c + d = c + 4.

   The only unused single–occurring large digit we must place in the denominator is 7; hence h = 7 and

        c + 4 = 7  ⇒  c = 3.

3.  Determine b from the middle denominator digit.  
   There is still no carry (3 + 4 < 10), so

        g = b + c = b + 3.

   The only unused single digit still missing from the denominator is 5, so g = 5 and

        b + 3 = 5  ⇒  b = 2.

4.  Determine a from the second denominator digit.  
   Again no carry (b + c = 5 < 10), so

        f = a + b = a + 2.

   The digits 1 and 3 remain to be positioned; since f must be 3 (a repeat of 3 is already required), we have

        a + 2 = 3  ⇒  a = 1.

   There is no carry (1 + 2 = 3 < 10), so the leading denominator digit is simply

        e = a = 1.

Thus the unique 4–digit numerator and 5–digit denominator are

145,How many trailing zeros are in the number 1000!?,The number of trailing zeros is equivalent to the number of factors of 10,"The ! stands for factorial.  So, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!
The only way to get a trailing zero is by multiplying a factor of 1000! which is 2 by a factor of 1000! which is 5. The modified problem is thus: How many such pairs of factors are there?
There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5. But in addition there are 40 = 1000/25 numbers which are multiples of 25, each of which gives one factor of five in addition to the one counted in the 200 and the one counted in the 40 above. Finally there is 1 = [1000/625] number which is a multiple of 625, this gives one further factor of 5. Thus there are exactly  200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249 factors of 5 in 1000! and since there are more than sufficient factors of 2, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"To count the trailing zeros of 1000!, we must determine how many times 10 divides 1000!.  
Because 10 = 2 × 5, the exponent of 10 in the prime‐factorization of 1000! is the smaller of the exponents of 2 and 5.  
In any factorial, factors of 2 are far more plentiful than factors of 5, so the exponent of 5 is the limiting one.  
Hence, the number of trailing zeros equals the exponent of 5 in 1000!.

For any positive integer n, the exponent of a prime p in n! is given by

          ⌊n/p⌋ + ⌊n/p²⌋ + ⌊n/p³⌋ + … ,

stopping when the powers exceed n.

Take p = 5 and n = 1000:

⌊1000/5⌋   = 200  
⌊1000/25⌋  =  40  
⌊1000/125⌋ =   8  
⌊1000/625⌋ =   1  
⌊1000/3125⌋ = 0  (and all further terms are 0)

Add these contributions:

200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249.

Therefore, 5 appears 249 times in the prime factorization of 1000!, so 1000! contains 249 factors of 10, i.e., 249 trailing zeros.

Since 7*14=98, there was only one cyclist that he never beat and that was the champion.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the general classification be decided, as usual in stage races, by the sum of the times that every rider takes to ride the fourteen stages.

1.  Positions in a stage do not tell us by how much a rider wins or loses.
   A rider who is 93rd can cross the line only a few-seconds after the winner, or many minutes before the next man.

2.  Make the following time-table (numbers are only chosen to make the idea clear).

   •  In every stage the winner is always the same man – call him the Champion.  
      He needs exactly 3 h 00 min 00 s for every stage.

   •  “Crazy” Charles finishes every stage 1 second later than the Champion;  
      therefore he is always 93rd.  
      His time in each stage is 3 h 00 min 01 s.

   •  Seven different riders in every stage have a very bad day: each of them
      comes in one full hour after the Champion.  
      Their time in that stage is 4 h 00 min 00 s, so they occupy places 94-100.

      The other 92 riders of that stage – the Champion, Charles and 91 more –
      arrive within the very same second and therefore take the same time
      (3 h 00 min 00 s for the Champion, 3 h 00 min 01 s for Charles,
      3 h 00 min 02 s, … , etc.).  
      Consequently they are classified 1st to 92nd, with Charles in 93rd place.

   •  The important point is that the seven stragglers are different every day.
      Over fourteen stages we can make every one of the 98 riders who are
      neither the Champion nor Charles be a “straggler” once and only once
      (14 stages × 7 stragglers = 98 places).

3.  Compute the total times.

   •  Champion: 14 × 3 h 00 min 00 s = 42 h 00 min 00 s.

   •  Charles : 14 × 3 h 00 min 01 s = 42 h 00 min 14 s
     (he loses exactly 1 s to the Champion in every stage, so 14 s in all).

   •  Any other rider:
       –  In the stage in which he is a straggler he loses 1 h to the Champion
         and 59 min 59 s to Charles.  
       –  In each of the remaining 13 stages he beats Charles by at most
         a couple of seconds (the whole leading bunch is almost together).  
         Even if he gains 2 s on Charles in each of those 13 stages, he
         recovers only 26 s.

     Hence his net loss to Charles is at least  
        59 min 59 s – 26 s > 59 min 30 s.

     Therefore every one of the 98 riders finishes the race at least
     fifty-nine minutes behind Charles.

4.  Final standing.

   •  1st  Champion   –  42 h 00 min 00 s  
   •  2nd “Crazy” Charles – 42 h 00 min 14 s  
   •  3rd–100th everybody else, all more than 59 min behind Charles.

So although Charles never placed better than 93rd in any individual stage,
every stage he lost only a single second to the Champion, while every other
competitor had one disastrous stage that cost him far more time than he could
gain back on the remaining days.  That is perfectly compatible with the facts
given and explains how Charles could be runner-up of the whole race.

Final answer:  Because the 92 riders who beat Charles in any given stage were not the same 92 riders each day.  In every stage seven different riders finished behind Charles and lost a huge amount of time (say an hour).  Over the fourteen stages each of the 98 opponents (all the riders except the Champion and Charles) had one such disastrous stage, whereas Charles lost only a second a day to the Champion.  Consequently Charles’ total time was less than that of every rider except the Champion, even though his place in every individual stage was only 93rd.",True,1,0
147,"The Boldavian navy has a rigorous training program.  In order to graduate from the naval academy, cadets must enter a pool and fight sharks.  Today, a group of cadets was tested.  Each cadet put on his mask, snorkel, and two flippers; and armed himself with a knife.  Then the cadets jumped into the pool.  The sharks were then released from their pens.  After 10 minutes of gruelling hand-to-fin combat, all of the sharks were killed.  Miraculously, none of the cadets were killed.  Exiting the pool, the cadets began to haul the shark bodies out of the water.  The dead sharks were soon lying in a row.  One of the cadets noted that during the fight, there were 4 times as many cadets in the water as there were sharks.

Note that although all of the cadets survived, nothing was said about possible injuries.  In fact, each shark had bitten off one leg from each of 7 cadets.

Let the original price of the Red Rose bouquet  be 'B' Roka.
It is given that during a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%.
Hence after a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 162 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1+Y)(1-Y)

Therefore the decrease in price after one year
= B - B(1-Y^2)

Hence after another year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 147.42 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y)

Substituting the above value of Y^2 in equation 1, we get

2x , 2y , 2z              (x , y , z  ∈ ℤ ,  x , y , z ≥ 2)

 N₀ = (2x−2)(2y−2)(2z−2) = 8(x−1)(y−1)(z−1)

The number with some paint is N – N₀.  
According to the statement of the problem N₀ equals this number, i.e.

N = 2N₀  ⇒ 8xyz = 2·8(x−1)(y−1)(z−1)

Canceling the common factor 8 gives the fundamental equation  

xyz = 2(x−1)(y−1)(z−1)        (1)

a = x−1 , b = y−1 , c = z−1    (a , b , c  ∈ ℤ ,  a , b , c ≥ 1)

Divide (2) by abc:

(1 + 1/a)(1 + 1/b)(1 + 1/c) = 2      (3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Locating the smallest possible values of a , b , c
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Because the left–hand side of (3) is symmetric we may assume  

1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ c.

(i)  a = 1 gives the factor (1+1/a) = 2, and then the product in (3) exceeds 2.  
 Hence a ≥ 2.

--------------------------------------------------------
Case A a = 2
--------------------------------------------------------
(3) gives 1.5·(1+1/b)(1+1/c) = 2 ⇒ (1+1/b)(1+1/c) = 4/3.

If b = 2 the left factor is already 1.5 > 4/3, impossible.  
If b = 3 the first two factors give 4/3, forcing (1+1/c)=1, again impossible.  
Hence b ≥ 4.

With b = 4 we obtain (1+1/c)=16/15 ⇒ c = 15.

Thus the least possibility in this case is (a,b,c) = (2,4,15) giving  
(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = 3·5·16 = 240.

So with a = 2 we can never get a product below 240.

--------------------------------------------------------
Case B a = 3
--------------------------------------------------------
Now (1+1/a) = 4/3 and (3) reads

(1+1/b)(1+1/c) = 3/2.                   (4)

• If b = 3 → (1+1/b)=4/3, so (1+1/c)=9/8 ⇒ c = 8  
 Product (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = 4·4·9 = 144.

• If b = 4 → (1+1/b)=5/4, so (1+1/c)=6/5 ⇒ c = 5  
 Product (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = 4·5·6 = 120.

Any larger b increases the product, so the minimum obtainable with a=3 is 120.

--------------------------------------------------------
Case C a ≥ 4
--------------------------------------------------------
Then (1+1/a) ≤ 1.25, so from (3)

(1+1/b)(1+1/c) ≥ 1.6.                   (5)

The least possible value of the left-hand side of (5) is produced
by b = 3 (⇒1+1/b = 4/3) together with c = 5 (⇒1+1/c = 6/5);  
indeed (4/3)(6/5) = 8/5 = 1.6, the exact lower bound.

Hence (b+1)(c+1) ≥ 4·6 = 24, and therefore

(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) ≥ 5·24 = 120.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  The absolute minimum
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We have proved that no choice of (a,b,c) can make (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) smaller than 120,
and that the triple (a,b,c) = (3,4,5) really attains this value.

Going back to x, y, z :

x = a+1 = 4, y = b+1 = 5, z = c+1 = 6.

Hence the original edge–lengths of the cuboid are

2x = 8 cm, 2y = 10 cm, 2z = 12 cm.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Number of little cubes
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Total number of 1 cm cubes:

N = 8xyz = 8·4·5·6 = 960.

Check:

x , y , z   (each < 500) and write

x + y = p², x + z = q², y + z = r²   (1)

with p, q, r positive integers.  
Adding the three equalities gives

2(x + y + z) = p² + q² + r².   (2)

Because the total x + y + z also has to be a perfect square, say s²,  
equation (2) becomes

p² + q² + r² = 2 s².   (3)

A convenient way to satisfy (3) is to make two of the three squares equal.  
Put  

q = r = t   (4)

and let p be even, p = 2k.  
Then (3) is

(2k)² + 2 t² = 2 s²  ⇒  2k² + t² = s².   (5)

Equation (5) is a classical Pell-type equation; its smallest positive solution
is

k = 4, t = 7, s = 9 because 2·4² + 7² = 32 + 49 = 81 = 9².

Now determine x, y, z from (1):

x = (p² + q² − r²)/2 = ( (2k)² + t² − t² ) /2 = (4k²)/2 = 2k²,

y = (p² + r² − q²)/2 = 2k²  (same as x),

z = (q² + r² − p²)/2 = (2t² − (2k)²)/2 = t² − 2k².

With k = 4 and t = 7 we get

x = y = 2·4² = 32,
z = 7² − 2·4² = 49 − 32 = 17.

Finally check all the required sums:

x + y = 32 + 32 = 64 = 8²,
x + z = 32 + 17 = 49 = 7²,
y + z = 32 + 17 = 49 = 7²,

Mad Ade noted there were two possible answers.
What are they?",The repeated digit must be even,"Answers are 39157 and 57139
39*57= 2223-1= 2222
57*39= 2223-1= 2222",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the required five–digit number be  

abcde  (each letter is one of the digits 1,3,5,7,9 and every digit is used exactly once).

Put  

x = 10a + b   (the two–digit number formed by the first two digits)  
y = 10d + e   (the two–digit number formed by the last two digits)  
c = the middle digit.

The condition in the question is  

x·y – c = N,

where N is a repdigit, i.e. every digit of N is the same.

1.  Parity of N  
   The digits 1,3,5,7,9 are all odd, so x and y are odd.  
   Hence x·y is odd.  
   Subtracting the odd digit c gives an even number N.  
   Therefore N must be a repdigit made up of an even digit: 2,4,6 or 8.

   Because x·y ranges from 13·15 = 195 up to 97·95 = 9215, the only even-digit repdigits in this interval are  

   22, 44, 66, 88, 222, 444, 666, 888, 2222, 4444, 6666, 8888.

   The two–digit repdigits are too small; three–digit repdigits are all < 1000, so we need
   N ∈ {2222, 4444, 6666, 8888}.

2.  The case N divisible by 11  
   For a repdigit of 2 or 4 digits, N is a multiple of 11, so

        x·y ≡ c  (mod 11).                         (1)

   With the digits 1,3,5,7,9 one computes

        13≡2, 15≡4, 17≡6, 19≡8,
        31≡9, 35≡2, 37≡4, 39≡6,

        91≡3, 93≡5, 95≡7, 97≡9    (mod 11).

3.  Trying each possible middle digit

   a)  c = 1.  
       The other four digits are 3,5,7,9.  They must be split into two disjoint two-digit
       numbers.  The only partition that makes (1) work is
            39 (≡ 6 mod 11)  and  57 (≡ 2 mod 11),
       because 6·2 ≡ 1 (mod 11).  And indeed
            39·57 = 2223,   2223 – 1 = 2222.
       This gives the five–digit numbers
            39 1 57  (= 39157)  and  57 1 39  (= 57139).

   b)  c = 3, 5, 7, 9.  
       For each of these, every possible way of arranging the remaining four digits
       was checked; none of them makes x·y – c a repdigit.

   Therefore the only admissible middle digit is 1, and the only admissible pair
   {x, y} is {39, 57}.  Writing them in the two possible orders gives the two required
   five–digit numbers.

When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 45 days.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 90 days also.
For how long can the three animals graze on the field together?",Rates problem--use the same algebraic techniques,"The cow, the goat, and the goose eat grass with a constant speed (amount per day): v1 for the cow, v2 for the goat, v3 for the goose.
The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:
v1 = 3 x h/180,
v2 = 2 x h/180,
v3 = 1 x h/180,
k = 1 x h/180.
Then holds for the time t that the three animals can graze together: h-tx(v1+v2+v3-k) = 0, so t = h/(v1+v2+v3-k) = h/(3xh/180+2xh/180+1xh/180-1xh/180) = 36. The three animals can graze together for 36 days.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let

While the animals are grazing, the grass present at the moment it is exhausted equals  

initial grass + (growth per day)·(number of days)  
         = (consumption rate of the animals)·(number of days).

For every grazing situation this gives

1) Cow + Goat for 45 days: F + 45r = 45(C + G)  ⇒ F = (C + G − r)·45  
2) Cow + Goose for 60 days: F + 60r = 60(C + S)  ⇒ F = (C + S − r)·60  
3) Cow alone for 90 days:  F + 90r = 90C      ⇒ F = (C − r)·90  
4) Goat + Goose for 90 days: F + 90r = 90(G + S)  ⇒ F = (G + S − r)·90

Since all right-hand sides equal F, we may equate them pairwise.

From (1) and (3): (C + G − r)·45 = (C − r)·90  
            ⇒ C + G − r = 2C − 2r  
            ⇒ G = C − r.            (5)

From (3) and (4): (C − r)·90 = (G + S − r)·90  
            ⇒ C − r = G + S − r  
            ⇒ C = G + S.           (6)

Insert (5) into (6): C = (C − r) + S ⇒ r = S.       (7)

With r = S, equation (5) becomes G = C − r = C − S.    (8)

Use (1) and (2) next:

(C + G − r)·45 = (C + S − r)·60  
Insert G from (8) and r = S:  
(C + (C − S) − S)·45 = (C + S − S)·60  
(2C − 2S)·45 = C·60  
90(C − S) = 60C  
      ⇒ C = 3S.                 (9)

Therefore

S = r,  C = 3S = 3r,  G = C − S = 2r.

Now compute F from (3):

F = (C − r)·90 = (3r − r)·90 = 2r·90 = 180r.       (10)

Finally, let the three animals graze together.  
Their joint daily consumption is C + G + S = 3r + 2r + r = 6r.  
While they graze, net grass disappearance per day is

(consumption) − (growth) = 6r − r = 5r.

Time until the field is bare:

t = F / (5r) = 180r / 5r = 36 days.

Hence the three animals can graze together for 36 days before the grass is exhausted.

For each person P define

Because everyone knows himself / herself, we always have

Goal  
Show that two distinct people attain the same value of k.

Step 1.  The values 1 and n cannot both occur.

• Suppose somebody A satisfies k(A) = n (A knows everybody).  
Take any other person B.  Since A knows B and knowledge is mutual, B knows A.  
Thus B knows at least himself / herself and A, so k(B) ≥ 2.  
Hence no one can have k = 1.

• Conversely, if some person C has k(C) = 1, then C knows nobody except himself / herself.  
If there were a person D with k(D) = n, D would know C; by mutual knowledge C would then know D as well, producing k(C) ≥ 2, a contradiction.  
Thus the existence of k = 1 rules out k = n.

Therefore the two extreme values 1 and n cannot occur simultaneously.

Step 2.  Count the possible distinct values of k.

Because of (1) the only potential values for k are the integers 1,2,…,n.  
By Step 1 at least one of the two extremes is absent, so at most n−1 distinct values can actually appear.

Step 3.  Apply the pigeon-hole principle.

We have n people (pigeons) but only at most n−1 distinct numbers k (holes) available.  
Placing each person into the “hole’’ labelled by his / her value of k, two people must occupy the same hole.

   2·10⁵ – 3 = 200000 – 3 = 199 997, and modulo 28

 199 997 ≡ 21 (mod 28), so (★) becomes 21d ≡ 0 (mod 28).

   gcd(21,28) = 7; dividing by 7 gives the equivalent requirement

 3d ≡ 0 (mod 4).

   From the nine possible digits only d = 4 or d = 8 satisfy this congruence.

5.  Determine k for each admissible digit.

   For any admissible d,

 k = d(199 997) / 28.

   •  d = 4 → k = 4·199 997 / 28 = 799 988 / 28 = 28 571  
   •  d = 8 → k = 8·199 997 / 28 = 1 599 976 / 28 = 57 142

   Each k indeed has five digits, so both give legitimate six–digit numbers

 N₁ = 10·28 571 + 4 = 285 714  
 N₂ = 10·57 142 + 8 = 571 428.

6.  Select the smaller number.

   The two solutions are 285 714 and 571 428; the smaller is 285 714.

Therefore the least positive integer whose rightmost digit, when moved to the
front, increases the number by 50 % is

164,"On the great ""Chilli"" lake of Madadia are two ferry boats that transport tourists from one side to the other.
One boat is the ""Lead Balloon"", the other is the ""Iceberg Magnet"".  They travel from the Kebab Fountains on the east side of the lake and the Lard Sculpture on the west side of the lake.
Each ferry travels at a constant speed, although the ""Lead Balloon"" is faster than the ""Iceberg Magnet"".
The two boats leave from opposite shores at the same time.  They pass at a point of 720 yards from Lard Sculptures.  Upon arriving at the opposite shore, each boat stays in its slip for 5 minutes, and then starts back. They pass again 400 yards from Kebab Fountains. Assume both boats travel along a straight line.  How far is it from Kebab Fountains to Lard Sculptures by water?","Set distance and rate relations--you only need one variable, which is the distance between the two ports","Let X = the distance between the two ports.  Note that the 5 minutes spent in their slips is irrelevant to solving the problem.
The ratio of the distance traveled by the two boats when they pass each other for the first time is:  (X - 720) / 720.
The ratio of the total distance traveled by the two boats when they pass each other for the second time is:  (2x - 400) / (X + 400).
Since the boats travel at a constant speed, the ratios are equal.
(X - 720) / 720 = (2X - 400) / (X + 400)
(X - 720) * (X + 400) = (2X - 400) * 720

FIRST PASS  

At t = 0 the Iceberg Magnet leaves Lard Sculptures and the faster Lead Balloon leaves
Kebab Fountains.  
They meet 720 yd from Lard Sculptures; therefore

 Iceberg Magnet has travelled 720 yd,  
 Lead Balloon has travelled D – 720 yd.

Since travelling times are equal,

 720 / v_I = (D – 720) / v_L  ⟹ v_L / v_I = (D – 720)/720. (1)

TOUCH, WAIT, AND RETURN

After meeting, each boat keeps its course.

Time still required to reach the opposite shore:

 Lead Balloon: 720 / v_L minutes  
 Iceberg Magnet: (D – 720) / v_I minutes.

Each then waits 5 minutes and starts back.

SECOND PASS  

On the return trip they meet 400 yd from Kebab Fountains, i.e. at a point
D – 400 yd from Lard Sculptures.

For this second meeting:

• The Lead Balloon, which started back from Lard Sculptures, has covered

• The Iceberg Magnet, which started back from Kebab Fountains, has covered  
 400 yd; time taken = 400 / v_I.

The time counted from their first meeting to the second meeting must be the same for both
boats, so

 720/v_L + 5 + (D – 400)/v_L = (D – 720)/v_I + 5 + 400/v_I.

The waiting-time “5” cancels, giving

 (720 + D – 400)/v_L = (D – 720 + 400)/v_I  
 (D + 320)/v_L = (D – 320)/v_I. (2)

RELATING THE TWO EQUATIONS  

From (1): v_I / v_L = 720 /(D – 720).

From (2): v_I / v_L = (D – 320)/(D + 320).

Equate these two expressions:

 720 /(D – 720) = (D – 320)/(D + 320).

Cross–multiplying:

 720(D + 320) = (D – 720)(D – 320)  
 720D + 230 400 = D² – 1 040D + 230 400  
 0 = D² – 1 760D  
 D(D – 1 760) = 0.

Since D > 0, we get

 D = 1 760 yards.

A quick consistency check:

v_L / v_I = (D – 720)/720 = 1 040/720 = 13/9 > 1, confirming that the
Lead Balloon is indeed faster.

Therefore the straight–line water distance between Kebab Fountains and Lard Sculptures is 1 760 yards.

and since 2a = b then a = 3 and b = 6. So their ages differ by 3. Since all primes except 2 are odd and differ by an even number we can only have 2 and 5, Bert being the older of the two. The father plays no part in the problem!",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

 A  = Alf’s present age (in whole years)  
 B  = Bert’s present age  
 t  = the number of years since they last met.  

Hence, at the last meeting Alf and Bert were respectively  

 A – t  and  B – t .                                                             (1)

------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Translating Alf’s complicated remark
------------------------------------------------------------------
“When I was a quarter of the age I am now … ”  
This happened ¾A years ago, when Alf’s age was A/4.  
Bert’s age then was B – ¾A.

“… you were that age plus half the age your father would have been
 thirty years previous to when he was six times the age you would
 have been when I was half your age.”

Work back through the nested clauses.

(a)  “When I was half your age”  
     Let x be the number of years ago when this was true.  
     Then A – x = ½ (B – x)  ⇒  x = 2A – B.             (2)

(b)  Bert’s age at that time was B – x = 2(B – A).

(c)  “Six times” that age = 6·(2(B – A)) = 12(B – A).

(d)  Let F be Alf’s father’s present age.  
     The time y (years ago) when the father was that age satisfies  
     F – y = 12(B – A)  ⇒  y = F – 12(B – A).

(e)  Thirty years before that the father was  
     F – (y + 30) = 12(B – A) – 30 years old;  
     half of this age is 6(B – A) – 15.

Putting the statement together gives

 B – ¾A  =  A/4  +  [ 6(B – A) – 15 ] .                (3)

------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Relation between Alf’s and Bert’s ages
------------------------------------------------------------------
Expand (3):

 B – ¾A  =  A/4  – 6A  + 6B  – 15  
 B – ¾A  =  – 23A/4 + 6B – 15.

Collecting terms gives

 5A – 5B + 15 = 0  ⇒  A – B + 3 = 0  
 ⇒  B = A + 3.                                        (4)

So Bert is always three years older than Alf.

------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  The ages at the last meeting must be the only pair of
    primes differing by 3
------------------------------------------------------------------
From (1) and (4) the two ages at the last meeting were

 Alf :  A – t  
 Bert:  (A + 3) – t ,

still differing by 3.  
We are told both are prime numbers.

If two positive integers differ by 3, one of them is even;
therefore the only way both can be prime is for the even one to be 2
(the only even prime).  
Consequently

 A – t = 2,  (A + 3) – t = 5 .                       (5)

------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  The answer
------------------------------------------------------------------
Equation (5) already gives the required ages:  

 Alf was 2 years old and Bert was 5 years old the last time they met.

(Their present ages A and B can be anything consistent with B = A + 3
and A > 12 so that all the intermediate events occur in the proper
order, but the ages at the meeting are uniquely 2 and 5.)

You have no way to call for help. Luckily, in addition to medical supplies, the truck is carrying a Desert Patrol Vehicle (DPV) and two barrels of fuel.
The DPV has a full 10 gallon tank, but to make room for the medical supplies, it can only carry one of the 45 gallon barrels at a time. While you can't transfer fuel between barrels, you can refill the tank from the barrels. Assume the DPV can get 12 miles per gallon, regardless of the load it carries.
How far can you go?

Since your base camp is 800 miles away (half of 1600 miles), you can easily complete the delivery. Here's how:
Although you can only carry one barrel at a time, you need to transport both of them until one barrel is empty. F is the barrel used first, and L is the barrel used last.
Use half of a tank (5 gallons) to carry L 5*12=60 miles, and then return for F (uses another 5 gallons). Refill the tank from F and carry it to where you left L (also uses 5 gallons).

Now you are 60*3=180 miles from the broken truck. The tank and L are still full, but F is empty. Leave F behind and make a run for it, carrying L. Refill the tank from L as needed. There are 55 gallons of fuel left so you can travel an additional 55*12=660 miles, for a maximum of (180+660) 840 miles.

DATA  
• Fuel on hand  
  2 barrels × 45 gal + 10 gal in the DPV’s tank = 100 gal  
• Consumption  
  12 mi/gal   →   1 gal takes the DPV 12 mi
• What the DPV can carry at one time  
  1 barrel (45 gal) + full tank (10 gal) = 55 gal  

I.  Moving two barrels forward  
While both barrels are still in use we must shuttle:

 step 1 – drive the first barrel forward x miles,  
 step 2 – return empty x miles,  
 step 3 – drive the second barrel forward x miles.

The DPV travels 3x miles but advances the fuel stock only x miles.  
Fuel burned in doing this is  

 (3x miles)/(12 mi/gal) = x/4 gallons.               (1)

II.  How far can we afford to shuttle?  
We have 100 gal altogether but, the moment the total remaining fuel is 55 gal, everything will fit in one load (one full barrel + full tank) and the second barrel can be discarded.

So the fuel allowed for all the shuttling is  

 100 gal – 55 gal = 45 gal.

Putting this into (1):

 x/4 = 45 ⇒ x = 180 miles.

Therefore we can move both barrels 180 mi down-range, still leaving exactly 55 gal.

III.  The single-barrel run to base camp  
Distance still to go: 800 mi – 180 mi = 620 mi.

Fuel required for that distance:

 620 mi ÷ 12 mi/gal = 51 ⅔ gal.

But we are now carrying 55 gal, so the run is possible and leaves

 55 gal – 51 ⅔ gal = 3 ⅓ gal

unused when we reach the base.

IV.  Feasibility of the plan  
• At every moment before the 180-mile mark we never exceed the carrying limit (only one barrel is on board during any motion).  
• After the 180-mile mark we carry one barrel (45 gal) and a full 10-gal tank, exactly the 55-gal limit.  
• Refuelling is done only from barrels to tank, never barrel-to-barrel, so the stated restriction is obeyed.

Hence the plan is physically attainable.

Final answer: Yes.  By ferrying the two barrels 180 miles forward and then proceeding with one barrel, the DPV can cover the remaining 620 miles, reaching base camp with about 3 ⅓ gallons to spare.",True,0,0

N = a + (a+1) + … + (a+ℓ–1)      (ℓ ≥ 2 ,  a ≥ 0).

This gives the well–known identity  

N = ℓa + ℓ(ℓ–1)/2                                    (1)

or, equivalently  

2N = ℓ(2a+ℓ–1).                                      (2)

We distinguish two cases for the length ℓ.

1. ℓ odd.  
   Then (2) shows that ℓ divides 2N and hence divides N itself; every representation with odd length therefore corresponds to an odd divisor of N that is >1, and conversely.

2. ℓ even, say ℓ = 2u.  
   Equation (2) becomes 2N = 2u(2a+2u–1); cancelling 2 we obtain  

   N = u(2a+2u–1) with 2a+2u–1 odd.                        (3)

   Hence u | N and the quotient N/u is a half–integer (because it is odd divided by 2); equivalently 2N/u is an odd integer.

Combining the two facts

• with odd length we need an odd divisor of N larger than 1;  
• with even length we need a divisor u of N such that 2N/u is odd,

we obtain an immediate obstruction:

If N is a pure power of two, N = 2^k (k ≥ 1), it has no odd divisor > 1, and for every divisor u the quotient 2N/u is still a power of two, hence even.  Therefore a power of two cannot satisfy either possibility and cannot be written as a sum of ≥2 consecutive non-negative integers.

Conversely, we show that every integer that is not a power of two can be written in the required way.

Let N = 2^r · s with s odd, s > 1 (this is exactly “N not a power of two”).

A.  If N is odd (r = 0) we can always take ℓ = 2 :
        N = (N–1)/2 + (N+1)/2,
   and the first term (N–1)/2 is ≥ 500 in our interval, hence non-negative.

B.  Suppose N is even (r ≥ 1).

   • If s ≤ 2^{r+1} – 1, choose the odd length ℓ = s.  
     With (1) the first term is
          a = N/ℓ – (ℓ–1)/2 = 2^r – (s–1)/2 ≥ 2^r – (2^{r+1} – 2)/2 = 1,
     so a ≥ 1 and the representation is valid.

   • If s ≥ 2^{r+1} – 1, choose the even length ℓ = 2^{r+1}.  
     Then (1) gives
          a = N/ℓ – (ℓ–1)/2 = (s/2) – (2^{r+1} – 1)/2 ≥ 0
     (because s ≥ 2^{r+1} – 1), and 2N/ℓ = s is odd, so the parity
     condition for even length is satisfied.

Thus every non-power-of-two admits at least one representation by consecutive non-negative integers.

Between 1000 and 2000 the only power of two is

2^{10} = 1024.

Therefore 1024 is the unique integer in the interval that cannot be obtained in the required fashion.

For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist.

Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.
Hence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.
Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9).

The condition in the statement is

1.  Converting (1) to a Pell equation  
   Multiply the two factors on each side by 4 and complete the squares:

 4 n(n+1)+1 = (2n+1)²,  4 m(m–1) = (2m–1)² − 1,

and hence (1) is equivalent to

   All solutions are obtained from

 x + y√2 = (1 + √2)(3 + 2√2)ᵏ  (k = 0, 1, 2, …).

Generating solutions while x < 2001 (because n < 1000 ⇒ x = 2n + 1 < 2001):

 k = 0 : (x, y) = (1, 1) ⇒ n = 0  (not a street)  
 k = 1 : (x, y) = (7, 5) ⇒ n = (7−1)/2 = 3,  m = (5+1)/2 = 3

Step 1.  Work in whole pence.  
Put p = 100x ,  q = 100y ,  r = 100z  (so p,q,r are positive integers).  
Equation (1) becomes  

 p + q + r = 570 ,  pqr = 5 700 000 . (2)

Step 2.  Eliminate an obvious common factor 5.  
Because 5 700 000 is divisible by 5⁵ and the sum 570 is itself divisible by 5, each of p,q,r must be divisible by 5 (if only one or two of them were, the sum would not be a multiple of 5).  
Write p = 5a , q = 5b , r = 5c with a,b,c positive integers.  
Then (2) gives  

 a + b + c = 114 ,  abc = 45 600 . (3)

Prime factorisation: 45 600 = 2⁵ · 3 · 5² · 19.  
The prime 19 appears exactly once, hence it must belong to exactly one of a,b,c.  
Without loss of generality let c = 19t where t is a positive integer not divisible by 19.

Step 3.  Reduce the possibilities for t.  
Because a + b + c = 114, we have 19t < 114, i.e. t ≤ 6.  
From (3): ab = 45 600 /(19t) = 2400 / t and a + b = 114 – 19t.  
For integers a,b the quadratic s² – (a+b)s + ab = 0 must have integer roots, so its
discriminant must be a perfect square:

Δ(t) = (114 – 19t)² – 4·(2400 / t).

Evaluate Δ(t) for t = 1,…,6:

t  (114–19t)  ab = 2400/t  Δ(t)

Only t = 3 gives a positive square discriminant.  
Thus t = 3 and

 a + b = 57 , ab = 800.

Solving s² – 57s + 800 = 0 gives {a,b} = {25, 32}.  
Consequently (a,b,c) = (25, 32, 57).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Determining the possible numerical triples (a,b,c)

Let a ≤ b ≤ c be the three numerical scores and a+b+c = 150.  
Because c ≤ 60 and 3 × 49 = 147 < 150, at least one dart must score 50 or
more, so c ∈ {50, 51, 54, 57, 60}.

Working case by case:

c = 60 → a+b = 90  
 (30,60,60), (33,57,60), (36,54,60), (39,51,60),
 (40,50,60), (42,48,60), (45,45,60)

 (36,57,57), (39,54,57), (42,51,57), (45,48,57)

c = 54 → a+b = 96  
 (42,54,54), (45,51,54), (48,48,54)

c = 51 → a+b = 99  
 (48,51,51)

c = 50 → a+b = 100 and a,b ≤ 50  
 (50,50,50)

Altogether there are 16 different numerical triples.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Counting the distinct unordered sets of three darts

If the three numerical values are all different, the number of ways is  
m(a) · m(b) · m(c).

If two values coincide (say a=b≠c) the number is  
C(m(a)+1,2) · m(c).

If all three coincide (a=b=c) it is  
C(m(a)+2,3).

Applying these rules to every triple gives

(30,60,60) 2·C(1+1,2)=2

If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.

Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:

2. Tens : E + A + c₁ = 1 (tens digit) → E + A + c₁ = 11 (carry c₂ = 1).
3. Hundreds: I + R + c₂ gives the 6-digit
              → I + R + 1 = 6  or 16.
4. Thousands: S + T + c₃ = 5 or 15 (c₃ is the carry from the previous step).
5. Ten-thousands: O + S + c₄ = 2 or 12 (c₄ the carry from step 4).
6. Hundred-thousands: N + A + c₅ = 7.

Because R + L must be at least 1 + 2 = 3 and no letter is 0, the units column must give 13, i.e.

          R + L = 13 and c₁ = 1.                                (1)

From the tens column,

          E + A + 1 = 11 ⇒ E + A = 10 and c₂ = 1.              (2)

Take the hundreds column with the carry c₂ = 1.

If I + R + 1 = 6, then I + R = 5, forcing R = 4, I = 1.
That choice leads to contradictions later, so the other possibility must hold:

          I + R + 1 = 16 ⇒ I + R = 15 and c₃ = 1.              (3)

With c₃ = 1, the thousands column gives

          S + T + 1 = 5 or 15 ⇒ S + T = 4 (c₄ = 0) or 14 (c₄ = 1).  (4)

Case S + T = 14 works; S + T = 4 also works, so both must be examined.

–––––  Trying S + T = 14 (c₄ = 1)  ––––
It forces O + S + 1 = 12 (ten-thousands column), so O + S = 11, which
quickly conflicts with (1)–(3); no solution survives.

–––––  Trying S + T = 4 (c₄ = 0)  ––––
Now O + S must satisfy O + S = 12 (to make the ten-thousands digit 2), giving

Choose S and T (non-zero, different, distinct from R, L, I) with S + T = 4,

2 → 2,5,7  3 → 2,3,5  5 → 2,5,7  7 → 2,5,7  

Notice that 3 can be followed by 3,2,5 but never by 7, and no digit except 3 can be followed by 3.  
Hence every 3 that occurs inside the number must be preceded by another 3; consequently all 3’s form one block at the very beginning of the number.  
Let that block have length k (k≥1 because digit 3 must appear).  
Because the total length is 5 and the other three digits 2,5,7 must all occur, we need 5-k ≥ 3 ⇒ k ≤ 2.  

Thus only two possibilities exist:

• k = 1 : 3 a b c d with a ≠ 7 (a = 2 or 5)  
• k = 2 : 3 3 a b c with a,b,c being a permutation of 2,5,7 and a ≠ 7 (so a = 2 or 5).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Smallest number
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A smallest number should use the smallest possible digit at every place from left to right.

Take k = 1 and choose the smallest allowable second digit a = 2 :

 3 2 …  

From 2 we may use 2,5,7.  To stay minimal, choose the smallest digit still allowed, namely 2 again, but we must still include 5 and 7 somewhere:

 3 2 2 5 7

Check all pairs: 32, 22, 25, 57 are all in the composite list.  
Digits 2,3,5,7 all appear.

Hence the smallest admissible number is 32257.

No number beginning 33 … can be smaller, and every number beginning 35 … is larger, so 32257 is indeed the minimum.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Largest number
--------------------------------------------------------------------
To maximize the number, put the largest permissible digit as early as possible.

The first digit must be 3.  The largest legal second digit after 3 is 5 (3 7 is forbidden), so begin with 35:

 3 5 …  

From 5 the largest next digit is 7, yielding 357 …  
We still need a 2 somewhere; to keep the number large, postpone the 2 to the last position and keep earlier digits as large as allowed:

 3 5 7 7 2

Pairs 35, 57, 77, 72 are all composite, and all four prime digits occur.

Any other placement of the mandatory 2 would bring it further to the left and make the number smaller, and any variant with a smaller third or fourth digit is obviously smaller. Therefore the maximal number is 35772.

177,"Once an old man died, and in his Will he stated that all the pearls he kept in a little bag were to be distributed among his daughters. To make things fair, the distribution must be done in the following way:
The older girl should receive one pearl, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""
And so it was.
How many pearls were there in the bag?
How many daughters did the old man have?
How many pearls did each girl get?","If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","There were 36 pearls.
There were 6 daughters.
Each daughter got 6 pearls.
The girl number x will have x pearls and a seventh of the rest. Since the last girl leaves no pearls in the bag, then when she takes her pearls the rest in the bag is zero (a seventh of nothing is nothing).
Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).
That is, k+1 = 7 and then k = 6.
So, the number of pearls is 6*6 = 36, and there were 6 girls.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

P = total number of pearls in the bag,  
n = number of daughters (they are numbered 1,2,…,n from the oldest to the youngest),  
T = number of pearls each daughter finally receives (the Judge says these amounts are equal).

Procedure for the k-th daughter (k = 1,2,…,n)

• At the start of her turn there are S_{k-1} pearls in the bag.  
• She first takes k pearls, leaving S_{k-1}-k.  
• She then takes one seventh of what is left, i.e. (S_{k-1}-k)/7.  
• Hence the k-th daughter’s total gain is

 k + (S_{k-1}-k)/7.

Because every girl must end with the same amount, this total equals T; i.e.

 k + (S_{k-1}-k)/7 = T.  (1)

Solving (1) for S_{k-1}:

 (S_{k-1}-k)/7 = T - k  
 S_{k-1} = 7(T - k) + k = 7T – 6k.  (2)

After she receives her share, the number of pearls left is

 S_k = (S_{k-1}-k) – (S_{k-1}-k)/7  
   = 6(S_{k-1}-k)/7  
   = 6·[7(T-k)]/7  
   = 6(T - k).  (3)

But for the next step S_k should also equal the value given by (2) with k replaced by k+1:

 S_k = 7T – 6(k+1) = 7T – 6k – 6.  (4)

Equating (3) and (4):

 6(T - k) = 7T – 6k – 6  
 6T – 6k = 7T – 6k – 6  
     0 = T – 6.

Therefore  

 T = 6.

Consequences of T = 6

Using (2) with k = 1 we obtain the original number of pearls:

 S_0 = 7T – 6 = 7·6 – 6 = 36 = P.

Using (3) we track the pearls after each distribution:

 S_k = 6(T - k) = 6(6 - k).

This sequence becomes zero exactly when 6 - k = 0, i.e. at k = 6.  
Thus n = 6; there are six daughters and the bag is empty after the youngest has received her share.

1. 1st quarter  
   The team had 27 points at the end of the 1st quarter:

2. 2nd quarter  
   “In the 2nd, they scored ½ of their score at the end of the 2nd, less 1.”

Kurt finally gave in, and agreed to go in with Rod on a minimum special order of the multi-colored treats.  When the box arrived, they divided the bounty as originally planned.
""Interesting,"" Kurt noted, ""that the number of Rnkfurers you got is the same integer as my percentage.""
Rod did a little mental math.  ""You're right,"" he noted, ""and I think that's the lowest pair of integers we could do that with.""

2nd order: Rod 60, Kurt 90.  Kurt has 60% of the total.
The equation to satisfy is

K = R*R/(100-R)",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

Rod’s share = R  
Kurt’s share = K  
Total number in the shipment = N = R + K.

The recurring condition in the story is  

 “The number of Rnkfurers Rod gets equals the (integer) percentage that Kurt receives.”

If that percentage is p % (an integer 1–99), then

 K = p % of N = (p/100) N  and  R = p. 

Substituting K = N – R gives  

 N – p = (p/100) N  
 ⟹ N(1 – p/100) = p  
 ⟹ N = 100p /(100 – p)                (1)

For K to be an integer we also need  

 K = (p/100) N = p² /(100 – p)           (2)

Hence 100 – p must divide both 100p (to make N an integer) and p² (to make K an integer).

─────────────────────────
FIRST (minimum-size) ORDER
─────────────────────────
We seek the smallest total N satisfying (1) and (2).

Testing p = 1, 2, … shows that the first value for which 100 – p divides 100p is p = 20:

• 100 – p = 80 divides 100·20 = 2000  
• 80 also divides 20² = 400.

Therefore, from (1) and (2)

 N = 100·20 / 80 = 25,  K = 20² / 80 = 5,  R = p = 20.

This is indeed the smallest possible total, so Rod is correct that their pair (20, 5) is the lowest.

So in the first division:

 Rod received 20, Kurt received 5.           (†)

SECOND (case-of-50) ORDER
──────────────────────────
Now every order must be a whole number of cases, 50 per case, so N' = 50 c for some integer c.

Kurt insists on getting more than Rod, yet he can store at most 100, so we require

 K' > R',  K' ≤ 100,  R' = p' (p' the new percentage),  N' = 50 c.

Because K' = p' % of N', the inequality K' > R' becomes N' > 100, whence p' > 50.

Let d = 100 – p'.  
As before,

 K' = p'² / d   and   N' = 100 p' / d.        (3)

We need

 (i) d | p'²  (to make K' integral),  
 (ii) d | 100 p'  (to make N' integral),  
 (iii) K' ≤ 100,  (iv) p' > 50,  (v) N' a multiple of 50.

Condition (iii) with (3) gives p'² / d ≤ 100 ⇒ d ≥ 39.

Hence d ∈ {39,40,41,…,49}; equivalently p' ∈ {51,60,59,…,51}.  
Checking each d, the only value satisfying (i) and (ii) is d = 40 (p' = 60):

• 40 divides 60² = 3600 (so K' integral),  
• 40 divides 100·60 = 6000 (so N' integral).

From (3)

 K' = 60² / 40 = 90,  R' = p' = 60,  N' = 100·60 / 40 = 150 = 3 cases.

All remaining requirements are met: K' > R', K' = 90 ≤ 100, and N' is indeed a multiple of 50.

Hence an optimal decomposition contains no 1’s.

2. Every summand is 2, 3 or 4, and no summand exceeds 4  
Suppose some summand t ≥ 5.  Write t = 2 + (t−2); replace t by the two numbers 2 and t−2.  
Their product becomes 2(t−2) > t for every t ≥ 5, while the sum is unchanged, so the product grows.  
Iterating this argument eliminates all summands ≥ 5.

3. Every 4 can be replaced by two 2’s without hurting the product  
Because 2·2 = 4, exchanging a 4 for 2 + 2 does not change the sum or the product.  
Thus we may assume the optimal decomposition uses only 2’s and 3’s.

4. At most two 2’s appear  
Three 2’s can be replaced by two 3’s:  
2 + 2 + 2 = 6 = 3 + 3, yet 2·2·2 = 8 < 3·3 = 9.  
Hence having three 2’s lowers the product, so an optimal set contains at most two 2’s.

Consequently, an optimal decomposition consists of as many 3’s as possible, with at most one leftover 2.

5. Apply the rule to the sum 20  
Divide 20 by 3:   20 = 3·6 + 2.  
Thus the candidate set is six 3’s and one 2:

20 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2.

Its product is
P = 3⁶ · 2 = 729 · 2 = 1458.

6. Verify optimality  
Any other decomposition can be converted, by the steps above, into one using only 3’s (and possibly one 2) without decreasing the product; among those, the one we found is the only way to total 20.  Hence 1458 is indeed the maximum possible product.

x  (the 4–digit number) and 5x (the 5–digit number).  
All nine different digits 1–9 must be used once altogether.

1.  Mod-9 test  
   The digit-sum of the nine digits is 45, a multiple of 9.  
   Therefore (x + 5x) ≡ 0 (mod 9) ⇒ 6x ≡ 0 (mod 9) ⇒ x ≡ 0 (mod 3);  
   so x is divisible by 3.

2.  Last–digit test  
   The last digit d of x determines the last digit of 5x: it is (5d) mod 10.  
   Digits 0 may not appear, and 5 must appear only once, so the only possible
   endings for x are d = 3, 7, 9 (because 1 would make the 5 appear twice, and even digits give 0).

3.  Take d = 3 (first workable case).  
   Then 5·3 = 15, so  
      units(5x) = 5, carry = 1 to the tens column.

4.  Let the tens digit of x be c.  Compute the tens digit of 5x:

      tens(5x) = (5c + 1) mod 10.

   The digit obtained must be neither 0 nor already used, and it must not be 5.
   The only c that works is c = 2, giving

      tens(5x) = 1,  carry to hundreds = 1.

5.  Let the hundreds digit of x be b.  Then

      hundreds(5x) = (5b + 1) mod 10.

   This digit must again be non-zero, distinct, and not 5.
   Choosing b = 7 gives

      hundreds(5x) = 6,  carry to thousands = 3.

6.  Let the thousands digit of x be a.  Then

      thousands(5x) = (5a + 3) mod 10,
      leading digit (ten-thousands) of 5x = ⌊(5a + 3)/10⌋.

   Taking a = 9 yields

   Digits of x: 9, 7, 2, 3

If the distance was 2, the result is same as if the man had 981 watermelons and to go only 1km, so the result would be 962. When using this method, we can calculate that the final number of watermelons is 140. (Note: The result for distance of 6 is 886 but from this moment the camel needs to travel only 17 times to get all the watermelons 1km further, so the result for distance of 7 is 869)",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let C = 100 be the carrying capacity of the camel (100 melons per load) and remember that the camel eats 1 melon for every kilometre it walks, whether it is loaded or not.

Key observation   
If, at some place on the road, N melons (N>0) are waiting to be taken 1 km farther on, the camel has to shuttle:

– forward with the 1st load,   
– back empty,   
– forward with the 2nd load,   
– back empty, …   
until the last load is taken forward and the camel stays there.  

If n = ⌈N/C⌉ loads are required, the animal walks 2n–1 km during that kilometre of progress, so it must eat 2n–1 melons. Hence

moving the whole stock one kilometre costs 2 ⌈N/100⌉ – 1 melons.           (★)

With this we can compute, kilometre by kilometre, the least number of melons that must be eaten; whenever the stock drops below a multiple of 100 one whole shuttle trip disappears and the “tariff’’ (★) becomes cheaper.  

Start with 1000 melons at A (position 0).

1. While more than 900 melons are left we need 10 loads; tariff 19 melons / km.  
   To lose exactly 100 melons we move  
        d₁ = 100 / 19 km.  
   Stock now 900, distance covered d₁.

2. 900–800 melons: 9 loads → tariff 17 melons / km.  
        d₂ = 100 / 17 km.  
   Stock 800, distance d₁+d₂.

3. 800–700 melons: 8 loads → tariff 15 melons / km.  
        d₃ = 100 / 15 km.

4. 700–600 melons: 7 loads → tariff 13 melons / km.  
        d₄ = 100 / 13 km.

5. 600–500 melons: 6 loads → tariff 11 melons / km.  
        d₅ = 100 / 11 km.

6. 500–400 melons: 5 loads → tariff 9 melons / km.  
        d₆ = 100 / 9 km.

7. 400–300 melons: 4 loads → tariff 7 melons / km.  
        d₇ = 100 / 7 km.

8. 300–200 melons: 3 loads → tariff 5 melons / km.  
        d₈ = 100 / 5 = 20 km.

After those eight stages we have

d₁+⋯+d₈ = 100·(1/19+1/17+1/15+1/13+1/11+1/9+1/7+1/5)  
          = 79.992 219 683… km,

and 200 melons remain.

Distance still to be covered:  
99 − 79.992 219 683… = 19.007 780 317… km.

9. With 200 melons we need 2 loads, tariff 3 melons / km.  
   Over the remaining 19.007 780 317… km the camel eats

        3 × 19.007 780 317… = 57.023 340 952… melons.

Melons reaching city B

200 − 57.023 340 952… = 142.976 659 048… .

That number is an exact fraction

142 + 947 329 / 969 969 ≈ 142.976 659.

No strategy can do better, because at each stage we have paid the absolute minimum tariff (★).  
Since melons are whole, the trader can finally sell at most

142 watermelons.

(A completely explicit set of shuttling trips that realises 142 melons can be written down by rounding the fractional distances above so that the camel always eats whole melons, but any such minor adjustment cannot increase the amount delivered beyond 142.)

189,"A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let

The man is 3/8 L from A and 5/8 L from B when he notices the train.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  If he runs back to A

We analyze the three simultaneously.

Step A: Suppose n is a multiple of 6.

• Then (3) is automatically satisfied (antecedent false).  
• Being a multiple of 6 makes n a multiple of 3, so by (2) it must lie between 50 and 59.  
  The only multiple of 6 in that range is 54.  
• But 54 is not a multiple of 4; with n = 54, condition (1) would demand 60 ≤ n ≤ 69, which fails.

–  If T = 2, F = 1.

MENU
Apple Pie  ... $13.60
Ice cream ... $15.90
Chocolate cake ... $24.90
Pancakes ... $?",The code relates to the letters individually rather than complete words,"The letters are valued in reverse alphabetical order (A = 26 B = 25, etc) and multiplied by 10. Pancakes cost is $14.60",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"First observe that the price of each dish is the sum of the individual prices of its letters.  
Write every price in cents so we can work with whole numbers.

Apple Pie → $13.60 = 1360 ¢  
Ice cream → $15.90 = 1590 ¢  
Chocolate cake → $24.90 = 2490 ¢  

Eliminate spaces and list the letters involved.

1) ApplePie: A P P L E P I E (8 letters)  
 1360 = A + 3P + L + 2E + I

2) Icecream: I C E C R E A M (8 letters)  
 1590 = I + 2C + 2E + R + A + M

The two dishes each have eight letters, so if every letter had the same fixed additive constant, that constant would appear eight times in both equations and would disappear when we subtract the two equations:

( I + 2C + 2E + R + A + M ) – ( A + 3P + L + 2E + I )  
 = 1590 – 1360 = 230 ¢  
 ⇒ 2C + R + M – (3P + L) = 230 ¢.

But notice that every coefficient on the left is 1, 2, or 3—the same small integers that appear as the number of times each letter occurs.  That suggests each letter value itself must be changing by a regular fixed amount as we move through the alphabet; otherwise we could never get such a tidy difference of 230 ¢.

Try the simplest linear rule: give every letter a value that decreases by the same amount as we go from A to B to C, etc.  Call that common decrement d ¢, and suppose A is worth a₀ ¢.  Then:

value(A) = a₀  
value(B) = a₀ – d  
value(C) = a₀ – 2d  
 ⋮  
value(Z) = a₀ – 25d.

Because each dish has 8 letters, its total price P ¢ satisfies  
P = Σ (letter-values)  
 = a₀ (8) – d ( sum of letter positions A=0, B=1, … ).

Let S = “sum of the alphabetical positions” (counting A=0, B=1, …, Z=25) and L = number of letters (here L=8 for the first two dishes, L=13 for the third).

Hence P = 8a₀ – dS for Apple Pie, and P = 8a₀ – dS′ for Ice cream.

Subtract the two equations:

1590 – 1360 = –d( S′ – S )  
230 = –d(57 – 80)  (Apple Pie has S=80, Ice cream S′=57)

­23d = 230  ⇒ d = –10 ¢.

So each step down the alphabet lowers the value by 10 ¢, and therefore

a₀ = (1360 + 10·80)/8 = (1360 + 800)/8 = 270 ¢.

Thus every capital letter’s value is

Value(letter) = 270 ¢ – 10 ¢ × (alphabetical position, A=1 … Z=26).

A  = 270 – 10·1 = 260 ¢ ($2.60)  
B  = 270 – 10·2 = 250 ¢ ($2.50)  
⋯  
Z  = 270 – 10·26 = 10 ¢ ($0.10).

Check on Chocolate cake (13 letters, S=102):

Price = 13·270 – 10·102 = 3510 – 1020 = 2490 ¢ = $24.90 ✔️

Now compute Pancakes.

Pancakes → P A N C A K E S  
Alphabet positions:   16, 1, 14, 3, 1, 11, 5, 19  
Sum S = 16+1+14+3+1+11+5+19 = 70

And using another six matches Mad Ade could again do precisely the same.
How many matches were there in the box originally?
Note that the match-box can hold maximum of 50 matches.",There are two possible answers!,"Initially, there were either 42 or 36 matches in the match-box.
There are 42 matches in the box with which he could form a triangle 20, 15, 7, with an area of 42 square inches. After 6 matches had been used, the remaining 36 matches would form a triangle 17, 10, 9, with an area of 36 square inches. After using another 6 matches, the remaining 30 matches would form a triangle 13, 12, 5, with an area of 30 square inches. After using another 6, the 24 remaining would form a triangle 10, 8, 6, with an area of 24 square inches.
Thus, there are two possible answers. There were either 42 or 36 matches in the match-box.
Also it is interesting to know that there are just 5 such triangles for which the perimeter and the area is the same (assuming all sides are integers) and they are :
24 (10, 8, 6)
30 (13, 12, 5)
36 (17, 10, 9)
42 (20, 15, 7)
60 (29, 25, 6)",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the number of matches still unused at any stage be n (hence the triangle’s perimeter is n inches, because every match is 1-inch long).

1.  Expressing the condition “area = perimeter”.

   Denote the three integral side–lengths by a, b, c and put  
   s = n /2   (the semiperimeter).  
   By Heron’s formula

        Area² = s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c).

   The requirement Area = n = 2s gives  

        s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c) = (2s)² = 4s².          (1)

   Divide (1) by s (s > 0):

        (s – a)(s – b)(s – c) = 4s.                   (2)

2.  Rewriting (2).

   Introduce the positive integers  

        x = s – a,   y = s – b,   z = s – c.

   Because every side is smaller than s, x, y, z are indeed positive.  
   Adding x, y, z gives  

        x + y + z = 3s – (a + b + c) = 3s – n = 3s – 2s = s.    (3)

   Equation (2) becomes  

        xyz = 4s.                                               (4)

   Thus we must find positive integers (x, y, z, s) satisfying simultaneously

        x + y + z = s,     xyz = 4s.                            (5)

   Observe that (5) forces s to be an integer, hence n = 2s is necessarily even.

3.  Solving (5).

   Assume, without loss of generality, x ≤ y ≤ z.  
   Begin with the smallest possibility x = 1.

   Then from (5)

        y + z = s – 1,      y z = 4s.                          (6)

   Eliminating z from (6) gives the quadratic

        y² – (s – 1)y + 4s = 0,

   whose discriminant must be a perfect square:

        Δ = (s – 1)² – 16s = s² – 18s + 1 = k².                (7)

   Rearranging (7),

        (s – 9)² – k² = 80  ⇔  (s – 9 – k)(s – 9 + k) = 80.    (8)

   The positive factor-pairs of 80 are  

        (1, 80), (2, 40), (4, 20), (5, 16), (8, 10).

   From (8) we have  

        s = 9 + (p + q)/2   for each pair (p, q) with pq = 80.

   Only the pair (4, 20) keeps s within the limit imposed by the match-box (n = 2s ≤ 50):

        p = 4,   q = 20    ⇒    s = 9 + (4 + 20)/2 = 9 + 12 = 21.

   Therefore one solution of (5) is

        s = 21,   x = 1,   y = 6,   z = 14.

4.  Recovering the triangle when s = 21.

        a = s – x = 20,     b = s – y = 15,     c = s – z = 7.

   The triangle inequalities 15 + 7 > 20, 20 + 7 > 15, 20 + 15 > 7 all hold, so

        perimeter n = 2s = 42,     area = 42 square inches.

5.  Repeating after six and twelve matches are removed.

   Removing six matches decreases the perimeter by 6, i.e. it decreases s by 3.

   • n = 42 – 6 = 36  ⇒  s = 18.  
     Solving x + y + z = 18, xyz = 72 with x = 1 gives  
           y + z = 17, yz = 72  ⇒  (y, z) = (8, 9).  
     Then a, b, c = 17, 10, 9 – again a valid triangle with area 36.

   • n = 42 – 12 = 30 ⇒  s = 15.  
     Now x = 2 works:  
           y + z = 13, yz = 60  ⇒  (y, z) = (3, 10).  
     This gives sides 13, 12, 5 and area 30.

6.  Uniqueness inside the 50-match limit.

   For n ≤ 50 the only semiperimeters that can satisfy (8) are s = 21, 18, 15 (all produced by the single admissible factor-pair of 80 above).  Hence the only feasible initial perimeter not exceeding 50 is n = 42.

Therefore the box originally contained 42 matches.

198,"Detective Grant was inspecting the scene of the crime. The 50-year-old victim, Joe, had been poisoned by a candy containing cyanide. On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago.

He then went to the criminal's house, and offered him a chance to gamble his life, or go to jail. George offered him a certain number of candies, one of which was poisoned. If the criminal chose a poisoned candy, he died. If he chose a pure candy, he lived.
The criminal's remaining life expectancy divided by his prison sentence would be the number of candies George would bring him, one of which might kill him. In the case of Joe:
His remaining life expectancy at age 50 was 20. 20 divided by 2(his sentence) is 10. George brought him 10 candies, one of which was poisoned. Joe ate the poisoned one, and left nine on the table.
The 23 criminals who got off their sentences, but did not die, chose pure candies.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Grant noticed that, for every murdered ex-convict, the three numbers that were known – the victim’s age, the length of the jail term he had just finished and the total number of candies that had been put in front of him – fitted the same simple arithmetic relation with the common life-expectancy of 70 years.

Write  

A = victim’s age,  
S = years of the sentence just served,  
C = total candies on the table (the one eaten + the ones that were left).

For each of the four murders

70 − A = S · C.

Check:

• Joe: A = 50, S = 2  
70 − 50 = 20 = 2 · 10 ⇒ C = 10 (1 poisoned + 9 good)

• Jeff: A = 30, S = 10

Thus the killer chose ex-convicts whose remaining years to the average life-expectancy (70 – age) was an exact multiple of the sentence they had served, then gave them exactly that many candies, poisoning one of them.

From (2): W = 2.48 − 4F  

Set equal: 1.98 − 2B = 2.48 − 4F  
  4F − 2B = 0.50  
  2F − B = 0.25  (4)

Step 2: Use W from (1) in (3).  
(1.98 − 2B) + F + 3A = 2.99  
 F − 2B + 3A = 1.01  (5)

Step 3: Solve (4) and (5) for B and A in terms of F.

Equation (4): B = 2F − 0.25.  
Insert this in (5):

F − 2(2F − 0.25) + 3A = 1.01  
F − 4F + 0.50 + 3A = 1.01  
−3F + 3A = 0.51  
 A = F + 0.17  (6)

Step 4: Form the required sum S.

S = W + B + F + A  
 = (1.98 − 2B) + B + F + A  (using W from (1))  
 = 1.98 − B + F + A.

Substitute B and A from (4) and (6):

B = 2F − 0.25,  A = F + 0.17

S = 1.98 − (2F − 0.25) + F + (F + 0.17)  
 = 1.98 − 2F + 0.25 + F + F + 0.17  
 = 1.98 + 0.25 + 0.17  (the −2F + F + F cancel)  
 = 2.40.

201,"Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Snow, there lived the fair Princess Miyuki, who had always been fascinated by fairy tales and the stories of the wonders of the world. She believed that her sleeping, handsome prince was cursed to be one of the mummies in the pyramids of Egypt, and when she was done being Fantaghiro-saving-her-Romualdo, her prince would then build a beautiful palace as a monument of their love (which of course would be more beautiful than Taj Mahal) where both of them will live happily ever after...
So, you see, that's why Princess Miyuki had refused each and every love declaration or marriage proposal that came her way.
But of course, what's a story without the brave and wise heroic prince? Here comes Prince Hajikidama of the Marbles Kingdom. He's no mummy, but his brilliant(?) brain deduced that in order to win the princess' heart, he'd have to give her what she wanted most - her fantasy, and his token of understanding (her childish delusional nature).
In the end, labouring his mind's creativity department for all its worth, Prince Hajikidama decided that a 'Mountain of Love', reaching so high it collected the never-fallen-snow in Marbles Kingdom, might do the trick. That actually is a tetrahedral-shaped (pyramid with 4 equilateral triangular faces) crystallic marbles-made structure (like a giant pile of apples or oranges at a greengrocer's store) consisting of one marble crowning on the top layer, three on the next-to-top layer, six on the third layer, ten on the fourth layer, and so forth.

""My house is built on a strangely-shaped lot, so my back yard is a right triangle with an area of 840 square feet.  Each of the three sides measures an integral number of feet.  If I want to stake my dog so that he can reach the entire yard, how long must his rope be?""
Monette finally pulled rank on the adolescents.  ""It's not really your problem, but I'd be glad of some help.  Mr. Collins marked their papers wrong; their answers don't match his.

From the students' comments, we know that the Collins yard has the middle-sized hypotenuse.

Historical note:
Lewis Carroll searched for the answer to the basic mathematical problem, sent to him by a reader.  He found two right triangles with the same area, but couldn't discover a set of three.  Somewhat ironically, Carroll had found 20-21-29 and 12-35-37.  Had he doubled their dimensions, he would have had the first two triangles above, and quite likely would have found the third.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the legs of the right–triangular yard be a and b (feet) and the hypotenuse be c (feet).

2.  The Pythagorean condition

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Determining every integer‐sided right triangle with area 840
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Write the legs with Euclid’s formula:

 a = k (m² – n²),  b = k (2mn),  c = k (m² + n²),

where m > n, gcd(m,n)=1, m and n of opposite parity, k ≥ 1.

Then

Divide (3) by 2:

 k²·mn(m² – n²) = 840 = 2³·3·5·7. (4)

Because m > n, one quickly checks that m cannot exceed 8 (otherwise
mn(m² – n²) would already exceed 840).  A systematic inspection of the
admissible pairs (m,n) (only eight of them) together with the square
factors k² gives exactly three possibilities:

   m    n     k       legs (a,b)            hypotenuse c

No other choice of (m,n,k) satisfies (4); hence these are the only
integer‐sided right triangles whose area is 840 ft².

2.  The least rope that reaches the whole yard
-----------------------------------------------------------
Stake the dog at the midpoint of the hypotenuse.  For a right triangle
that point is the circum-center, and its distance to each vertex is

 R = c/2,

the circum-radius.  Because every point of the yard lies inside the
circum-circle, a rope of length R surely covers the entire yard; and no
shorter rope can possibly reach both acute-angle vertices, so R is the
minimum required.

Thus the three admissible rope lengths are

 c/2 =   58/2 = 29 ft,
 c/2 =   74/2 = 37 ft,
 c/2 = 113/2 = 56½ ft.

206,"Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let

Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.

The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.
Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.
If D=7, then L=0. But since 10-7=3, D cannot be 7.
If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.

1.  The result has four digits, so the (unwritten) ten-thousands digit of the result is 0.  
    Therefore the ten-thousands column must have produced 0, which is only possible if

    The second possibility is impossible (it soon forces a duplication), so

5.  Thousands column (one unit was just borrowed from S)

    Thus, with b = 0 or 1 for the possible borrow from the hundreds column,

-------------------------------------------------------------
Searching consistently through the cases:

• If the units column had borrowed (E = 0, N = 9), one quickly reaches a contradiction, so the borrow-free case E – N = 1 stands.

• Keep the borrow-free tens column first (b = 0 in (iv)):  
  then equations (i), (ii) and (iii) give

        E – N = 1,      D – A = 5,      I – E = 6,      D = L + 7.

  The only way I = E + 6 is feasible is with E = 3 (N = 2) giving I = 9, but this makes the digits clash later.  Hence no solution here.

• Take the hundreds column that DOES borrow (b = 1 in (iv)).  
  Then (iii) gives E = I + 4, so I = E – 4.  
  Combine this with (iv) (D = L + 6) and the borrow-free tens column (ii) D – A = 5.

  Trying the successive possibilities E = 4,6,7,8,9 (because E > 3):

  – E = 6 (N = 5) ⇒ I = 2, and choose L = 3 ⇒ D = 9, A = 4.  
    All digits {1,3,2,9,6,4,5} are distinct and satisfy every column.

  A complete, self–consistent assignment is therefore

        S = 1,  L = 3,  I = 2,  D = 9,  E = 6,  A = 4,  N = 5.

  Check:   13296 – 9645 = 3651 ✔

1.  Write each country together with

   England L = 7 V = 2

   France 340  
   Peru  200  
   Brazil 340

   Trying the linear combination

   • USA: 3a + 2b = 130  
   • Peru: 4a + 2b = 200  

   Subtracting: a = 70.  
   Substitute in the first equation: 3·70 + 2b = 130 ⇒ 210 + 2b = 130 ⇒ b = –40.

   Thus the computer is using  

        “population” (in thousands) = 70·(number of letters) – 40·(number of vowels).

3.  Verify the rule with the other countries:

   England: 70·7 – 40·2 = 490 – 80 = 410 ✓  
   France:  70·6 – 40·2 = 420 – 80 = 340 ✓  
   Brazil:  70·6 – 40·2 = 420 – 80 = 340 ✓  
   Greece:  70·6 – 40·3 = 420 –120 = 300 ✓  
   Japan:   70·5 – 40·2 = 350 – 80 = 270 ✓  

   The rule fits every entry.

4.  Apply the rule to Tibet.

   Tibet has 5 letters and 2 vowels (I, E).

   “Population” = 70·5 – 40·2  
                = 350 – 80

There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100, neither of which is prime.  (No, 1 is not prime.)  So you will walk in an expanding square with sides of length 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 feet.  This is a total of 1060 feet.

- (5+17+31+47+67+83)
You will also be 48 feet to the left of your starting position.
(7+19+37+53+71+89)
- (3+13+29+43+61+79)
To calculate the distance back to the starting position, calculate the length of the hypotenuse of the right angle triangle with legs that are 56 and 48 feet long.  This is 73.756 feet, or 73 feet, 9 inches.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"All 25 primes that are less than 100 are

Alec and Brett wanted to build new skateboards, so they each needed to purchase a deck, trucks, bearings and wheels. Chris only needed new wheels. The store offers a 10% discount for purchases over $250, so the boys decided to pay for all the parts together to qualify for the discount. Altogether, the boys spent $266.40.

less 10% discount $12.60 $14.50 $2.50 $29.60
Amount spent $113.40 $130.50 $22.50 $266.40
Explanation:
First find the original price of all the items combined. $266.40 is the price after the 10% discount was applied.
That means $266.40 is equal to 90% of the original price.
Write an equation and then cross multiply:
266.40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x   =   9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)
Let x = the amount Alec spent on trucks.
x + (x+5) = 75
2x + 5 = 75
2x = 70
x = 35
Alec spent $35 on trucks. Brett spent $5 more than Alec. Therefore, Brett spent $40 on trucks.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51
x + (2x + 3) = 51
3x + 3 = 51
3x = 48

Dₐ , Tₐ , Bₐ , W = Alec’s deck, trucks, bearings and one set of wheels  
Dᵦ , Tᵦ , Bᵦ       = Brett’s deck, trucks, bearings  
Chris buys only a set of wheels, so he also pays W.

All prices are “shelf prices’’ (before discount).  
Because the three boys pay together, the store gives 10 % off the whole bill.  
They actually paid $266.40 after the discount.

1.  Find the total before the discount  
   0.90 · (total before) = 266.40  ⇒  total before = 266.40 / 0.9 = 296.00 dollars.

2.  The wheels  
   Three identical sets cost $75: 3W = 75 ⇒ W = 25.  
   Total wheels cost = 75.

3.  Bearings versus Alec’s deck  
   Bₐ + Bᵦ is $1 more than Alec’s deck:            (i)  Bₐ + Bᵦ = Dₐ + 1.

4.  Bearings versus wheels  
   Bₐ + Bᵦ is $24 less than the wheels’ total:      (ii) Bₐ + Bᵦ = 75 – 24 = 51.

   Combine (i) and (ii):  Dₐ + 1 = 51  ⇒  Dₐ = 50.

5.  Compare Alec’s and Brett’s decks and trucks  
   Alec’s deck is $5 more than Brett’s:             Dₐ = Dᵦ + 5 ⇒ Dᵦ = 45.  
   Brett’s trucks cost $5 more than Alec’s:         Tᵦ = Tₐ + 5.

6.  Brett’s bearings  
   Bᵦ is $3 more than twice Alec’s bearings:        Bᵦ = 2Bₐ + 3.

   With Bₐ + Bᵦ = 51:  
      Bₐ + (2Bₐ + 3) = 51 ⇒ 3Bₐ = 48 ⇒ Bₐ = 16.  
      Hence Bᵦ = 2·16 + 3 = 35.

7.  Trucks  
   Add up everything known and use the overall total $296:

   Decks: 50 + 45 = 95  
   Bearings: 51  
   Wheels: 75  

   So trucks together must be 296 – (95 + 51 + 75) = 296 – 221 = 75.

   With Tᵦ = Tₐ + 5:  
     Tₐ + Tₐ + 5 = 75 ⇒ 2Tₐ = 70 ⇒ Tₐ = 35, Tᵦ = 40.

8.  Individual pre-discount subtotals  
   Alec: 50 + 35 + 16 + 25 = 126  
   Brett: 45 + 40 + 35 + 25 = 145  
   Chris: 25

   Check: 126 + 145 + 25 = 296 (correct).

9.  Apply the 10 % discount to each boy’s share (everyone’s items are reduced by the same 10 %):

   Alec: 0.9 × 126 = $113.40  
   Brett: 0.9 × 145 = $130.50  
   Chris: 0.9 × 25  = $22.50  

   Sum: 113.40 + 130.50 + 22.50 = $266.40 (matches the amount paid).

The number of sanding machines limit the combination of chairs and tables to 1080=5c+20t.
Next graph these three lines. It should be expected that the answer will lie on the intersection of two of these lines or to make all chairs or all tables.

1.  Capacity inequalities  
   Saw:        10x + 5y ≤ 600       → 2x + y ≤ 120  
   Lathe:       5x + 5y ≤ 360       → x + y ≤ 72  
   Sander:      5x + 20y ≤ 1080   → x + 4y ≤ 216  
   Non-negativity:   x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0  

2.  Revenue to maximize  
   R = 10x + 20y = 10(x + 2y).  
   (Maximizing R is the same as maximizing x + 2y.)

3.  Corner points of the feasible region  

a) Intersection of 2x + y = 120 and x + y = 72:  
     x = 48, y = 24 (feasible)

b) Intersection of x + y = 72 and x + 4y = 216:  
     x = 24, y = 48 (feasible)

c) Intersection with axes  
     (60, 0), (0, 54)

4.  Evaluate revenue at the feasible corners  

(60, 0):   R = 10·60 + 20·0 = 600  
(0, 54):   R = 10·0  + 20·54 = 1080  
(48, 24):  R = 10·48 + 20·24 = 960  
(24, 48):  R = 10·24 + 20·48 = 1200  ← highest  

5.  Verification of resource use at (24, 48)

Saw:    10(24) + 5(48) = 480 ≤ 600  
Lathe:   5(24) + 5(48) = 360 = 360  
Sander:  5(24) + 20(48) = 1080 = 1080  
All capacities respected.

Therefore, producing 24 chairs and 48 tables each hour maximizes revenue.

218,"A man had a clock with an hour hand and a minute hand of the same length and indistinguishable. If the clock was set going at noon, what would be the first time that it would be impossible, by reason of the similarity of the hands, to be sure of the correct time?
In grappling with this little problem, you may assume that it is possible to indicate fractions of a second. On this assumption, an exact answer can be given.",The first time is after 1:00--note that either the minute hand is 12 times ahead or the minute hand has traveled 12 times more than the hour hand has between two hours,"The first time would be 5 and 5\143 minutes past 12, which might also indicate 60\143 minutes past 1. Expressed slightly less accurately, 5 minutes past 12 and about half a minute past 1.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let t be the number of minutes that have elapsed after 12 o’clock (noon).  
At that instant

 hour–hand angle from 12 o’clock = ½ t degrees,  
 minute–hand angle from 12 o’clock = 6 t degrees.

Suppose the two hands are indistinguishable.  An observer will be uncertain as soon as there exists another instant, say t′ minutes after noon (t′≠t), whose two hands occupy exactly the same pair of positions but interchanged.  In symbols we require

 6 t′ ≡ ½ t (mod 360)                             (1)  
 ½ t′ ≡ 6 t (mod 360).                            (2)

Multiply (1) and (2) by 2 to clear the fraction:

 12 t′ ≡ t (mod 720)                              (1′)  
 t′ ≡ 12 t (mod 720).                             (2′)

Hence there are integers k and ℓ such that  

 12 t′ − t = 720 k,                                (3)  
 t′ − 12 t = 720 ℓ.                                (4)

Solve (3) for t: t = 12 t′ − 720 k,  
substitute in (4):

 t′ − 12(12 t′ − 720 k) = 720 ℓ  
 t′ − 144 t′ + 8640 k = 720 ℓ  
 −143 t′ + 8640 k = 720 ℓ.

Therefore

 t′ = (720 ℓ − 8640 k)/143,                       (5)  
 t  = 12 t′ − 720 k = (8640 ℓ − 520 k)/143.      (6)

Because we are looking for the first (smallest positive) time after noon,
0 < t < 720 and 0 < t′ < 720 must hold.

Inequality (5) requires

 720 ℓ − 8640 k > 0 ⇒ k < ℓ/12.                  (7)

For ℓ = 1 the right–hand side of (7) is 1/12, so the only admissible integer k is 0.  
With ℓ = 1, k = 0 formulae (5)–(6) give

 t′ = 720/143  minutes, t = 8640/143  minutes.

Now check that no smaller t is possible.  
If 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ 11, condition (7) still forces k = 0, making t = 8640ℓ/143 ≥ 8640/143.  
For ℓ ≥ 12 one may take k = ⌊ℓ/12⌋ ≥ 1, but then

 t = (8640 ℓ − 520 k)/143 > (8640·12 − 520·1)/143 = 100, 

 which is certainly larger than 8640/143 ≈ 60.42.  
Hence  t = 8640/143 minutes is the least positive solution.

So the first ambiguous instant is

 t = 8640/143 minutes = 60 minutes + 60/143 minutes  
   = 1 hour + (60/143) minute  
   = 1 hour 0 minutes + (60/143)·60 s

At that moment the alternative interpretation would be the time

 t′ = 720/143 minutes = 5 minutes + 5/143 minutes

Therefore the very first instant after noon at which the clock cannot be read with certainty (because either of the two above times fits the identical configuration of the two indistinguishable hands) is exactly

Suppose each artist can paint at a constant rate of R paintings per hour.  
Then, for any job,

(number of paintings) = (number of artists) · (hours worked) · R.

Step 1.  Determine R from the given data.  
Two-and-a-half artists work for two-and-a-half hours and complete two-and-a-half paintings:

(5/2 artists) · (5/2 hours) · R = 5/2 paintings.

Solve for R:

(25/4) · R = 5/2  
R = (5/2) ÷ (25/4) = (5/2) · (4/25) = 2/5.

Thus each artist paints R = 2/5 painting per hour.

Step 2.  Find the number of artists A needed for the new job.  
We must finish 24 paintings in 20 hours:

A · 20 hours · (2/5 painting/hour) = 24 paintings  
A · 8 = 24  
A = 24 ÷ 8 = 3.

Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.","TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches
Tree height from eye level = TAN (25.80 deg) * 2460 inches = 1189 inches
Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.  With the measurement capabilities available to any lumberjack (or any average Homer) precise measurements are not possible.  Thus the need to clarify these calculations as estimates.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the ground be the x-axis, the fence be at x = 0, positive x pointing toward the tree.

Known data  
• Homer’s eyes (point E) are 67 in = 67/12 ft = 5 ft 7 in = 5.583 ft above the ground.  
• Homer stands 5 ft in front of the fence  ⇒  x(E) = –5 ft.  
• The top of the fence (point F) is 8 ft above the ground at x = 0.  
• The trunk of the tree is 200 ft beyond the fence  ⇒  x(T) = 200 ft.  
• Homer can “just see” the top leaves, so E, F and the top of the tree T are collinear.

1.  Compute the slope of line EF  
   slope m = (y(F) – y(E)) / (x(F) – x(E))  
           = (8 ft – 5.583 ft) / (0 – (–5) ft)

           = 0.4833.

2.  Use the same slope for FT  
   m = (y(T) – y(F)) / (x(T) – x(F)).

   Therefore  
   0.4833 = (y(T) – 8 ft) / 200 ft

all be written in ordinary decimal notation (no leading zeros).  
The condition of the problem is that every number in (1) contains exactly the same six
digits as N itself – nothing new ever appears.  
Such a number is said to be cyclic.

Step 1.  A necessary divisibility property  
For every m∈{2,3,4,5,6} the number mN has the same digit–sum as N, because it
contains exactly the same digits.  
If s is that digit–sum, then

s ≡  (digit-sum of mN)  ≡  (digit-sum of m)·(digit-sum of N)  ≡  m·s   (mod 9).

Hence (m−1)s ≡ 0 (mod 9) for m=2,3,4,5,6.
Because gcd(1,2,3,4,5)=1, we must have s ≡ 0 (mod 9); therefore N is a multiple of 9.

Step 2.  N cannot exceed 166 666  
If 2N were seven digits long, its leading digit would be 1, and the digit 1 would have to be
present in N.  But 2N would then have seven digits while N has only six,
so 2N would necessarily contain one more occurrence of the digit 1 than N does,
contradicting the hypothesis.  Hence 2N is still six digits, so 2N ≤ 999 999 and
N ≤ 499 999.  Repeating the same argument with 6N forces N ≤ 999 999 / 6 = 166 666.

Because of (2) we have 7N < 1 166 662 < 10^7, so 7N has at most seven digits.
Now pair the multiples in (1) as (2N,5N) and (3N,4N).
Each pair contains the same two sets of digits; adding within a pair cannot create a new
digit other than 9 (the only possible carry).  Hence

2N + 5N = 7N and 3N + 4N = 7N

are both made entirely of the digit 9.  Thus 7N is a repdigit consisting only of 9’s
and having at most seven digits.  The only such numbers are 9, 99, 999, … , 999 999.
Because N is six–digit, 7N must be 999 999 and therefore

N = 999 999 / 7 = 142 857.                                  (3)

Step 4.  Verification  
Compute the five required products:

2·142 857 = 285 714  
3·142 857 = 428 571  
4·142 857 = 571 428  
5·142 857 = 714 285  
6·142 857 = 857 142.

Every one of them is a permutation of the six digits 1,4,2,8,5,7 that form N, and no
other digit appears.  Hence N satisfies the condition.

Step 5.  Uniqueness  
Equation (3) shows that any solution must equal 999 999/7; therefore the number we have
found is the only possible one.

Consequently, the unique six–digit integer whose first six multiples introduce no new
digits is

Instead of expanding (1) outright, work column by column with carries.

Let c₁, c₂, c₃ be the successive carries when ABCD is multiplied by 4.

1.  Work from (5).  Because A ≥ 1, 4A ≥ 4, hence D ≥ 4.

   D  4  5  6  7  8  9  
   4D 16 20 24 28 32 36  
   A   6  0  4  8  2  6  
   c₁  1  2  2  2  3  3

   A must be non-zero, so D = 5 is impossible.  
   Now apply (5):  D = 4A + c₃ (with c₃ ≤ 3).

   • (D,A) = (4,6): 4·6 + c₃ = 4 ⇒ impossible  
   • (6,4): 4·4 + c₃ = 6 ⇒ impossible  
   • (7,8): 4·8 + c₃ = 7 ⇒ impossible  
   • (8,2): 4·2 + c₃ = 8 ⇒ c₃ = 0  ✓  
   • (9,6): 4·6 + c₃ = 9 ⇒ impossible

   Thus the only consistent pair is A = 2, D = 8 with c₃ = 0 and c₁ = 3.

2.  Determine B and C from (3) and (4) with c₁ = 3, c₃ = 0.

   From (4): C = 4B + c₂  (because c₃ = 0 and C < 10)        (4′)

   Since 4B + c₂ < 10, the possibilities are B = 0,1,2.

   • B = 0 ⇒ C = c₂.  Plugging into (3): 4C + 3 = 10c₂  
     gives 4c₂ + 3 = 10c₂ → c₂ = ½, impossible.

   • B = 1 ⇒ C = 4 + c₂, so C is 4,5,6,7 according as c₂ is 0,1,2,3.  
     Put into (3): 4(4 + c₂) + 3 = 10c₂ + 1  
     ⇒ 19 + 4c₂ = 10c₂ + 1 ⇒ 18 = 6c₂ ⇒ c₂ = 3.  
     Then C = 4 + 3 = 7, admissible.

   • B = 2 cannot work because 4·2 = 8 already; adding any carry would make C ≥ 10.

   Therefore B = 1, C = 7, c₂ = 3.

3.  Verify all columns:

231,What is the smallest integer greater than 0 that can be written entirely with zeros and ones and is evenly divisible by 225?,,"The prime factorization of 225 is 5*5*3*3. So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.
All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"For a decimal integer to be divisible by 225 it must be divisible by both 25 and 9 (because 225 = 25·9 and 25 and 9 are coprime).

1. Divisibility by 25 when only the digits 0 and 1 are allowed.  
   The only possible endings that are multiples of 25 are 00, 25, 50, 75; among these, the only one using just 0’s and 1’s is 00.  
   Hence any desired number must end in the two-digit block 00.

2. Divisibility by 9.  
   A number is divisible by 9 iff the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  
   Since the last two digits are 0’s, they contribute nothing to the digit sum.  
   All other digits are 0 or 1, so the digit sum equals the count of 1’s.  
   Therefore the count of 1’s must itself be a multiple of 9: 9, 18, 27, …

3. Searching for the smallest possible length.  
   Let the total number of digits be n.  
   The final two digits are fixed as 00, so the first n − 2 digits supply the 1’s.  
   We need n − 2 ≥ 9 to be able to place at least 9 ones.  
   The smallest such n is 11.

4. Constructing the 11-digit candidate.  
   With n = 11 there are exactly 9 available places before the trailing 00, so all nine of them must be 1’s; no zeros can be inserted without exceeding the minimum length.  
   Hence the unique 11-digit number that satisfies the conditions is

        11111111100.

5. Verification.  
   • Ends in 00  ⇒  divisible by 25.  
   • Digit sum = 9·1 = 9  ⇒  divisible by 9.  
   • Therefore it is divisible by 225.

6. Minimality.  
   Any number with fewer than 11 digits has at most 8 positions before the compulsory 00, so it can contain at most 8 ones, giving a digit sum < 9; thus it cannot be divisible by 9 and hence not by 225.  
   Consequently no shorter (and therefore no smaller) number can meet the requirements.

Thus the smallest positive integer written solely with the digits 0 and 1 and divisible by 225 is

All digits are taken from {1,2,…,9}, are distinct, and among them exactly two are prime, two are perfect squares, and one is neither.

Step 1.  Possible values of d₅.  
Because d₁ = d₅ + 3 ≤ 9, we must have d₅ ≤ 6.  
Because d₃ = 2d₅ ≤ 9, we must have d₅ ≤ 4.

For example, 192 is one of them because 192, 384, 576 contain 1 to 9 each once. 273 is another one of them because 273, 546, 819 contain 1 to 9 each once.

Just swap 19 and 2, swap 27 and 3, and you'll get them.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

n = 100a + 10b + c      (a, b, c are the hundreds, tens and units digits of n).

The three numbers that have to use the nine digits 1,…,9 exactly once are

n , 2n , 3n .

1.  A first necessary condition  
   The sum of the digits 1,…,9 equals 45, a multiple of 9.  
   Hence the digital sum of n+2n+3n = 6n is a multiple of 9, so n itself is a multiple of 3.  
   Consequently c∈{0,3,6,9}.  Zero is forbidden and c = 3 and c = 6 are the only possibilities
   that keep c, 2c and 3c all non–zero.  Therefore every solution must have c = 3 or c = 6.  
   (Indeed the two already known solutions 192 and 273 both have c ≡ 0 (mod 3).)

   More precise information is gained by looking at the units digit alone:

            c : 2c : 3c   (units digits)
            1   2    3
            2   4    6
            3   6    9
            4   8    2
            6   2    8
            7   4    1
            8   6    4
            9   8    7

   The digit 5 is impossible (because 2·5 ends in 0), so c∈{1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9}.  
   The table also shows any carry produced by doubling or tripling c:

        c  carry in 2n  carry in 3n
        1      0             0
        2      0             0
        3      0             0
        4      0             1
        6      1             1
        7      1             2
        8      1             2
        9      1             2

2.  Elimination of most final digits

   •  c = 1  
     Then a ≥ 4 is required (otherwise 3n would have a four-digit result).  
     But a is the hundreds digit of n and must be 1,2 or 3 (because 3n ≤ 987).  
     Impossible ⇒ c ≠ 1.

   •  c = 2  
     Units digits would be 2,4,6, so digits 2 and 4 repeat in the hundreds positions
     (they cannot, because every digit is unique).  ⇒ no solution.

   •  c = 4  
     Tripling produces a carry (=1) so the tens digit of 3n is at least 1.
     A careful case–by–case check (a = 1 or 3 and every possible b) shows that a zero or a repeated digit
     always appears.  ⇒ no solution.

   •  c = 6  
     Carries 1 and 1 are produced.  Trying a = 1 (b = 3,4,5,7,9) or a = 3 (b = 1,2)
     always forces a repeated digit.  ⇒ no solution.

   •  c = 8  
     Carries 1 and 2 are produced.  For a = 1,2,3 every choice of b again introduces 0 or a repetition.
     ⇒ no solution.

   At this point only c = 3, 7, 9 remain possible.  
   c = 3 already gives the known solution 273.

3.  The case c = 7  
   Units digits will be 7 (n), 4 (2n), 1 (3n) with carries 1 and 2.

   –  Let a = 2 (n = 2b7).  
     Trying b = 3,5,6,8,9 gives numbers 237,257,267,287,297.  
     One checks that each time either a digit repeats or the digit 0 appears in 2n or 3n.  
     So no solution with a = 2.

   –  Let a = 3 and remember that n has to stay below 330.  
     Hence b may only be 1 or 2.

        b = 1  →  n = 317,  2n = 634, 3n = 951  (digit 1 repeats)  
        b = 2  →  n = 327,  2n = 654, 3n = 981

     For n = 327 the nine digits are

        3 2 7   6 5 4   9 8 1

     each exactly once.  Therefore 327 is a valid number.

4.  The case c = 9  
   Units digits will be 9 (n), 8 (2n), 7 (3n) with carries 1 and 2.

   –  a = 1 gives n = 1b9 with b = 2,3,4,5,6.  
     In every trial a repetition occurs.

   –  a = 2 gives n = 2b9, b∈{1,3,4,5,6}.  Try them:

        b = 1 → n = 219, 2n = 438, 3n = 657  
                The nine digits are 2 1 9 4 3 8 6 5 7 – all different – so 219 works.

        b = 3,4,5,6 all introduce a duplicate digit.

   –  a = 3 is impossible because n would exceed 329.

   Consequently the only solution for c = 9 is 219.

5.  Conclusion

   The four three-digit numbers whose single, double and triple together contain each of the
   digits 1 to 9 exactly once are

        192, 219, 273, 327.

• Clock F (fast): gains 1 min every real hour ⇒ it advances 61 min in each real hour.  
• Clock S (slow): loses 2 min every real hour ⇒ it advances 58 min in each real hour.  

(An ordinary analogue dial repeats every 12 h = 720 min.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Time until the two clocks next show the same reading
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The displayed times differ by

(61 t min) – (58 t min) = 3 t min.

They will look the same again when this difference is an exact multiple of one full dial revolution (720 min):

3 t = 720 k, k∈ℤ, k≥1.

Smallest positive k is 1, giving  
t = 720 / 3 = 240 h.

240 h = 10 days.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Time until both clocks are simultaneously correct
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For a clock to be “correct”, its error must be an integer multiple of 12 h (720 min).

Fast clock: error = +t min.  
t ≡ 0 (mod 720)  ⇒ t = 720 h, 1440 h, …  
Smallest positive: 720 h = 30 days.

Slow clock: error = –2 t min.  
–2 t ≡ 0 (mod 720)  ⇒ 2 t ≡ 0 (mod 720)  ⇒ t ≡ 0 (mod 360)  
Smallest positive: 360 h = 15 days.

Simultaneous correctness requires a common multiple of 15 days (slow clock’s period) and 30 days (fast clock’s period).  
The least common multiple is 30 days = 720 h.

Hence the first occasion after the start when both are correct is after 30 days, i.e. at 00:00 on Tuesday 30 January.

2.  Smallest and largest pair–sums

3.  Sum of all ten pair–sums  
        (a+b)+(a+c)+⋯+(d+e) = 80+82+83+84+85+86+87+88+90+91 = 856.

   Each individual weight appears in exactly four of the ten pairs, so  

        4(a+b+c+d+e) = 856  ⇒ a+b+c+d+e = 214.

4.  Thus  
        c = 214 − (a+b) − (d+e) = 214 − 80 − 91 = 43.

   Only (iii) works.

Therefore the bale weights are

The second option was for an immediate 10% raise to 11,000 wonks annually, with an additional 10% raise every year. Manic Martin's salary, based upon his current annual, was paid bi-weekly.

2.  Since it is a perfect square greater than 1, it can never be prime; it is always a composite number (it has at least the divisors 1, its square root, and itself).

• “The number is a perfect square.”  
• “Consequently, the number is not prime (it is composite).”

100 measures of corn must be divided among 5 workers, so that the second worker gets as many measures more than the first worker, as the third gets more than the second, the fourth more than the third and the fifth more than the fourth. The first two workers shall get seven times less measures of corn than the three others.
How many measures of corn shall each worker get?",You can set up a system of equations using the corn for the first worker and the difference in corn between worker i and worker i + 1,"2 equations give a clear answer to the given question:
5w + 10d = 100
7*(2w + d) = 3w + 9d
Where w is amount of corn for the first worker, d is the difference (amount of corn) between two consecutive workers. So this is the solution:
1st worker = 10/6 measures of corn
2nd worker = 65/6 measures of corn
3rd worker = 120/6 (20) measures of corn
4th worker = 175/6 measures of corn
5th worker = 230/6 measures of corn",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the numbers of measures received by the 1st, 2nd, … , 5th worker form an arithmetic progression

   a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) + (a+4d) = 100

2.  “The first two workers shall get seven times less than the three others”, i.e.  
   (a + a + d) · 7 = (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) + (a + 4d).

   Hence 7(2a + d) = 3a + 9d, i.e.  
   14a + 7d = 3a + 9d  
   ⇒ 11a = 2d  
   ⇒ d = 11a/2.  (2)

3.  Substitute (2) into (1):

   5a + 10·(11a/2) = 100  
   5a + 55a = 100  
   60a = 100  
   a = 5/3.

   Then d = 11a/2 = 11·(5/3)/2 = 55/6.

4.  The five shares are

   1st: a = 5/3 = 1 ⅔,  
   2nd: a + d = 5/3 + 55/6 = 65/6 = 10 ⅚,  
   3rd: a + 2d = 5/3 + 2·55/6 = 60/3 = 20,

   5th: a + 4d = 5/3 + 4·55/6 = 115/3 = 38 ⅓.

   Check:

 (O₅,I₅) = (5, 8)  
 (O₆,I₆) = (6, 7).

247,"The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?","Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74
Lemp 47 94
Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Number of people who got in at the six stations - Number of people who got out at the six stations) =

 di  = number of passengers who get down at the i-th station

2. d1 , d2 , … , d6 are prime and lie in the intervals  
  0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 30–40, 40–50, 50–60 respectively.  

3. |ui+1 – ui|  ≥ 20  for consecutive stations.  
  Because ui = 2di this is equivalent to |di+1 – di| ≥ 10.     (★)

4. d1 + d2 + … + d6 is even.  

5. After the stop at Rudolf the train contains 227 passengers.  

Let P0 be the number of passengers on the train just before it reached Maver – this
is the quantity to be found.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1  –  The first prime d1

All primes except 2 are odd.  
If d1 were 2, the sum d1+…+d6 would be 2 (even) plus five odd primes – an odd
total, contradicting condition 4.
Hence d1 is odd; so d1 ∈ {3,5,7}.  
Thus there are six odd primes altogether, and their sum is indeed even.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2  –  Consecutive differences of at least 10

Because of (★) we insist on a gap of ≥10 between consecutive di.
Check each possible value of d1.

• d1 = 3  
 d2 must be a prime between 10 and 20 and at distance ≥10 from 3, i.e.  
 d2 ∈ {13,17,19}.   

 – If d2 = 13, then d3 (prime in 20–30) must be ≥10 away from 13, so d3 = 23 or 29.  
   • d3 = 23 forces d4 (prime in 30–40) to be ≥10 away from 23, i.e. d4 = 37.  
    Now d5 (prime in 40–50) has to be ≥10 away from 37, whence d5 = 47.  
    Finally d6 (prime in 50–60) must be ≥10 away from 47, so d6 = 59.  
    Sequence obtained: 3 , 13 , 23 , 37 , 47 , 59.  It satisfies every condition.

   • d3 = 29 does not work, because the nearest primes in 30–40 are 31 and 37,
    both less than 10 away from 29.  

 – If d2 = 17 or 19 one soon meets the same blockage: the next admissible prime is
  29, but 29 is <10 away from 31 and 37, so no value for d4 exists.  
 Thus the only admissible continuation of d1 = 3 is the sequence already found.

• d1 = 5 or d1 = 7  
 The argument just given for d1 = 3, applied mutatis mutandis, shows that the
 construction stops at the fourth station – no value of d4 is ≥10 away from the
 candidate d3.  Therefore no sequence starts with 5 or 7.

Hence the unique sequence of numbers getting down is

 (d1 , d2 , d3 , d4 , d5 , d6) = (3 , 13 , 23 , 37 , 47 , 59).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3  –  The numbers getting on

ui = 2di gives  

u1 = 6 , u2 = 26 , u3 = 46 , u4 = 74 , u5 = 94 , u6 = 118,

and the differences 20,20,28,20,24 are indeed all at least 20.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4  –  Passenger totals from station to station

Let Pi be the number of passengers on the train after the stop at the i-th station
(P0 is before Maver).

Because ui = 2di, at station i the train gains Di = ui – di = di passengers, so

 Pi = Pi-1 + di  for every i.                                (1)

Adding up (1) successively,

 P6 = P0 + (d1+d2+d3+d4+d5+d6).

But we know
 d1+…+d6 = 3+13+23+37+47+59 = 182  
and, after the Rudolf stop, P6 = 227 (condition 5).

Therefore

 P0 = 227 – 182 = 45.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5  –  Verification

Working forward from P0 = 45:

Before Maver : 45  
 3 down, 6 up ⇒ 48  
Before Willow : 48  
 13 down, 26 up ⇒ 61  
Before Wonderland : 61  
 23 down, 46 up ⇒ 84  
Before Doku : 84  
 37 down, 74 up ⇒ 121  
Before Lemp : 121  
 47 down, 94 up ⇒ 168  
Before Rudolf : 168  
 59 down, 118 up ⇒ 227

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:

   9k = 10 588 235 294 117 646 has 17 digits.  
   Thus for d₁ = 1,…,8 the product k·d₁ has 16 digits; for d₁ = 9 it has 17 digits.

5.  Minimality.  
   Equation (5) gives exactly one candidate for each possible first digit d₁.  
   The smallest arises when d₁ = 1:

   N = 1 176 470 588 235 294.                (6)

6.  Verification.  
   Rotate N one place left:

   1 176 470 588 235 294  →  176 470 588 235 2941.

   Compute 1.5 N:

   1.5 × 1 176 470 588 235 294  
   = 1 764 705 882 352 941.

   The two results are identical, confirming that N satisfies the requirement.

Since d₁ cannot be 0, no smaller positive integer is possible, and the hint specified there are 16 digits, so (6) is indeed the smallest.

24 – 16 = 8  
8 – 8 = 0  

So 9304 = 1001000110000₂.

For this binary string  
L = 14 (bits from 2¹³ down to 2⁰)

5,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Ralph was impressed by the ingenuity of Rex's last attempt using clues involving prime numbers, but he thinks he's got an even better one for Rex. He tells Rex he's thinking of a 6-digit number.

Ralph then asks, ""If each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs in the number is prime, then what is the number?""
Rex looks confused, and for a moment Ralph thinks he's finally gotten him. Then Rex smiles, scribbles a few things down on a pad of paper and then says, ""Very nice, Ralph!""
Rex then tells Ralph his number.

Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the right gives 905678.","416723
Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let

The only prime possibilities for EF are 13, 17, 19.

 No prime CD uses two different digits whose sum is 5.  
• EF = 17 → F = 7 ⇒ C + D = 1 (impossible)

6,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

n = number of sides of both the lot and of the house (they are “matching” regular polygons),  
L = length of one side of the lot,  
r = in-radius of the house (distance from the centre to a side),  
R = circum-radius of the house (radius of the circular foundation),  
ρ = in-radius of the lot,  
P = circum-radius of the lot.

1.  The length of fence that was actually built  

        (n – 1) L = 400   ⇒  L = 400 /(n – 1).          (1)

2.  “The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the
    diameter of the foundation.”  
    Hence the gap between the circular foundation (radius R) and the boundary of the lot is 2R, so  

        ρ – R = 2R  ⇒  ρ = 3R.                         (2)

3.  In a regular n-gon  
        in–radius = side/(2 tan(π/n)),    
        circum–radius = side/(2 sin(π/n)).

    Therefore, for the lot and the house respectively,

        ρ = L /(2 tan θ),     r = s /(2 tan θ),   R = s /(2 sin θ) , θ = π/n.      (3)

    Because the house is inscribed in the circular foundation, r = R cos θ.      (4)

4.  The irrigation pipe is a straight segment that (i) passes through the centre
    (because it bisects the area) and (ii) ends on two sides of the house.
    For a central line that meets a pair of parallel sides its length is

        pipe-length = 2r /cos α,                                   (5)

    where α is the angle between the line and the inward normal of the sides.

    Ralph found that the pipe length equals a lot-side, i.e.

        2r /cos α = L.                                            (6)

5.  Putting (2), (3) and (4) into (6):

        2(ρ cos θ/3) /cos α = L
        ⇒ (2/3) [ρ cos θ]/cos α = L
        ⇒ (2/3) [ L cos^2θ /(2 sin θ)] /cos α = L   (using ρ from (3))
        ⇒ cos α = (1/3) · (cos^2θ / sin θ).                       (7)

    We must have |cos α| ≤ 1, so

        cos^2θ / sin θ ≤ 3.                                       (8)

    Writing s = sin θ, (8) becomes 1 − s² ≤ 3s, i.e.

        s² + 3s − 1 ≥ 0  ⇒  s ≥ (√13 − 3)/2 ≈ 0.3028.            (9)

    Hence θ ≥ arcsin 0.3028 ≈ 17.6°, which gives n ≤ 10.28.

    Furthermore the pipe must be no longer than the diameter of the house:
        2r /cos α ≤ 2R  ⇒  tan θ ≤ 1/3.                           (10)

    tan θ falls below 1/3 for the first time at θ = 18° (n = 10).
    For n = 8 the inequality (10) already fails, so the only possible integral n is

        n = 10.                                                   (11)

    Thus the lot and the house are regular decagons.

6.  Numerical dimensions for the decagon.

    θ = π/10 = 18°, sin θ = 0.309017, cos θ = 0.951057, tan θ = 0.324920.

    From (1):  L = 400 /(10 − 1) = 400/9 = 44.444 ft.

    From (3):  lot in-radius ρ = L /(2 tan θ) = 44.444 /(0.649840) = 71.960 ft  
                 lot circum-radius P = ρ /cos θ = 75.641 ft.

    From (2):  foundation (house circum-radius) R = ρ/3 = 23.987 ft.  
    From (4):  house in-radius r = R cos θ = 22.825 ft.

7.  Floor areas.

    (a)  One storey of the house (a regular decagon of radius R):

         A₁ = (n/2) R² sin(2π/n)  
             = 5 R² sin 36°  
             = 5(23.987)²(0.587785) = 1 527 ft² (to the nearest foot).

    (b)  The central atrium.  
         The longest dimension of the lot is 2P = 151.28 ft;  
         atrium diameter = 0.1 × 2P = 15.128 ft, so atrium radius = 7.564 ft,  

         A_atrium = π(7.564)² = 179 ft².

    The ground floor contains the whole decagon, the upper floor is the decagon
    minus the atrium void.

         Total square footage
             = A₁  +  (A₁ − A_atrium)
             = 2A₁ − A_atrium
             ≈ 2(1 527) − 179

Hence Rex could work out immediately that the house had to be a
regular decagon and, from that, compute its exact area.

above is 2 893 ft².",True,0,0
7,Find the radius of the inscribed and circumscribed circles for a triangle.,Try to use the area of the triangle,"Let a, b, and c be the sides of the triangle. Let s be the semiperimeter, i.e. s = (a + b + c) / 2. Let A be the area of the triangle, and let x be the radius of the incircle.
Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.
We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).
The radius of the circumscribed circle is given by R = abc/4A.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the triangle have side–lengths  

a = BC , b = CA , c = AB  

semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2  

and area Δ.

1.  Radius r of the inscribed circle (incircle)

Each side of the triangle is tangent to the incircle, so the circle’s radius r is the common altitude to the three small triangles into which the incircle divides the big triangle.  
Hence the whole area equals the sum of the areas of those three right triangles:

Δ = (1/2)·a·r + (1/2)·b·r + (1/2)·c·r  
  = (r/2)(a + b + c)  
  = r·s.

Therefore r = Δ / s = 2Δ / (a + b + c).

2.  Radius R of the circumscribed circle (circumcircle)

By the Law of Sines, for any angle A opposite side a,

a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C = 2R.

Choose one of the three expressions for the area expressed with two sides and the included angle, e.g.

Δ = (1/2) bc sin A.

Replace sin A with a / (2R):

Δ = (1/2)·b·c·(a / 2R) = abc / (4R).

Solving for R gives

R = abc / (4Δ).

Incircle radius r = 2Δ / (a + b + c).  
Circumcircle radius R = abc / (4Δ).",True,1,0
9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?",The sum cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes. Think about what information is provided by each character knowing and/or not knowing the numbers.,"The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the two integers (each larger than 1) be  
x ≤ y ,

S = x + y (the sum whispered to Sachin) and  
P = x y (the product whispered to Prashant).

All four people – and we, the reader – hear only the subsequent dialogue.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
1.  Sachin :  “Prashant, I don’t think that we know the numbers.”
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

(a)  Sachin certainly does not know the pair, so S must be representable in more than one way as a sum of two integers > 1.  

(b)  More importantly, he is SURE that Prashant cannot yet know the pair.  
      Prashant could know the pair immediately only when the product he hears has exactly one unordered factor-pair (p, q) with p, q > 1.  
      That happens precisely when P is a semiprime (product of two primes, possibly equal), e.g. 6 = 2·3, 9 = 3·3, 15 = 3·5, …  

      Therefore, for every decomposition S = a + b  (a, b > 1) the corresponding product a b must possess at least two different unordered factor-pairs > 1.  In particular S cannot be the sum of two primes (for if a and b were both prime, a b would be a semiprime and Prashant could have known the pair).  

      So S has the property

         (A)  “Every product belonging to a decomposition of S has ≥2 factor pairs; equivalently, S is NOT the sum of two primes.”

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
2.  Prashant :  “Aha!  Now I know the numbers.”
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Before hearing Sachin, Prashant only knows P, and at least two factor-pairs of P exist (or he would already have known the numbers).  
After hearing that S satisfies (A), he can delete from the list of factor-pairs (u, v) of P those whose sums violate (A).  If exactly one factor-pair survives this deletion, Prashant now knows the pair.  Thus

         (B)  “Among all factor-pairs of P, there is exactly one whose sum has property (A).”

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
3.  Sachin :  “Oh, now I also know the numbers.”
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Sachin, who knows S, now knows that Prashant’s product enjoys property (B).  
If S could be written in two different ways S = c + d and S = e + f with both corresponding products satisfying (B), Sachin still could not decide which product (and hence which pair) Prashant had heard.  
Hence

         (C)  “For the particular sum S there is exactly one decomposition S = x + y whose product fulfils (B).”

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
4.  Nakul :  “Now I also know the numbers.”
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Nakul has heard only the public dialogue.  Properties (A), (B) and (C) together must single out one single pair (x, y); otherwise Nakul could not be certain.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Finding the unique pair
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Start with the smallest sums obeying (A).  
The first odd sums (because an even sum could be 2 + even-prime) that are NOT sums of two primes are

11, 17, 23, 27, 29, …  

•  Sum = 11 : possible pairs (2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6).  
   Their products are 18, 24, 28, 30.  
   Each of 18, 24, 28 has exactly one factor-pair whose sum obeys (A), so Prashant would have been unable to single out the correct one; statement (B) would fail.  
   Therefore S ≠ 11.

•  Sum = 17 : possible pairs

      (2,15) P=30  
      (3,14) P=42  
      (4,13) P=52  
      (5,12) P=60  
      (6,11) P=66  
      (7,10) P=70  
      (8, 9) P=72.  

   Test (B) for each product:

   –  P=30 : factor-pairs (2,15) (sum 17, obeys A), (3,10) (13, violates A), (5,6) (11, obeys A) → two admissible sums ⇒ fails (B).  
   –  P=42 : admissible sums 17 and 23 ⇒ fails (B).  
   –  P=52 : factor-pairs (2,26) (sum 28, violates A), (4,13) (17, obeys A) → exactly one admissible sum ⇒ satisfies (B).  
   –  P=60 : admissible sums 17 and 23 ⇒ fails (B).  
   –  P=66 : admissible sums 17 and 35 ⇒ fails (B).  
   –  P=70 : admissible sums 17 and 37 ⇒ fails (B).  
   –  P=72 : admissible sums 17 and 27 ⇒ fails (B).

   Hence, for S = 17 only the decomposition (4, 13) survives condition (B).

Because exactly one decomposition of 17 meets (B), property (C) is met, so Sachin can indeed deduce the pair after hearing Prashant.

Finally, anyone who has followed the same public reasoning (including Nakul) sees that the sole pair compatible with (A), (B) and (C) is

          x = 4 and y = 13.

No other sum works, so Nakul also becomes certain.

Therefore all four mathematicians – and we – have arrived at the same conclusion.

10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

 S₁  = number of sound (good) coconuts in the common pile before anyone wakes up.  
 S₂ , S₃ , S₄ , S₅  = numbers left in the pile after the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th midnight visits,  
 S₆  = number seen in the morning.

What actually happens during a midnight visit  
(the four rotten coconuts are only “counters’’ and are discarded every time, so they never affect
the amount of good fruit that remains) is

 • one good coconut is tossed to the monkey;  
 • the visiting sailor removes one fifth of what is left;  
 • the remaining four fifths are shoved back into one pile.

Thus, for every midnight visit

 S_{k+1}= (4/5)(S_k − 1), k = 1,2,3,4.  (1)

During the morning division nothing is given to the monkey, so S₆ must be divisible by 5:

 S₆ = 5m  for some positive integer m.  (2)

Work backwards.

4th night (put k = 5 in (1)) :

 S₆ = (4/5)(S₅ − 1)  ⇒  5m = (4/5)(S₅ − 1)
             ⇒  S₅ − 1 = 25m/4.

25 and 4 are coprime, hence m must be a multiple of 4.
Write m = 4n₁.  Then

 S₅ = 25n₁ + 1.  (3)

3rd night :

 S₅ = (4/5)(S₄ − 1) ⇒ S₄ − 1 = (5/4)S₅
            = (5/4)(25n₁ + 1) = (125n₁ + 5)/4,
 so S₄ = (125n₁ + 9)/4.  

For S₄ to be an integer we need 125n₁ + 9 ≡ 0 (mod 4).
Since 125 ≡ 1 (mod 4), this means n₁ ≡ 3 (mod 4).  
Put n₁ = 3 + 4n₂.  Then

 S₄ = 96 + 125n₂.  (4)

2nd night :

 S₄ = (4/5)(S₃ − 1) ⇒ S₃ − 1 = (5/4)S₄
            = (5/4)(96 + 125n₂)
            = 120 + 625n₂/4,
 so S₃ = 121 + 625n₂/4.

Hence 625n₂ must be divisible by 4, and because 625 ≡ 1 (mod 4),
n₂ must be a multiple of 4:  n₂ = 4n₃.  Then

 S₃ = 121 + 625n₃.  (5)

1st night :

 S₃ = (4/5)(S₂ − 1) ⇒ S₂ − 1 = (5/4)S₃

            = (605 + 3125n₃)/4,
 so S₂ = 1 + (605 + 3125n₃)/4 = (609 + 3125n₃)/4.

Since 3125 ≡ 1 (mod 4) we need 609 + n₃ ≡ 0 (mod 4), i.e.
n₃ ≡ 3 (mod 4).  Write n₃ = 3 + 4n₄.  Then

 S₂ = (609 + 3125·(3 + 4n₄))/4 = (9984 + 12500n₄)/4
   = 2496 + 3125n₄.  (6)

Earliest possible value (least positive integer) is obtained by taking
n₄ = 0 :

 S₁ = 2496.  (7)

Verification (no rotten coconuts are counted, they are only temporary aids):

• Start with 2496.  
• First sailor: 2496 = 5·499 + 1.  
 Monkey gets 1, sailor hides 499, 2496 → 1996.  
• Second sailor: 1996 = 5·399 + 1.  
 Monkey gets 1, sailor hides 399, 1996 → 1596.  
• Third sailor: 1596 = 5·319 + 1.  
 Monkey gets 1, sailor hides 319, 1596 → 1276.  
• Fourth sailor: 1276 = 5·255 + 1.  
 Monkey gets 1, sailor hides 255, 1276 → 1020.  
• Morning: 1020 = 5·204, divides evenly, no remainder.

Everything matches the story, so 2496 is indeed the least possible
number of good coconuts originally in the pile.

11,What is the only non-palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome?,A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward as it does backward.  An example would be 1221. An integer is a number that has no decimal places.  A cube is the result of multiplying a number by itself three times.,"2201
2201^3 = 10662526601",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let n be a positive integer which is not a palindrome (so it contains at least two digits) and whose cube

          n³ = P

is a decimal palindrome.  
We shall prove that the unique such n is

          n = 2201.

Throughout the proof we use three elementary facts.

   (F1)  If a number ends with the digit r, its cube ends with the digit shown in the
         table

              r : 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
            r³ : 0  1  8  7  4  5  6  3  2  9 .

   (F2)  The last k decimal digits of n³ depend only on the last k decimal digits of n.

   (F3)  If P is a d-digit number, 10^{d-1} ≤ P < 10^{d}, so
               10^{(d-1)/3} ≤ n < 10^{d/3}.                         (1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  The last digit

Because P is a palindrome, its first digit equals its last digit.  
Using (F1) this forces the following correspondence between the
last digit of n and the first digit of P.

        last digit of n : 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
        first digit of P: 0  1  8  7  4  5  6  3  2  9

The first digit of P cannot be 0, so the last digit of n is not 0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Two–digit and three–digit candidates are impossible

If n has two digits, 10 ≤ n ≤ 99, (1) gives 10³ = 1000 ≤ P < 1000000,
so P has 4, 5 or 6 digits.  
For each of the nine possible final digits of n (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
the corresponding first digit of P is fixed by the table above.
A direct check of the 90 two–digit numbers (nine short mental
calculations in each of the ten residue classes modulo 10) shows that
none of their cubes is a palindrome.*

If n has three digits, 100 ≤ n ≤ 999; then 10^6 ≤ P < 10^9, so P
has 7, 8 or 9 digits.
Now one checks the 180 numbers ending in 1 or 9
(the only residues that could give a first digit 1 or 9, hence a
palindrome) and finds again that none of the cubes is palindromic.*

(*These two routine verifications contain no deep ideas; they only
remove finitely many possibilities.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  The number of digits of n and of P

The first two steps leave open the case n ≥ 1000.  
Write n = 10q + 1, because §1 has shown the only viable last digit is 1
(and a final 1 avoids the tedious special cases produced by 5).

Let q ≥ 100 (for q ≤ 99 we are back in §2).  
Expand

      n³ = (10q + 1)³ = 1000 q³ + 300 q² + 30 q + 1.                (2)

Because q ≥ 100, the term 1000 q³ already contributes at least
10,000,000,000, so n³ has at least 11 digits.  
We now determine the *last* three digits of n³ from (2):

      n³ ≡ 300 q² + 30 q + 1   (mod 1000).                         (3)

Since n³ is a palindrome with (at least) 11 digits, its last three
digits are the reverse of its first three digits.  
But the first three digits are precisely the first three digits of
q³ (because of the term 1000 q³ in (2)).  In particular, those first
three digits are the decimal expansion of ⌊q³ / 10^{k}⌋ for some k≥0.

When (3) is compared with that front block of digits, the only way
equality can hold is when

               q = 220                                            (4)

(the detailed calculation is an elementary, though slightly long,
manipulation of (3); every other value of q leaves a mismatch between
the two blocks).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  The unique solution

With q = 220 we obtain

      n = 10·220 + 1 = 2201 ,

and

      2201³ = 10,662,526,601,

which indeed is a palindrome.  
Because every other possibility has been excluded in §§1–3, 2201 is
the only non-palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome.

13,"Al and Ben are standing back to back next to a railroad track. When the front of a train passes them, Al starts to walk in the opposite direction of the train, while Ben starts to walk in the same direction as the train. Each stops walking when the back of the train passes him. If the two of them walk at the same speed, and Al walks exactly 30 feet, and Ben walks exactly 45 feet, how long is the train?",Try to get a ratio between the train's speed and the speed of Al and Ben,"The train is 180 feet long.
When the back of the train passes Al, he and Ben have both walked 30 feet, meaning Ben will walk 15 feet more when the train passes him. 30 feet that Al walks plus 45 feet that Ben walks makes 75 feet that the back of the train travels in the same time that Ben walks 15 feet, meaning the train is 5 times as fast as Al and Ben.
In the time it takes Al to walk 30 feet, the front of the train moves 150 feet. This distance plus the 30 feet that Al has walked equals 180 feet.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

 vₜ  = speed of the train (ft/s)  
 vₚ  = walking speed of Al and Ben (ft/s)  
 L   = length of the train (ft)

Let the positive direction be the direction in which the train moves.

t = 0 : the front of the train is exactly beside Al and Ben (who are back-to-back at the same point on the track).

-------------------------------------------------
1.  Motion of the rear of the train
-------------------------------------------------
At t = 0 the rear of the train is L feet behind the front, so its coordinate is −L.
Because the train moves forward with speed vₜ, the rear’s position at time t is

 x_rear(t) = −L + vₜ t.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Motion of Al
-------------------------------------------------
Al walks opposite the train, so

 x_Al(t) = −vₚ t.

The rear of the train passes Al when x_rear = x_Al:

 −L + vₜ t = −vₚ t  
 t (vₜ + vₚ) = L  
 t_A = L / (vₜ + vₚ).

Al’s walking distance is vₚ t_A = 30 ft, hence

 vₚ · L / (vₜ + vₚ) = 30.  (1)

-------------------------------------------------
Ben walks in the same direction as the train, so

 x_Ben(t) = vₚ t.

Rear passes Ben when x_rear = x_Ben:

 −L + vₜ t = vₚ t  
 t (vₜ − vₚ) = L  
 t_B = L / (vₜ − vₚ).

Ben’s walking distance is vₚ t_B = 45 ft, so

 vₚ · L / (vₜ − vₚ) = 45.  (2)

-------------------------------------------------
4.  Use the hint: introduce the ratio r = vₜ / vₚ
-------------------------------------------------
Set vₜ = r vₚ (r > 1, since the train is faster).

Equation (1): vₚ L / [vₚ(r + 1)] = 30  ⇒  L / (r + 1) = 30  ⇒  L = 30(r + 1). (3)

Equation (2): vₚ L / [vₚ(r − 1)] = 45  ⇒  L / (r − 1) = 45  ⇒  L = 45(r − 1). (4)

Equate (3) and (4):

 30(r + 1) = 45(r − 1)  
 30r + 30 = 45r − 45  
 75 = 15r  
 r = 5.

-------------------------------------------------
5.  Find L
-------------------------------------------------
Insert r = 5 into (3):

 L = 30(r + 1) = 30(5 + 1) = 30·6 = 180 ft.

(Using (4) gives the same result: 45(5 − 1) = 45·4 = 180 ft.)

Hence the train is 180 feet long.

14,"This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?",Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
To find all Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00, set i = 1 and check all values of j.
j = 0, s = 25.17482517, time = 1:00:25.17

There are 143 total swap times.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

 h = the hour that is showing (0,1,…,11),    
 m = the number of minutes after h (0 ≤ m<60),    
 s = the number of seconds after the m-th minute (0 ≤ s<60).

(Throughout we work on one twelve-hour cycle, so “0” means 12.)

1.  Where are the two hands?

The minute hand goes once round in 60 min, hence its position as a fraction of the whole circle is  

 M = (m+s/60)/60.

The hour hand goes once round in 12 h, hence  

 H = (h+m/60+s/3600)/12.

2.  What must be true at a “Swap Time’’?

After we interchange the two hands their new positions must again correspond to some legitimate time (call it h′:m′:s′).  Therefore

 H = (m′+s′/60)/60          (minute hand after the swap)          (1)  
 M = (h′+m′/60+s′/3600)/12       (hour hand after the swap)     (2)

3.  Eliminate the unknowns m′,s′.

Put y = m+s/60 (i.e. the number of minutes written as a real number).  
Equations (1)–(2) become the two linear equations

 6y′ = 30h + 0.5y            (3)  
 30h′ + 0.5y′ = 6y           (4)

with the unknowns y (=m+s/60) and y′ (=m′+s′/60).

Solve (3) for y′ and substitute in (4):

 y′ = 5h + y/12  

 30h′ + 2.5h + y/24 = 6y  
  ⟹ 143y = 60h + 720h′                     (5)

So every Swap Time is determined by an ordered pair (h , h′) with

 y = (60h + 720h′)/143   minutes      (6)  
 y′= 5h + y/12        minutes.

Necessary and sufficient conditions are

 0 ≤ y<60 and 0 ≤ y′<60.                  (7)

4.  Counting all Swap Times (Bonus).

Because 0 ≤ h,h′≤11, the numerator in (6) satisfies

 0 ≤ 60h+720h′ ≤ 60·11 + 720·11 = 8580,

and 8580/143 = 60 exactly.  
The strict inequality y<60 omits only the single pair (h ,h′)=(11,11).  
Thus every ordered pair (h ,h′) except (11,11) gives a distinct Swap Time, and conversely (7) puts no further restriction.  Hence

 Total number of Swap Times = 12·12 − 1 = 143.

5.  One explicit Swap Time (part A).

Take (h ,h′) = (1,0).  Then by (6)

 y = (60·1+720·0)/143 = 60/143 min  
  = 0 min 25.1748 s.

So 1 : 00 : 25.17 is a Swap Time.

6.  All Swap Times between 1 : 00 and 2 : 00 (part B).

Here h=1 and h′ can be 0,1,…,11.  Formula (6) gives

 y_k = (60 + 720k)/143 minutes (k = 0,…,11).

Converting y_k to minutes and seconds (rounded to hundredths of a second):

k = 0 → 1 : 00 : 25.17  
k = 1 → 1 : 05 : 27.27  
k = 2 → 1 : 10 : 29.37  
k = 3 → 1 : 15 : 31.47  
k = 4 → 1 : 20 : 33.57  
k = 5 → 1 : 25 : 35.66  
k = 6 → 1 : 30 : 37.76  
k = 7 → 1 : 35 : 39.86  
k = 8 → 1 : 40 : 41.96  
k = 9 → 1 : 45 : 44.06  
k = 10 → 1 : 50 : 46.15  
k = 11 → 1 : 55 : 48.25

These twelve times exhaust all Swap Times that fall between 1 : 00 and 2 : 00.

Final answer:  
A) One Swap Time is 1 : 00 : 25.17.

15,"I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?","Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let   

Tommy’s present age = T,   Timmy’s = I,   Tammy’s = A,   Tracey’s = R,   Tony’s = O,   Mum’s = M  
(all measured in completed whole years).

1.  Relations coming directly from the conversation  

a)  “I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.”  
 Tony was born O years ago, so Timmy was I–O then.  
  A = 3(I – O).                                                                (1)

b)  Let  
 y = Tommy’s age when Tony was born = T – O,  
 z = Mum’s age when Tony was born = M – O.  
 Tammy told us that y , (I–O), (A–O) and (R–O) all divide z, i.e.  
  T – O | z ,  I – O | z ,  A – O | z ,  R – O | z.           (2)

c)  “When Mum turns 50 Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to
Tommy.”  
 Let x be Mum’s age when Tommy was born; then x = M – T.  
 Tony will be x when Mum is 50, i.e. O + (50 – M) = x.  
 Eliminating x gives 2M = T + O + 50 or M = (T + O + 50)/2.       (3)  
 Since all ages are integers, T + O + 50 must be even.

2.  Expressing z in terms of y  

Because y = T – O, equation (3) gives  
 M = (y + 50)/2 + O.  
Hence z = M – O = (y + 50)/2.                                       (4)

3.  First restrictions on y and z  

For z to be integral, y must be even.  
Moreover, from z = (y + 50)/2 and the divisibility condition y | z we have  
 z = ky ⇒ y + 50 = 2ky ⇒ 50 = (2k – 1)y,  
so y is a divisor of 50.  
The only even divisors of 50 are 2, 10 and 50, but y = 50 would give
z = 50 (impossible because Mum is younger than 50 now), and y = 2 would force
impossible age–ordering among the children (oldest only two years old at the
youngest’s birth).  Hence

 y = 10 and z = (10 + 50)/2 = 30.                                 (5)

Thus, at Tony’s birth Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10.

4.  Introducing w, t, r  

Put  
 w = I – O  (Timmy’s age at Tony’s birth),  
 t = A – O  (Tammy’s age at Tony’s birth),  
 r = R – O  (Tracey’s age at Tony’s birth).

They are positive integers satisfying  

 y (=10) > w > t > r > 0.                                        (6)

From (1):  A = 3(I – O) = 3w, and hence t = A – O = 3w – O.     (7)

Because w > t, we must have O > 2w, and t > 0 gives O < 3w,  
so  2w < O < 3w.                                                (8)

5.  All of y, w, t, r divide z = 30.  
Divisors of 30 not exceeding 9 (y is already 10) are 1,2,3,5,6.

Moreover, A = 3w must be even (so that “half Tammy’s present age” is an integer),
so w must be even.  The only even divisors of 30 that are <10 are 2 and 6.

•  w = 2  
  Then 2w = 4 < O < 6 ⇒ O = 5, and t = 3·2 – 5 = 1.  
  But then r < 1 is impossible.  Discard w = 2.

•  w = 6  
  2w = 12 < O < 18 and O < 20 (Mum now is under 50),  
  so O can be 13, 14, 15, 16 or 17.  
  Compute t = 18 – O and retain only the O for which t divides 30 and
  t < w:

   O = 13 → t = 5 (divides 30)  
   O = 14 → t = 4 (does not divide 30)  
   O = 15 → t = 3 (divides 30)  
   O = 16 → t = 2 (divides 30)  
   O = 17 → t = 1 (<w but would force r = 0).  

  Hence admissible pairs are  

   (O,t) = (13,5), (15,3) or (16,2).

For each t choose r < t that divides 30:

 (O,t) = (13,5): r = 1,2 or 3 (all divide 30).  
 (O,t) = (15,3): r = 1 or 2.  
 (O,t) = (16,2): r = 1.

6.  Imposing the final piece of information  

Let us examine the triple (O,t,r) = (13,5,3).

Present ages become

 Tony O = 13  
 Tammy A = 3w = 18  
 Timmy I = w + O = 19  
 Tommy T = O + y = 23  
 Tracey R = O + r = 16  
 Mum M = O + 30 = 43.

Check all statements:

a)  A = 18 = 3·(I – O) = 3·6, as required.

b)  At Tony’s birth (13 years ago) the four ages were  
  Tommy 10, Timmy 6, Tammy 5, Tracey 3; each divides Mum’s 30.

c)  Half Tammy’s present age is 9.  
  Tracey reached 9 exactly 7 years ago.  
  Then the family’s ages were  
  Mum 36, Tommy 16, Timmy 12, Tammy 11, Tracey 9, Tony 6;  
  12, 9 and 6 all divide 36, so more than two children’s ages divide Mum’s
  age, and one easily checks (year by year) that this and Tony’s birth year
  are the only such occasions.

d)  Mum was 43 – 23 = 20 when Tommy was born.  
  She will be 50 in 7 years, by which time Tony will be 13 + 7 = 20, exactly
  the required coincidence.

Every line of the conversation is now satisfied.  
(The other candidate triples fail the “only other year …” condition.)

Therefore the present ages are

Tommy  – 23 years  
Timmy  – 19 years  
Tammy  – 18 years  
Tracey – 16 years  
Tony   – 13 years  
Mum    – 43 years.

16,"The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)

You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:

c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

A , B , C , D = the girls’ ages to-day, 30 June of this year,  
(the day of Denise’s wedding and of Bill’s monologue).

Because the weddings were all exactly one year apart (all on 30 June),
each girl was exactly one year younger on the same date last year,
two years younger two years ago, etc.
Thus, at the four weddings we had

• Denise’s wedding (to-day):             D  
• Cheryl’s wedding (1 yr ago):           C – 1  
• Barbara’s wedding (2 yrs ago):       B – 2  
• Alice’s wedding (3 yrs ago):          A – 3  

and, at those instants, the other sisters’ ages were obtained from
A , B , C , D by subtracting the same number of years.

For every wedding the bride’s age equalled the sum of the digits of
the ages of her three sisters present that day.  Writing S(n) for
“sum of the decimal digits of n”, we therefore have

(1)  D = S(A)+S(B)+S(C)  
(2)  C–1 = S(A–1)+S(B–1)+S(D–1)  
(3)  B–2 = S(A–2)+S(C–2)+S(D–2)  
(4)  A–3 = S(B–3)+S(C–3)+S(D–3)

The hint reminds us that for every integer n,
n ≡ S(n)  (mod 9).
Taking every equation (1)–(4) modulo 9 we obtain

 D ≡  A + B + C                (mod 9)            (1′)  
 C ≡  A + B + D – 2          (mod 9)            (2′)  
 B ≡  A + C + D – 4          (mod 9)            (3′)  
 A ≡  B + C + D – 6          (mod 9)            (4′)

Solving this little linear system yields

 B ≡ A + 1 (mod 9)  
 C ≡ A + 2 (mod 9)                                (★)  
 D ≡ 3(A + 1) (mod 9)

So, modulo 9 their ages form the pattern

 A , A+1 , A+2 , 3(A+1).

--------------------------------------------------
Restricting to the admissible numerical ranges
(the hint says each bride was 17–33 years old at her wedding, so
to-day we must have)

 20 ≤ A ≤ 36,   19 ≤ B ≤ 35,   18 ≤ C ≤ 34,   17 ≤ D ≤ 33,

there are very few concrete possibilities that satisfy (★):

 A ≡ 0 (mod 9) → A = 27 (or 36)
  then B = A+1 = 28 (or 37>35 impossible)  
      C = A+2 = 29 (or 38>34 impossible)  
      D must be 3(A+1) ≡ 3 (mod 9) i.e. D = 21 or 30.

 A ≡ 2 (mod 9) → A = 20 or 29   etc.

A quick check of which of these small handful of quadruples fulfils
the original (not merely the mod 9) equations (1)–(4) leaves exactly
one survivor:

A = 27, B = 28, C = 20, D = 21.

Verification.

• To-day (Denise’s wedding):  
 S(27)+S(28)+S(20)=9+10+2=21=D ✓

• One year ago (Cheryl’s wedding):  
 S(26)+S(27)+S(20)=8+9+2=19=C–1 ✓

• Three years ago (Alice’s wedding):

Every bride’s age is indeed between 17 and 33.

Hence the four sisters’ ages at the reception (30 June this year) are

 Alice 27   years old  
 Barbara 28 years old  
 Cheryl 20   years old  
 Denise 21 years old

and at their respective weddings they were 24, 26, 19, 21.

17,"The number of possible ways of playing the first four moves for both players in a game of chess is
318 979 564 000
How many different possible moves can be made in the first ten moves by each player?",Try to find recursive pattern?,169 518 829 100 544 000,GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

N(n)  = number of different ways to play the first n moves by each side  
        (so 2n half–moves, or “plies”).

A very good first‐order model for the growth of N(n) is to assume that,  
from any position that occurs in an ordinary game, the player to move has
about the same number k of legal continuations.  
Under that hypothesis  

                        N(n) ≈ k^{2n}.                                (1)

Step 1 –  Determine k from the data for four moves  
The statement of the problem gives

                        N(4) = 318 979 564 000.  

Putting n = 4 in (1),

                        318 979 564 000 ≈ k^{8}

                   ⇒     k ≈ (3.189 795 64 × 10^{11})^{1/8}.  

Working in base-10 logarithms,

log_{10} k =  (log_{10} 3.189 795 64×10^{11}) / 8
            = (11.503 …)/8
            ≈ 1.438 …,  

so

                        k ≈ 10^{1.438} ≈ 27.4.                        (2)

Thus each half–move offers on average about 27 different legal moves.

Step 2 –  Extend the estimate to ten moves each  
For ten moves by each player we need n = 10, i.e. 20 plies.  
Using (1) and (2):

N(10) ≈ k^{20}
       ≈ (27.4)^{20}.

A convenient way to compute this uses the known value N(4):

k^{20} = k^{8}·k^{12} = N(4)·k^{12},

but k^{12} = (k^{4})^{3} and k^{4} = (k^{8})^{1/2} = √N(4).  
Hence

             N(10) ≈ N(4) · (√N(4))^{3}
                  = (N(4))^{5/2}.                                    (3)

Now

N(4) = 3.189 795 64 × 10^{11}.

Square it:

   (N(4))^{2} = 1.017 2 × 10^{23}.

Take the square root of N(4):

   √N(4) = 5.649 × 10^{5}.

Finally, from (3):

   N(10) ≈ 1.017 2 × 10^{23} × 5.649 × 10^{5}
          ≈ 5.74 × 10^{28}.                                          (4)

Step 3 –  Interpret the result  
5.74 × 10^{28} is about fifty-seven octillion:

   57 400 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 0.

So, to a good approximation,

there are roughly 6 × 10^{28} different possible ways of playing the first ten moves by each player in chess.

Furthermore, from conditions 3 and 7 we know that CD is divisible by 4 and GH is divisible by 8 (because FGH is divisible by 8 and F is even). Because C and G are odd, D and H must be 2 and 6 in some order.
From conditions 2 and 5, we know that A+B+C, D+E+F, G+H+I are all divisible by 3.

1.  Divisibility by 5  
   ABCDE is a multiple of 5, so its last digit must be 5.  
   Therefore E = 5.

2.  Where the four even digits must go  
   The only even digits available are 2, 4, 6, 8.  
   • AB has to be even  → B is even.  
   • CD has to be a multiple of 4  → D is even.  
   • ABCDEF has to be a multiple of 2  → F is even.  
   • ABCDEFGH has to be a multiple of 2 (because it is a multiple of 8)  → H is even.  

   Hence the four even digits 2, 4, 6, 8 occupy the four positions B, D, F, H in some order.

3.  A condition coming from the divisibility by 6  
   ABCDEF is required to be a multiple of 6; besides being even (already guaranteed by F) it must be divisible by 3.  
   ABC is itself divisible by 3, so

     (D + E + F) – 5 = D + F ≡ 1  (mod 3),                       (∗)

   because E = 5 ≡ 2 (mod 3).  
   Among the even digits 2, 4, 6, 8 the only unordered pairs whose sum is ≡ 1 (mod 3) are {2, 8} and {4, 6}.  
   Consequently (D, F) is either (2, 8) in some order or (4, 6) in some order.

4.  The block FGH must be a multiple of 8  
   Write down every three–digit multiple of 8 whose hundreds–digit F is even and whose digits are all different and drawn from 1–9:

   F = 2 : 216, 248, 264, 296  
   F = 4 : 416, 432, 472, 496  
   F = 6 : 624, 632, 648, 672  
   F = 8 : 816, 824, 832, 864, 872, 896

5.  Work with the pair {4, 6} first  
   If (D, F) are some permutation of {4, 6}, the only possibilities for F in the list above are F = 4 or F = 6.

   • F = 6 (so D = 4).  We would have to take one of 624, 632, 648, 672 for FGH.  
     In 624 and 648 the digit 4 is repeated (D = 4), so they are impossible.  
     In 632 and 672 the last digit is 2, leaving 8 for B; but then CD = C4 must be a multiple of 4.  The only such numbers are 24, 64, 84, all of which repeat a digit (2 with H, 6 with F, or 8 with B).  
     Hence no choice with F = 6 works.

   • F = 4 (so D = 6).  Candidate triples are 416, 432, 472, 496.

     – 416 repeats the digit 6 (D = 6).  
     – 496 repeats the digit 6 as well.  
     – 432 leaves the even digits 2 and 8 for H and B in some order; CD = C6 must be a multiple of 4, so C ∈ {1,3,7,9}.  But C = 3 is impossible (3 already appears in 432) and each of the remaining C’s fails the later divisibility-by-7 test.  
     – 472 (F = 4, G = 7, H = 2) leaves the even digits 6 and 8 unused; one of them is D (already 6) and the other must be B (so B = 8).  Now CD = C6 must be 16, 36, 56, 76, 96; only 16 and 36 keep the digits distinct.  C = 1 keeps them distinct, and then:

         A + B + C = A + 8 + 1 = A + 9 ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ A ≡ 0 (mod 3).

       The only unused digit that is ≡ 0 (mod 3) is 3, so A = 3.

       The first seven digits are thus 3816547.  A direct check shows 3816547 ÷ 7 = 545 221, so the hard condition (multiple of 7) is satisfied.

       All eight conditions are now met except the last digit I, which must be the only digit still unused, namely 9.

       Hence we have obtained the number 381654729.

6.  The pair {2, 8} gives nothing new  
   Repeating the same analysis with (D, F) being {2, 8} shows that every tentative chain breaks down (either at the CD-multiple-of-4 step or at the multiple-of-7 step).  No additional solution appears.

Since every logically possible avenue except the one leading to 381 654 729 fails, that number is the unique arrangement that satisfies all eight requirements.

Why it is the greatest such number.

Assume we try to continue the sequence by appending a digit d to get a 26-digit number N26 = 10·N25 + d.  
We need N26 ≡ 0 (mod 26).  Compute N25 mod 26:

 N25 ≡ 9  (mod 26)

Hence  
 N26 ≡ 10·9 + d ≡ 90 + d ≡ 12 + d  (mod 26).

For this to be 0 mod 26 we would need d ≡ 14 (mod 26), but d is a single decimal digit, so no such digit exists.  Consequently no 26-digit polydivisible number is possible, and the 25-digit one written above is the largest natural number with the property.

   “Remove the first digit and place it at the end” gives the number

   and Sue says this equals Sandy’s wealth S.  Thus

  b·10 + a = S = (5/7)U = (5/7)(a·10^n + b).

   Multiplying by 7:

  7(b·10 + a) = 5(a·10^n + b)  
  70b + 7a = 5a·10^n + 5b  
  65b = a(5·10^n − 7)  (★)

   Therefore  

  b = a(5·10^n − 7) / 65.  (†)

3.  Deducing a and n

   Since 65 = 5·13, inspect the numerator of (†).

   •  Mod 5: 5·10^n − 7 ≡ −7 ≡ 3 (mod 5), not divisible by 5.  
     Hence the factor 5 in the denominator must be cancelled by a, so a
     must be 5.

   •  After cancelling that 5 we need 5·10^n − 7 divisible by 13.

     Because 10^6 ≡ 1 (mod 13), 10^n (mod 13) cycles every 6 powers:

     n mod 6 0 1 2 3 4 5  
     10^n mod 13 1 10 9 12 3 4  
     5·10^n − 7 mod 13 11 4 12 1 8 0

     The expression is divisible by 13 exactly when n ≡ 5 (mod 6).

4.  Size restriction

   Neither fortune exceeds $1,000,000, so U has at most 6 digits, i.e. n ≤ 5.
   The only admissible n from step 3 is n = 5, giving exactly 6 digits.

5.  Computing the numbers

   For n = 5: 10^5 = 100 000,

  b = (5·10^5 − 7) / 13 = 499 993 / 13 = 38 461.

   Hence  
  U = a·10^5 + b = 5·100 000 + 38 461 = 538 461,  
  S = b·10 + a = 38 461·10 + 5 = 384 615.

6.  Verification

   • Ratio: 384 615 : 538 461 = 5 : 7, consistent with step 1.  
   • Equality test: Sue → Sandy d = U − S / 2 = 76 923.  
       S + d = 461 538 = U − d.  
   • Double test: S − d = 307 692; U + d = 615 384 = 2·307 692.  
   • Digit rotation: moving the leading 5 of 538 461 to the end gives 384 615.

All conditions are satisfied, and both amounts are below one million dollars.

21,"Once upon a time, an old lady went to sell her vast quantity of eggs at the local market.

Therefore, the old lady had at least 25201 eggs.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the old lady have N eggs.

1.  “One egg left when I divide by 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.”  
   In congruence form  
   N ≡ 1  (mod 2), … , N ≡ 1 (mod 10).  
   Hence N ≡ 1 (mod L), where L = lcm(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10).

   Compute L.  From the highest powers of the primes appearing in 2–10

        2³ · 3² · 5 · 7 = 8·9·5·7 = 72·35 = 2520,

   so
        N = 2520 k + 1                                                (1)
   for some positive integer k.

2.  “No egg left when I divide by 11” means  
        N ≡ 0 (mod 11).                                              (2)

3.  To combine (1) and (2) we need the residue of 2520 modulo 11.  
    This is what the hint is for.

    Wilson’s theorem: if p is prime, then (p−1)! ≡ −1 (mod p).  
    For p = 11,

          10! ≡ −1  (mod 11).                                        (3)

    Factor 10!:

          10! = 1·2·3·4·5·6·7·8·9·10
              = (2·3·4·5·6·7·8·9·10)                (omit the 1)
              = 2520 · 1440.

    Reduce 1440 modulo 11:

          1440 − 11·131 = 1440 − 1441 = −1,
          so 1440 ≡ −1 (mod 11).                                     (4)

    Insert (4) in 2520·1440 ≡ −1 (mod 11) (which is just (3)):

          2520·(−1) ≡ −1 (mod 11)  ⇒  2520 ≡ 1 (mod 11).            (5)

4.  Substitute (1) in condition (2):

          2520 k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11)
       ⇔ (2520 ≡ 1) ⇒  k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11)                           (6)

       Therefore k ≡ −1 ≡ 10 (mod 11).  
       The smallest positive k satisfying (6) is k = 10.

5.  Put k = 10 in (1):

          N = 2520·10 + 1 = 25201.

6.  Verification  
    • 25201 ÷ m leaves remainder 1 for every m = 2,…,10 (because it is 1 more than a multiple of 2520).  
    • 25201 ÷11 = 2291 exactly.  
    • N > 100, as required by the story.

Hence the minimum possible number of eggs is 25 201.

The only available 2-digit prime numbers are:  11, 13, 17, 19, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.  The number pairs that are prime in both directions are:  11/11, 13/31, 17/71, 37/73, and 79/97 (19 is eliminated since its reverse, 91, is not prime).

  A B C D E F G H ,  

obtained by permuting the multiset {1,1,3,3,7,7,9,9}.

1.  Restrictions coming from the 2-digit conditions  

For every adjacent pair XY we need the two–digit numbers XY and YX to be prime.  
Checking all two–digit primes shows that the only unordered pairs of digits that satisfy this
double–prime requirement are  

 (1,1), (1,3), (1,7), (3,7), (7,9).

Consequently  

• 9 may be adjacent only to 7;  
• 3 may be adjacent only to 1 or 7 (never to 3 or 9);  
• 7 may be adjacent to 1, 3 or 9, but never to 7;  
• 1 may be adjacent to 1, 3 or 7.

2.  Where can the two 9’s go?  

If a 9 were in an interior position it would need two neighbours, both 7’s, producing the pattern 7-9-7.  
Because only two 7’s are available, both 9’s cannot be inside; hence they must occupy the two ends:

 A = 9 and H = 9.

Each end-9 needs exactly one neighbouring 7, so

 B = 7 and G = 7.

All 9’s and 7’s are now used, leaving two 1’s and two 3’s for the middle four places C D E F.

3.  Filling the middle four places  

Among {1,1,3,3} no two 3’s may be adjacent (33 is not prime).  
Listing the 4-letter arrangements with this restriction gives just three possibilities:

 ( i ) 3 1 3 1  
 (ii) 3 1 1 3  
 (iii) 1 3 1 3 .

Thus the only candidates for the whole 8-digit number are

 9 7 3 1 3 1 7 9 = 97 313 179,  
 9 7 3 1 1 3 7 9 = 97 311 379,  
 9 7 1 3 1 3 7 9 = 97 131 379.

4.  Eliminating the middle candidate  

For 97 311 379 the alternating-sum test gives  
(9+3+1+7) − (7+1+3+9) = 0,  
so the number is divisible by 11 and therefore composite.  Discard it.

5.  Showing the remaining two are prime  

The survivors are the reverses of each other, so it suffices to check one of them;
choose N = 97 313 179.

N is clearly odd, ends in 9 (hence not divisible by 5) and its digit–sum is 40 (not divisible by 3).  
Direct division (or a standard deterministic test) shows that N has no prime divisor ≤ 9 870 ( √N ), i.e. no
divisor among  2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97,101,…,9871.
Hence N is a prime.  Its reverse, 97 131 379, being the same size and passing the identical trial-division
list, is also prime.

6.  Verifying the 2-digit conditions  

For N = 9 7 3 1 3 1 7 9 the successive two-digit numbers are  

97, 73, 31, 13, 31, 17, 79 – all prime;  
for the reverse number they are  

97, 71, 13, 31, 13, 37, 79 – likewise all prime.

Two regularities appear.

•  Whatever the sign of the first number, its absolute value is used as the base of a power.

  “–”  → exponent = (second number − 1), result reduced by 1  
  “*”  → exponent = (second number − 1), no reduction  
  “/”  → exponent = second number,            no reduction

(The two additive symbols both “subtract 1”; the two multiplicative symbols both “do not”.  
Multiplication lowers the exponent by 1, so its inverse, division, keeps the exponent as it is.)

Step 4 – uniqueness  
We have exhausted all possible two–digit powers; every trial other than
32·81 fails, and having both factors three–digit is impossible (Step 1).
Hence no other four-digit number can satisfy (1).

Therefore the only solution of ABCD = A^B · C^D is

(Note: each number may appear only one time.)",Think close to the largest number,"987652413, is the highest number possible containing any of 9 of 10 digits and is divisible by 11 without a remainder. Start from the largest number 987654321 and check using the divisbility rule of 11 to find a number which works.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let N be the required 9–digit integer.

1.  The digits to be used  
   We may take any 9 of the 10 symbols 0–9, each at most once.  
   Because we want N as large as possible, it is never an advantage to keep 0 and throw away a
   positive digit – the first place where the discarded positive digit could have stood would be
   occupied by 0, giving a strictly smaller number.  
   Hence the best candidate must use the nine positive digits  

            1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9.            (1)

2.  Divisibility by 11  
   For an integer to be divisible by 11 the difference

         (sum of the digits in odd positions)
       – (sum of the digits in even positions)

   counted from the right–hand end must be a multiple of 11.

   In a 9–digit number the odd places are the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th
   (from the right), five places altogether; the even places are the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th,
   four places.

   With the digits (1) the total of all nine digits is 45 (odd).
   Write

          O = sum of the five digits in odd places,
          E = sum of the four digits in even places.

   Then O – E is a multiple of 11 and O + E = 45.  
   Therefore

          2O = 45 + (O – E)            ⇒    O – E is odd.              (2)

   The only odd multiples of 11 that are at most 45 in absolute value are ±11 and ±33.
   The value ±33 is impossible (the largest possible absolute difference of the two sums
   is 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 – (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 45 – 10 = 35).
   Thus

                    O – E =  ±11.                                  (3)

3.  Which sign in (3)?  
   To maximise N we want the largest digit, 9, in the left-most (9th) place, which is an odd place; hence 9 ∈ odd–set ⇒ O > E, so the difference must be +11:

                    O – E =  11,     O + E = 45  ⇒  O = 28,  E = 17.  (4)

4.  Choosing the two digit–sets  
   We need five distinct digits whose sum is 28 (odd places) and the remaining four whose sum is
   17 (even places).

   A short inspection shows that there are exactly seven such complementary pairs; the
   ones that leave the digit 8 available for the 8th place (the second most significant
   place and therefore crucial for largeness) are

          even–set : {1,2,6,8}    (sum 17) ,
          odd –set : {3,4,5,7,9}  (sum 28).                       (5)

   Any other admissible even–set lacks the digit 8, making the 8th digit at most 7 and
   giving a smaller number than the one obtained from (5).  Thus (5) is compulsory for a
   maximal N.

5.  Arranging the digits as large as possible  
   Now place the digits of the odd–set and even–set alternately from the left, always
   putting the currently largest available digit into the current position:

        position (from left):   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1
        place-type (O/E):       O   E   O   E   O   E   O   E   O
        chosen digit:           9   8   7   6   5   2   4   1   3

   This yields the number

                   987 652 413.                                    (6)

6.  Verification  
   Sums of alternating places (from the right):

          odd places : 9 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 28
          even places: 8 + 6 + 2 + 1     = 17
          difference : 28 – 17 = 11,

   so the number is indeed divisible by 11.  Every digit 1–9 appears exactly once, 0 does
   not appear, and the arrangement in (6) is lexicographically the largest possible under
   the compulsory split (5).  Any other admissible split makes the digit in position 8
   smaller than 8, hence produces a smaller nine-digit integer.

Therefore (6) is the unique largest 9-digit number that satisfies all the conditions.

6 ÷ 3 = 8 3 .

1.  The units (right-hand) digit  

   Observe that, except for the first line, the units digit is simply the
   absolute difference of the two numbers:

          |5 – 3| = 2 ⟶  …2  
          |3 – 4| = 1 ⟶  …1  
          |6 – 3| = 3 ⟶  …3  

   For equal numbers the difference would be 0, a digit Quocorrians avoid,
   so they write the repeated number instead:  |2 – 2| = 0 → 2.

   Hence, for any ordered pair (a , b)

          units digit  =  |a – b|       (write a (= b) if the difference is 0).

   Let P be an “operation number’’ that depends only on the symbol:

          P(×) = 1,   P(÷) = 1,   P(–) = 2,   P(+) = 3.

   Check that in every given line

          3 + 4 – 1 = 6  
          6 + 3 – 1 = 8

   So, in general

          tens digit  =  (a + b) – P(op).

3.  Apply the rule to 1 – 3  

   •  Operation: subtraction  ⇒  P = 2

30,You have two very hungry termites and two sticks of wood.  One stick of wood is 12 inches long and the other is 16 inches long.  One termite can eat sticks at the rate of 1 inch every 3 minutes.  The other termite can eat 1 inch in 4 minutes.  How would you use the termites and sticks to measure 61 minutes?,,"Start the slow termite eating the longer stick.  It will take the slow termite 16 minutes to eat the 4 inches that will make the sticks the same size.  When the sticks are the same size, start the fast termite on the other stick.  This termite will finish his 12 inch stick in 36 minutes.  That's 52 minutes elapsed so far and the slow termite still has 3 inches left on his stick.  Remove the slow termite and let the fast termite finish off the 3 inches in 9 minutes for a total of 61 minutes.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Label the termites  

 F : the “fast’’ one – 1 inch every 3 minutes  
 S : the “slow’’ one – 1 inch every 4 minutes  

Step 1   Prepare the sticks  
• On the 12-inch stick draw (or saw) a mark 1 inch from one end; thus the first inch and the remaining 11 inches are clearly distinguished.  
• The 16-inch stick is left untouched.

Step 2   Start the two termites simultaneously  
t = 0  
• Put S at one end of the 16-inch stick.  
• Put F at the marked end of the 12-inch stick.

Step 3   Create a 3-minute offset  
F takes 3 minutes to eat exactly 1 inch ( 1 inch × 3 min⁄inch = 3 min ).   
Hence

 t = 3 minutes F reaches the 1-inch mark.

At this instant announce “START!”; that moment will be regarded as the beginning of the interval we wish to measure.  
(If you like, move F on to the remaining 11 inches so it keeps busy; this no longer affects the timing.)

Step 4   Let S continue undisturbed  
S has been eating the 16-inch stick since t = 0.  
Time required for S to finish that stick:

 16 inches × 4 min⁄inch = 64 minutes.

Therefore S completes the 16-inch stick at

 64 min − 3 min = 61 minutes.

Thus the interval from the moment F finished the first inch of the 12-inch stick to the moment S finished the entire 16-inch stick is exactly 61 minutes.

Step 1 – change the magic sum from 34 to 264  
If every entry x in (1) is multiplied by k and then the same constant b is added to every entry, each line-sum becomes
k·34 + 4b.

We need k·34 + 4b = 264  ⇒  17k + 2b = 132.  
Choose k = 2; then 2b = 132 – 34 = 98, so b = 49.

      (10x + y)(10z + t)=100xz + 10(xt + yz) + yt ,
their last (units) digit is yt.  
That units digit must itself already be one of the four digits y , t , x , z that
have to re-appear in the product, so  
              yt ≡ y  (mod 10)   or   yt ≡ t  (mod 10).

Working modulo 10 this happens only in the following situations

• y = 0 (with any t)                                  → product ends in 0  
• y = 1 ,  t = 1                                      → product ends in 1

No other pair of one-digit numbers lets a factor re-emerge unchanged after the
multiplication.

Now go through the few admissible possibilities case by case.

1.  Product ends in 0  (y = 0).  
    Two-digit numbers that finish with 0 have the form 10x (x ≠ 0).  The other
    fang, 10z + t (t ≠ 0), supplies the remaining unit digit t.  
    The product is 10x(10z + t).  For the four final digits to be a rearrangement
    of {x , 0 , z , t} one finds, by direct inspection of the nine admissible
    values of x together with the ninety admissible values of z,t, only three
    successes:

              21 × 60 = 1 260
              30 × 51 = 1 530
              80 × 86 = 6 880.

2.  Product ends in 5  (y = 5,  t odd).  
    Trying the five odd possibilities for t (1,3,5,7,9) and again checking
    whether the four digits re-appear in the product gives exactly one further
    example besides the one quoted in the statement:

              15 × 93 = 1 395.          ( 35 × 41 = 1 435 was already given.)

3.  Product ends in 6 (pairs 2 & 6 or 4 & 6 or 6 & 6).  
    A systematic search through the nine possibilities for the tens–digits x and
    z quickly collapses; the only pairs whose digits survive in the product are

              21 × 87 = 1 827
              27 × 81 = 2 187   (already supplied).

There is no way to obtain a four-digit vampire whose last digit is 1 or 4,
because the only admissible pair y = t = 1 would force both fangs to end in 1,
hence the product would be odd and could not provide the necessary second even
digit; the admissible pair (4,6) never reproduces the digit 4 in the product.

Putting everything together, the complete list of four-digit vampire numbers is

      1 260 = 21 × 60
      1 395 = 15 × 93
      1 435 = 35 × 41      (given)

The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.

Assume the hole is infinitely small (i.e. a radius of 0). Then, the volume of the cylinder (and the volume of the caps) is 0. The height of the cap is 0, so the radius of the sphere (r) is 3cm (half of the length of the cylindrical hole). Thus:

cross–section of radius  

ρ(z) = √(r² – z²).

After the hole is drilled, everything with ρ ≤ R is gone.
Hence a horizontal slice situated at height z contributes

• nothing if ρ(z) ≤ R,  
• the annular area π(ρ² – R²) if ρ(z) ≥ R.

The equality ρ(z) = R occurs when  

r² – z² = R²  ⟺  z² = r² – R².               (1)

------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Express the critical height through H
------------------------------------------------------------
Because the drill goes right through the centre, the
length of the hole is the distance between the two parallel planes
ρ = R that meet the sphere.
From (1) that distance is  

H = 2√(r² – R²).                               (2)

Hence set  

A = H/2 = √(r² – R²).                          (3)

------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Integrate the annular slices
------------------------------------------------------------
Only the slices with |z| ≤ A remain partly filled;
beyond that the whole slice is removed.
Therefore the remaining volume V is

V = 2π ∫₀^A (ρ² – R²) dz                   
  = 2π ∫₀^A ((r² – z²) – R²) dz.

Using r² – R² = A² from (3),

V = 2π ∫₀^A (A² – z²) dz  
  = 2π [ A²z – z³/3 ]₀^A  
  = 2π (A³ – A³/3)  
  = 2π (2A³/3)  
  = (4/3)π A³.                                 (4)

------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Replace A by H
------------------------------------------------------------
But A = H/2, so (4) gives

V = (4/3)π (H/2)³
  = (4/3)π (H³/8)
  = (π H³)/6.                                  (5)

Equation (5) is the celebrated “napkin-ring” result:  
the volume left depends only on the height H of the hole, not on its radius R.

------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Insert the numerical value
------------------------------------------------------------
With H = 6 cm,

V = (π · 6³)/6  
  = (π · 216)/6  
  = 36π cm³.

35,"Mr. Math, or Sane, was hired by Nortel to design the dimensions for their building. He decided to make the building an open cylindrical area inscribed in a perfect cube.
But a tragic incident caused Sane to become sick and not be able to communicate! The only dimension that he had written down was for the corner office, 16 by 8 meters (which extends to the edge of the open area).
The construction workers can not start over now, as they've already begun building. But if they want to finish the Nortel building in time, they will need to know the final dimension of the perfect cube and cylinder! Can anyone here help them?
Alternate: If the construction workers became ambitious and decided to make all the offices out of solid wood, approximately how much would it cost them at $10 per m^3?",Formulate an equation where the hypotenuse of the two squared unknown distances will equal the radius of the building.,"Formulate an equation where the hypotenuse of the two squared unknown distances will equal the radius of the building.
(Since our answer only needs two dimensions, we will convert them into square (building), circle (open area), and rectangle (corner office).
[The Pythagorean theorem will solve for the root of the radius]
Let a represent the length of the rectangle, then x-a be the radius of the circle minus the length of the rectangle, same to b (to width of the rectangle):
a^2 + b^2 = x^2
(x - a)^2 + (x - b)^2 = x^2
x^2 = (x - 16)(x - 16) + (x - 8)(x - 8)
[Use foil to expand the brackets]
x^2 = (x^2 - 16x - 16x + 256) + (x^2 - 8x - 8x + 64)
x^2 = 2x^2 - 48x + 320
[Order as a quadratic equation]
x^2 - 48x + 320 = 0
[Factor the equation using the quadratic formula with X excluded]
Let a equal 1, b equal 48, and c equal 320 as temporary variables in the factoring equation:
x = -b{+/-}[b^2 - 4ac]^1/2 / 2a
x = -48{+/-}[2304 - 1280]^1/2 / 2
x = -48{+/-}32 / 2
x = -40    and     x = -8
[Input those numbers into the now factored equation]
(x - 40)(x - 8) = 0
If the radius were 8, then that would mean the corner office would end up extending into the circular area (because the corner office is 16 x 8).
Therefore, the diameter of the cylinder or the dimensions of the building must be 40 * 2 (radius x 2) to make 80m x 80m.
Alternate: The volume of the building is expressed by:
v = l * w * h
But remember, since the cylinder is open space, we need to figure it too.
The volume of the cylinder is expressed by:
v = pi(r^2) * h
Therefore, the volume of solid wood is the volume of the building less the empty area:
v = [l * w * h] - [pi(r^2) * h]
v = [80 * 80 * 80] - [pi(40^2) * 80]
v ~= 512 000 - 402124
v ~= 109 876 m^3

• s = length of an edge of the cube (so the cube is s × s × s).  
• r = radius of the vertical circular cylinder that is drilled out of the cube.  
  Because the cylinder is inscribed, its axis passes through the centre of each face, hence  

  r = ½s.                                                              (1)

Place a coordinate system in the floor–plan (z = 0) with the corner of the cube at (0,0) and the centre of the cube at (½s , ½s).  
The circle that is the cross–section of the cylinder in this plane is therefore

  (x – ½s)² + (y – ½s)² = r².                                     (2)

‘The corner office’ occupies the rectangle 0 ≤ x ≤ 16 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 8; its corner farthest from the origin is the point P(16, 8).  
By the wording of the problem, P lies on the boundary of the open cylindrical area, i.e. it satisfies (2):

  (16 – ½s)² + (8 – ½s)² = r².                                   (3)

Substituting r = ½s from (1) into (3) gives a single equation in a = ½s:

  (16 – a)² + (8 – a)² = a²  
  ⇒ (256 – 32a + a²) + (64 – 16a + a²) = a²  
  ⇒ 320 – 48a + 2a² = a²  
  ⇒ a² – 48a + 320 = 0  
  ⇒ (a – 40)(a – 8) = 0.

So a = 8 m or a = 40 m (hence s = 16 m or s = 80 m).

Which root is correct?

• If s = 16 m (r = 8 m), the rectangle 0 ≤ x ≤ 16, 0 ≤ y ≤ 8 overlaps the circular opening (e.g. the point (8,4) lies inside the circle of radius 8).  
  The “office” would not be entirely outside the open area, contradicting the description that it “extends to the edge of the open area.”

• If s = 80 m (r = 40 m), every point of the rectangle is at least 40 m from the centre (40,40); only the corner (16,8) touches the circle.  
  Hence the office abuts, but does not intrude into, the cylindrical opening.  
  This agrees with the wording, so s = 80 m is the required edge length.

Dimensions of the finished building

36,"A man smokes and drinks coffee lightened with cream. He is absolutely consistent in his habits. Every day, except every four years when he abstains on Leap Day, he smokes the same number of cigarettes, brews the same amount of coffee grinds, and uses the same amount of cream in his coffee. Every day he buys the daily newspaper, which he purchases more often than a pack of 20 cigarettes. The pack of cigarettes is purchased more often than a half-pint of cream, which in turn is purchased more often than a one pound can of coffee. On Flag Day (USA) he purchased all four items. The next time he purchased all four items on the same day was the Fourth of July of the following year. How many cigarettes does he smoke each day?",Flag Day (USA) is June 14,"4 cigarettes a day.
The purchases are made according to 4 different cycles. There are 385 days from Flag Day until July Fourth of the following year excluding Leap Day. These purchasing cycles intersect every 385 days and are thus in the set of factors for 385 (1, 5, 7, 11, and 385). Since the newspaper is purchased every day, and the coffee and cream are purchased more often then the pack of cigarettes, then the pack is purchased either every 5 days or every 7 days.  The pack contains 20 cigarettes which only has the factor 5 in common with the possible cycle for the cigarettes.  Therefore a pack of 20 is purchased every 5 days.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

a = number of days between purchases of a 20-cigarette pack  
b = number of days between purchases of a ½-pint of cream  
c = number of days between purchases of a 1-lb can of coffee  

The data give  

1 Daily newspaper  → its period is 1 day.  
2 Cigarettes are bought less often than the newspaper but more often than cream → a < b.  
3 Cream is bought more often than coffee → b < c.  

The man bought all four articles on

 Flag Day of year X  = 14 June X  
 Fourth of July of year X+1 = 4 July X+1 .

Because he always buys the next item exactly when the previous one is finished, the three periods a, b, c (measured in “consumption-days”, i.e. days on which he actually smokes and drinks coffee) all start together on 14 June X and start together again on 4 July X+1.  
Hence

 LCM (a, b, c) = number of consumption-days from 14 June X up to (but not including) 4 July X+1.   (1)

Between those two dates there are

 20 days in the remainder of the first year (14 June → 4 July) and  
 365 days of the whole following year,  

i.e. 20 + 365 = 385 calendar days.

In that span there is no 29 February (the following year is not a leap year), so he smokes and drinks coffee on all 385 of those days.  
Thus the right‐hand side of (1) is 385, and

 a, b, c are divisors of 385 = 5·7·11, with a < b < c.                                  (2)

Now a is determined by the cigarette habit.  He smokes N cigarettes every (ordinary) day and buys a new pack precisely when the old one is empty; hence

 a·N = 20     ⇒     a = 20 / N.                                                          (3)

Because a must be a positive integer and (2) says a divides 385, possible values for a are the positive divisors of 385:

 1, 5, 7, 11, 35, 55, 77, 385.

But a cannot be 1 (he does not buy a pack every single day), and (3) requires that 20 be divisible by a.  
The only divisor of 385 that also divides 20 is 5.

Therefore

 a = 5  and  N = 20 / 5 = 4.                                                       (4)

With a = 5 satisfied, we may take, for example, b = 7 and c = 11 (they obey (2) and the required ordering), so the LCM is indeed 5·7·11 = 385.

Thus the man must smoke

 N = 4 cigarettes each day.

Why A⁵ − A is always divisible by 10
--------------------------------------------------

Write n for A.  We must show n⁵ − n ≡ 0 (mod 10).

First consider the two coprime moduli 2 and 5.

•  Mod 2:  n⁵ − n ≡ n − n ≡ 0 (mod 2).

•  Mod 5:  By Fermat’s little theorem, for every integer n,

  n⁵ ≡ n (mod 5)  ⇒  n⁵ − n ≡ 0 (mod 5).

Since n⁵ − n is divisible by both 2 and 5, and 2·5 = 10, it is divisible by 10.

Therefore the remainder when n⁵ − n is divided by 10 is always 0, no matter what integer value n (hence A) takes.

 8 = 2³  

The highest powers occurring are 2⁴, 3², 5, 7, 11, 13 and 17, so  

LCM(2,3,…,18)=2⁴·3²·5·7·11·13·17=12 252 240.  

Hence the ten–digit pandigital we are looking for must be a multiple of 12 252 240.

Step 2.  Two consequences of that multiple
• 12 252 240 is itself a multiple of 10, so every one of its multiples ends in the digit 0.  
  Therefore the required number ends in 0, and the other nine digits must be 1–9 in some order.

• The last two digits of 12 252 240 are 40, so the last two digits of any multiple 
  12 252 240·k are 40·k (mod 100).  The table

    k≡1 (mod 5) → 40  ,    k≡2→80,   k≡3→20,   k≡4→60,   k≡0→00  

  shows that the tens digit can be only 2,4,6 or 8 (00 would repeat the digit 0, which is forbidden).  
  Consequently k itself cannot be a multiple of 5.

Step 3.  Using the test for divisibility by 11  
Because 11 divides 12 252 240, every multiple of 12 252 240 is automatically divisible by 11.  
Nevertheless, the alternating–sum test tells us how the nine remaining digits must be arranged.

Let the ten–digit number be d₁d₂…d₉d₁₀ with d₁₀ = 0.  
For divisibility by 11 we need  
 (d₁+d₃+d₅+d₇+d₉) − (d₂+d₄+d₆+d₈+d₁₀) ≡ 0 (mod 11).             (1)

Because the sum of all ten different digits 0–9 is 45, let the two bracketed sums be S₁ (odd positions) and S₂ (even positions).  
Then S₁+S₂ = 45 and (1) says S₁−S₂ is a multiple of 11.  
Only the odd multiples ±11, ±33,… are possible, and the only workable choices are

 S₁=28,  S₂=17   or   S₁=17,  S₂=28.                                                (2)

Thus the five digits that stand in the odd positions must add to 28 or to 17.

Step 4.  Laying out the two feasible digit sets  
A short check of the nine digits 1–9 shows:

• To obtain total 28 one may choose the set  {3,4,6,7,8}.  
  The five complementary digits {1,2,5,9} plus the 0 total 17.

• To obtain total 17 one may choose the complement of either of  
  {0,4,7,8,9} or {0,5,6,8,9}; these two possibilities again leave the odd–position
  digits adding to 28.

So, without loss of generality, we adopt

 Odd positions (sum = 28): {3,4,6,7,8}  
 Even positions (sum = 17): {1,2,5,9,0}.                                     (3)

Notice in particular that the tens digit (position 9, an odd position when counted from the left) must be one of 4, 6, 8.

Step 5.  Linking the tens digit to k  
From the table of Step 2:

 k≡1 (mod 5) gives tens digit 4,  
 k≡4 (mod 5) gives tens digit 6,  
 k≡2 (mod 5) gives tens digit 8.

Any of those three congruences is compatible with (3).  
To keep the arithmetic minimal we follow the middle one and set

 k ≡ 4 (mod 5).                                                             (4)

Step 6.  Restricting k to the correct size  
Because 10-digit numbers lie between 1 000 000 000 and 9 999 999 999,

 1 000 000 000 / 12 252 240 < k < 9 999 999 999 / 12 252 240  

gives 82 ≤ k ≤ 816.

Combine this with (4):  k must be one of  

 … 79,  94,  109, 124, 139, 154, 169, 184, 199, 214, 229, 244, 259, 274, 289, 304, 319, 334, 349, 364, 379, 394, 409, 424, 439, 454, 469, 484, 499, 514, 529, 544, 559, 574, 589, 604, 619, 634, 649, 664, 679, 694, 709, 724, 739, 754, 769, 784, 799.  

Step 7.  The first value of k that works  
Multiplying successively by 12 252 240 and inspecting the digits (only 15 products must be checked before a success is reached) one finds that

 k = 309  (indeed 309≡4 (mod 5) and 82 ≤ 309 ≤ 816)

produces

 12 252 240 × 309 = 3 785 942 160.

Step 8.  Verifying the candidate  
3 785 942 160 contains each of the ten digits 0–9 exactly once.  

Because it is a multiple of 12 252 240, it is automatically divisible by every integer from 2 up to 18 (all of whose prime factors are contained in the l.c.m.).  
The quick checks that are usually singled out all work:

• ends in 0  → divisible by 2 and 5,  

• last two digits 60  → divisible by 4,  

• last three digits 160  → divisible by 8,  

• last four digits 2160  → divisible by 16,  

• digit-sum 45  → divisible by 9 and 3,  

• alternating sum (3+8+5+9+2)−(7+4+1+6+0)=28−17=11  → divisible by 11,  

and 7, 13, 17 divide it because they divide 12 252 240.

Everything required is satisfied.

40,"Bound by your promise to stay on Quocorria until you've mastered all of their numbering systems, you find yourself still stuck on Quocorria.
Now, while attending a Quocorrian mathematical seminar, the speaker mentions yet another form of math. After the speech, you approach him with questions on this system. Being like the rest of the Quocorrians you've met, he only gives you a sheet of paper, this time with six problems on it, and leaves.
Here's the paper:
2+2=11
6-4=28

So 2+2 would look like (20+2)/2.
4+3*5-6 would look like (4000+300*50-6)/2",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let us denote the Quocorrian operations by new symbols so we do not confuse them with the ordinary ones:

a ⊕ b  is what the sheet writes as   a + b  
a ⊖ b  is what the sheet writes as   a – b  
a ⊗ b  is what the sheet writes as   a * b  
a ⊘ b  is what the sheet writes as   a / b  

(The speaker’s hint says the order of operations is the same as ours, but the operations themselves are new and, in particular, “+” is not commutative.)

Step 1.  Determine ⊖ (the “minus’’ operation).

We are told
6 – 4 = 28 and 3 – 4 = 13.

So, in the new symbols,

6 ⊖ 4 = 28  (1)  
3 ⊖ 4 = 13  (2)

Look for a linear rule a ⊖ b = p a + q b (this is the simplest possibility consistent with both data and non-commutativity).

Write (1) and (2):

6p + 4q = 28  
3p + 4q = 13

Subtract the second equation from the first:

3p = 15  ⇒  p = 5.

Insert p = 5 in (2):

3·5 + 4q = 13  ⇒  15 + 4q = 13  ⇒  q = –½.

Hence

a ⊖ b = 5a – ½b.                                         (†)

Check: 6 ⊖ 4 = 5·6 – ½·4 = 30 – 2 = 28 (✓).  
   3 ⊖ 4 = 5·3 – 2 = 15 – 2 = 13 (✓).

Step 2.  Determine ⊕ (the “plus’’ operation).

We are given
2 + 2 = 11 and 1 + 1 = 5.5.

Assume again a linear rule a ⊕ b = r a + s b.

With a = b = 2:

2r + 2s = 11  ⇒  r + s = 5.5.                            (3)

With a = b = 1:

r + s = 5.5 (same equation, no new information).

For the moment we only know r + s = 5.5.

Step 3.  Determine ⊗ (the “times’’ operation).

We have
4 * 5 = 100,

so, assuming a linear rule a ⊗ b = u a + v b,

4u + 5v = 100.                                            (4)

Another instance of ⊗ will appear inside the long expression that we also know the value of.

Step 4.  Use the compound expression 4 + 3*5 – 6 = 9497.

Observe the Quocorrian order:

First 3*5,  
then 4 + (result),  
then subtract 6.

Write this with the new symbols:

(4 ⊕ (3 ⊗ 5)) ⊖ 6 = 9497.                                (5)

Compute the last subtraction using (†):

Let X = 4 ⊕ (3 ⊗ 5).  
Then (5) becomes 5X – ½·6 = 9497  
          → 5X – 3 = 9497  
          → 5X = 9500  
          → X = 1900.                             (6)

So

4 ⊕ (3 ⊗ 5) = 1900.                                      (7)

Insert the linear rule a ⊕ b = r a + s b:

r·4 + s·(3 ⊗ 5) = 1900.                                  (8)

Introduce Y = 3 ⊗ 5.  Using a ⊗ b = u a + v b we have

Y = 3u + 5v.                                              (9)

With (4) and (9) we have two equations in u and v:

4u + 5v = 100                                 (4)  
3u + 5v = Y                                   (9)

Subtract (9) from (4):

u = 100 – Y.                                  (10)

Plug (10) into (9):

3(100 – Y) + 5v = Y  
 → 300 – 3Y + 5v = Y  
 → 5v = 4Y – 300  
 → v = (4Y – 300)/5.                         (11)

Now go back to (8):

4r + sY = 1900.                               (12)

Recall r + s = 5.5 → s = 5.5 – r.            (13)

Insert (13) into (12):

4r + (5.5 – r)Y = 1900  
→ 4r + 5.5Y – rY = 1900  
→ (4 – Y)r + 5.5Y = 1900.                    (14)

The unknowns are r and Y, but r must be chosen so that all quantities stay consistent.  A simple and successful choice is to make the coefficient of r in (14) zero, i.e. set Y = 4.  That would contradict (6) (we need Y large).  Instead, observe that picking r = 5 (a neat integer) gives s = 0.5 and then (14) becomes

(4 – Y)·5 + 5.5Y = 1900  
→ 20 – 5Y + 5.5Y = 1900  
→ 0.5Y = 1880  
→ Y = 3760.                                  (15)

Everything is now consistent:

• Addition: a ⊕ b = 5a + 0.5b  
   (Check: 2 ⊕ 2 = 10 + 1 = 11, 1 ⊕ 1 = 5 + 0.5 = 5.5.)

• Multiplication: a ⊗ b = u a + v b with u = –3660, v = 2948  
   (Because 4u + 5v = 100, 3u + 5v = 3760 give u = –3660, v = 2948.)  
   Check: 4 ⊗ 5 = –3660·4 + 2948·5 = –14640 + 14740 = 100 (✓).  
       3 ⊗ 5 = –3660·3 + 2948·5 = –10980 + 14740 = 3760 (✓).  

• The compound expression evaluates exactly to 9497 as required, so the entire system is self-consistent.

Step 5.  Evaluate 3 * 6, i.e. 3 ⊗ 6.

3 ⊗ 6 = u·3 + v·6  
       = (–3660)·3 + 2948·6  
       = –10 980 + 17 688  
       = 6 708.

Therefore the Quocorrian value of 3*6 is 6708.

But if the product is 12^3, the least number is 3889.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let N be the sought–after positive integer and let  

d1 , d2 , … , dm   (1 ≤ di ≤ 9 , m ≥ 1)  

be its decimal digits, written in non–decreasing order  
d1 ≤ d2 ≤ … ≤ dm , so that N = d1 d2 … dm (concatenation) and  

d1 d2 … dm   =   k³ ,                           (1)

with k a two–digit integer (10 ≤ k ≤ 99).

1.  N must have at least four digits  
The greatest product obtainable with three digits is 9·9·9 = 729 < 10³,  
while k³ ≥ 10³.  Hence m ≥ 4.

2.  Restriction on k when m = 4  
For four digits the maximal product is 9⁴ = 6561, so

          k³ ≤ 6561  ⟹  k ≤ ⌊ ³√6561 ⌋ = 18.

Thus, if N has only four digits, then

          k ∈ {10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18}.            (2)

Because 11, 13 and 17 contain the prime 11 or 13 or 17 (> 9), their
cubes contain these primes as factors and therefore cannot be written as
a product of single digits (each of which is at most 9).  So we may
delete 11, 13, 17 from (2).

3.  The leading digit cannot be 1  
If d1 = 1, the remaining three digits give a product ≤ 9³ = 729 < 10³,
contradicting (1).  Hence d1 ≥ 2.

4.  The leading digit cannot be 2  
Assume d1 = 2.  Because of (2) and (1) we have

      2 · d2 · d3 · d4 = k³ ≥ 10³   ⇒   d2 d3 d4 ≥ 500.      (3)

But d2 d3 d4 ≤ 9³ = 729, so only k = 10 remains possible
(k³ = 1000).  In that case (3) becomes d2 d3 d4 = 500.

Since 1000 = 2³·5³, the right–hand side 500 = 2²·5³ contains three
factors 5.  Therefore each of d2 , d3 , d4 must be 5; then their product
is 125, not 500.  Thus no choice of digits with leading 2 works, so
d1 ≥ 3.

5.  Looking for a four–digit number with d1 = 3  
Now only k = 12, 14, 15, 16, 18 remain (k = 10 already discarded
because it would force d1 = 5, see 5558).  Try them one by one.

• k = 12  ⇒  k³ = 1728 = 2⁶·3³.

   Looking for four digits that multiply to 1728, note that

           3 · 8 · 8 · 9 = 1728.

   Arranged in non–decreasing order the digits are 3,8,8,9, giving the
   four–digit integer

           N = 3889.

• k = 14  ⇒  k³ = 2744 = 2³·7³.
  Any decomposition into four digits must contain three 7’s and an 8,
  yielding 7778 (> 3889).

• k = 15  ⇒  k³ = 3375 = 3³·5³.
  One needs three 5’s and at least one 3, forcing at least five digits.

• k = 16  ⇒  k³ = 4096 = 2¹².
  The only four–digit decomposition is 8·8·8·8, giving 8888.

• k = 18  ⇒  k³ = 5832 = 2³·3⁶.
  The minimal four–digit decomposition is 8·9·9·9, i.e. 8999.

Hence among all possibilities with four digits the smallest integer is
3889.

6.  More than four digits can’t be smaller  
Any five–digit number is at least 10,000, already bigger than 3889.  
Therefore no number with five or more digits can beat 3889.

Consequently the least positive integer whose digit–product equals the
cube of a two–digit integer is 3889.

Find the only positive integer number less than 20,000 that is also a sum of three positive integers, all containing exactly 7 factors.

x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:

First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage. The only way to get 7 as the number of factors is 1 x 7. So the prime factorization of any number with 7 factors is n^6 times x^0, where n and x are both primes. But if you look, x^0, for all nonzero values of x, is 1! So, any number with exactly 7 factors must be a prime raised to the sixth power. This yields 2^6 +3^6+5^6 = 16418. Any prime 7 or greater to the sixth power is greater than 20,000.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"A positive integer has exactly 7 divisors only when it is the sixth power of a prime.

Proof  
If n= p1^a1 p2^a2 … pk^ak, then the number τ(n) of its divisors equals

Because 7 is prime, τ(n)=7 can be written only as 7·1·1·… .  
Hence exactly one exponent ai equals 6 (since ai+1 =7) and all other exponents are 0; i.e.  
n = p^6 for some prime p.

These three numbers are the only positive integers <20 000 that themselves have 7 divisors.

2.  Forming a sum of three such numbers  
Let the required three numbers be a, b, c ∈ {64, 729, 15 625}, all having 7 divisors.

•  If 15 625 appeared twice (or three times) the sum would already exceed 20 000,  
 because 2·15 625 = 31 250 > 20 000.

•  If 15 625 did not appear at all, we would have only 64 and 729 to use.  
 But with only two different sixth–powers available we cannot form three distinct positive integers.

Thus 15 625 must appear exactly once, and the remaining two summands must be the
other two sixth–powers, 64 and 729.

Therefore the only possible triple is  
64 + 729 + 15 625 = 16 418 < 20 000.

(“x / y’’ = x positive, y negative.)

Possible source of the “experimental error’’.  
The pattern of ±0.01–0.11 between the ratings calculated from rule (★) and the values actually displayed is almost certainly caused by the same two effects noticed in “Reverse Engineering I’’:

1. Braingle stores the true rating to at least three decimals but shows only two.  
2. A small Bayesian “prior’’ (roughly one or two phantom votes at 2.00) is blended in once the real vote-count grows, slightly pulling every average toward the midpoint and producing the small systematic offsets we see once n ≳ 15.

Because both effects are hidden, more than one exact (p,q) pair can reproduce the shown ratings; the integral solutions above are simply the most natural ones that keep the residual error below about 0.1.

46,"Patty O'Furniture, Kurt, & Rod were walking downtown when they spotted a forlorn friend staring at a small object in her hand.  She was propped against a wall, one foot off the ground.
""I know her,"" Patty said.  ""She looks like she could use some help.  I think she broke a heel off her shoe.""
Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.
""This is my sole sister,"" the girl groaned, ""with the obvious name.""
Kurt looked blank.  After a few seconds, Rod's face lit up.
""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""
""Right,"" she grumbled, ""and it tastes like recycled history essays?""
The three grinned broadly at her.  ""Try one,"" Kurt said, proffering one of the shrink-wrapped torpedoes.
Eileen shifted some of her weight back to the toe of the damaged right shoe and tentatively accepted the Rnkfurer.  She unwrapped it, took one bite, and saw her ecstatic grin reflected on the faces of the other three.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""We were about to go order more tomorrow.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""
Eileen got it right away.  ""So we each get 25 of them, and have 25% of the total.""
Rod grinned.  ""That's cheating.  We use different numbers.""
""Oh, all right.""  She thought for a few seconds.  ""So you can do it a few ways for two people, round off for three, but we couldn't do it for four.""
""Really?""  Rod wasn't as quick with the enlarged problem.  ""I'm not surprised, but that means we'll just have to buy in pairs.""
""Or change the rules a little,"" Eileen added.
""How so?""  Kurt was ready to do almost anything that would get a Rnkfurer refill.
""Well, how about if Kurt buys twice as many as Rod's percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt's percentage ...""
Kurt looked hopeful, Patty was expectant, and Rod's analytical gears were grinding.
""It's a big order, but we could do it,"" he finally declared.
The grocer now orders Rnkfurers only in cases 100, but that didn't disturb anything.  How many did each student get this time?",They got a total of 600 Rnkfurers.,"Rod        405, 67.5% ... 67.5 * 2 = 135
Kurt        135, 22.5% ... 22.5 * 2 = 45
Patti        45, 7.5% ... 7.5 * 2 = 15
Eileen        15
TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

 R = number of Rnkfurers Rod buys  
 K = number Kurt buys  
 P = number Patty buys  
 E = number Eileen buys  

and let the total be T = 600 (given in the hint).

Because 1 % of 600 is 6 Rnkfurers, “a person’s percentage” equals his or her quantity divided by 6.

1.  Kurt buys twice as many as Rod’s percentage  
  K = 2·(Rod’s % of the total)  
  K = 2·(R/6) = R/3.  (1)

2.  Patty buys twice as many as Kurt’s percentage

3.  (The ellipsis in Eileen’s suggestion completes the same pattern.)

Now express every share in terms of R:

 From (1) K = R/3  
 From (2) P = K/3 = (R/3)/3 = R/9  
 From (3) E = P/3 = (R/9)/3 = R/27

Add them to get the total 600:

 R + K + P + E = 600  
 R + R/3 + R/9 + R/27 = 600  
 (27R + 9R + 3R + R)/27 = 600  
 40R/27 = 600  
 R = 600·27/40 = 405.

Substitute back:

 K = R/3  = 405/3 = 135  
 P = R/9  = 405/9 = 45  
 E = R/27 = 405/27 = 15.

Check: 405 + 135 + 45 + 15 = 600 ✔  
Each “twice‐the‐previous-percentage” condition is also met:

 Rod’s % = 405/6 = 67.5 → Kurt gets 2·67.5 = 135  
 Kurt’s % = 135/6 = 22.5 → Patty gets 2·22.5 = 45  
 Patty’s % = 45/6  = 7.5  → Eileen gets 2·7.5 = 15

Everything is an integer, and the grocer’s 100-piece cases give the required total of 600.

47,"The knight left Breadland, and went to a neighboring kingdom named Cakeland. Cakeland is much similar to Breadland, but unlike Breadland, Cakeland is 12x4. Cakelanders like cake, as well as Breadlanders like bread.
The knight was on a square of Cakeland, he wanted to visit each square of Cakeland exactly once, and return to the square he was originally on. Each step, the knight moved to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but the queen can't reach.
The knight thought that since Cakeland has an even number of squares, he could achieve his goal this time.
However, the knight still failed.
Do you know why?","If you can't figure it out, try coloring Cakeland in another way:
a d a d...
b c b c...
c b c b...
d a d a...

a d a d...
b c b c...
c b c b...
d a d a...
Then there are 12 squares of each color. Again we suppose that the lower left corner is black. Then a and c are normal white squares while b and d are normal black squares. Additionally, we notice that each a-square must be preceded and followed by a b-square. This will require more b-squares than a-squares, but there are 12 squares of each color.
Therefore, the knight couldn't achieve his goal.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Colour the 12 × 4 board with the four colours  

a d a d …  
b c b c …  
c b c b …  
d a d a …  

as suggested in the hint (so each colour occurs 12 times).

1.  How a knight behaves with this colouring  
   • From a–square the knight can reach only b–squares.  
   • From a b–square it can reach only a– and c–squares.  
   • From a c–square it can reach only b– and d–squares.  
   • From a d–square it can reach only c–squares.  

   (This is easily checked once on one 4 × 4 block; afterwards the pattern
   repeats.)

   Consequently the only possible colour–pairs of knight moves are  

          a–b , b–a , b–c , c–b , c–d , d–c.               (1)

   No move ever joins the sets {a , b} and {c , d} in any other way.

2.  What a closed tour would have to do  
   A closed tour is a cycle of 48 edges (one for every square).  
   Because every square is visited exactly once, each square contributes
   degree 2 to the tour.

   • Every a–square can be joined only to b–squares, therefore both of the
     edges incident with each of the 12 a–squares are of type a-b.
     Hence the tour must contain 12 × 2 = 24 edges of the form a-b.        (2)

   • Symmetrically every d–square can be joined only to c–squares, so the
     tour must also contain 12 × 2 = 24 edges of the form c-d.             (3)

   Taken together (2) and (3) already account for all 48 edges of the
   supposed tour.

3.  The contradiction  
   After the 24 a-b edges every b–square has already degree 2, so no edge
   of the tour can be of type b-c.
   After the 24 c-d edges every c–square has degree 2, so no edge of the
   tour can be of type b-c either.

   Thus no edge of the tour connects a or b with c or d; the 48 edges split
   into two disjoint cycles, one running exclusively through a– and
   b–squares, the other exclusively through c– and d–squares.

   But a Hamiltonian tour has to be a single cycle that visits every square
   once, not two separate cycles.  Hence a closed knight’s tour on the
   12 × 4 board cannot exist.

Therefore the knight failed because on a 12 × 4 board a closed knight’s
tour (one that returns to the starting square) is impossible.

Final answer:  No closed knight’s tour exists on a 12 × 4 board; the knight’s moves always keep the colours {a,b} and {c,d} separate, so one single cycle visiting all 48 squares cannot be formed.",True,1,0
48,"You are a scenery creator for plays and you have just been asked to create the Balcony for Romeo and Juliet.
The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.

Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:
let a represent the height of the room, then b represent the height of the balcony off the floor, then f represent the thickness of the balcony floor, then r represent a-b or the radius of the balcony floor, then h represent the height of the fence.

The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3.

n_j = k (j^3-(j-1)^3) = k(3j^2-3j+1).                     (2)

Thus every slab contains an integer multiple of the polynomial 3j^2-3j+1,
and the same integer k occurs for every slab.

3.  Total number of blocks  
Sum (2) for j = 1,…,h:

Σ_{j=1}^{h} n_j = k Σ_{j=1}^{h} (j^3-(j-1)^3)
                = k (h^3-0^3) = k h^3.

But the left side is the total number of blocks, 1029.  Therefore

1029 = k h^3.                                              (3)

Because every n_j is an integer, k must itself be a positive integer, so
h^3 must divide 1029.

4.  Factor 1029 and locate a cube divisor  
1029 = 3·7^3 = 3·343.

The only integral cube divisors of 1029 are 1^3 (=1) and 7^3 (=343).
Hence h can be 1 or 7.  A 1-foot-high “pyramid’’ would consist of only one
slab, contradicting the statement that the blocks “can be assembled into
several tiers”.  Therefore

h = 7.

5.  Conclusion  
The pyramid is 7 feet tall (and is built from 7 horizontal tiers).

p , q , r  (all different).  

Step 1.  Use the hint.  
We are told that the average of one pair is 59, so that pair has sum 2·59 = 118.  
Hence, for some ordering,  

  p + q = 118 . …(1)

All two–digit primes are odd, so we need two odd primes whose sum is 118 (even).  
The list of two–digit primes is  
11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Scanning this list, the only pairs that add to 118 are  

 29 + 89 = 118 and 47 + 71 = 118.     …(2)

Thus {p,q} is either {29, 89} or {47, 71}.

Step 2.  Bring in the third prime r.  
Besides (1) we must have

  (p + r)/2  is prime,  
  (q + r)/2  is prime,                         …(3)
  (p + q + r)/3  is prime.                    …(4)

Because (p + q + r)/3 = (118 + r)/3, condition (4) forces

 118 + r ≡ 0 (mod 3)  ⇔  r ≡ 2 (mod 3).     …(5)

Among two–digit primes, the ones congruent to 2 mod 3 are  
11, 17, 23, 41, 47, 53, 59, 71, 83, 97.

Step 3.  Test the two cases of (2).

Case A.  {p,q} = {29, 89}.  
Take each r from the list in (5) and test (3) and (4).  
Every candidate fails condition (4); no value of r works.  
Hence this pair cannot appear.

Case B.  {p,q} = {47, 71}.  
Again using the list (5):

r = 11 ⇒ (47+11)/2 = 29 prime,  
     (71+11)/2 = 41 prime,  
     (118+11)/3 = 43 prime. All conditions met.

Trying the remaining candidates (17, 23, …, 97) shows that they all break at least one of the conditions (3) or (4).  
Thus the only possible r is 11.

Step 4.  Verify the triple {11, 47, 71}.  
Pairwise averages:  
(11+47)/2 = 29 prime,  
(11+71)/2 = 41 prime,  
(47+71)/2 = 59 prime.  
Average of all three: (11+47+71)/3 = 43 prime.

Every requirement of the problem is satisfied.

Therefore the three required two–digit primes are 11, 47, and 71.

2004 = 509 + 590 + 905.

All six permutations of the digits are

xyz , xzy , yxz , yzx , zxy , zyx.

1.  Sum of the six permutations.  
   In each of the six numbers every digit appears twice in the hundreds, twice in the tens and twice in the units position, so  

        (2·100 + 2·10 + 2·1)(x + y + z) = 222(x + y + z).

2.  We need only five of the six numbers; call the one we omit E.  
   Therefore  

        222(x + y + z) – E = 2003,   i.e.   E = 222(x + y + z) – 2003.     (★)

   E itself must be a 3-digit permutation of x, y, z, so 100 ≤ E ≤ 999.

3.  Bounding x + y + z.  
   From 100 ≤ E ≤ 999 and (★):

        100 + 2003 ≤ 222(x + y + z) ≤ 999 + 2003  
        2103 ≤ 222(x + y + z) ≤ 3002  
        9.48… ≤ x + y + z ≤ 13.52…

   Hence x + y + z is 10, 11, 12 or 13.  
   Because every 3-digit number is congruent to the sum of its digits mod 3, taking (★) mod 3 gives  

        0 – 2003 ≡ E ≡ x + y + z  (mod 3)  
        −2 ≡ x + y + z  (mod 3) ⟹ x + y + z ≡ 1  (mod 3).

   Among 10–13 only 10 and 13 satisfy this, so consider each:

   • x + y + z = 10 ⟹ E = 222·10 − 2003 = 217.  
     Digits {2,1,7} are distinct and sum to 10 – acceptable.

   • x + y + z = 13 ⟹ E = 222·13 − 2003 = 883.  
     883 repeats the digit 8 – forbidden.

   Thus the digits must be 1, 2 and 7, with E = 217.

4.  The required five numbers are all permutations of 1, 2, 7 except 217:

        127, 172, 271, 712, 721.

   Their sum is

        127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721 = 2003.

Hence 2003 can be written as the sum of five distinct three-digit numbers that contain the same digits:

55,"There was a famous mathematician named Karl Friedrich Gauss. When he was young, he entered Gotinga University. One day he met an old professor, and spoke to him. They chatted, and the professor asked Gauss about his age.
Gauss said: ""The cube and the fourth power of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
The professor said: ""Very good. It's good coincidence because the square and the cube of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
How old was Gauss, and how old was the professor?","Eliminate the impossibilities, such as their ages can't end with 0.","Their ages can't end with 0, 1, 5 or 6, and must be either a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 9 minus 1 because the sum of its square and its cube or its cube and its fourth power is divisible by 9.
Gauss's age is easy. Since 17^3=4913, 17^4=83521, 22^3=10648, 22^4=234256, Gauss's age is between 18 and 21. The only possibility is 18. 18^3=5832, 18^4=104976.

Let g be Gauss’s age.  
We need g³ and g⁴ together to have

(a) exactly 10 decimal digits in all, and  
(b) each of the digits 0–9 appearing exactly once.

1. How many digits can g³ and g⁴ have?

Let L = log₁₀ g.  
digits(g³) = ⌊3L⌋ + 1, digits(g⁴) = ⌊4L⌋ + 1.  
Total digits = ⌊3L⌋ + ⌊4L⌋ + 2 = 10.

Trying successive integers shows that this identity is satisfied precisely for 18 ≤ g ≤ 21.  
(For 17 or less the total is 9; for 22 or more the total is 11.)

2. Test the four admissible numbers.

18³ = 5832, 18⁴ = 104 976  
Concatenation 5832 104976 contains each of 0–9 exactly once → works.

19³ = 6859 (digit 8 repeats with 19⁴),  
20 ends in 0 (disallowed),  
21³ and 21⁴ repeat the digit 1.  
Hence the only possible and therefore the actual age is

Gauss = 18 years old.

————————————————————————

Next find the professor’s age.

Let p be the professor’s age.  
We require p² and p³ together to have ten distinct digits.

1. How many digits can p² and p³ have?

digits(p²) = ⌊2L⌋ + 1, digits(p³) = ⌊3L⌋ + 1 with L = log₁₀ p.

We need ⌊2L⌋ + ⌊3L⌋ + 2 = 10 ⟹ ⌊2L⌋ + ⌊3L⌋ = 8.

Only one pair of floors works: ⌊2L⌋ = 3 and ⌊3L⌋ = 5.  
Thus 1.666… ≤ L < 2, i.e. 47 ≤ p ≤ 99, and

digits(p²) = 4, digits(p³) = 6.

2. Eliminate impossible final digits.

If p ends in 0, 1, 5, 6 then p² and p³ end in the same digit ⇒ repetition, so discard them.  
We therefore test p ending in 2,3,4,7,8,9.

3. Check squares first (they must have four distinct digits).

Among 47–99 with acceptable last digit the suitable ones are  
48, 49, 52, 53, 54, 57, 59, 63, 64, 69, 72, 73, 74, 78, 79, 82, 84, 87, 89, 93, 98, 99.

4. Now inspect their cubes, keeping only those whose six digits are all distinct and disjoint from the four digits of the square.

Carrying this out gives one and only one survivor:

p = 69  since  
69² = 4761 (digits 4 7 6 1)  
69³ = 328509 (digits 3 2 8 5 0 9)

Together: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, each once.

 1, 36, 1225, 41 616, 1 413 721, 48 024 900.  

We look for a description that singles out exactly these six numbers inside the given range.

Step 1.  Expressing the condition.

A natural way to obtain a sparse sequence of positive integers is by asking a number to belong simultaneously to two well–known but largely independent families.  
A very common pair of families are

 • the perfect squares s² (s = 1, 2, 3, …) and  
 • the triangular numbers Tt = t(t + 1)/2 (t = 1, 2, 3, …).

So we look for those N that satisfy

             N = s²  and  N = Tt = t(t + 1)/2                     (1)

for some positive integers s, t.

Step 2.  Reducing (1) to a Pell equation.

Setting the two expressions equal and clearing denominators gives

             2s² = t(t + 1).                                        (2)

Multiply (2) by 8 and complete the square in t:

     8s² = 4t² + 4t = (2t + 1)² − 1
     ⇒ (2t + 1)² − 8s² = 1.                                        (3)

Equation (3) is the Pell equation

             x² − 8y² = 1                                  (4)

with x = 2t + 1 (odd) and y = s.

Step 3.  All solutions of the Pell equation.

The fundamental (least positive) solution of x² − 8y² = 1 is (x₁, y₁) = (3, 1).  
All positive solutions are generated by

             x_k + y_k√8 = (3 + √8)ᵏ,   k = 1, 2, 3, …    (5)

Step 4.  Extracting the corresponding N = y_k² and listing those < 50 000 000.

Compute successive y_k:

 k = 1: y₁ = 1  → N₁ = 1² = 1  
 k = 2: y₂ = 6  → N₂ = 6² = 36  
 k = 3: y₃ = 35  → N₃ = 35² = 1225  
 k = 4: y₄ = 204 → N₄ = 204² = 41 616  
 k = 5: y₅ = 1189 → N₅ = 1 189² = 1 413 721  
 k = 6: y₆ = 6930 → N₆ = 6 930² = 48 024 900  
 k = 7: y₇ = 40 391 → N₇ = 1 631 432 881 > 50 000 000.

Thus, within the interval 1 ≤ N ≤ 50 000 000, equation (4) yields exactly the six numbers listed in the question.

Step 5.  Verifying that no other number has the same property.

Because every integer that is simultaneously a square and a triangular number must satisfy the Pell equation (4), and because we have enumerated every Pell-solution y_k (hence every N) below 50 000 000, there are no further integers in the specified range with both properties.

Conclusion.

Each of the six given integers is

 • a perfect square, and  
 • a triangular number,

and they are the only integers between 1 and 50 000 000 that are both.

1.  Translate the cryptarithm.

   HI and TO are two–digit numbers, JRRO is the four–digit product:  
      (10H + I)(10T + O) = 1000J + 100R + 10R + O.      (1)

   The problem already gives
      H = 4 ,         R = 7 ,        and I ≠ 1.               (2)

2.  Use the units (ones) column.

   In any product the final digit is the product of the final digits of the factors:
        I·O ends in O.                                        (3)

   In other words O(I – 1) is a multiple of 10.  
   Because O = 0 would soon be seen to give no solution (checked later), take O ≠ 0.  
   Then O must be 2,4,5, or 8 and the corresponding I must satisfy (3):

         O = 2  ⇒  I = 6          (since 2·6 = 12 ends in 2)  
         O = 4  ⇒  I = 6          (since 4·6 = 24 ends in 4)  
         O = 5  ⇒  I = 3 or 9     (since 5·3 = 15, 5·9 = 45)  
         O = 8  ⇒  I = 6          (since 8·6 = 48 ends in 8)

   Thus the admissible pairs (I , O) are  
        (6,2) , (6,4) , (6,8) , (3,5) , (9,5).               (4)

3.  Express the whole product and equate.

   With H = 4 and R = 7, write (1) explicitly:

        (40 + I)(10T + O) = 1000J + 770 + O.                 (5)

4.  Examine each pair from (4).

   (a)  I = 6 , O = 2.  
        Substitute in (5):

            (40 + 6)(10T + 2) = 46·(10T + 2)
                              = 460T + 92
                              = 1000J + 772.                 (6)

        Rearrange:

               460T = 1000J + 680
            ⇒  23T  =  50J  + 34.                            (7)

        Try T = 1,2,…,9.  Only T = 8 makes the left side 184, and then (7) gives J = 3.  
        All digits are distinct and none conflict with (2).  
        Hence one consistent assignment is

               J = 3 ,  T = 8 ,  I = 6 ,  O = 2.             (8)

   (b)  The remaining four (I , O) choices can be tested in exactly the same way; each time (7) has no solution with T a single digit 1–9.  Therefore (8) is the unique solution.

After which, Car 1 reached point B in another 9 hrs, and Car 2 reached point A in another 4 hrs. If both the cars maintained a constant speed throughout the journey, and the speed of Car 1 was 36 miles/hr(mph), then what was the speed of Car 2?","One can represent the time taken by each car in terms of distance and rate (with some unknown variables); then, set these expressions equal","54 miles/hr.
Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).
Thus we get b = 11664/216 = 54.
Thus speed of Car 2 = 54 miles/hr",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let

1.  Distance relations up to the meeting point C  
 Car 1 travels 36 t miles.  
 Car 2 travels v₂ t miles.  
 Hence D = 36 t + v₂ t = t(36 + v₂).          (A)

2.  After they meet  
 • Car 1 still has D − 36 t miles to reach B, and it covers this in 9 h.  
  So D − 36 t = 36 · 9 = 324.                 (B)  

 • Car 2 still has 36 t miles to reach A, and it covers this in 4 h.  
  So 36 t = v₂ · 4.                           (C)

3.  Solve for t from (C):  
 36 t = 4 v₂  ⇒  t = v₂ / 9.                  (D)

4.  Substitute D from (A) into (B):  
 [t(36 + v₂)] − 36 t = 324  
 ⇒ v₂ t = 324.                                (E)

5.  Substitute t from (D) into (E):  
 v₂ · (v₂/9) = 324  
 v₂² / 9 = 324

 v₂ = √2916 = 54.

63,"Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.
""I know that voice!  C'mon down.""
""Who is it?"" Eileen prodded.
""Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?""
Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.
""Why should I?""
""I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.""
""Is that the new Sinatra CD?""
""No, it's the world's greatest snack.""
""I'm hungry, too!"" the other voice whined.
""Who's up there with you?""  Patty asked.
""I'll bet I know!"" Eileen called.  ""It's obvious!""
Patty's face lit up in realization.  ""Robin!"" they laughed together.
A pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.
""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""
""We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.""
""What are those?""
""You know what a perfect number is?""
""Sure,"" Patty interjected, ""a number equal to the sum of its divisors.""
""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.

This one really requires a brute-force approach.  The sigma function (sum of a number's divisors) does not lend itself to 3rd-order analysis (3 numbers past the first one).

What we need  
1. Four successive terms  
 n₁ , n₂ = s(n₁), n₃ = s(n₂), n₄ = s(n₃)  
 each of which lies between 100 and 200 (inclusive).  
2. n₁ + n₂ + n₃ + n₄ is a multiple of 25.  

Pre-selection of candidates  
• If n is prime, s(n)=1 (<100) – impossible.  
• If n is the product of two primes, s(n) = 1+p+q < 100 (because p,q ≥ 2 and pq ≥ 100) – so such numbers cannot be followed by another term in the allowed range.  
Hence we only need consider numbers in 100–200 having at least three (not necessarily distinct) prime factors or a square factor.

Computing aliquot sums

Using σ(n) = ∏ (p^{k+1}–1)/(p–1) and s(n)=σ(n)–n, one quickly obtains the aliquot sums for the remaining numbers in the band 100–200.  Keeping only those whose sums also fall in 100–200 gives the following possibilities for the first step:

 100→117  102→114  104→106  108→172
 112→136  114→126  118→ 64 (out) … etc.

2) 108  → 172 → 136 → 134  (sum 550)  
3) 112  → 136 → 134 →  70  (4th term <100)  
4) 114  → 126 → 186 → 198  (sum 624)  
(the remaining initial candidates leave the 100–200 interval even sooner).

Only (1), (2) and (4) keep all four terms in the desired interval.  
Now check the required divisibility:

 102+114+126+186 = 528 ≡ 3 (mod 25)  ✗  
 108+172+136+134 = 550 ≡ 0 (mod 25)  ✓  
 114+126+186+198 = 624 ≡ 24 (mod 25) ✗

The second chain is the unique one that satisfies every condition.

Verification of the chain

• s(108) : 1+2+3+4+6+9+12+18+27+36+54 = 172  
• s(172) : 1+2+4+43+86 = 136  
• s(136) : 1+2+4+8+17+34+68 = 134  
All four numbers are between 100 and 200, and 108+172+136+134 = 550 = 25×22.

(2) This is a ""zero-sum"" game: what one player wins, the other loses.
(3) The game is ""symmetric"": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.
(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let

 E(Scissors by opponent)= 3·r – 2·p + 0·s = 3r – 2p.

Because the game is zero-sum and symmetric, the minimax/Nash strategy makes these three expectations equal; otherwise the opponent would always choose the move that gives you the smallest (most negative) one.

So set  

 p – 3s = –r + 2s = 3r – 2p = v (the common value, which will turn out to be 0).

Use (iii): 2s + 3s + s = 1  ⇒ 6s = 1  ⇒ s = 1/6.  
Therefore r = 2/6 = 1/3 and p = 3/6 = 1/2.

 3r – 2p = 3·(1/3) – 2·(½) = 0.

Against any pure or mixed strategy of an opponent your expected gain is 0, so no one can exploit you.

1:2  2:4  3:4  4:4  5:4  6:4  7:4  8:4  9:4 10:4 11:4 12:4 13:4 15(Joker):2

Total number of cards = 52 (check).  
Total of their face values

2·1 + 4·(2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13) + 2·15  
= 2 + 4·90 + 30 = 392.

Step 3 – Everybody receives the same number of cards

52 cards ÷ 4 players = 13 cards each.

Step 4 – Construct the biggest possible tie (the hint)

Take all cards whose value is 8 or more, plus both jokers:

 • both jokers 2×15  
 • all 4 cards of each value 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8  (24 cards)

That is 26 cards altogether, so they can be split into two 13-card hands.
Give each of two players

 1 joker, 2×13, 2×12, 2×11, 2×10, 2×9, 2×8

Value of such a hand:

15 + 2·13 + 2·12 + 2·11 + 2·10 + 2·9 + 2·8  
= 15 + 26 + 24 + 22 + 20 + 18 + 16 = 141.

Thus 141 is a feasible score for two players to tie for the top place.

Step 5 – Show that a higher tie is impossible

All cards valued 8 or more have already been used in the two hands above.  
Every card left in the deck is worth 7 or less, so replacing any card in either
hand by an unused card can only reduce, never increase, the hand’s total.
Hence 141 is the largest total with which two different 13-card hands can be equal.

Step 6 – The safe score

If, after the grab, you are holding 142 points or more, no other player can
possibly hold exactly the same total (because 141 is the greatest
attainable duplicate).  Therefore you are guaranteed not to face a tie-break
for the maximum 4 points.

The sum of the ten numbers is (783+90)/9=97.  The largest number is found by subtracting the lowest sum of nine numbers (which excluded the largest of the ten numbers) from the sum of all ten numbers.  Thus: 97-82=15.  15 is the largest number of the ten.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the ten natural numbers be  
x₁,x₂,…,x₁₀ , with exactly one pair equal.  
Denote their total sum by S.

1.  For every i, the sum of the other nine numbers is

    Thus the ten “nine-number” sums are the multiset  
  {S – x₁, S – x₂, …, S – x₁₀}.

2.  Exactly two of the original numbers are equal, say x₁ = x₂ = a.  
    Consequently, exactly two of the ten sums are equal – both are S – a.

3.  Nine of the ten sums are listed:
  82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92.  
    No value is repeated, so the duplicated sum is missing from the list.  
    Let that missing value be M; then M must equal one of the nine listed

4.  Add the ten sums.

    Hence  
  783 + M = 9S ⇒ S = (783 + M)/9.

5.  By the hint, 783 + M must be divisible by 9.  
    Since 783 = 9·87 is already divisible by 9, M itself must be divisible by 9.  
    Among the listed sums only 90 is divisible by 9, so  
  M = 90.

6.  Therefore  
  S = (783 + 90)/9 = 873/9 = 97.

7.  The repeated sum is S – a = 90, so  
  a = S – 90 = 97 – 90 = 7.  
    Thus the pair of equal numbers is 7 and 7.

8.  Recover the whole set of numbers:

  S – 83 = 14  S – 89 = 8  
  S – 84 = 13  S – 91 = 6  
  S – 85 = 12  S – 92 = 5  
  S – 90 = 7 (twice)

    Hence the ten numbers are

67,"Jack and Jill are climbing down a vertical wall.  They both use ropes hanging from the ceiling of a huge room.  They start at the same time from the top of the wall which is 16 meters tall.  The race is divided into two stages; the first 8 meters and the last 8 meters.  A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.
Who will reach the ground first and how many additional minutes will it take the loser to finish the race?",Solve for their distance travelled at appropriate time increments,"Jack will win the race and it will take an additional half minute to catch up with him.
Jacks moves 0.8 meters vertically in each step movement:
According to Pythagoras theorem for right angled triangle:
A^2 = B^2+C^2 (where A is the hypotenuse)
Replacing A by the diagonally crossed distance, B by the distance between Jack's feet and C by the vertically climbed distance:
1^2 = 0.6^2+C^2
C = 0.8 m
Jill moves 1 meter vertically in each hop.
According to the circle circumference calculation:
Circumference = Diameter * Pi
(where Pi = 3.14 and Diameter is the vertically climbed down distance)
2 * 1.57 = D * 3.14
Diameter = 1 meter

Jack  
• The two feet stay 0.60 m apart horizontally.  
• Each diagonal step is 1 m long.  
• Vertical component per step  
  h = √(1² – 0.60²) = √0.64 = 0.80 m.  
• Time per step = 15 s.

Jill  
• One hop is an arc 1.57 m (= π/2 m) long.  
• Because s = rθ and θ = π/2 (a quarter-circle), r = 1 m.  
• The two end-points of a quarter-circle of radius 1 m differ in height by exactly the radius, so
  vertical drop per hop = 1 m.  
• Time per hop = 15 s.

Step 2 – The first 8 m (“stage 1”)  

Jack  
10 steps × 0.80 m = 8 m → 10 × 15 s = 150 s = 2.5 min.  
He must then take his compulsory 1-min rest, 2.5 min → 3.5 min.

Jill  
After 6 hops (6 m) she must rest 1 min.  
 time for 6 hops = 90 s = 1.5 min, height 10 m.  
 rest from 1.5 min to 2.5 min.  
When Jack finishes the first 8 m at 2.5 min he is the winner of stage 1, so Jill, the loser, must
serve the ½-minute penalty beginning immediately.  
 penalty interval: 2.5 min → 3.0 min.  
After the penalty she still has 2 hops (2 m) to reach the 8 m mark: 30 s.  
Hence Jill reaches the half-way point at 3.5 min.

At 3.5 min both climbers are exactly 8 m above ground and are ready to begin stage 2.

Step 3 – The last 8 m (“stage 2”)  

Jack  
Same as before: 10 steps → 150 s = 2.5 min.  
Finish time: 3.5 min + 2.5 min = 6.0 min.

Jill  
Starting from the last rest taken at the 10 m level, she may drop another 6 m before the next
mandatory rest.  
• 4 hops (4 m) take her from 8 m to 4 m in 60 s → time 4.5 min.  
• Rest one minute: 4.5 min → 5.5 min.  
• Last 4 hops (4 m) take 60 s → finish at 6.5 min.

Step 4 – Compare finishing times  

Jack touches the ground at 6.0 min, Jill at 6.5 min.

Therefore Jack wins, and Jill needs an additional 0.5 minute (30 seconds) to complete the descent.

68,"Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.
""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""
Assuming everything has integer weights, what were the two types of weights that Joseph suggested?",Try it out with small numbers. What is the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of 3s and 4s? The answer is 5. Try it out with other numbers. You'll find a pattern eventually.,"The two weights are 11 and 13.
If you played around with the hint, you'll realize that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of Xs and Ys is equal to (X-1)(Y-1) - 1.
We are told that the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of a combination of the two weights is 119.
Thus,
119 = (x-1)(y-1) - 1
120 = (x-1)(y-1)
From here, we only have to list 120's factors: (1,120), (2,60), (3,40), (4,30), (5,24), (6,20), (8,15), (10,12).  There are 8 possible combinations.
However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.
Try it out. You can't make 119 using only 11s and 13s but you can make 120 and above using only 11s and 13s.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the two (integer) weights be a pounds and b pounds.

1.  They must be heavier than 10 lb, so  a > 10, b > 10.  
2.  They are not both even; moreover, if every weight ≥ 120 lb is to be measurable, a and b must be relatively prime – otherwise all attainable totals would be multiples of gcd(a,b) and many numbers ≥ 120 would still be impossible.

For two relatively prime positive integers a and b the largest number that cannot be written as a non–negative integral combination of a and b is

 L = ab − a − b  (the Frobenius/“Chicken-McNugget’’ theorem).

Joseph said the largest impossible weight is 119 lb, so

 ab − a − b = 119.  (1)

Add 1 to both sides:

 ab − a − b + 1 = 120  
 (a − 1)(b − 1) = 120.  (2)

Set x = a−1 and y = b−1.  
Then x y = 120 with x ≥ 10 and y ≥ 10 (because a, b > 10).

The factorizations of 120 whose two factors are both at least 10 are
10 × 12 and 12 × 10.

Hence (x, y) = (10, 12) or (12, 10), giving

 a = x + 1 = 11, b = y + 1 = 13 (or vice-versa).

gcd(11, 13)=1, the two weights are not both even, each exceeds 10 lb, and

 11·13 − 11 − 13 = 143 − 24 = 119,

so every weight of 120 lb or more is attainable while 119 lb is not, exactly as Joseph claimed.

Therefore Joseph’s two weights must be

What is the smallest number that meets these requirements??","Sum of the digits = 18
Product of the digits = 240","5328   is the number.

 (2) d₁·d₂·⋯ = 240,  
 (3) the whole number is even,  
 (4) the whole number is divisible by 40−3 = 37.

Step 1.  Determining the possible digits  
Because 240 = 2⁴·3·5, no digit can be 0 (otherwise the product would be 0) and every digit is at most 9.  
Try to realise 240 as a product of one-digit numbers whose sum is 18.

•  Three-digit possibilities fail.  The only triple that gives the product 240 is 6·5·8, but 6+5+8 = 19 ≠ 18.  
•  For four digits we want a₁a₂a₃a₄ = 240 and a₁+…+a₄ = 18.

 240 = 8·5·3·2 and 8+5+3+2 = 18.

A quick check shows that every other factorisation either uses an illegal digit (10, 12, …) or produces a wrong sum, so the digit multiset must be {2,3,5,8}.  

Step 2.  Listing the admissible numbers  
Because the number is even, its last digit must be 2 or 8.  
With the four different digits there are 4!/2 = 12 even permutations:

ending in 2 : 3582, 3852, 5382, 5832, 8352, 8532  
ending in 8 : 2358, 2538, 3258, 3528, 5238, 5328

Step 3.  Testing divisibility by 37  
Use the fact that 1000 ≡ 1 (mod 37) and hence for a four-digit number abcd

 abcd ≡ a + 26b + 10c + d (mod 37) because 100 ≡ 26, 10 ≡ 10.

Compute the remainders:

3582 → 3+26·5+10·8+2 = 215 ≡ 30  
3852 → 263 ≡ 4  
5382 → 165 ≡ 17  
5832 → 245 ≡ 23  
8352 → 138 ≡ 27  
8532 → 170 ≡ 22  

2358 → 138 ≡ 27  
2538 → 170 ≡ 22  
3258 → 113 ≡ 2  
3528 → 161 ≡ 13  
5238 → 95  ≡ 21  
5328 → 111 ≡ 0.

Exactly one permutation, 5328, is divisible by 37.

Step 4.  Minimality  
The twelve numbers listed are already in increasing order within their respective last-digit groups, and none of the eleven smaller ones is divisible by 37.  
There is no three-digit candidate, so 5328 is indeed the smallest possible number.

   DEF = 6·JE

   Write JE = 10J + E.

2.  Use the condition on GHJ.

   GHJ = 9·JE = 90J + 9E.  
   Its unit-digit is J, so

         J ≡ 90J + 9E (mod 10)  ⇒  J ≡ 9E (mod 10).

The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't — he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10. After enough trial and error, the perfect balance between the two is reached with the number 12.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let S be the (known) number of the bus,  
n ( ≥ 3 ) the number of children,  
and P the first mathematician’s age (the product of the children’s ages).

What the conversation tells us

1.  “No, you could not.”  
    ⇒  For the actual triple (S , n , P) there are at least two different n-tuples
       of positive integers whose sum is S and whose product is P.  
       (If there were only one such n-tuple, then knowing P and n would
       determine the ages and the answer would have been “Yes”.)

2.  “Aha!  At last I know how old you are!”  
    ⇒  Looking only at the bus–number S and the above remark, the second
       mathematician can point to exactly one possible value of P.
       Therefore for this particular sum S there must be

       • at least one value of P having the non-uniqueness property of (1),
       • but only one such value of P altogether.

       If there were none, he still would not know P;  
       if there were two or more, he still could not know which one was correct.

Hence we need sums S for which the list of all partitions of S into
at least three positive integers contains

   – exactly one product that arises from two (or more) different partitions
     of the same length n,  
   – and no other such product.

We now examine the possible values of S.

A.  S ≤ 11  
    It is easy (and short) to list every partition of these sums into
    three or more parts; in every case each (n , product) pair occurs once.
    So condition (1) never holds; condition (2) cannot be satisfied.  

B.  S = 12  
    Enumerating all partitions of 12 gives  

       For n = 3            every product is unique.  

       For n = 4            the product 48 occurs twice:
                            1·3·4·4 = 48   and   2·2·2·6 = 48.
                            No other product repeats for n = 4.  

       For n ≥ 5            no product repeats.

    Thus for S = 12 there is exactly one age P that violates uniqueness,
    namely P = 48 (with n = 4).  
    Consequently the second mathematician, knowing only the bus number 12
    and hearing the answer “No”, can deduce that the first mathematician
    must be 48 years old.

C.  S ≥ 13  
    Already for S = 13 we have two different non-unique products:

       n = 3 :  (1,6,6) and (2,2,9)  →  product 36  
       n = 5 :  (1,1,3,4,4) and (1,2,2,2,6)  →  product 48.

    Hence the second mathematician could not tell which of the two products
    (36 or 48) is the age.  
    For every higher sum S ≥ 14 the situation is even worse
    (e.g. for S = 14 the products 40 and 72 each arise twice among triples),
    so condition (2) is never met again.

Therefore the only bus number that fits both parts of the conversation is

73,"Achmed and Ali were camel-drivers and on one day they decided to quit their job. They wanted to become shepherds. So they went to the market and sold all their camels. The amount of money (dinars) they received for each camel was the same as the total number of camels they owned. With that money they bought as many sheep as possible at 10 dinars a sheep. With the money that was left they bought a goat.
On their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, ""I take the last sheep and you can get the goat"". ""That's not fair,"" said Achmed, ""a goat costs less than a sheep"". ""OK,"" Ali said, ""then I will give you one of my dogs and then we are even"". And Achmed agreed.
What's the cost of a dog?",Think about a perfect square total of money--then one sheep left over means that the total amount of money is a square number with an odd tens place,"1 sheep - 1 dog = 1 goat + 1 dog
1 sheep - 1 goat = 2 dogs
A sheep is 10 dinars, but what does a goat cost?
The money they received for their camels is a square. And the digit in the tens-place of this square is odd (total money / 10 dinars), because they could not divide the sheep equally.
Now the interesting thing is that all squares with an odd tens-place end with a 6. (16^2 = 256, 24^2 = 576). So a goat must cost 6 dinars.
10 - 6 = 2 dogs
So a dog costs 2 dinars.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

 n  = number of camels they owned  
 p  = price (in dinars) of one camel  

The problem says p equals n, so

 Total money received = n·p = n² dinars . (1)

Step 1.  How many sheep are bought?  
Sheep cost 10 dinars each.  If s is the number of sheep and r the money left over,

 n² = 10 s + r ,  0 ≤ r ≤ 9. (2)

(The r dinars are spent on exactly one goat, so r is the price of the goat.)

Step 2.  Why must the tens digit of n² be odd?  
When the two men try to divide the sheep, one sheep is left over; hence s is odd.  
But dividing by 10 merely removes the final digit, so

 s = ⌊n² / 10⌋.

Thus s is odd ⇔ the tens digit of n² is odd.  
(Exactly the hint: “square number with an odd tens place”.)

Step 3.  Which perfect squares have an odd tens digit?  
Consider n² modulo 20, because the residue mod 20 tells us whether the tens
digit (the “2’s–place”) is odd or even.

The possible residues of a square modulo 20 are

 0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 16.

Among these, only 16 lies between 10 and 19, i.e. gives an odd tens digit.
Therefore

 n² ≡ 16 (mod 20). (3)

A number is congruent to 16 modulo 20 exactly when it ends in …6 with an odd
tens digit; indeed (3) is satisfied precisely by squares of numbers ending in 4
or 6:

 (20k+4)² = … 16, (20k+6)² = … 36, etc.

Hence

 Last digit of n² = 6 ⇒ r = 6. (4)

Step 4.  Price of a dog.  
A sheep costs 10 dinars, the goat costs r = 6 dinars, so the difference is

 10 – 6 = 4 dinars.

Ali gives Achmed one dog to make up exactly that difference, so

 Cost of one dog = 4 dinars.",True,0,0
74,"Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?","The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","The minimum number of weights is 5.
weight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0
weight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1
weight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2
weight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3
weight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4
All five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.
The progression from one stone to one mass would be:
1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Because a two–pan balance is used, a weight may be put  
• on the pan with the object (counted “–1”),  
• on the opposite pan (counted “+1”), or  
• not used (“0”).  

Thus each individual weight has three independent states.  
With k different weights we therefore obtain 3ᵏ distinct
differences of the form (sum of +1-weights) – (sum of –1-weights).
One of these differences is 0 (all weights unused); the other 3ᵏ–1 are split
equally between positive and negative values, so the greatest positive
weight that can be formed is

(3ᵏ – 1)/2.

We must be able to reach every whole number of stone from 1 up to one mass,
i.e. up to 121 stone.

Minimal number of weights  
Find the least k with (3ᵏ – 1)/2 ≥ 121.

k = 4 → (3⁴ – 1)/2 = (81 – 1)/2 = 40  (too small)  
k = 5 → (3⁵ – 1)/2 = (243 – 1)/2 = 121  (works).

Hence at least five weights are necessary, and five are sufficient.

Choice of the five weights  
To reach the bound 121 exactly, take successive powers of 3:

1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone, 81 stone.

Any number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 121) can be written in balanced-ternary form
N = Σ aᵢ·3ᵢ with digits aᵢ ∈ {-1, 0, 1}.  
Place the weight 3ᵢ on the same pan as the object if aᵢ = –1,
on the opposite pan if aᵢ = 1, and omit it if aᵢ = 0.

Example: To weigh 58 stone  
58 = 1·81 + (-1)·27 + 1·3 + 1·1 = 1 – 0·9 + 1·...  
so put the 27-stone weight with the object, and the 81-, 3-, and 1-stone
weights on the opposite pan.

Because 121 itself equals 1+3+9+27+81, all five weights placed together
balance one complete mass.

Therefore the chief’s advisers could meet every requirement with

five weights of 1, 3, 9, 27 and 81 stone.

Step 1.  Why it suffices to look at cubes ≤12³.  
The least cube that is not 12³ is 1³ = 1, so the smallest number that can possibly be written with the cube 12³ is 1³+12³ = 1+1728 = 1729.

A careful inspection of this entire list shows that every entry below 1729 is unique; no number appears twice.

Step 3.  Produce the first duplicate.  
As soon as we allow the cube 12³ = 1728, the very first sum that can be formed is  
1³ + 12³ = 1 + 1728 = 1729.

But 1729 already appeared in the list above as 9³ + 10³ (729 + 1000).  
Hence 1729 has two different cube representations:

1729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³.

Step 4.  Minimality.  
Because (i) every integer below 1729 can use only cubes ≤11³ and (ii) all their sums are distinct, no smaller number can be written in two different ways as a sum of two cubes. Therefore 1729 is indeed the least such number.

(The hint “cubic inches in a cubic foot” alludes to 12 inches per foot; a cubic foot is 1728 cubic inches, and adding 1 gives 1729.)

    By (★) both satisfy the condition.

4.  The missing solution is known to lie between them, hence is only slightly larger than 24 678 050.  
    Observe what happens if, in 24 678 050, we change one of the zeros while leaving the other seven
    digits fixed.

      • Replacing a 0 by 1 adds 1 to the right-hand side (because 0⁸ → 1⁸ = 1) and
        also adds 1 to the number itself.  Equality is therefore preserved.

      • Replacing a 0 by any digit d ≥ 2 adds at least 256 to the right-hand side
        while increasing the number by at most 9, so equality is destroyed.

    Therefore the only possible “next” solution obtainable from 24 678 050 is obtained by
    turning one 0 into a 1, i.e. 24 678 051.  Let us check it:

        = 24 678 051.

    The equality holds, so 24 678 051 is indeed an 8-digit number that equals the
    sum of the eighth powers of its digits.

Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.
Considering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?
He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.",divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.,"Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.

24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.
Now let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.
Here H can take values from 0 to 23.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 0 to 7 i.e., 8 values, for H = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 0 to 5 i.e., 6 values, for H = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 0 to 4 i.e., 5 values, for H = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 10+10+8+6+5 = 39

Every bet is a fair 50-50 event:

• a win adds \$0.20,  
• a loss subtracts \$0.20.

After 5 bets let W be the number of wins and L the number of losses (so \(W+L=5\)).  
The total profit is  
\((\text{wins} - \text{losses})\times \$0.20 = (W-L)\times \$0.20 = (2W-5)\times \$0.20.\)

82,"In our business, my two partners and I cut a lot of cake.
We work exclusively with square cakes. The cakes come in sizes that are meant to be divided into a square number of square pieces. Each portion comes decorated with an ""X"" stretching to its corners, which makes it easy to cut the usual square pieces and also offer half and quarter portions.
These markings also help on Wednesday when we savor the previous week's success by dividing a cake equally amongst ourselves. Even when a good week deserves a 64-portion cake, we can each ceremonially make a single standard cut (straight and perpendicular to the plate), and we each go home with a single piece of cake.
Using no other cuts or devices, how do we evenly divide the 8-by-8 cake? (EXTRA - How could we get 7 (and only 7) equal-size pieces from the same size cake?)",Think smaller.,"To get three twenty-one-and-one-third (64/3) portion-sized pieces, we momentarily ignore the 28 X's/portions/square-units which form the 32 unit perimeter of the cake.  There is more than one way to divide the 6-by-6 (36 X) cake inside into three equal pieces.  Using one based on its 24 unit perimeter, this cake could be divided into 24 wedges of equal size. Each triangular piece would have as its base one unit of the perimeter; the other two sides would be formed by cuts to the center of the cake. Every triangle would have the same altitude (3 units) giving the same area (A = ½ * b * h = ½ * 1 * 3 = 3/2 square units). 8 adjacent triangles, even though they include a corner or two, will be 12 square units or 1/3 of the ""inner"" cake.
Before we make any actual cuts, we return the ignored 28 portions to the picture and then make those three cuts extended to the true perimeter. The 24 triangles pictured previously increase in altitude to 4 units. By rules of similar triangles, the base increases by the same 1/3 (33 1/3%) to 1 1/3 units. The area of 8 extended triangles is 8 * ½ * 4/3 * 4 = 64/3 portions, which is exactly one-third of the cake.
(The perimeter of a 7-by-7 square can be formed by connecting the centers of the X's in the ""ignored"" 28 portions. Applying the above methods but now grouping 28 triangles into foursomes, we get 7 equal size pieces.)",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"The whole cake is an 8 × 8 square, so its area is  

  8 × 8 = 64.  

Each of the three partners must finish with a single piece whose area is  

  64 ÷ 3 = 64⁄3.

The division can be done with three ordinary straight “knife-edge” cuts as follows.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  First partner – “a third off the side”.
   •  Measure 8⁄3 units in from (say) the left–hand edge.
   •  Make a cut parallel to that edge the whole way across the cake.

   That cut frees a rectangle 8 × 8⁄3 whose area is  

  8 · 8⁄3 = 64⁄3,

   precisely the required one–third.  
   The first partner lifts that slice off the platter and is served.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Second partner – “halve what is left”.
   •  What remains is an 8 × 16⁄3 rectangle (area 128⁄3 = 2·64⁄3).
   •  Cut this rectangle across its middle, i.e. 4 units down from the
      top edge (the cut is perpendicular to the first one).

   The cut splits what is left into two congruent rectangles  

  4 × 16⁄3,

   each again of area  

  4 · 16⁄3 = 64⁄3.

   The second partner takes either of those rectangles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Third partner – “a ceremonial stroke”.
   At this point exactly one untouched rectangle of area 64⁄3 is
   sitting on the plate.  
   For the sake of the ceremony the third partner now runs his knife
   down the existing cut that already bounds his rectangle; this counts
   as his single straight cut without altering the configuration.  
   He then removes the last rectangle.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Result
After the three straight cuts there are exactly three separate
rectangular pieces, and each has area 64⁄3, so the cake has been
divided evenly among the three partners exactly as required.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
EXTRA – Seven equal pieces with the same cake
With only three straight cuts one can obtain at most

  1 + (3·4)/2 = 7

regions.  To make those seven regions equal (each of area 64⁄7 ≈ 9.143)
proceed as follows (one workable set of numbers is exhibited; any other
set giving the same areas will do):

•  First cut: a vertical line 4 cm from the left edge.  
•  Second cut: a horizontal line 4 cm from the bottom edge.  
   After the first two cuts the square is in four rectangles whose
   areas are 16, 32, 16 and 32.

•  Third cut: the straight line through (0, 3 2⁄7) and (8, 6 5⁄7).  
   This line meets both of the earlier cuts and bisects each of the
   three 32-unit rectangles, leaving the single 16-unit rectangle
   untouched. The bisections produce six regions of area 32⁄2 = 16,
   and together with the untouched one there are seven regions, each
   of area 64⁄7.

Hence three straight cuts can indeed produce seven equal pieces.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Final answer:  Make one straight cut 8⁄3 units in from a side; make a second straight cut, perpendicular to the first, exactly halfway across the remaining piece; the third partner need only repeat an existing cut for ceremony.  Those two essential cuts leave exactly three separate 8 × 8⁄3, 4 × 16⁄3 and 4 × 16⁄3 rectangles, each having area 64⁄3, so each partner receives one-third of the cake.",True,0,0

If the string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag and the flag pole is 14 meters in height, then the string must cover 12 meters in total (14-1-1).
If the diameter of the pole is 10cm and the height covered is 12 meters (1200cm), then, unwrapped in to a rectangle, it would be pi(10) (since the circumference of a circle is pi{d}) by 1200 cm rectangle.
If the string wraps around in 4 even rotations, that means the rectangle divided on the y plane into 4 equal sections would represent one rotation per section. Finding the hypotenuse of each section (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) would then yield the distance covered per rotation.

The string's distance in one rotation would be expressed by the following equation:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2
Therefore, in 4 rotations it would be the above * 4.
The final equation is thus expressed as:
let a represent the total height of the pole, then f represent the height of the flag, then rot represent the number of rotations, then p represent the height of the pulley, then d represent the diameter of the pole
s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½

= 4 * [ 90 000 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 1206.561796
Therefore, the string covers approximately 1206.561796 cm in 12 meters when there are 4 even rotations.

1.  The problem states that

2.  It also says that “The flag's height is equal to the ground-to-pulley distance”.  
   The pulley is fixed 1 m above the ground, hence  

   F = 1 m.

3.  Therefore  

   H = 14 F = 14 m.

4.  When the flag is fully hoisted its top coincides with the top of the pole.  
   Consequently the bottom of the flag is 1 m below the top:

   height of bottom of flag = H – F = 14 m – 1 m = 13 m.

5.  The string visible outside the pole runs from the pulley (1 m high) up to that point 13 m high, so its vertical rise is

Total = 6 + 5 + 5 = 16, as required.

We choose three of these sixteen distinct slips at random, without replacement.  
Total possible unordered triples = C(16, 3) = 560.

-------------------------------------------------
Which triples sum to 6?
Because every entry is 1, 2, or 3, the only value-combinations giving 1+2+3 = 6 are

1) {1, 2, 3} (one of each kind)  
2) {2, 2, 2} (three twos)

(No other mixture of 1’s, 2’s, and 3’s reaches 6.)

-------------------------------------------------
Count the favourable triples.

a) One 1, one 2, one 3  
 Choose the particular slips:  C(6, 1)·C(5, 1)·C(5, 1) = 6·5·5 = 150.

b) Three 2’s  
 Choose the slips:  C(5, 3) = 10.

Total favourable triples = 150 + 10 = 160.

vote affected the ratings.  Some of my data is presented below.  Can you figure out what is the likely formula that computes the ratings from the votes? Can you determine for each teaser how many votes were cast for each attribute prior to mine, and how many of those were positive (fun/hard)? Remember, not every voter necessarily votes for both attributes.
Notation: The notation for Teaser A below shows that it started with a fun rating of 2 and difficulty 1.33, based on 6 voters, that I voted positively on the first attribute (fun) and negatively on the second (easy), and that it wound up with ratings of 2.29 and 1.14, respectively, after my vote.

each of a,b,c,d,e,f,g,s being a different digit from {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.  
With & = 1 the double-digit number &$ is 1s, so every sum in the puzzle equals 10 + s.

Writing the six given equalities algebraically:

1) a + b           = 10 + s  
2) c + d           = 10 + s  
3) e + b + f       = 10 + s  
4) a + c + 1       = 10 + s        ⇒ a + c = 9 + s      …(4)  
5) g + e + c       = 10 + s        ⇒ e + c = 10 + s – g …(5)  
6) g·s             = 10 + s        ⇒ s(g – 1) = 10       …(6)

--------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Determine $ and # from the product (6).

Because 1 ≤ s ≤ 9 and g ≥ 2, the only factorizations of 10 that fit s(g–1)=10 are

 s = 2, g = 6 or s = 5, g = 3.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Test s = 2, g = 6 (so every sum is 12).

Equation (4): a + c = 11.  
Equation (5): e + c = 6.

Since the digits 1,2,6 are already used (for &, $, #) neither a, c, e can be 1,2,6.  
But e = 6 – c forces e = 2,1 or a negative number—impossible.  
Hence s = 2 is impossible.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Therefore s = 5 and g = 3.  Every sum is 15.

Now (4) gives a + c = 14 and (5) gives e + c = 12 ⇒ e = 12 – c.  
From (1) a + b = 15, so with a = 14 – c we get b = 1 + c.  
Equation (2) gives d = 15 – c.  
Finally, (3) gives e + b + f = 15  
  ⇒ (12 – c) + (1 + c) + f = 15 ⇒ f = 2.   (f is immediately fixed.)

The unknown digits must all be different and must come from {2,4,6,7,8,9}.

9  | 5       | 10     | 6      | 3   (b not a digit 1–9; a=5 duplicates $)

Only c = 8 satisfies all conditions.

The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.

1.  Common exponent  
   If n = k⁴ = m⁹, then n is a perfect power whose exponent must be a common multiple of 4 and 9.  
   The least such exponent is lcm(4, 9) = 36, so the necessary and sufficient form is  
                 n = t³⁶ , t ∈ ℕ.

2.  Size restriction  
   We need t³⁶ < 10¹⁰⁰.  Take base-10 logarithms:
         36·log₁₀ t < 100  
         log₁₀ t < 100/36 = 25/9.

   Therefore  
         t < 10^{25/9} = 10^{2+7/9} = 10² · 10^{7/9}.  

   Because log₁₀6 ≈ 0.7781513 > 7/9 = 0.777… , we have 10^{7/9} < 6, so  
         10^{25/9} < 100·6 = 600.  

   Hence  t  can take the integer values 1, 2, …, 599.

3.  Verification of the upper bound  
   log₁₀(599) ≈ 2.777427 ⇒ 36·log₁₀(599) ≈ 99.987 < 100, so 599³⁶ < 10¹⁰⁰.  
   For 600, 36·log₁₀(600) ≈ 100.013 > 100, so 600³⁶ ≥ 10¹⁰⁰.  
   Thus 599 is indeed the greatest allowable t.

   – 7^C ≡ 7 (mod 8) if C is odd, 1 (mod 8) if C is even.  
   Squares are 0,1,4 (mod 8).  
   Checking the eight parity combinations shows that N can be ≡1 (mod 8) only in two
   situations:  

        (i)  A odd,  B odd,  C even,                (ii)  A even,  B even,  C odd.

   All other parity patterns make N ≡3,5 or 7 (mod 8) and therefore impossible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Case (i):  C is even.  Write C = 2t (t ≥ 1).

     7^C = (7^t)^2 is itself a square, say n^2 with n = 7^t ≥ 7.  
     Put d = 3^A + 5^B (A,B odd), so N = n^2 + d must be another square m^2:

                m^2 − n^2 = d = 3^A + 5^B .                    (1)

     Factor the left side: (m−n)(m+n) = d.  
     Both factors are even, so the least possible value of m−n is 2, whence

                d ≥ 2(2n+2) = 4(n+1) ≥ 4·8 = 32            (because n ≥ 7).

     Consequently

                N = n^2 + d ≥ 7^2 + 32 = 49 + 32 = 81.       (2)

     Equality in (2) occurs when n = 7 and d = 32, i.e. m−n = 2, m+n = 16.
     Those equations give m = 9, so N = 9^2 = 81 provided d = 32 is attainable.
     Take A = 3, B = 1 (both odd); then 3^3 + 5^1 = 27 + 5 = 32, and indeed

                3^3 + 5^1 + 7^2 = 27 + 5 + 49 = 81.            (3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Case (ii):  C is odd.  The smallest possibility is C = 1, so

                N ≥ 7 + 3^2 + 5^2 = 7 + 9 + 25 = 41.          (4)

     The only squares between 41 and 80 are 49 and 64.

     •  If N = 49, then 3^A + 5^B = 42.  With A even, the only feasible value
       is A = 2 (3^2 = 9), giving 5^B = 33 – not a power of 5.

     •  If N = 64, then 3^A + 5^B = 57.  Again A = 2 is the only even choice ≤ 57,
       yielding 5^B = 48 – impossible.

     Hence Case (ii) cannot give a square below 81, and any larger C only
     increases N far past 81.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Minimality and concrete solution  
   Case (i) furnishes N = 81, and Case (ii) cannot reach any smaller square;
   (2) showed that even in Case (i) no value below 81 is possible.
   Therefore 81 is the least square attainable.

A set of exponents that attains this minimum is  

        A = 3,   B = 1,   C = 2,

Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.
The solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10. This is a total of 35 slushes, and therefore 35 coupons given out. 35 * $0.75 = $26.25 in losses from the coupons. $46.50 - $26.25 = $20.25 net profit when accounting for the coupons. You made your goal!",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let

Substitute m = 4s into (1):

0.75s + 4s + 1.75l + 2x = 46.50

s = 1, 2, 3 ⇒ no solutions of (2) satisfy (3).  
s = 4:

19·4 = 76, 186 − 76 = 110  
Equation (2): 7l + 8x = 110.

Because 8 ≡ 1 (mod 7), x ≡ 110 ≡ 5 (mod 7).  
Take x = 5 ⇒ l = (110 − 8·5)/7 = 70/7 = 10.

Check (3): 4s = 16 > l = 10 > x = 5 > s = 4 ✓

94,"Dear Jim:
Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.
Jerry","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the boys’ present ages (in years) be  

 Albert a  
 Bill  b  
 Charles c  

All ages are positive integers and are different.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Translating the three statements into equations
--------------------------------------------------------------------
S(n) = “sum of the digits of n”.

(i) Now: a = S(b)+S(c)                               (1)

(ii) One year ago: b–1 = S(a–1)+S(c–1)              (2)

(iii) Six years hence: c+6 = S(a+6)+S(b+6)          (3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Using the 9-remainder hint
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Because n ≡ S(n) (mod 9),

from (1) a ≡ b + c (mod 9)                     (1′)

from (2) b ≡ a + c – 1 (mod 9)                 (2′)

from (3) c ≡ a + b + 6 (mod 9)                 (3′)

Add (1′), (2′), (3′): a + b + c ≡ –5 ≡ 4 (mod 9).  
Put this and (1′) into (2′) to get

 –2c ≡ –1 (mod 9) ⇒ c ≡ 5 (mod 9)

Then (1′) gives a ≡ b + 5, and substituting in (3′) yields

 a + b ≡ 8 (mod 9) ⇒ b ≡ 6 (mod 9) and therefore a ≡ 2 (mod 9).

So far:

 a ≡ 2, b ≡ 6, c ≡ 5 (mod 9).                       (4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  A first bound on Charles’ age
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Equation (3) says c+6 equals a sum of two digit–sums, each at most 18, so
 c + 6 ≤ 18 ⇒ c ≤ 12.  
Together with (4) this forces

 c = 5.                                              (5)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Consequences of c = 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Insert (5) in (1): a = S(b) + 5 ⇒ S(b) = a – 5.               (6)

Insert (5) in (2): b – 1 = S(a – 1) + 4 ⇒ b = S(a – 1) + 5.    (7)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Limiting Albert’s age
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Because the family was started less than 25 years ago, every boy is
younger than 25; in particular, a < 25, so a is at most two–digit.
Hence S(a – 1) ≤ 17, and (7) gives b ≤ 22; thus b too is at most
two–digit, so S(b) ≤ 9.

But (6) says S(b) = a – 5, so a – 5 ≤ 9 ⇒ a ≤ 14.

Combining this with a ≡ 2 (mod 9) from (4) yields the single possibility

 a = 11.                                             (8)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Determining Bill’s age
--------------------------------------------------------------------
With a = 11, (6) gives S(b) = 6.  
The two-digit numbers whose digit–sum is 6 and that satisfy b ≡ 6 (mod 9)
are 6, 15, 24, …, but (7) with a = 11 gives b = S(10) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6.

Hence

 b = 6.                                              (9)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Verification
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Now (a,b,c) = (11,6,5).  Check each original condition:

•  Now: S(b)+S(c) = 6 + 5 = 11 = a. ✓  
•  A year ago: b–1 = 5, S(a–1)+S(c–1) = S(10)+S(4) = 1 + 4 = 5. ✓  
•  In six years: c+6 = 11, S(a+6)+S(b+6) = S(17)+S(12) = 8 + 3 = 11. ✓  

All three are satisfied and the ages are distinct.

95,"What three-digit number when doubled is, by value, one more than the value of the same three digits when reversed?
If this is too easy, go for extra points included with hint.","A wrongheaded guess would say 123, because 123 * 2 = 321 + 1.  The title hints you can easily go on to find for a ten-digit number that otherwise has same characteristics.","Answer-
397.
397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.
102?  Is 204 = 201 + 1?  No.
103?  Is 206 = 301 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds even.]
396?  Is 792 = 693 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds again.]
The answer given is the only one that passes.
As for extra points, an infinite number of 9's can be added between the 3 and the 7 without spoiling the major characteristics.

N = 100a + 10b + c  (a ≠ 0, a,b,c are digits).

The statement “when doubled it is one more than the number obtained by reversing its digits’’ translates to  

2(100a + 10b + c) = 100c + 10b + a + 1.  

Expand and collect like terms:

200a + 20b + 2c = 100c + 10b + a + 1  
199a + 10b – 98c = 1.                        (1)

A few quick congruences already narrow the possibilities.

•  Mod 2: 199a + 10b ≡ a (mod 2).  
  The right–hand side of (1) is 1, so a ≡ 1 (mod 2); a is odd.

•  Mod 5: 199 ≡ –1, 98 ≡ –2 (mod 5).  
  Hence –a + 10b ≡ –2c + 1 (mod 5) ⇒ a ≡ 2c – 1 (mod 5).  
  This allows only a = 1,3,5,7,9.

Rewrite (1) as  

10b = 98c + 1 – 199a.                                (2)

Because 0 ≤ 10b ≤ 90, the quantity on the right must lie in that same range.  
Substituting each permissible a and using 0 ≤ c ≤ 9 gives:

a = 1 ⇒ 98c + 1 ∈ [199, 289] (no c works)  
a = 3 ⇒ 98c + 1 ∈ [597, 687] (c = 7 works)  
a = 5,7,9 give too large a lower bound for 98c + 1.

With a = 3 and c = 7, equation (2) yields 10b = 90 ⇒ b = 9.

Thus the only three-digit solution is

N = 397,  because 2·397 = 794 = 793 + 1.

-------------------------------------------------
A pattern and the ten-digit analogue
-------------------------------------------------
Notice what 397 looks like: a 3, a run of 9’s, and a final 7.  
Indeed, if we put

N_n = 3·10^{\,n-1} + (10^{\,n-1}-10) + 7
     = 4·10^{\,n-1} – 3    (n ≥ 2),

its decimal form is the digit 3, followed by (n−2) copies of 9, ending in 7.

Its reverse is

rev(N_n) = 7·10^{\,n-1} + (10^{\,n-1}-10) + 3
         = 8·10^{\,n-1} – 7.

Then

2N_n = 2(4·10^{\,n-1} – 3) = 8·10^{\,n-1} – 6  
rev(N_n) + 1 = (8·10^{\,n-1} – 7) + 1 = 8·10^{\,n-1} – 6.

Hence 2N_n = rev(N_n) + 1 for every n ≥ 2.

Taking n = 10 produces the ten-digit number

96,"An iterative equation is one where an initial value is put into the equation to obtain a result, which is in turn put back into the equation as an input and the process is repeated for either a fixed number of times or until a final value is achieved (where you get the same number out as you put in).
For example, if you start with the iterative equation,
A{n+1} = 1/A{n} + 1
And you put in an initial value of 1, you would get 2 as the result.  Put the 2 back in as the input and you would get 1.5, and so on.
There is a simple iterative equation which, when repeated just five times, will give you a very good approximation of the square root of two (accurate to three decimal places, or less than 0.1%).

Step 1 – obtain an expression that leaves A unchanged whenever (1) is true  
Multiply the two sides of (1) by (A+1) and then collect like terms:

  A² = 2   ⇔   A² + A = A + 2   ⇔   A(A+1) = A + 2.

Now divide both members by (A+1) (which is permitted unless A = –1):

  A = (A + 2)/(A + 1).                                             (2)

Step 3 – show that the sequence converges to √2  
The derivative of f is

  f ′(x) = –1/(x + 1)².

At the positive root x = √2 ≈ 1.4142 one has |f ′(√2)| = 1/(√2 + 1)² ≈ 0.172 < 1,
so √2 is an attracting fixed point.  
For every initial value A₀ ≠ –1 the iterates therefore converge to √2; for
A₀ = –1 the map is undefined, so “almost every’’ real starting value works
(including A₀ = 0).

Step 4 – check the claimed accuracy  
Take, for instance, the worst-case starting value A₀ = 0.

 A₁ = (0 + 2)/(0 + 1) = 2  
 A₂ = (2 + 2)/(2 + 1) = 4/3 = 1.333333  
 A₃ = (1.333333 + 2)/(1.333333 + 1) = 35/24 ≈ 1.428571  
 A₄ ≈ 1.411765  
 A₅ ≈ 1.414634.

Since √2 = 1.414213…, the absolute error after five steps is
|1.414634 – 1.414213| ≈ 4.2 × 10⁻⁴, a relative error of about 0.03 %,
well within the promised 0.1 % and already correct to three decimal places.

Any other positive (and almost any negative) starting value converges even
faster; e.g. with A₀ = 1:

 1. A₁ = 1.5

                3a + 7b ≡ 0  (mod 21).                        (★)

2.  Smallest possible digit sum  
   The least positive multiple of 21 is 21 itself, so we first try

                3a + 7b = 21.                                 (1)

   Solve (1) in non–negative integers.

   Reduce (1) modulo 3: 7b ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ b ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ b = 3m (m ≥ 0).

   Substitute b = 3m into (1):

                3a + 7·3m = 21  ⇒  3(a + 7m) = 21  ⇒  a + 7m = 7.    (2)

   Two non–negative solutions of (2) are  
   • m = 0  ⇒  b = 0, a = 7 (seven 3’s) → number 333 3333  
   • m = 1  ⇒  b = 3, a = 0 (three 7’s) → number 777

3.  Eliminate 333 3333  
   333 3333 is not divisible by 7, so it violates condition (3).

4.  Check 777  
   Digit sum: 7 + 7 + 7 = 21, divisible by 3 and 7.  
   Number: 777 = 7 × 111 = 3 × 259 = 21 × 37, hence divisible by both 3 and 7.

5.  Minimality  
   Any number with fewer than three digits cannot have digit sum 21, so no 1- or 2-digit candidate can satisfy (2).  
   Among the eight possible 3-digit strings {333, 337, 373, 377, 733, 737, 773, 777}, only 777 has digit sum 21, so 777 is the smallest that fulfils all three conditions.

98,"Suppose you're in a hallway lined with 100 closed lockers.
You begin by opening every locker. Then you close every second locker. Then you go to every third locker and open it (if it's closed) or close it (if it's open).  Let's call this action toggling a locker. Continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n.  After 100 passes, where you toggle only locker #100, how many lockers are open?",Think about this can be related to the number of factors of each number,"Answer: 10 lockers are left open:
Lockers #1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.
Each of these numbers are perfect squares. This problem is based on the factors of the locker number.
Each locker is toggled by each factor; for example, locker #40 is toggled on pass number 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40.  That's eight toggles: open-closed-open-closed-open-closed-open-closed.
The only way a locker could be left open is if it is toggled an odd number of times. The only numbers with an odd number of factors are the perfect
squares. Thus, the perfect squares are left open.
For example, locker #25 is toggled on pass number 1, 5, and 25 (three toggles): open-closed-open.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let us label the lockers 1, 2, 3, …, 100.  
A locker is toggled once for every pass number that divides its label.  
Example: locker 12 is toggled on passes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12—once for each divisor of 12.

1. A locker ends open exactly when it is toggled an odd number of times.
2. Hence we must identify the numbers from 1 to 100 that have an odd number of divisors.
3. A positive integer has an odd number of divisors precisely when it is a perfect square.  
   Reason: divisors normally come in complementary pairs d and (n / d).  
   Only when d = n / d, i.e. when d² = n, is a divisor unpaired, giving an odd total.  
   That happens exactly for perfect squares.

4. The perfect squares not exceeding 100 are  
   1², 2², 3², …, 10² → 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.

There are 10 such numbers.

Therefore 10 lockers remain open after the 100th pass.

The fifteenth time, he flips 1 of the 2 coins that is heads up, and 92 of the coins that are tails up, leaving 93 coins heads up.
The sixteenth and last time he can get all of them tails up.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

• H = “heads”, T = “tails”;  
• a coin is coded 0 if it shows H and 1 if it shows T;  
• k = number of moves that Tom makes;  
• Sₘ  (m = 1,…,k) is the set of the 7 coins he **does not** flip in move m (he flips the other 93).

1.  Parity condition for k  

   If a coin i is not flipped in Sₘ it is flipped in that move, otherwise not.  
   Hence, during k moves

            (# times coin i is flipped) = k – s_i ,

   where s_i = |{m : coin i ∈ Sₘ}| is the number of moves in which coin i is spared.  
   To end up 1 (tails) each coin has to be flipped an odd number of times, so

            k – s_i ≡ 1 (mod 2)  for every i.      (1)

   • If k were odd, (1) would force every s_i to be even.  
     Then ∑ s_i (sum over the 100 coins) would be even, but also

            ∑ s_i = 7k ≡ 7·1 ≡ 1 (mod 2),

     an impossibility.  Therefore k cannot be odd.

   • Thus k is even, and (1) tells us that every s_i must be odd (1,3,5,…,k).

2.  Lower bound for k  

   Because all 100 coins must have s_i ≥ 1 (and odd),

            ∑ s_i ≥ 100·1 = 100.

   But ∑ s_i = 7k, so 7k ≥ 100 ⇒ k ≥ 100/7 ≈ 14.29.  
   With k required to be even, the first admissible value is

            k = 16.

   Hence no sequence of ≤14 moves can work, and 16 is the only possible candidate for the minimum.

3.  Showing that 16 moves are enough  

   We must exhibit 16 sets S₁,…,S₁₆, each of size 7, such that every coin appears in an odd number of them.  
   Choose six “special” coins (label them 1–6) that will appear three times each; the remaining 94 coins will appear exactly once.  
   The row-sum requirements are then

            6·3 + 94·1 = 18 + 94 = 112 = 7·16,

   exactly the total number of “spared–coin slots” available in 16 moves.

   A concrete schedule works as follows (each line lists the 7 coins **left unflipped** in that move):

   S₁  = {1,2,7,8,9,10,11}  
   S₂  = {1,3,12,13,14,15,16}  
   S₃  = {1,4,17,18,19,20,21}  
   S₄  = {2,3,22,23,24,25,26}  
   S₅  = {2,4,27,28,29,30,31}  
   S₆  = {3,4,32,33,34,35,36}  
   S₇  = {5,37,38,39,40,41,42}  
   S₈  = {5,43,44,45,46,47,48}  
   S₉  = {5,49,50,51,52,53,54}  
   S₁₀ = {6,55,56,57,58,59,60}  
   S₁₁ = {6,61,62,63,64,65,66}  
   S₁₂ = {6,67,68,69,70,71,72}  
   S₁₃ = {73,74,75,76,77,78,79}  
   S₁₄ = {80,81,82,83,84,85,86}  
   S₁₅ = {87,88,89,90,91,92,93}  
   S₁₆ = {94,95,96,97,98,99,100}

   • Coins 1–6 each occur in exactly 3 of the Sₘ’s (odd).  
   • Every other coin appears once (odd).  
   • Each Sₘ indeed has 7 distinct coins.

   Therefore after these 16 moves every coin has been flipped an odd number of times, so they all show tails.

4.  Conclusion  

   • k must be even and at least 16;  
   • 16 moves can actually achieve the goal.

1. The divisibility conditions can be written in congruence form:
   N ≡ 1 (mod 2)  
   N ≡ 2 (mod 3)  
   N ≡ 3 (mod 4)  
   …  
   N ≡ 8 (mod 9)

2. Rewrite each congruence by adding 1 to both sides.  
   (N + 1) ≡ 0 (mod 2)  
   (N + 1) ≡ 0 (mod 3)  
   (N + 1) ≡ 0 (mod 4)  
   …  
   (N + 1) ≡ 0 (mod 9)

   Thus N + 1 is simultaneously divisible by every integer from 2 through 9.

3. Therefore N + 1 must be a common multiple of 2, 3, …, 9.  
   The least common multiple of these numbers is

        lcm(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
      = 2³ · 3² · 5 · 7
      = 8 · 9 · 5 · 7
      = 72 · 35
      = 2520.

4. Hence N + 1 is a multiple of 2520, so
        N = 2520k – 1                         (k ∈ ℕ).

5. Impose the size restriction N < 3000:

        2520k – 1 < 3000
        2520k < 3001
        k < 3001 / 2520 ≈ 1.19.

   The only positive integer k satisfying this is k = 1.

6. Substitute k = 1:

        N = 2520(1) – 1 = 2519.

7. Verification:
   • 2519 ÷ 2 = 1259 r 1  
   • 2519 ÷ 3 = 839 r 2  
   • 2519 ÷ 4 = 629 r 3  
   • 2519 ÷ 5 = 503 r 4  
   • 2519 ÷ 6 = 419 r 5  
   • 2519 ÷ 7 = 359 r 6  
   • 2519 ÷ 8 = 314 r 7  
   • 2519 ÷ 9 = 279 r 8  
   All remainders are exactly 1 less than their divisors, as required.

Therefore, the unique number below 3000 fulfilling all the conditions is 2519.

   Because the birth events (every 25) are more frequent than the death events
   (every 33 or 34), once the difference has been pushed up to 2 it can never
   return to 1 – there can never be two consecutive death events without a
   birth event between them.

   The last time a death event occurs before the very next birth event is at
   P = 167; for P = 167 … 174 we have Δ(P)=1, and the birth
   event at P = 175 raises the difference to 2 permanently.

105,"A man is standing on a rock in the middle of a circular lake of radius 1. There is a tiger on the shore of the lake that can run four times as fast you can swim, however the tiger cannot swim. The tiger is hungry and always attempts to keep the distance between the two of you at a minimum. How can you safely swim to shore?
Assume that as long as you can get to the shore before the tiger gets to you (even if it is only a split-second before), you will be safe.",Use the factor of 4 to your advantage,"Until you are more than 1/4 of the radius away from the rock you can swim fast enough so that you can keep the tiger the furthest distance possible from you. Regardless of which direction the tiger moves around the circle, you swim the other way, always keeping the rock between you and the tiger.  While you are doing this you will be able to move outward, since you will have some energy to spare.
Before long you will be 1/4 of the radius away from the center and the tiger will be 180 degrees away. At this point swim straight to the point on the shore furthest from the tiger. You will be able to get there in 3/4 units of time, while it will take the tiger pi/4 =~ 0.7854 units of time.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let your swimming speed be v (=1 unit of length per unit of time after rescaling) and let the tiger’s running speed be 4v (=4).

The geometry
• Lake: circle of radius 1 and centre O.  
• You start at O; the tiger is somewhere on the circumference.  
• While you are in the water the tiger cannot touch you; the only danger is when you reach the bank.

Notation
r = your distance from O while you are swimming.  
θ = the angular separation (measured at O) between the tiger’s position T and the point P of the shore toward which you will finally swim.

Two elementary facts

1.  If you swim on a circle of radius r your angular speed is ω_you = v/r = 1/r.  
2.  The tiger runs on the circle of radius 1 with speed 4, so its angular speed is ω_tiger = 4.

Hence  

  ω_you > ω_tiger  iff  r < ¼,  
  ω_you = ω_tiger  iff  r = ¼.

The escape strategy

Step 1 – gain the angular advantage  
Swim out a short distance and then move on a very small circle (say r = 0.1).  
Because 1/r = 10 > 4, you can rotate around O faster than the tiger can run.  
Choose the direction of motion so that you make the tiger gradually move to the point diametrically opposite you; i.e. arrange θ = π radians = 180°.

Step 2 – freeze the advantage at r = ¼  
Spiral outward, keeping the tiger opposite you, until your radius is exactly r = ¼.  
During this spiral you still have r ≤ ¼, so your angular speed is never less than the tiger’s, and the separation θ = π is preserved.

Now you are at point A with |OA| = ¼ and the tiger is at the opposite point B of the shore (θ = π).

Step 3 – the dash to safety  
From A swim straight along the radius through A to the shore.

• Distance you must cover: 1 – ¼ = ¾.  
  Time you need: t_you = (¾)/v = 0.75.

• The tiger must run from B to the landing point A’, half-way round the lake: arc length = π.  
  Time the tiger needs: t_tiger = π/4 ≈ 0.785.

Because t_you = 0.75 < t_tiger ≈ 0.785, you reach the bank a fraction of a second before the tiger, so you are safe.

Why the factor 4 mattered  
Choosing r = ¼ makes your angular speed equal to the tiger’s (1/r = 4).  
With θ = π the tiger would need time θ/4 = π/4 to reach the landing spot, while you need time 1 – r = ¾.  
The inequality ¾ < π/4 (true precisely because 4 > π) gives the required margin.

Therefore you can always escape by:

1. Moving on a very small circle until the tiger is diametrically opposite you,  
2. Spiralling out to radius ¼ while keeping that opposition, and  
3. Swimming straight to the shore.

Final answer: Swim in a small circle until the tiger is diametrically opposite; spiral out to a circle of radius ¼ maintaining that 180° separation; then swim straight to the bank—your ¾-radius dash beats the tiger’s π-arc sprint, so you reach land first and are safe.",True,1,0

After each gift he always keeps the complementary fraction, so the stock that remains in the bag after giving the 1/k-th part to the k-th friend is

N/2, N/3, N/4, … , N/10.

(To see this, just compute a few steps; each time the factor k in the denominator increases by 1.)

For the gift to be possible, each share must be an integer.  
Hence, just before the (k+1)-st gift the number of marbles in the bag, N/k, has to be divisible by (k+1):

N/k ≡ 0 (mod k+1).

That means

N is divisible by k(k+1)  for k = 2, 3, … , 9.

So N must be a common multiple of

6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90.

The smallest such number is their least common multiple.

Prime factorisations  
6 = 2·3  
12 = 2²·3  
20 = 2²·5  
30 = 2·3·5  
42 = 2·3·7  
56 = 2³·7  
72 = 2³·3²  
90 = 2·3²·5

Take the highest power of every prime that appears:

2³ · 3² · 5 · 7 = 8 · 9 · 5 · 7 = 2520.

Thus the fewest marbles Justin can start with is N = 2520.

After the last gift he keeps N/10 marbles, namely

2520 / 10 = 252.

A quick check shows that every share is indeed an integer:

Mike: 2520/2 = 1260  
Paul: 1260/3 = 420  
Dave: 840/4 = 210  
Bert: 630/5 = 126

Rick: 360/8 = 45

108,"In the equation FORTY+TEN+TEN=SIXTY, each letter represents a different digit. Can you figure out which letter is which digit?",Start from the last digits.,"First, there are ten different letters in this equation: E, F, I, N, O, R, S, T, X, Y. Therefore, every digit from 0 to 9 is used.
Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.
If T=8, then R=X+3, we can have R=6, X=3, or R=7, X=4.
If R=6, X=3, the remaining digits are 2, 4, 7, and again we can't choose S=F+1.
If R=7, X=4, the remaining digits are 2, 3, 6, where 3=2+1. Hence S=3, F=2.

1.  Units column  
    Y + N + N = Y (mod 10).  
    Hence 2 N ≡ 0 (mod 10) ⇒ N = 0 or 5.

2.  If N = 5 then the carry from the units column is 1.  
    In the tens column we would have  
          T + E + E + 1 = T (mod 10)  
          ⇒ 2 E + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 10), impossible because 2 E + 1 is odd.  
    Therefore N ≠ 5 and we must have  

          N = 0  and  (carry k₁) = 0.

3.  Tens column (with k₁ = 0)  
          T + E + E = T  (mod 10) ⇒ 2 E ≡ 0 (mod 10).  
    Since N = 0 is already used, E cannot be 0, so E = 5.  
    The sum 2 E = 10 produces a carry k₂ = 1 into the hundreds column.

6.  Ten-thousands column  
          F + k₄ = S,  and  k₄ ≤ 1.                (3)

7.  The case k₃ = 0 is impossible: (2) would give I = O, contradicting the
   “different digits’’ rule.

8.  Try k₃ = 1.  
    Then (2) gives O + 1 = I (so k₄ = 0), and by (3) we would get S = F, again
    impossible.  Hence k₃ ≠ 1.

9.  Therefore k₃ = 2.  
    (2) becomes O + 2 = I + 10 k₄.  To have k₄ = 1 we need O + 2 ≥ 10,
    i.e. O = 9 (O = 8 would force I = 0 already used).  Thus  

          O = 9,  k₄ = 1,  I = 1.                 (4)

          ⇒ X = R + 2 T − 19.                     (6)

    Since 0 ≤ X ≤ 9, we need 19 ≤ R + 2 T ≤ 24.  
    Available digits (distinct from 0,1,5,9) are 2,3,4,6,7,8.

11.  Solving R + 2 T = 21, 22 or 23 (values 19 and 24 give X = 0 or 5,
     already used) we obtain three arithmetically possible pairs:

        a) T = 8, R = 6  → X = 3  
        b) T = 8, R = 7  → X = 4  
        c) T = 7, R = 8  → X = 3

     Test each against (5):

        a) Used digits would be {0,1,3,5,6,8,9}.  The only
           free digits are 2,4,7; none give a pair F,S with S = F + 1.
           Reject.

        b) Used digits {0,1,4,5,7,8,9}.  Free digits {2,3,6}.  
           Choosing F = 2, S = 3 satisfies S = F + 1 and keeps all
           digits distinct.  Y must then be the last unused digit 6.
           This assignment works.

        c) Used digits {0,1,3,5,7,8,9}.  Free digits {2,4,6}.  No

We must now find positive integers a, b, d, x satisfying (3) and (4).

-------------------------------------------------
4.  Exploit equation (4) to confine the search  
-------------------------------------------------
Because x is the youngest child’s age, the hint “the youngest children are very young’’ tells us x is small compared with the interval d.  
In particular x < 4d; then from (4)

 b – a = 3(x+4d) < 3·(4d+4d) = 24d.                 (5)

On the other hand, with (3) fixed, the difference b – a grows when a and b depart from the common value √(ab)=√15 d ≈ 3.87d.  
Inequality (5) therefore forces b to stay fairly close to a and consequently forces d itself to be small.  
Trying the only plausible small values d = 1, 2, 3 quickly reveals:

• d = 1 ⇒ ab = 15.  The pairs (a,b) = (1,15),(3,5) give b–a =14 or 2, neither divisible by 3(x+4) with integral x.

• d = 2 ⇒ ab = 60.  No factor pair gives b–a divisible by 3(x+8) with integral x.

• d = 3 ⇒ ab = 135.  The factor pairs are  
  (1,135) b–a =134 (too large),  
  (3,45)  b–a =42 = 3·14,  
  (5,27) b–a =22 (no multiple of 3),  
  (9,15) b–a =6  (no positive x).

Only (a,b) = (3,45) satisfies (4):

 b – a = 42 = 3(x + 12) ⇒ x + 12 = 14 ⇒ x = 2.       (6)

-------------------------------------------------
5.  Obtain the father’s age and check
-------------------------------------------------
With (a,b) = (3,45) and d = 3,

 F = a + b = 48.

Children’s ages (x = 2, d = 3):

 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26.

Finally,

 2²+5²+8²+11²+14²+17²+20²+23²+26²  
  = 4+25+64+121+196+289+400+529+676  
  = 2304 = 48² = F²,

exactly as required.

-------------------------------------------------
6.  Exclude larger d  
-------------------------------------------------
For d ≥ 4, condition (5) fails: with ab = 15d² ≥ 240, every pair (a,b) with ab fixed gives b–a ≥ 24d, contradicting (5); hence no further solutions exist.

-------------------------------------------------
Conclusion  
-------------------------------------------------
The only possible ages are

111,"Mad Ade was visiting his friend, computer tycoon and Olympic Kebab hurling champion, Mike Rohsopht.
He was there on Sunday and when the radio gave the time at the hour, Mad Ade noticed that the Madadian antique clock, designed by Madadian clock maker Arthur Minit (teaser #4891) was exactly 3 minutes slow.
""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Mike assured Mad Ade that his treasured Arthur Minit clock had not been adjusted nor fixed since his last visit.
What day of the week was Mad Ade's second visit?",It must lose some multiple of 12 hours in total,"The answer is 17 days and 3 hours later, which would have been a Wednesday.
This is the only other time in the same month when the two would agree at all.
In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.
Since the clock was not adjusted since the last visit, it's also possible that the radio time shifted by one hour due to a change to or from summer daylight saving time.  However, it turns out that the only additional possibilities that need to be considered are those of 4 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 12 hours 57 minutes, and 29 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 3 days 10 hours 57 minutes.  Without even considering the rules for when in the month the
clock is changed, these possible solutions are ruled out because we know that both visits were in the evening (""Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht"") and they involve times in a different part of the day.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the real time be T and the clock time be C.

1.  Rate of the clock  
   In 1 real hour the clock loses 7 min, so it advances  
   60−7 = 53 min.  
   Hence   
          C-advance / T-advance = 53/60  
   or – and this is more useful – the error (E = T–C) grows at  
          7 min per real hour.

2.  First observation (Sunday)  
   Error E₀ = 3 min (the clock is 3 min slow).

3.  Second observation  
   After t real hours the error will be  
          E = 3 + 7t   (minutes).

   The clock is read only to the nearest position of the hands, so it
   will look correct whenever its reading differs from real time by an
   integral multiple of 12 h = 720 min:

          3 + 7t = 720k , k = 1,2,3,…

4.  t must be an integral number of hours  
   Both observations were taken exactly “at the hour’’ (when the radio
   sounded the hour signal).  Therefore t itself has to be an integer.
   So we need 720k−3 divisible by 7:

          720k − 3 ≡ 0 (mod 7).

   Now 720 ≡ 6 (mod 7), so the condition is

          6k − 3 ≡ 0 (mod 7)  ⟺  6k ≡ 3 (mod 7)  
          ⟺  k ≡ 6·3 ≡ 18 ≡ 4 (mod 7).

   Thus k = 4, 11, 18,…  

5.  Stay within the same month  
   One month has at most 31 days ≈ 744 h.  
   The smallest admissible k (and hence the smallest positive t) is
   therefore k = 4:

          t = (720·4 − 3)/7 = 2877/7 = 411 h
              = 17 days 3 h.

   k = 11 already gives more than 744 h, so 17 days 3 h is the only
   possible interval within the month.

6.  Day of the second visit  
   Starting on a Sunday, 14 days later is again a Sunday; adding the
   remaining 3 days places the visit on a Wednesday, three hours later
   in the day (quite consistent with the remark that it was “rather
   late in the evening’’).

Therefore Mad Ade’s second visit must have taken place on a

112,"Pretend you have two faucets for your shower, one that releases hot water and one that releases cold water, but at varying pressures.  If the hot water is 105 degrees Fahrenheit and the cold water is 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and you could rotate the faucet at most 360 degrees, how much would you have to rotate the cold water faucet to get the temperature to be 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, if the hot water is turned on all the way, and could not be turned down?",Add how much you've rotated each and divide by the total rotation to get the average temperature.,"the equation for finding the answer, explained by the hint, is              (105(360)+(45)(x))/(360+x)=98.6
Solving for x:
x= 42.985 degrees",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the amount each faucet is opened be measured by the number of degrees it is turned.

Hot-water faucet  
• temperature = 105 °F  
• opened the full 360°

Cold-water faucet  
• temperature = 45 °F  
• opened x degrees (0 ≤ x ≤ 360 is possible)

Because the hint says “Add how much you've rotated each and divide by the total rotation to get the average temperature,” we assume the flow rate – and hence the influence on the mixed temperature – is directly proportional to how far each faucet is turned.

Average (mixed) temperature =  
( (rotation of hot)·(temperature of hot) + (rotation of cold)·(temperature of cold) )
÷ (total rotation)

Set this average equal to the desired 98.6 °F and substitute the known data:

(105·360 + 45·x) / (360 + x) = 98.6.

Solve for x:

105·360 = 37 800, so  
(37 800 + 45x) = 98.6(360 + x)

37 800 + 45x = 35 496 + 98.6x  
37 800 − 35 496 = 98.6x − 45x  
2 304 = 53.6x  
x = 2 304 / 53.6 ≈ 42.99.

Thus the cold-water faucet must be opened about 43 degrees (out of the possible 360 degrees).

A weird number is an abundant number, n, for which no subset of its proper divisors adds to n. What is the smallest weird number?",They are very rare indeed. The smallest is somewhere between 50 and 100.,"The number needs a lot of prime factors for the sum to exceed the number--a factor of 2 is pretty important to get a large enough factor, and then the next prime factor being at least 5 is good so the small primes are less granular and the sum might only barely exceed th number; The smallest weird number is 70.
The next three being 836, 4030 and 5830.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"We have to find the least integer n that satisfies simultaneously  

1. n is abundant: the sum σ(n) of its proper divisors exceeds n, and  
2. n is not semiperfect: no sub-collection of those divisors sums exactly to n.  
   (Such an integer is called weird.)

The hint already restricts the search to 50 ≤ n < 100, so we inspect only those integers.

Step 1.  Decide which numbers in that interval are abundant.  
For m < 100 the abundant numbers are well–known; in the interval 50–100 they are  

54, 56, 60, 66, 70, 72, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 96, 100,…

(68 is not abundant because 1+2+4+17+34=58 < 68, and 72 or above already lie outside the “smallest” search once one weird number is found.)

Step 2.  Show that every abundant number below 70 is semiperfect.

For each such m it is enough to exhibit one subset of proper divisors whose sum is m.

• 54: 27+18+9 = 54.  
• 56: 28+14+8+4+2 = 56.  
• 60: 30+20+10 = 60.  
• 66: 33+22+11 = 66.

Hence none of 54, 56, 60, 66 can be weird.

Step 3.  Examine 70.

Proper divisors of 70: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35.  
Their sum is 1+2+5+7+10+14+35 = 74 > 70, so 70 is abundant.

We must now prove that no subset of {1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35} totals 70.

A convenient way is to separate the cases according to whether 35 is used, because 35 is the only divisor that exceeds half of 70.

Case A.  35 is included.  
We would still need another 35.  The remaining divisors are {1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14}.  Their largest possible sum is  
1+2+5+7+10+14 = 39; the individual possibilities are:

14+10+7+5 = 36  
14+10+7+2+1 = 34  
14+10+5+2+1 = 32  
14+7+5+2+1 = 29  
10+7+5+2+1 = 25  

No combination gives 35, so a subset containing 35 can never reach 70.

Case B.  35 is not included.  
Then every candidate subset is drawn from {1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14} alone, whose total sum is only 39—far below 70.  

Therefore no subset of proper divisors of 70 can equal 70.

Because 70 is abundant yet not semiperfect, it meets the definition of a weird number.

Step 4.  Conclusion.

All abundant numbers below 70 are semiperfect, whereas 70 is abundant and non-semiperfect. Consequently, 70 is the smallest weird number.

The robots are grouped into tribes according to the numbers of arms they have so that in any tribe, no member has a different number of arms to the other members. Each tribe follows the same fertility ritual before bed each night, a ritual that also reveals the number of members in a tribe. In the ritual, each arm of a male links with an arm of a female, no male-female pair of robots linking more than once. The minimum number of robots required to link all arms once only is the number belonging to that tribe. Now one night, the Creaky tribe cornered half of the Rusty tribe and despite being outnumbered two to one, unscrewed one arm from each, there being an equal number of male and female victims. However, the Creaky tribe were extremely poor at arithmetic and had failed to realise that they needed 24 times their actual haul of spare arms in order that the number of links their members could then make, each with the same number of extra arms, was half the maximum number of links the Rusty tribe could then make. How many Creakies and Rusties were there?",,"ARMLESS ALIENS. There were 14 Creakies and 56 Rusties.

Then the maximum number of links that the Rusty tribe can make after the mutilation is y(2y-1)/2. The number of extra arms each Creaky needs is 24y/2x allowing x(x + 24y/2x) links. Forming the links equation we have 2(y squared) - 49y - 4(x squared) = 0. We must have y=4x so that y - 4x is a factor. A long division shows that the condition for zero remainder is x=7 so y=28. The numbers of members are twice these.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

 c  = number of arms on each Creaky,   tribe size = 2c  
 r  = number of arms on each Rusty,   tribe size = 2r  

(Reason: in every tribe the number of members is the minimum that lets every arm be linked once,
with no two links between the same male-female pair.  
That minimum is obtained with r males and r females, i.e. 2r robots, so a tribe whose members
have k arms each always contains 2k robots.)

1.  The raid  
Half of the Rusties, i.e. r robots (r males and r females), are attacked;  
each loses one arm, so the Creakies carry off r spare arms.  
Because r robots are an even split of sexes, r must be even; write r = 2k (k ∈ ℕ).

2.  How many links can the damaged Rusty tribe still make?  
After the raid

 k males and k females have r arms each;  
 k males and k females have r–1 arms each.

Total male arms  = k(r) + k(r–1) = k(2r–1) = r(2r–1)/2,  
and the same number of female arms.  
Hence the maximum possible links for the whole Rusty tribe is  

 L_R = r(2r – 1)/2.

3.  What the Creakies wanted  
They intended to share some equal number x of extra arms between their 2c members.  
Thus 2c·x spare arms are needed.  
The problem says they would have needed 24 times the arms they actually stole, i.e.

 2c·x = 24·r ⟹ x = 12r / c    (1)

With the extras each Creaky would have c + x arms, so the whole Creaky tribe
could make

 L_C = c (c + x)   links.                                   (2)

They wanted this to equal half of L_R:

 c(c + x) = ½·L_R = r(2r – 1)/4.                             (3)

4.  Eliminate x using (1): c(c + 12r/c) = r(2r – 1)/4   
  ⟹ c² + 12r = r(2r – 1)/4  
  ⟹ 4c² + 48r = 2r² – r  
  ⟹ 2r² – 49r – 4c² = 0.                                    (4)

Because r is even, put r = 2k and multiply (4) by ½:

 4k² – 49k – 2c² = 0  
 ⟹ 2c² = 4k² – 49k.                                         (5)

5.  A Pell-type equation  
Write (5) as

 (49)² + 32c² = (8k – 49)².  

Set s = 8k – 49; then

 s² – 32c² = 2401.                                           (6)

Equation (6) is of Pell type.  Searching for small integer
solutions gives immediately

 c = 7, s = 63,

because 63² – 32·7² = 3969 – 1568 = 2401.

6.  Recover k and r  
s = 8k – 49 ⇒ 63 = 8k – 49 ⇒ 8k = 112 ⇒ k = 14  
r = 2k = 28 (even, as required).

7.  Verify x and the link condition  
x = 12r / c = 12·28 / 7 = 48.  
Each Creaky would have 7 + 48 = 55 arms, so

 L_C = 7·55 = 385.

Damaged Rusties: L_R = r(2r – 1)/2 = 28·55/2 = 770,

1.  After Junior cuts a strip 2 m wide all the way round, the uncut central square has side  
    S – 4 m (2 m taken off each of the four sides).

2.  The children agreed each would mow exactly one–half of the lawn.  
    Hence the area left for Little Miss (= the area of the inner square) equals one–half of the whole lawn’s area:

               (S – 4)²  =  ½ S².

3.  Solve the equation:

        (S – 4)² = ½ S²
     ⇒  S² – 8S + 16 = ½ S²
     ⇒  ½ S² – 8S + 16 = 0
     ⇒  S² – 16S + 32 = 0        (multiplying by 2)

        S = [16 ± √(16² – 4·32)] / 2

With every cut you should cut through every previous cut. As long as you keep doing this you will always be able to do so again with your next cut. The number of additional pieces formed on cut x will always be x. The sum of all integers from 1 to n is n*(n+1)/2. So the sum of additional pieces cut will be n*(n+1)/2.
Finally add 1 because we start with 1 piece: n*(n+1)/2 + 1.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let P(n) be the greatest possible number of pieces a circular pizza can be cut into with n straight cuts.

Step 1.  Establish a recurrence for P(n).

Suppose after j cuts the pizza has been divided into P(j) pieces.  
Draw the (j + 1)-st cut so that

• it intersects every one of the previous j cuts,  
• no three cuts meet in a single interior point, and  
• all intersection points lie inside the pizza.

Under these conditions the new cut meets the boundary of the pizza at two points and is broken by the j interior intersection points into j + 1 distinct segments.  
Each of those segments lies in a different old piece, so the cut creates j + 1 new pieces.

Hence
P(j + 1) = P(j) + (j + 1).                                        (1)

Step 2.  Initial condition.

With no cuts, the pizza is whole: P(0) = 1.

Step 3.  Solve the recurrence.

Iterating (1):

P(1) = P(0) + 1 = 2  
P(2) = P(1) + 2 = 4  
P(3) = P(2) + 3 = 7  

In general,
P(n) = 1 + (1 + 2 + 3 + … + n)

Thus
P(n) = n(n + 1)/2 + 1 = (n² + n + 2)/2.

The hint tells us to “think multiplication,” so we compare each of the listed numbers with nearby multiples of some fixed whole number.

1.  Try the small multiples successively.
   •  9 is 1 more than 8 (=1·8).  
   •  17 is 1 more than 16 (=2·8).  
   •  33 is 1 more than 32 (=4·8).

2.  Check that none of the “non-zingers’’ enjoys this property.
   •  2 = 0·8 + 2   (remainder 2)  
   •  8 = 1·8 + 0   (remainder 0)

   A “zinger’’ is precisely an integer that is one more than a multiple of 8, i.e. any number of the form 8k + 1 for some whole number k.  (Equivalently, a zinger is any integer that gives remainder 1 when divided by 8.)

One less complex method is to imagine the axis of the cone form a right triangle. This triangle shares the dimensions of the cone, so it is 12 by 5. We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.
Next we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x. If we add 10x on both sides, we get 22x=60, and dividing 22 from both sides yields x=60/22=30/11.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the cone’s axis be the y-axis, with the apex at y = 0 and the circular base in the plane y = 12.

1.  Express the cone’s radius at any level  
If a horizontal cross-section is taken at height y (0 ≤ y ≤ 12), the cone’s cross-sectional radius r_c(y) is obtained from similarity of the side-view triangles:

2.  Describe the cylinder
• Its bottom face coincides with the cone’s base, so the cylinder’s bottom is at y = 12.  
• Let the cylinder’s height be h. Then its top face is at y = 12 − h.  
• Let the cylinder’s radius be r. Because the top circumference just touches the cone,

Equation (2) immediately gives two useful facts.

1.  10a + d is a multiple of 9, so a + d ≡ 0 (mod 9).  
    For every fixed thousands digit a, the ones digit d is therefore fixed:

        a : 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
        d : 8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0      (since 10 ≡ 1 (mod 9))

2.  Dividing (2) by 9 gives

  b – c = (10a + d)/9.                   (3)

The right–hand side of (3) must be an integer not exceeding 9 (because b ≤ 9), so a cannot exceed 8 (for a = 9 the quotient would be 10).  The possible values are:

        8  1       9

The year 1978 (a = 1) is already one solution (b – c = 2, with b = 9, c = 7).

We now look for the chronologically next solution.

•  For a = 1 we have just seen that the only admissible tens digit is c = 7 (since d is already forced to be 8), giving the single year 1978.  Hence no further solutions occur in the 1900s.

•  The next admissible thousands digit is a = 2.  
  Here d = 7 and b – c = 3.  To obtain the earliest possible year we choose the smallest hundreds digit b that will let c stay a digit (non-negative).  Taking b = 3 gives c = 0.  Thus the smallest year with a = 2 is

Verify the property:

 first two digits 23  
 last two digits 07  
 23 + 7 = 30,

Because a = 2 already produces a valid year and any larger a (3,4,…) would give years 3000 or later, 2307 is the very next year after 1978 with the required property.

Multiplying r by s gives the units digit l and a carry C₁;  
multiplying a by s then gives the tens digit i and carry C₂;  
multiplying i by s gives the hundreds digit a and carry C₃;  
finally s·l plus C₃ forms the thousands digit r.

Translating this into equations:

(2)   s·a + C₁ = i + 10C₂  
(3)   s·i + C₂ = a + 10C₃

Step 2.  Combine (1) and (4′).

Since r = s·l, substitute in (1):

C₂ is a carry, so 0 ≤ C₂ ≤ 8.  
Solve (8):

C₂ = 3 gives 2·3 – 1 = 5 ⇒ i = 1.  
C₂ = 8 gives 2·8 – 1 = 15 ⇒ i = 3, but then from (7) a = 4·3 + 8 = 20 (>9), impossible.

• A be the largest cog (242 teeth),  
• B the next (160 teeth),  
• C the next (64 teeth),  
• D the smallest (22 teeth).

Because the wheels are in constant mesh we have, for every meshing pair,

(number of teeth) × (number of revolutions) = constant

and the two wheels of a pair turn in opposite directions.  
If A makes R revolutions, then

 A ↔ B  242·R = 160·R_B  ⇒ R_B = 242⁄160 · R = 121⁄80 · R (opposite direction)

 B ↔ C  160·R_B = 64·R_C  ⇒ R_C = 160⁄64 · R_B = 242⁄64 · R = 121⁄32 · R (same direction as A)

126,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
In a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).  How many different ways can a 13-card alternating-colour straight be formed from a Snapoker deck?

A-2-3-4-…-K, the only possible 13-card straight is  

Ace-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K.  

The condition “alternating colours” forces

• every odd–numbered rank (A, 3, 5, 7, 9, J(11), K(13)) to be red, i.e. a heart or a diamond;  
• every even-numbered rank (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, Q(12)) to be black, i.e. a spade or a club.

Hence, for each of the thirteen ranks we only have to look at the red suits for odd ranks and the
black suits for even ranks, and count how many physical cards of each such suit actually remain
in the two–deck Snapoker pack after the prescribed removals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  What remains in the Snapoker pack?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting with two complete decks (104 cards), the rules eliminate

 • odd spades  ⇒ only the even-ranked spades (2,4,6,8,10,12) survive;  
 • even hearts  ⇒ all odd-ranked hearts (A,3,5,7,9,J,K) survive;  
 • prime diamonds (2,3,5,7,11,13) plus A ♦ ⇒ only the composite diamonds (4,6,8,9,10,12) survive;  
 • non-prime clubs (A,4,6,8,9,10,12)  ⇒ only the prime clubs (2,3,5,7,11,13) survive.

Because we began with TWO decks, every surviving card occurs in duplicate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Counting the alternating–colour straights
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Because exactly one card must be taken for each rank, the number of different 13-card hands is the
product of the available choices for the individual ranks.

Red odd ranks : 2·2·2·2·4·2·2  = 2⁸ = 256  
Black even ranks: 4·2·2·2·2·2 = 2⁷ = 128  

Total number of alternating-colour 13-card straights

256 × 128 = 2¹⁵ = 32 768.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Note on duplicates
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The two decks make the physical copies of a given rank-and-suit distinct
(e.g. the two 9♥’s are different pieces of cardboard), so each choice between
the two copies really yields a different 13-card hand; that is why every
surviving card contributes a factor of 2 to the count above.

0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 9 exactly once.

Because D = 2 N, let us try to make D end in 0 – that forces N to end in 5 (2 × 5 = 10).  
Write  

 N = a b c d 5 , D = e f g h 0 .

Double the last digit first:

1. 2 × 5 = 10 ⇒ h = 0 and a carry of 1 into the tens column.

Now double d with that carry:

2. 2 d + 1 = h .  
   The available digits show that only d = 1 or 4 or 6 work (giving h = 3, 9 or 3 respectively).  
   Choose d = 1 (gives h = 3 and no carry) or d = 4 (gives h = 9 and no carry) or d = 6 (gives h = 3 with carry 1).  
   The branch d = 6 with a carry proves fruitful.

Continuing with d = 6:

3. 2 d + 1 = 13 ⇒ h = 3, carry = 1.

Next handle c:

4. 2 c + 1 must give a digit we still possess.  
   Choose c = 2 ⇒ 2 c + 1 = 5; that digit (5) is already used, so instead take c = 2 with no carry:  
   2 × 2 = 4, carry = 0, so g = 4.

Now for b:

5. 2 b + 0 = f .  
   Taking b = 6 would reuse the single 6, but b = 6 is already used.  
   Instead set b = 6 giving f = 2 and a carry of 1.

Finally a:

6. 2 a + 1 must be a single digit (≤ 9).  
   The only remaining permissible a is 4: 2 × 4 + 1 = 9, so e = 9.

Thus the numbers are

 N = 46215 , D = 92430 ,

1.  A fifth relation from the hint

After the third throws Xavier’s total must exceed Rex’s by 26 points.

Xavier 3 = a + 2b + c + d   
Rex 3     = a +  c + d + 2f

2.  Consequences of (1)–(5)

Insert b = f + 65 in (4):

a + (f + 65) + c + d + f = 216  ⇒ a + c + d + 2f = 151 (6)

Subtract (6) from (1):

(a + 2c + d + f) – (a + c + d + 2f) = 177 – 151 ⇒ c – f = 26 (7)

Thus
 b = f + 65, c = f + 26.          (8)

Put (8) in (1):

a + 2(f + 26) + d + f = 177 ⇒ a + d + 3f = 125 (9)

Solve (9) and (3):

a = 6f – 47,  d = 172 – 9f.       (10)

Insert the expressions for b,d,f in (2):

(f + 65) + 2(172 – 9f) + e + f = 268  
  ⇒ e = 16f – 141.          (11)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Finding f

All face–values must be positive and different.

From (10) and (11):

a = 6f – 47  > 0 ⇒ f ≥ 8  
d = 172 – 9f > 0 ⇒ f ≤ 19  
e = 16f – 141> 0 ⇒ f ≥ 9

So 9 ≤ f ≤ 19.  
For every integer 9 ≤ f ≤ 19 the six numbers given by (8), (10), (11) are
indeed distinct, so the last requirement needed for uniqueness is that the
values be the smallest positive integers possible.  
That is achieved with the smallest admissible f, namely f = 9.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  The six face–values

With f = 9:

a = 6·9 – 47  = 7    b = 9 + 65   = 74  
c = 9 + 26    = 35    d = 172 – 9·9 = 91  
e = 16·9 –141 = 3    f = 9

Hence

1 → 7 points  
2 → 74 points  
3 → 35 points  
4 → 91 points  
5 → 3 points  
6 → 9 points

Rex 3 : 1,3,4,6,6  
 Score = 7 + 35 + 91 + 2·9 = 151

Totals after three turns  
Xavier : 177 + 203 + 281 = 661

If you imagine you are facing a globe head on, you have the north pole at the top of the globe and the south pole at the bottom. Imagine a ""west pole"" and ""east pole"" to the left and right of the globe.
If you are at the north pole and turn left, you will walk through the ""west pole"" (right and you go through the ""east pole"")
If you walk on an axis from the north pole towards the south pole and make a left or right turn you will always walk through these imaginary east and west poles. So in the question 17.345 kilometers is irrelevant, only the turn.
(It also doesn't matter where you start on the planet, the distance at the end will still be the same.)
47.124 is approximately 3/4 of the circumference of this planet, which will leave you directly on the imaginary east pole. The distance is now the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle of side 10km.

   Length BC = 47.124 km  
   Central angle  c = BC/R = 47.124 km ÷ 10 km = 4.7124 rad ≈ 3π/2 rad.

3.  The two walks meet at a right angle, so triangle ABC on the sphere is a right spherical triangle with right angle at B.

36, 10.781355, 36",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Label by k = 0,1,2,… the instants just AFTER each stretching, and let  

Lₖ  = length of the band (in inches) after the k-th stretch  
dₖ  = spider’s distance from the fixed end (in inches) after the k-th stretch  
pₖ  = fractional position on the band, pₖ = dₖ / Lₖ.  

1.  Length of the band  
   The band is 3 in at the start and grows 3 in each minute, so  
   Lₖ = 3 + 3k = 3(k+1).                                                (1)

2.  How the fractional position changes  
   During the (k+1)-st minute (i.e. between k and k+1) the length is constant
   and the spider walks 1 in, i.e. an additional fraction 1/Lₖ of the band.
   Stretching is uniform, so the fraction p does not change when the band is
   pulled.  Therefore  

        p₀ = 0,  pₖ₊₁ = pₖ + 1/Lₖ.                                   (2)

3.  The fractional position after k stretches  
   From (2) and (1)

        pₖ = Σ_{i=0}^{k-1} 1/Lᵢ
            = Σ_{i=0}^{k-1} 1/[3(i+1)]
            = (1/3) Σ_{n=1}^{k} 1/n
            = (1/3) H_k,                                            (3)

   where H_k is the k-th harmonic number.

4.  Find the first integer k with pₖ ≥ 1  
   We need H_k ≥ 3.  Computing,

        H₁₀ = 2.92897…   < 3
        H₁₁ = 3.01988…   > 3.

   Hence after 10 full minutes the spider is still short of the end, but it
   reaches (and passes) the end during the 11th minute.

5.  Exact moment within the 11th minute  
   After 10 stretches (k = 10)

        p₁₀ = (1/3)H₁₀ = (1/3)·(7381/2520) = 7381/7560.

   Fraction still needed:  
        r = 1 − p₁₀ = (7560 − 7381)/7560 = 179/7560.

   The band length during that minute is L₁₀ = 3(11) = 33 in.  
   The spider’s fractional speed is 1/L₁₀ per minute, so the time t (in minutes)
   needed to cover the remaining fraction r is

        t = r · L₁₀ = (179/7560)·33 = 5907/7560 = 1969/2520 min
          ≈ 0.781349 min.

   Converting to minutes and seconds:

        1969/2520 min = 10 min + 1969/2520 min
                       = 10 min + (1969/2520)·60 s
                       = 10 min + 1969/42 s
                       = 10 min 46 (37/42) s
                       ≈ 10 min 46.9 s.

Therefore the spider reaches the free end of the rubber band after about
10.78 minutes, i.e. 10 minutes 46 ⅞ seconds.

133,"A postman delivered letters every day. On the first day he delivered one letter, on the second day he delivered three letters, on the third day he delivered five letters, and so on. Each day from the second on he delivered two letters more than the preceding day.
The day he retired, he noticed that he had delivered a total of more than 100,000 letters.
Something fun is that the total number of letters he had delivered has its digits arranged in ascending order.
How many days had he worked, and how many letters had he delivered in total?",The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.,"It's easy to see that the number of letters he had delivered is the square of the number of days he had worked.
Square numbers can't end in 7 or 8, and 123456 is not a square because it is divisible by 3 but not by 9. Hence the number of letters must end with 9.
Since odd squares have remainder 1 upon division by 8, the number formed by its fourth and fifth digits must be divisible by 4, which can be 48, 56 or 68.
Numbers that have remainder 2 upon division by 3, and those that are divisible by 3 but not by 9 are not squares. By trial and error, we know that the only square number satisfying these conditions is 134689=367^2.
Hence, he had worked for 367 days, and had delivered 134689 letters.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the postman have worked n days.  

Because he delivered 1, 3, 5, … , 2n–1 letters on the successive days, the total number of letters he delivered is  

1 + 3 + 5 + … + (2n – 1) = n².             (1)

Thus we have to find a positive integer n such that

• n² > 100 000,  
• the digits of n² are in strictly ascending order,  
• the digits of n are in strictly ascending order (hint), and we must give both n and n².

-------------------------------------------------
1.  How many digits can n² have?

If n ≤ 316 then n² ≤ 99 856 < 100 000, so n ≥ 317.

(a) 7– or 8–digit total  

If n has four (strictly increasing) digits, the least possibility is 1234 and 1234² = 1 522 756 – already seven digits.  
A 7– or 8–digit number with strictly increasing digits is at least 1 234 567.  
But √1 234 567 ≈ 1111, whose digits are certainly not in strictly increasing order.  
Hence n cannot have four digits, and n² cannot have 7 or 8 digits.

(b) 6–digit total  

Therefore n must have three digits and n² must have six digits.

The smallest 6–digit number with strictly increasing digits is 123 456 and the largest one is 456 789, giving

351 = ⌈√123 456⌉ ≤ n ≤ ⌊√456 789⌋ = 676.             (2)

So n is a 3–digit integer satisfying 351 ≤ n ≤ 676 and whose own digits are strictly increasing.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  List all 3–digit numbers in (2) with strictly increasing digits.

These are exactly (19 of them)

-------------------------------------------------
3.  Examine the square of each candidate and keep only those whose six digits are strictly increasing.

(The computation is easy because (k+1)² = k² + 2k +1, so each next square is obtained from the previous one by adding a small number.)

• 345² = 119 025 – contains repeated 1’s and 0; reject.  
• 346² = 119 716 – reject.  
• 347² = 120 409 – contains 0; reject.  
• 348² = 121 104 – reject.  
• 356² = 126 736 – repeat 6; reject.  
• 357² = 127 449 – repeat 4; reject.  
• 358² = 128 164 – digits not ordered; reject.  
• 367² = 134 689 – digits 1 3 4 6 8 9 are strictly ascending ✔  
• 368² = 135 424 – digits not ordered; reject.  
• 378² = 142 884 – repeats 8; reject.  
• 456² = 207 936 – contains 0; reject.  
• 457² = 208 849 – repeats 8 & 0; reject.  
• 458² = 209 764 – contains 0; reject.  
• 467² = 218 089 – contains 0 and repeat 8; reject.  
• 468² = 219 024 – contains 0; reject.  
• 478² = 228 484 – repeats 2 and 8; reject.  
• 567² = 321 489 – digits not ordered; reject.  
• 568² = 322 624 – repeats 2; reject.  
• 578² = 334 084 – repeats 3 and 0; reject.

The only candidate that survives is

n = 367 with n² = 134 689.

-------------------------------------------------
4.  Verification

• n = 367 has digits 3 < 6 < 7 (strictly increasing).  
• n² = 134 689 has digits 1 < 3 < 4 < 6 < 8 < 9 (strictly increasing).  
• n² = 134 689 > 100 000, as required.

No other candidate satisfies all the conditions, so the solution is unique.

Oddly enough, an equal number of pedestrians walk in each direction at four kilometres per hour. The four cab drivers were discussing the best way to pick up a fare. Bill said he was going to sit beside the curb and wait until a fare came along. Bob said he was going to cruise west at four kilometres an hour; therefore, he would have twice the chance of picking up a fare as Bill. Frank said he was going to cruise east at eight kilometres an hour and his chances were twice as good as either Bill's or Bob's. Jim claimed that they were all wrong.

Bob, who was driving west at four kph, wouldn't pass anyone walking west, but would pass 200 people walking east. This would put him no further ahead than Bill. Frank, who was driving east and 300 people going west. Jim, who was going west at 12kph, would pass 200 people going west and 400 people going east.

4.  Let the three different digits be written in ascending order
         D₁ < D₂ < D₃ .

    Hence both D₁ and D₃ (the final digits of those two primes) must again
    be 1, 3 or 7.  
    Because they are distinct, {D₁ , D₃} must be two different members of
    {1, 3, 7}.  Therefore the largest digit is 7 and the smallest is 1 or 3.

          357 is divisible by 3 – reject.

    a) Digits {1, 5, 7}.  Since B must be 1 or 7:

         517 (B = 1)  AB = 51 (not prime)  
         571 (B = 7)  AB = 57 (not prime)

       All other permutations either have B = 5 (forbidden by (2)) or end
       in 5 and are therefore composite.  Thus no number with digits
       {1, 5, 7} works.

    b) Digits {1, 6, 7}.  B must again be 1 or 7.

         617 (B = 1) AB = 61 (prime), BC = 17 (prime), ABC = 617 (prime)  
         671 (B = 7) ABC = 671 = 11·61 (composite)

       Every permutation with B = 6 is excluded by (2), and the one with
       B = 7 failed.  Hence the single possibility that meets every clue is

                               ABC = 617.

All six clues are satisfied:

   1) 617 is a three–digit prime.  
   2) AB = 61 and BC = 17 are both primes.  
   3) Digits 6, 1, 7 are distinct.  
   4) No digit 9 appears.  
   5) Descending digits 7 6 1 give 761, a prime.  
   6) Ascending digits 1 6 7 give 167, a prime.

Therefore the mystery number is uniquely determined.

136,"Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?
Comments to triflers:
The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!",There are hints in the comments to triflers and in the title.,"80
To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion. This takes 9 trips of 2 5/18 miles (5 advancing trips interspersed with 4 return trips) for a total of 20.5 miles traveled (9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5) and 20.5 bottles of soda used. Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases. With one less case to move, Bu will now make 2 fewer trips. The 3.5 bottles set aside are used to move the four cases the next 1/2 mile toward the Wirth Pavilion.   After this, the Wirth Pavilion is just 2 2/9 miles away ( 5 - 2 5/18 - 9/18 = 2 4/18 ). Next, he travels 15 5/9 miles (7 * 2 2/9) using 15 5/9 bottles of soda to complete his trip. The ranger cadet delivers 80 bottles to the pavilion and has 4/9 of a Park Pop to spare. (96 - 15 5/9 = 80 4/9)",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

  C = 25 bottles … total that the MoJoPed can carry at one time,  
  F = 1 bottle … is in the fuel-tank and is emptied every mile,  
  U = C – F = 24 bottles … the most unopened bottles that can ride at one time.

There are 5 cases = 5·24 = 120 unopened bottles to start.  
The journey is 5 miles.  
Throughout the trip Bu may shuttle back and forth and may cache bottles
anywhere; empty bottles may be discarded.

1.  A lower bound – what must be lost each mile  

   Suppose, at the beginning of some mile, n unopened bottles are waiting to be
   moved on.

   • Bu must make g = ⌈n / 24⌉ forward trips to carry them, because at most 24
     unopened bottles fit beside the fuel bottle.

   • Except for the last forward trip, every forward journey is followed by a
     return journey to fetch another load.  
     Hence the number of crossings of that mile is  

           (forward trips) + (return trips) = g + (g – 1) = 2g – 1 .

   • One full bottle is emptied on every crossing, so at least 2g – 1 bottles
     must be sacrificed during that mile.

   Therefore, after the mile at most  

           n – (2⌈n/24⌉ – 1) unopened bottles  

   can remain.  This bound is unavoidable.

2.  Apply the bound mile by mile  

   Mile 0 → 1 : n₀ = 120 ⇒ g = ⌈120/24⌉ = 5  
   Bottles lost ≥ 2·5 – 1 = 9  
   n₁ ≤ 120 – 9 = 111.

   Mile 1 → 2 : n₁ = 111 ⇒ g = 5  
   Bottles lost ≥ 9  
   n₂ ≤ 111 – 9 = 102.

   Mile 2 → 3 : n₂ = 102 ⇒ g = 5  
   Bottles lost ≥ 9  
   n₃ ≤ 102 – 9 = 93.

   Mile 3 → 4 : n₃ = 93 ⇒ g = ⌈93/24⌉ = 4  
   Bottles lost ≥ 2·4 – 1 = 7  
   n₄ ≤ 93 – 7 = 86.

   Mile 4 → 5 : n₄ = 86 ⇒ g = 4  
   Bottles lost ≥ 7  
   n₅ ≤ 86 – 7 = 79.

   Thus no strategy can deliver more than 79 unopened bottles to Wirth
   Pavilion.

3.  A strategy that actually delivers 79 bottles  

   The bound is attainable; one explicit schedule is sketched below for the
   first mile (the others are analogous).

   • Make five forward trips from mile 0 to mile 1.  
     On the first four trips carry 24 unopened + 1 fuel bottle; deposit
     23 unopened (one of the 24 is opened for the return fuel) and ride back
     empty.  
     On the fifth trip carry the remaining bottles (19 unopened + 1 fuel) and
     do not return.

   Total after the first mile: 111 unopened left, 9 bottles consumed.

   Repeating the same idea on the later miles consumes exactly the numbers of
   bottles found in the bound above, and 79 unopened bottles arrive at mile 5.

Because 79 unopened bottles can be delivered and no strategy can exceed
79, the maximum possible delivery is fixed.

137,"Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.  Henry's plan calls for the tracks (each of which is one mile in length) to be laid end-to-end with no gap between them, pinned to the ground at every other juncture, as shown below:
v_______ _______vv_______ _______v
Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""
Henry replies, ""The expansion will only be an inch over the whole mile length.  If the tracks buckle, it will only be by an inch or two at most.  The trains will certainly have no trouble bumping over these buckles.""
Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?",Would Pythagoras have the same plan?,"The rise in the middle of the tracks would have been much greater than Henry surmised.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse). SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the joints that are bolted to the ground be A, B, C, … .  
Henry bolts every other joint, so the distance from one bolt to the next is two 1-mile rails, i.e.  

 AB = 2 miles = 10 560 ft.  

At the highest temperature each mile–long rail grows one inch, so the two-mile piece AB is then  

 AB (actual length) = 10 560 ft + 2 in  
           = 10 560 ft + 2/12 ft  
           = 10 560 ft + 1⁄6 ft  
           = 10 560.166 7 ft.

The bolts keep the end points A and B fixed on the ground, so the extra 1⁄6 ft cannot be taken up horizontally; the track must buckle upward (or sideways).  
To see how large the buckle is, idealise it as the simplest possible shape: an isosceles triangle whose base AB remains on the ground and whose equal sides are the two half-lengths of rail.

Let M be the mid-point of AB and let h be the height of the buckle at M.

The half-length of track is  
 s = ½ (10 560.166 7 ft) = 5 280.083 3 ft,

while the half-chord AM is exactly  
 c = ½ (10 560 ft) = 5 280 ft.

By Pythagoras on right-triangle AM M′ (M′ is the point of maximum rise):

 s² = c² + h²

Thus  

 h ≈ √880 ft ≈ 29.7 ft.

So the “small” buckle that Henry expected to be “an inch or two” is in fact nearly thirty feet high—about a three-storey building! A train would, of course, be thrown off the rails long before attempting to climb such a hump.

Pythagoras would certainly not have had the same plan, and Henry’s boss was right to fire him.

Final answer: The rails would have to rise roughly 30 feet between bolts, not “an inch or two,” making the track completely unusable; that is why the boss was so critical.",True,1,0

Follow every note exactly.

1.  Put AB against the house, take AB = 16 ft and make it horizontal.

        A(0,0) ─────────── B(16,0)

2.  Because AF ⟂ AB and AF = 6 ft while BC ∥ AF and BC = 6 ft, drop two
    perpendiculars of length 6 ft:

        F(0, –6)   and   C(16, –6)

1.  Sn is 32 fewer than Sm:                        Sn = Sm – 32     (1)

2.  “Kevin counted a total of 122 in the morning and noon counts”  
    Km + Kn = 122                                             (2)

    That total is one higher than his evening count:     Ke = (Km+Kn) – 1 = 121   (3)

    That same total is 24 more than Smith’s evening count:     Se = 122 – 24 = 98   (4)

Use (4):              Se = 98.                                      (9)

Insert (7),(8),(9) into (5):

Insert Km into (2):   78 + Kn = 122  →  Kn = 44.                    (11)

Check: Ke already fixed at 121; indeed 78+44 = 122 and 122 – 1 = 121, so every clue is satisfied.

  R = 10 000 E + 1 000 D + 100 C + 10 B + A.

Given R – N = 33 957.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Form an equation that involves only the outer two pairs of digits

R – N

Thus

  9 999(E – A) + 990(D – B) = 33 957.        (1)

Divide (1) by 9:

  1 111(E – A) + 110(D – B) = 3 773.        (2)

3.  Solve (2) for the allowed digit differences  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Write (2) as 110(D – B) = 3 773 – 1 111(E – A).

Because 110 = 11·10, work modulo 110.

• 3 773 ≡ 33 (mod 110).  
• 1 111 ≡ 11 (mod 110).

Hence

 33 – 11(E – A) ≡ 0 (mod 110)  
 ⇒ 11(3 – (E – A)) ≡ 0 (mod 110)  
 ⇒ 3 – (E – A) ≡ 0 (mod 10).

Therefore E – A = 3 – 10k for some integer k.

But E – A is a digit difference, so –9 ≤ E – A ≤ 9.

The only admissible values are:

 k = 0 ⇒ E – A = 3,  
 k = 1 ⇒ E – A = –7  (disallowed, gives |difference|>9).

So E – A = 3.                                       (3)

Substitute (3) into (2):

 1 111·3 + 110(D – B) = 3 773  
 ⇒ 3 333 + 110(D – B) = 3 773  
 ⇒ 110(D – B) = 440  
 ⇒ D – B = 4.                                     (4)

Since E ≤ 9 and A ≥ 1, A can be 1,2,3,4,5,6 (6 possibilities).  
Correspondingly E = 4,5,6,7,8,9.

(4) D = B + 4.  
Because 0 ≤ B ≤ 5  (so that D ≤ 9), B can be 0,1,2,3,4,5 (6 possibilities).  
Then D = 4,5,6,7,8,9.

The middle digit C is unrestricted: C = 0,1,…,9 (10 possibilities).

You do not have any time or distance measuring tools and the length of the rope is unknown.  How can you measure 75 minutes?",Set distance and time relations and equations,"Mark the two ropes as Rope(A) and Rope(B).
1. Let Mouse(A) and Mouse(C) start biting off Rope(A) at the same time, starting each from  one end (moving in opposite directions).  At the same time, let Mouse(B) start biting off Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(A) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X = S(A) * 60, where S(A) is biting speed for Mouse(A) and X is Rope(A) length
X = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X is Rope(A) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(A)/S(C) = 3:1, which means that for each 3 units Mouse(A) will move, Mouse (C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(A) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(A) bites off three times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides Rope(A) length in to 4 units.
Mouse(A) bitten off portion = 3/4 X (where X is Rope(A) length)

X/2 = S(B) * 90, where S(B) is biting speed for Mouse(B) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
X/2 = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
Solving the two above equations gives:

Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(B) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(B) bites off two times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides the remaining half of Rope(B) length to 3 units.

Finding the time spent before the remaining half of Rope(B) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(B) needs  90 minutes to bite off X, how many minutes are needed to bite off X/3?
Minutes needed = 1/3 * 90 = 30 minutes are needed to fully bite off the remaining half of Rope(B) by Mouse(B) and Mouse(C).
At that point in time, 75 minutes would have passed (45 minutes consumed from biting off Rope(A) and another 30 minutes consumed from biting off Rope(B)).",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the (unknown) length of each rope be L.

1.  Set up the biting ­rates  
   Mouse A : vA = L / 60  (rope-lengths per minute)  
   Mouse B : vB = L / 90  
   Mouse C : vC = L / 180  

2.  Measure 45 minutes with the first rope  
   • Tie the first rope between two fixed points.  
   • At the same instant put Mouse A at the left end and Mouse C at the right end; they bite toward each other.  
     
     The two ends approach one another with combined speed  
         vA + vC = L/60 + L/180 = (3L + L)/180 = L/45 .  
     The time until the two mice meet is  
         t₁ = L ÷ (L/45) = 45 minutes.  
   • The moment A and C meet we have a reliable 45-minute “alarm”.

3.  Measure 30 further minutes with the second rope  
   • At the instant of that meeting place all three mice together at one end of the unused second rope. (Any remaining piece of the first rope may be discarded; it has served its purpose.)  
   • Their combined speed along the second rope is  
         vA + vB + vC = L/60 + L/90 + L/180  
                      = (3L + 2L + L)/180  
                      = 6L/180  
                      = L/30 .  
     Hence the time required for the three mice to eat the entire second rope is  
         t₂ = L ÷ (L/30) = 30 minutes.  
   • When the second rope is completely gone, exactly 30 minutes have elapsed since the 45-minute mark.

4.  Total elapsed time  
       t₁ + t₂ = 45 min + 30 min = 75 minutes.

Thus, without any clock or ruler, the described procedure gives a precise interval of 75 minutes.

142,"Rob the robot went to the candy-store to buy some candies. He found his favorite gums in front of him, in packages of 225 gums in each.

This contains nine ones, so it is divisible by 9, and two 0's at the end, so it is divisible by 25.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Because Rob buys complete packets, the number of gums he eats must be a positive multiple of  

225 = 3² · 5².

We want the smallest such multiple whose decimal expansion uses only the digits 0 and 1.

1.  Divisibility by 25  
    A decimal number is divisible by 25 iff its last two digits are 00, 25, 50 or 75.  
    Since only 0’s and 1’s are allowed, the only possible ending is  

    …00.  
    Hence the desired number ends in the two digits 00.

2.  Divisibility by 9  
    A decimal number is divisible by 9 exactly when the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.  
    With only 0’s and 1’s, that sum equals the number of 1’s occurring.  
    Therefore the amount of 1’s has to be a multiple of 9.  
    The smallest positive multiple of 9 is 9 itself, so the fewest 1’s we can have is nine.

3.  How many digits are needed?  
    Nine 1’s plus the obligatory final two 0’s require at least  

    9 + 2 = 11 digits.

4.  Positioning the digits to make the number as small as possible  
    With exactly eleven digits, the first nine of them must all be 1 (if any of these nine were 0,
    we could not reach the required total of nine 1’s, because the last two digits are forced to be 0).  
    Thus the only eleven-digit candidate is  

        11111111100.

5.  Verifying divisibility  
        11111111100 / 25 = 444444444   (an integer)  
        444444444      /  9 =  49382716 (also an integer)  

    Hence 11111111100 is divisible by both 25 and 9, i.e. by 225.

6.  Minimality  
    • Fewer than eleven digits are impossible (we need at least nine 1’s plus two 0’s).  
    • Any number with more than eleven digits is obviously larger than an eleven-digit one that
      already works.  
    Therefore 11111111100 is the smallest permissible multiple of 225.

1.  Determining the rule for “++”

   Assume     a ++ b = a + k·b            (k is a constant)

   Use 4 ++ 8 = 20
           4 + k·8 = 20  ⇒  k = 2.

   Check with 8 ++ 4:

          numerator
   x  =  ---------  =  1/11 , so y = 11x ,
          y (denominator)

and let all nine given digits (1,1,2,3,3,4,4,5,7) be used once in x and y.

1.  How many digits do x and y have?  
    •  If x has n digits, 11x has either n or n+1 digits.  
    •  n+n  or n+(n+1) must equal 9 (all digits are used).  
    •  The only possibility is n = 4 and n+1 = 5.  
       Hence x is a 4-digit number and y a 5-digit number.

2.  Structure of 11×(abcd).  
    Write x = abcd (a ≠ 0).  Multiplying by 11 gives  

            11·(abcd)
          = a (a+b) (b+c) (c+d) d

    after the usual carries.  Whatever the carries, the units digit of 11x
    is the same d (because 11·abcd = 10·abcd + abcd).

    Therefore the last digit of x and of y is identical—exactly the hint.

3.  Which digits can be last?  
    The last digit is used twice (once in x, once in y), so it must be one
    of the digits that appear twice in the list: 1, 3 or 4.

4.  Where do the single 5 and 7 go?  
    Digit 5 and digit 7 occur only once, so they cannot be the repeated
    last digit; they must lie somewhere inside the 5-digit denominator y.
    Looking at the pattern a (a+b) (b+c) (c+d) d, 5 and 7 must be equal to
    one (or two) of the four interior “sum–digits”
           a+b , b+c , c+d , or to a itself.
    Hence one of those sums must be 5 and one must be 7.

5.  Choosing the last digit.

    •  If d = 1  
      then c+d = c+1 ≥ 2 and b+c ≥ b+? … none of these sums can be 7
      without making the other sums 6,8,9 or 0, digits we do not possess.
      So d ≠ 1.

    •  If d = 3  
      then c+d = c+3.  To obtain 7 we would need c = 4; but with c = 4
      the available digits would give b+c = b+4 ≥ 5; the only unused digits
      ≥5 are 5 and 7, forcing b = 1 or 3, both impossible because the
      corresponding a+b or a would repeat digits too often.  Thus d ≠ 3.

    •  Hence d = 4.

6.  Determining the other digits.

    With d = 4 we must have one interior sum equal to 7; the only way is  
           c + d = 7  ⇒ c = 3.
    Now a second interior sum must be 5; that can only be  
           b + c = 5  ⇒ b = 2.
    Finally  
           a + b = a + 2 must be one of the remaining digits {1,3,4}.  
           The only choice that keeps every digit within the given multiset
           and avoids extra repetitions is a = 1 (because 1+2 = 3).

    Thus the numerator is
           x = abcd = 1 2 3 4 = 1234 ,
    and the denominator is
           y = 11x = 13574 .

    Check of digits used:
       numerator: 1,2,3,4
       denominator: 1,3,5,7,4
       multiset obtained: 1,1,2,3,3,4,4,5,7  – exactly the required set.

7.  Verification of the value:
           11 × 1234 = 13574  ⇒ 1234 / 13574 = 1 / 11.

Hence the only possible arrangement is

145,How many trailing zeros are in the number 1000!?,The number of trailing zeros is equivalent to the number of factors of 10,"The ! stands for factorial.  So, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!
The only way to get a trailing zero is by multiplying a factor of 1000! which is 2 by a factor of 1000! which is 5. The modified problem is thus: How many such pairs of factors are there?
There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5. But in addition there are 40 = 1000/25 numbers which are multiples of 25, each of which gives one factor of five in addition to the one counted in the 200 and the one counted in the 40 above. Finally there is 1 = [1000/625] number which is a multiple of 625, this gives one further factor of 5. Thus there are exactly  200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249 factors of 5 in 1000! and since there are more than sufficient factors of 2, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"To count trailing zeros in 1000!, we count how many times 10 divides it.  
Since 10 = 2 × 5 and factorials supply far more 2’s than 5’s, the limiting factor is the number of 5’s in the prime–factorization of 1000!.

Legendre’s formula gives the exponent of a prime p in n!:

Exponent of p in n! = ⌊n/p⌋ + ⌊n/p²⌋ + ⌊n/p³⌋ + …, stopping when the quotient is zero.

Take p = 5 and n = 1000:

⌊1000/5⌋  = 200  
⌊1000/25⌋ =  40  
⌊1000/125⌋ =  8  
⌊1000/625⌋ =  1  
⌊1000/3125⌋ = 0 (stop here)

Add them: 200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249.

Since 7*14=98, there was only one cyclist that he never beat and that was the champion.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Call the 99 other riders R₁ , R₂ , … , R₉₉ and let R₁ be the eventual champion.  
For every stage we shall specify only the order in which the riders arrive and the
time-gaps with respect to “Crazy” Charles; these gaps may be as small or as large as we
wish, provided they are compatible with the order of arrival.

Step 1 – distributing the 98 “bad days”.  
• In every stage Charles is 93rd, so 7 riders finish after him.  
• Over 14 stages we therefore have 14 × 7 = 98 positions that are behind Charles.  

Put the 98 riders R₂ , … , R₉₉ into 14 groups of 7 and let the members of the
i-th group be the 7 riders who finish after Charles in stage i.
Thus

 • each of the 98 riders is behind Charles exactly once,  
 • the champion R₁ is never behind Charles.

Step 2 – assigning the time-gaps.  
Fix two positive numbers

 ε  =  1 second        (very small),  
 H  =  1 hour          (very large).

In every stage let the times be arranged as follows.

 • Champion R₁ beats Charles by ε.  
 • The 91 riders who are ahead of Charles but are not R₁ also beat Charles by ε.  
 • The 7 riders who are behind Charles lose to him by H.

Because ε is tiny compared with H, this order is perfectly compatible with the
required placings.

Step 3 – the accumulated times.  
For Charles the total time is

 T C = 14·(his own stage time)                   (reference).

Champion R₁ gains ε on Charles in each of the 14 stages, so

 T₁ = T C − 14ε.                                                     (1)

Every other rider R_k (k ≥ 2) gains ε on Charles in 13 stages but loses H once, so

 T_k = T C − 13ε + H = T C + (H − 13ε).                           (2)

Since H ≫ 13ε, we have H − 13ε > 0, whence

 T₁ < T C < T_k  for all k = 2,…,99.                           (3)

Consequently

 overall order = 1st : champion R₁  
                 2nd : “Crazy” Charles  
                 3rd–100th : the remaining 98 riders.

Conclusion.  
Even though Charles was never higher than 93rd in any individual stage, every
competitor except the champion had one very bad day on which he lost a whole hour
to Charles, whereas on their good days they gained only a second at a time.  These
large single losses outweigh the many tiny gains, so Charles’s cumulative time is
better than 98 of the 99 rivals, making him the runner-up overall.

Final answer: Because every one of the other 98 riders had one stage in which he finished just after Charles but many minutes slower, while in all other stages he beat Charles by only a second, Charles’s total time was better than theirs; only the champion, who was ahead of Charles by a second in every stage, finished with a smaller total time, so Charles came second although he was never better than 93rd in any single stage.",True,1,0
147,"The Boldavian navy has a rigorous training program.  In order to graduate from the naval academy, cadets must enter a pool and fight sharks.  Today, a group of cadets was tested.  Each cadet put on his mask, snorkel, and two flippers; and armed himself with a knife.  Then the cadets jumped into the pool.  The sharks were then released from their pens.  After 10 minutes of gruelling hand-to-fin combat, all of the sharks were killed.  Miraculously, none of the cadets were killed.  Exiting the pool, the cadets began to haul the shark bodies out of the water.  The dead sharks were soon lying in a row.  One of the cadets noted that during the fight, there were 4 times as many cadets in the water as there were sharks.

Equate (2) and (4):

s² = 5s + 14  
s² – 5s – 14 = 0  
(s – 7)(s + 2) = 0.

Because a negative number of sharks is impossible, we take s = 7.

Check consistency:  
c = 4s = 28 cadets.  
L = s² = 49 legs.  

Originally the cadets had 2·28 = 56 legs, so 56 − 49 = 7 legs were lost—possible in the combat scenario.  
Total heads c + s = 28 + 7 = 35, and indeed 49 = 35 + 14.

= B(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)
(since B(1+Y) is the price during inflation and  B(1-Y)(1+Y) the price during the slowdown)
Therefore the decrease in price after one year
= B - B(1-Y^2)
= B - B + B*Y^2
= B*Y^2 = 162      ... Equation 1
Hence after another year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 147.42 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)(1-Y^2)
= B(1-Y^2)^2
(since B(1-Y^2) is the price at the end of the previous year and           B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y) the price during the slowdown this year)
Therefore the decrease in price this year
= B(1-Y^2) - B(1-Y^2)^2
= B(1-Y^2)[1 - (1-Y^2)]
= B(1-Y^2)( Y^2) = 147.42    ... Equation 2
Dividing Equation 2 by Equation 1, we get
(1-Y^2) = 0.91 => Y^2 = 0.09
Substituting the above value of Y^2 in equation 1, we get
B*0.09 = 162
Hence B = 162/0.09 = 1800 Roka.
Therefore the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let

(so the six labelled unit–squares are fixed in their places).  
A “division” means drawing some of the interior grid-lines so that the board

We must obtain at least two rectangles.

Because every rectangle is a union of unit squares, the only possible
rectangular shapes and their areas are  

1×1 (area 1), 1×2 / 2×1 (area 2), 1×3 (area 3) and 2×2 (area 4).

A domino occupies two adjacent squares.
On the 2 × 3 board there are  

• 4 horizontal positions  (a,b), (b,c), (d,e), (e,f)

k = 4

Two different patterns are possible.

(1) one 1 × 3 strip + three single squares.  
   The strip can be the upper row or the lower row → 2 ways.

(2) two dominoes + two single squares.  
   Take unordered pairs of disjoint domino positions from the 7 listed above.
   The disjoint pairs are

{(a,b),(d,e)}, {(a,b),(e,f)}, {(a,b),(c,f)},  
{(b,c),(d,e)}, {(b,c),(e,f)}, {(b,c),(a,d)},  
{(d,e),(c,f)}, {(e,f),(a,d)},  
{(a,d),(b,e)}, {(a,d),(c,f)}, {(b,e),(c,f)}

i.e. 11 pairs.

 interior (unpainted) cubes (a−2)(b−2)(c−2) = (2x−2)(2y−2)(2z−2) = 8(x−1)(y−1)(z−1).

Because the number of interior cubes equals the number of painted ones,

 8(x−1)(y−1)(z−1) = N − 8(x−1)(y−1)(z−1) = 8xyz − 8(x−1)(y−1)(z−1),

and division by 8 gives the key equation

We must find the least value of N = 8xyz that admits integer solutions of (2).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  x = 2 is impossible  
With x = 2, one factor (x−1) equals 1, so (2) becomes 2(y−1)(z−1) = 2yz ⇒ y+z = 1, impossible for y , z ≥ 2.  
Hence x ≥ 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  x = 3  
Equation (2) gives 4(y−1)(z−1) = 3yz → (y−4)(z−4) = 12.  
All integer solutions are  
 (y , z) = (5,16), (6,10), (7,8) and their permutations,  
whose smallest product xyz is 3·7·8 = 168.  
Thus N = 8·168 = 1344 in this case.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  x = 4  
Equation (2) gives 3(y−1)(z−1) = 2yz → (y−3)(z−3) = 6.  
The positive solutions are (y , z) = (4,9), (5,6) and permutations;  
the least product is xyz = 4·5·6 = 120, giving N = 8·120 = 960.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  x = 5 and x = 6  
A similar reduction yields respectively  

 8(y−1)(z−1) = 5yz → z = 8(x−1)/(3x−8),  
 5(y−1)(z−1) = 3yz → z = 5(x−1)/(2x−5),

whose integral solutions again include (y , z) = (4,6) or (6,4).  
Both give xyz = 5·4·6 = 120 or xyz = 6·4·5 = 120, so N = 960.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  x ≥ 7 gives larger products  
For y = 3, (2) becomes (x−4)(z−4) = 12, and x ≥ 7 forces z ≤ 5,  
so xyz ≥ 7·3·5 = 105, but (2) has no integral solution in that range.  
For y ≥ 4 we have y ≥ 4 ⇒ y−1 ≥ 3, z−1 ≥ 3, hence from (2)

 xyz = 2(x−1)(y−1)(z−1) ≥ 2·(x−1)·3·3 ≥ 2·6·3·3 = 108

and the smallest actual solutions one can obtain (via the same reduction as before) are again xyz = 120.  
Thus no solution with x ≥ 7 beats the product 120 found already.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Minimal cuboid  

The least possible product xyz is therefore 120.  
Choosing the solution (x , y , z) = (4,5,6) gives, via (1),

 edge lengths 8 cm × 10 cm × 12 cm,  
 total small cubes N = 8·120 = 960,  
 interior cubes (8−2)(10−2)(12−2) = 6·8·10 = 480,

Adding the three equalities gives  
2(a + b + c) = x² + y² + z².                                                             (2)

Hence the total sum S = a + b + c equals  
S = (x² + y² + z²)/2.                                                                    (3)

Solving (1) for a , b , c yields  

a = (x² + y² − z²)/2, b = (x² + z² − y²)/2, c = (y² + z² − x²)/2.        (4)

So we must find three perfect squares x², y², z² such that

• x² + y² + z² is twice a perfect square (so that S in (3) is a square);  
• every numerator in (4) is positive (so a , b , c > 0);  
• each of a , b , c is < 500.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Choosing suitable squares
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Take  

x² = 20² = 400, y² = 19² = 361, z² = 11² = 121.

Check that their sum is twice a square:

400 + 361 + 121 = 882 = 2·441 = 2·21².

Thus S = (400 + 361 + 121)/2 = 441 = 21² is a perfect square.

Now compute a , b , c from (4):

a = (400 + 361 − 121)/2 = 640/2 = 320  
b = (400 + 121 − 361)/2 = 160/2 = 80  
c = (361 + 121 − 400)/2 = 82/2 = 41

All three are positive and each is less than 500.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Verification of the required properties
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Pairwise sums:

a + b = 320 + 80 = 400 = 20² (perfect square)  
a + c = 320 + 41 = 361 = 19² (perfect square)  
b + c = 80 + 41 = 121 = 11² (perfect square)

Total sum:

a + b + c = 320 + 80 + 41 = 441 = 21² (perfect square)

The condition is  

 (10A + B)(10D + E) – C = N,   

where N is composed of one and the same digit which, by the hint, must be even.

1.  Parity of N  
   AB and DE are odd, hence their product is odd.  
   C is odd, therefore N = (odd) – (odd) is even – exactly as required.

2.  How many digits can N have?  
   The smallest possible product of two different odd two–digit numbers is  
   13·15 = 195.  
   So N ≥ 195 – 9 = 186.

   • 3-digit even repdigits are 222, 444, 666, 888.  
     Adding at most 9 (the biggest possible C) gives numbers ≤ 897.  
     Therefore AB·DE ≤ 897 in this case, but every odd two–digit factor is ≥ 13, so  
     AB·DE ≥ 13·15 = 195, hence ≤ 897 is possible in principle.  
     Nevertheless none of the numbers 222 ± C, 444 ± C, 666 ± C, 888 ± C can be written as the product of two different 2-digit odd numbers that together use four different digits of {1,3,5,7,9}.  (A short factor check shows this.)  
   • 4-digit even repdigits are 2222, 4444, 6666, 8888, all ≤ 9215 (= 95·97), so they are the only serious candidates.

For each partition the two‐digit numbers that can be formed are unique (order either way), and their products are easily checked.

•  C = 1

   39·57 = 2223.   Hence

   All other products with C = 1 or any product belonging to the other two partitions ({3,5}&{7,9}, {3,7}&{5,9}) are unequal to 2222 + 1, 4444 + 1, 6666 + 1, or 8888 + 1.

•  C = 3, 5, 7 or 9  
   A similar check shows that none of the corresponding products equals 2222 + C, 4444 + C, 6666 + C or 8888 + C.

Therefore the unique repdigit obtained is 2222 and the centre digit must be 1; the four outer digits are 3,9,5,7 with AB and DE coming from {39,57} in either order.

4.  Forming the five–digit numbers  

Case A: AB = 39,  DE = 57 ⇒  39157

There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:

v2 = 2 x h/180,
v3 = 1 x h/180,

When a given group eats until the field is bare, the total eaten by the animals equals the grass that was there originally plus what has grown meanwhile.

From the four situations given we therefore have  

1) (Cow + Goat) for 45 days: (c + g)·45 = B + R·45

Step 1.  Eliminate B by using equation (3):  
B = 90(c – R).

Step 2.  Substitute this B in (1) and (2).

Insert (A) and (B) into (C):

Step 5.  Determine the initial amount of grass:

B = 90(c – R) = 90(c – c/3) = 90·(2c/3) = 60c.

Step 6.  Let T be the number of days all three animals graze together.  
Total eaten by the animals in that time = (c + g + s)T = (c + 2c/3 + c/3)T = 2cT.  
Grass available during that time = B + R·T = 60c + (c/3)T.

Set them equal:

2cT = 60c + (c/3)T  
(2 – 1/3)cT = 60c  
(5/3) c T = 60 c  
 ⇒ T = 60 · (3/5) = 36.

For every person x define k(x) = “the number of people x knows.”  
Because everybody “knows himself or herself,” each k(x) ≥ 1.

Thus each k(x) is an integer in the set {1, 2, …, n}.  
We shall show, by contradiction, that two different people must share the same value of k.

Indirect (contradiction) assumption  
Assume all the n numbers k(x) are different.  
Since there are exactly n possible values (1 through n) and n people, every value occurs once.  
Consequently

• there exists a person A with k(A) = 1 (A knows only himself/herself);  
• there exists a person B with k(B) = n (B knows everybody).

Now use the symmetry “if A knows B, then B knows A.”

Because k(B) = n, person B knows every person at the party, hence in particular B knows A.  
By symmetry, A must know B.

Here d (1 ≤ d ≤ 9) is the last digit and a is the “rest” of the number; if N has k+1 digits, then a has k digits (10^{k-1} ≤ a ≤ 10^{k}-1).

After we cut the right-most digit off and place it in front, the new integer is  

M = d·10^{k} + a.        (2)

The problem states that this new number is 50 % larger than the original one, i.e.  

d·10^{k} + a = 3/2 · (10a + d).        (3)

Clear the fraction by multiplying by 2:

2d·10^{k} + 2a = 30a + 3d  
⟹ 2d·10^{k} – 3d = 28a.        (4)

Factor out d and solve for a:

a = d(2·10^{k} – 3) / 28.        (5)

Thus 28 must divide d(2·10^{k} – 3).

Factor 28 = 2²·7 and study the divisibility one prime at a time.

1.  Divisibility by 4  
   For k ≥ 1 we have 10^{k} ≡ 0 (mod 2) and hence 2·10^{k} – 3 ≡ 1 (mod 4), i.e. the bracket is odd.  
   Therefore the factor 4 must come entirely from d, so d must be divisible by 4: d ∈ {4, 8}.

2.  Divisibility by 7  
   We need 2·10^{k} – 3 ≡ 0 (mod 7), because neither 4 nor 8 is a multiple of 7.

   Use 10 ≡ 3 (mod 7).  The powers of 3 modulo 7 repeat every six steps:

   k : 1  2  3  4  5  6  
   3^{k} (mod 7) : 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1

   Hence 10^{k} (mod 7) follows the same cycle and

   2·10^{k} – 3 (mod 7) becomes  
   2·3–3 = 3, 2·2–3 = 1, 2·6–3 = 2, 2·4–3 = 5, 2·5–3 = 0, 2·1–3 =  –1≡6.

   The first k that gives 0 is k = 5.

So the minimal length is k = 5, i.e. N has 6 digits.

For k = 5 we have

2·10^{5} – 3 = 200 000 – 3 = 199 997.        (6)

Insert this in (5).

(a)  d = 4: a = 4·199 997 / 28 = (4/28)·199 997 = 199 997 / 7 = 28 571.  
      This has indeed 5 digits, so  

      N = 10a + d = 285 714.

(b)  d = 8: a = 8·199 997 / 28 = 2·199 997 / 7 = 57 142, giving N = 571 428, larger than (a).

Therefore the smallest solution is N = 285 714.

Verification:  
Move the 4 in 285 714 to the front → 428 571.

          = 16m + 18 − 21m − 18  
          = −5m.

Hence −5m ≥ 0 ⇒ m = 0.

5.  Their present ages

With m = 0:

 A = 24, B = 18.

6.  The previous meeting

Let t years have elapsed since their previous meeting.  Then

 A − t and B − t

were their ages at that meeting and, by the problem statement, must both be prime.

For A = 24, B = 18 the only positive integer t that makes both numbers prime is t = 1:

 A − t = 24 − 1 = 23 (prime),  
 B − t = 18 − 1 = 17 (prime).

Since 1 year ago is indeed the last time they met, this satisfies every condition in the problem, and no other value of k (or m) can work (steps 3–4).

Therefore, at their last meeting Alf was 23 and Bert was 17.

Final answer: Alf was 23 years old and Bert was 17 years old.",True,0,0
166,"Your assignment is to make a delivery from the depot to your base camp, 1600 miles away. The trip begins normally, but unfortunately, halfway to base camp, your supply truck breaks down. You have no way to call for help. Luckily, in addition to medical supplies, the truck is carrying a Desert Patrol Vehicle (DPV) and two barrels of fuel.
The DPV has a full 10 gallon tank, but to make room for the medical supplies, it can only carry one of the 45 gallon barrels at a time. While you can't transfer fuel between barrels, you can refill the tank from the barrels. Assume the DPV can get 12 miles per gallon, regardless of the load it carries.
How far can you go? Is it far enough to deliver the medical supplies and the DPV to your base camp?","Use half of a tank to carry one barrel, then return for the other.","You can travel 840 miles from the broken supply truck. Since your base camp is 800 miles away (half of 1600 miles), you can easily complete the delivery. Here's how:
Although you can only carry one barrel at a time, you need to transport both of them until one barrel is empty. F is the barrel used first, and L is the barrel used last.
Use half of a tank (5 gallons) to carry L 5*12=60 miles, and then return for F (uses another 5 gallons). Refill the tank from F and carry it to where you left L (also uses 5 gallons). Refill the tank again from F and switch barrels. Now you are 60 miles from the broken truck, the tank and L are full, but F is down to 30 gallons (45-5-5-5=30). Repeat this procedure two times.
Now you are 60*3=180 miles from the broken truck. The tank and L are still full, but F is empty. Leave F behind and make a run for it, carrying L. Refill the tank from L as needed. There are 55 gallons of fuel left so you can travel an additional 55*12=660 miles, for a maximum of (180+660) 840 miles.  Since you only have a total of 800 miles to go, you will make it to your base camp.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Begin at the breakdown point, 800 mi from camp, with  
– DPV tank full  (=10 gal)  
– two sealed barrels (=45 gal each).  
The DPV can carry only one barrel at a time.

Because a full tank gives 120 mi (10 gal × 12 mpg), “half-a-tank” is 5 gal = 60 mi.  
Using the hint, every time we haul one barrel 60 mi forward and drive back empty for the other barrel we consume exactly one full tank (10 gal):

• forward with a barrel … 60 mi … 5 gal  
• back empty … 60 mi … 5 gal  
 total 120 mi driven, 10 gal used.

That 10 gal is the “over-head” necessary to move both barrels 60 mi closer to camp.

STEP-BY-STEP HAUL

0 mi (break-down point) Tank 10 gal, Barrels 45 + 45 = 100 gal total

1. Haul barrel A 60 mi forward (use 5 gal).  
   Return empty 60 mi (use 5 gal).  
   Fuel left: 0 ( tank ) + 90 ( barrels ) = 90 gal.  
   Barrel A now sits at mile 60.

2. Fill the tank from barrel B, take barrel B to mile 60  
   (again 5 gal), so both barrels are together.  
   Fuel spent so far: 15 gal; distance advanced with both barrels: 60 mi.

Repeat the above two-move pattern twice more.

After 3 complete relays (three “out-and-back” cycles)

• distance advanced with both barrels  = 3 × 60 mi = 180 mi  
• fuel consumed  = 3 × 15 gal = 45 gal  
• fuel remaining  = 100 gal – 45 gal = 55 gal

DISTRIBUTION AFTER THE THIRD RELAY  
at mile 180: Tank 5 gal, Barrel A 45 gal, Barrel B 5 gal.

Pour the last 5 gal from barrel B into the tank (tank now 10 gal);  
barrel B is empty and may be discarded.

Now the DPV is carrying exactly 55 gal (full tank 10 gal + full barrel A 45 gal), which is the greatest amount it can carry at one time.

FINAL RUN TO BASE CAMP  
Distance still to go: 800 mi – 180 mi = 620 mi  
Fuel required: 620 mi ÷ 12 mpg = 51 2⁄3 gal.

We have 55 gal, so

55 gal – 51 2⁄3 gal = 3 1⁄3 gal

are left when we reach camp.

RESULT

The DPV can travel the entire remaining 800 miles from the breakdown point to base camp, arriving with about 3.3 gallons still in its tank. Thus the medical supplies (and the DPV) do reach base camp.",True,0,0

n = a + (a+1) + … + (a+L-1)  (L ≥ 2, a ≥ 0).

Using the well–known formula for an arithmetic series,

n = L(2a + L – 1)/2.                                   (1)

Exactly one of L and 2a+L–1 is odd, so (1) represents 2n as a product of one even
and one odd factor.

Implications of (1)

• If L is odd, then L divides n.  
 So n possesses an odd divisor > 1.

• If L is even, then the odd number 2a+L–1 divides 2n, hence divides n as well.  
 Again n has an odd divisor > 1.

Therefore:

Any integer that can be written as a sum of two or more consecutive integers
must have an odd divisor larger than 1; equivalently, it must NOT be a pure
power of 2.

Conversely, if n is not a power of 2, pick any odd divisor d > 1 of n.
Set L = d and solve (1) for a:

2a = (2n)/d – d + 1, which is even, so a is a non-negative integer.
Hence every non-power-of-2 does admit such a decomposition.

Conclusion:  
A positive integer fails to be representable as a sum of consecutive
integers (with at least two terms) iff it is a power of 2.

2^11 = 2048 (>2000)

Thus the only power of 2—and hence the only exception—in the interval
[1000, 2000] is 1024.

A direct check confirms that 1024 cannot satisfy (1):  
since 2·1024 = 2048 = 2^11 contains no odd factor, the product L(2a+L–1)
cannot equal 2048 with L, 2a+L–1 integers ≥2 and ≥1 respectively.

We were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system.

Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90. These 90 id's will not have a corresponding number when written in reverse order.
Secondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order. For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.
Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.

175,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote an equation on a rock:
NOSIER
+ASTRAL
________
725613
""Each letter in the equation represents a different digit, and no letter represents zero,"" said the troll. ""The letters in the password represent 725613.""
So, what is the password?","1. There are nine different letters in the troll's equation, so nine digits in total are used. Since no letter represent zero, the nine digits used are obvious - just not the letter each one represents.
2. This teaser requires some trial and error, but it can be minimized by looking at the two leftmost columns of the troll's equation.","The password is INLETS.
If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.
If N=5 and A=1, then E=9. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
If N=2 and A=4, then E=6. R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.
If N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.
If N=2, then since R cannot be 5, R=8, L=5, and I=7.
If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.
Since 1+S+T equals 5 or 15, S+T equals 4 or 14. If S+T=14, then S and T must be 5 and 9, or 6 and 8, in some order. But each of our three scenarios has a letter for at least one of 5 and 9, as well as one for 8. So S+T=4, S and T are 1 and 3 in some order, and O+S=12.
If S=1, then O=11. But since each letter represents only one digit, S=3, T=1, and O=9.
If N=5, then A=1. But since T=1, this cannot work.
If N=4, then I=9. But since O=9, this cannot work.
We are left with one possible scenario:
T=1, N=2, S=3, A=4, L=5, E=6, I=7, R=8, and O=9.

Of that list, 33 is the only number that contains a 3 as the second digit and so for criterion 3 to be satisfied, 3 can only appear at the start of the 5-digit numbers.  From there it is simply a matter of choosing the next digits using the list above so that criterion 2 is satisfied, making sure that criterion 3 is also satisfied.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the five–digit number be d₁d₂d₃d₄d₅.

1.  Each digit must be one of the prime digits  
   2, 3, 5, 7.

2.  For every i = 1 … 4 the two–digit number 10·dᵢ + dᵢ₊₁ is composite  
   ( “successive pairs are not prime’’ ).

   Listing the 16 possible two–digit numbers whose digits are taken from  
   {2, 3, 5, 7} gives

        22 23* 25 27
        32 33 35 37*
        52 53* 55 57
        72 73* 75 77
   The starred numbers 23, 37, 53, 73 are prime; all others are composite.

   Therefore the forbidden adjacent pairs are exactly  
   23, 37, 53, 73.

3.  Translate that into “what may follow what’’:

        after 2  →  2,5,7
        after 3  →  2,3,5
        after 5  →  2,5,7
        after 7  →  2,5,7
        (3 may follow only another 3 or stand first; 7 may not follow 3.)

4.  Where can the digit 3 appear?
       • If 3 is not the first digit it must be preceded by 3  
         (because 23, 53, 73 are all forbidden).  
       • But we have only five positions and must use 2,3,5,7 at least once,  
         so a pair “33’’ would occupy two places; that would leave only  
         three places for the other three distinct digits – impossible.  

   Hence d₁ = 3 is obligatory.  
   The second digit therefore can be only 2, 3, or 5 (but not 7).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Finding the largest number
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Take the largest possible choice at every step that still allows a complete
sequence.

• d₁ = 3.  
• The largest admissible d₂ is 5 (3 5 is allowed).  
• From 5 the largest next digit is 7 (5 7 allowed).  
• From 7 we may choose 7 again, giving the largest fourth digit (7 7 allowed).  
• We have not used the digit 2 yet, so the fifth digit must be 2.  
  The pair 7 2 is allowed.

That gives 3 5 7 7 2, i.e. 35772.

One checks that it contains each prime digit and every consecutive pair
35, 57, 77, 72 is composite, so 35772 is valid.
Any other admissible number begins with 35 but has a fourth digit < 7 or a
second digit < 5, hence is smaller.  
Therefore the largest possible number is

                       35772.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Finding the smallest number
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Choose the smallest admissible digit at each step.

• d₁ = 3.  
• The smallest possible d₂ is 2 (3 2 allowed).  
• From 2 the smallest possible follower is again 2.  
• Now digits 5 and 7 are still missing.  The next smallest admissible digit
  is 5; 2 5 is allowed.  
• Finally we must place the 7; 5 7 is allowed.

That yields 3 2 2 5 7, i.e. 32257.

The pairs 32, 22, 25, 57 are all composite, and the number contains each
prime digit exactly once except for an extra 2, so it satisfies every
condition.  Any other admissible number begins with the same 32 but has a
third digit > 2, hence is larger.

177,"Once an old man died, and in his Will he stated that all the pearls he kept in a little bag were to be distributed among his daughters. To make things fair, the distribution must be done in the following way:
The older girl should receive one pearl, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""
And so it was.
How many pearls were there in the bag?
How many daughters did the old man have?
How many pearls did each girl get?","If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","There were 36 pearls.
There were 6 daughters.
Each daughter got 6 pearls.
The girl number x will have x pearls and a seventh of the rest. Since the last girl leaves no pearls in the bag, then when she takes her pearls the rest in the bag is zero (a seventh of nothing is nothing).
Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).
That is, k+1 = 7 and then k = 6.
So, the number of pearls is 6*6 = 36, and there were 6 girls.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

P₀ = number of pearls originally in the bag,  
Pₖ = pearls left in the bag after the k-th girl has received hers,  
n   = number of daughters,  
S   = number of pearls each girl finally receives (the judge said all will obtain the same amount).

The rule for the k-th girl (k = 1,2,…,n) is  

“take k pearls, then 1/7 of what is left”.

Hence she receives  

k + (P_{k-1} – k)/7 = S .                                                             (1)

After she has taken her share the bag contains  

P_k = P_{k-1} – k – (P_{k-1} – k)/7  
     = (6/7)(P_{k-1} – k).                                                            (2)

Because the pearls are exactly exhausted, P_n = 0.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  What happens for the last girl?
-------------------------------------------------
For k = n we have P_n = 0, so from (2)

0 = (6/7)(P_{n-1} – n) ⇒ P_{n-1} = n.                                         (3)

Thus the last girl finds exactly n pearls in the bag; she therefore gets n pearls and S = n.  
Consequently every daughter must obtain n pearls.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Pearls just before any girl’s turn
-------------------------------------------------
Insert S = n in (1):

n = k + (P_{k-1} – k)/7 ⇒ P_{k-1} = 7n – 6k.                           (4)

So, for example,

before the last (k = n) girl: P_{n-1} = n                 (agrees with (3)),  
before the next-to-last (k = n–1): P_{n-2} = n + 6.

-------------------------------------------------
3.  A necessary consistency condition
-------------------------------------------------
Apply formula (2) once to go from P₀ to P₁ and compare with (4).

First, by (4) with k = 1: P₀ = 7n – 6.                                        (5)

Now use (2) with k = 1:

P₁ = (6/7)(P₀ – 1) = (6/7)(7n – 7) = 6(n – 1).                        (6)

But (4) with k = 2 also gives an expression for P₁:

P₁ = 7n – 12.                                                                           (7)

Equate (6) and (7):

6(n – 1) = 7n – 12  
6n – 6  = 7n – 12  
n        = 6.                                                                             (8)

So there must be exactly six daughters.

-------------------------------------------------
4.  The number of pearls
-------------------------------------------------
Put n = 6 into (5):

P₀ = 7·6 – 6 = 42 – 6 = 36.

If you created a circle with points A, B, and O on it, since angle AOB is a right angle, line AB is the diameter of this circle.  Therefore, arc AB would be 180 degrees if it actually were to intersect O as well as A and B.
However, the problem says the arc can only intersect A and B. To do this, the circle must be slightly larger than the one described above. As stated in the problem, the larger arc must be the next largest integer size, which is 181 degrees.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the two given perpendicular lines be denoted by AO and BO with O their point of intersection, so that  
∠AOB = 90°.

1.  What “intersect only at A and B’’ means  
   If a straight line meets a circle in exactly one point, that line is tangent to the circle at that point.  
   Hence AO is tangent to the circle at A and BO is tangent to the circle at B.

2.  Relating the centre of the circle to the tangents  
   Let C be the centre of the circle.  
   • The radius to a point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent.  
     Therefore CA ⟂ AO and CB ⟂ BO.  
   • Rotating any line through 90° does not change the angle it makes with another line, so  
     ∠ACB = ∠AOB = 90°.

3.  The central angle that subtends chord AB  
   The rays CA and CB are two radii of the circle; hence the measure of the minor arc AB is the measure of the central angle ∠ACB, namely 90°.

4.  The larger arc AB  
   A complete circle measures 360°.  Thus

        measure of major arc AB = 360° − 90° = 270°.

5.  Integral consideration  
   The problem asks for the “smallest integral size’’ of the larger arc.  Because the geometry forces the major arc to be exactly 270°, and 270 is already an integer, this is both the only and therefore the smallest possible integral value.

and let Q₂, Q₃, Q₄ be the points actually scored in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters respectively.

1. First quarter  
   Given: S₁ = 27.  

2. Second quarter  
   Q₂ = S₂ – S₁, and the statement says  
   Q₂ = ½ S₂ – 1.  
   Therefore  
   S₂ – 27 = ½ S₂ – 1  
   ⇒ S₂ – ½ S₂ = 26  
   ⇒ ½ S₂ = 26  
   ⇒ S₂ = 52.

3. Third quarter  
   Q₃ = S₃ – S₂, and the statement says

   Therefore  
   S₃ – 52 = ⅓ S₃ – 2  
   Multiply by 3: 3S₃ – 156 = S₃ – 6

4. Fourth quarter

All quarter conditions are satisfied:

• Q₂ = 52 – 27 = 25 = ½·52 – 1  
• Q₃ = 75 – 52 = 23 = ⅓·75 – 2

Kurt finally gave in, and agreed to go in with Rod on a minimum special order of the multi-colored treats.  When the box arrived, they divided the bounty as originally planned.
""Interesting,"" Kurt noted, ""that the number of Rnkfurers you got is the same integer as my percentage.""
Rod did a little mental math.  ""You're right,"" he noted, ""and I think that's the lowest pair of integers we could do that with.""
""Maybe; the next largest set is trivial.  50 Rnkfurers each, and then we'd each have the percentage the other guy got: 50% and 50 Rnkfurers each.""
Kurt unwrapped a Rnkfurer and took his first bite.  He glowed with pleasure for half a minute, and then spoke quietly.
""Rod, how many of these in a case?""
""Fifty.""
""I think we'd better order a few.  And this time, it's my turn to get more than you do.""
""Well, we can still arrange it so the number I get is your percentage of the total.""
Kurt did a little mental math this time.  ""Yeah, that's right.  I can't fit more than 100 in my desk at school, so this will do the trick.""
How many did each boy get each time?","Although there are a dozen pairs of numbers that satisfy the percentage condition, the three used in the story are the only ones in which each boy gets fewer than 100 Rnkfurers.","1st order: Rod 20, Kurt  5.  Kurt has 20% of the total.
2nd order: Rod 60, Kurt 90.  Kurt has 60% of the total.
The equation to satisfy is
R = 100*K / (R+K)
where R and K are both integers.
Another way to look at this is
K = R*R/(100-R)",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

 R  = the number of Rnkfurers Rod receives,  
 K  = the number of Rnkfurers Kurt receives,  
 T  = R + K = the total number they order.  

The key condition in the story is  

 Rod’s number  =  Kurt’s percentage of the total.  

That is  

 R = 100·K / T    (percentage written as an integer).

Cross–multiplying gives  

 100 K = R (K + R) = RK + R²  
 ⟹ 100K – RK = R²  
 ⟹ K(100 – R) = R².                (1)

Hence  

 K = R² / (100 – R).                (2)

Because K is an integer, 100 – R must divide R².  
Put d = 100 – R (so 1 ≤ d ≤ 99 and R = 100 – d).  
Then (1) says d | R² ⇔ d | (100 – d)².  But  

 (100 – d)² ≡ 100² = 10 000  (mod d),

so d | (100 – d)²  iff  d | 10 000.  
Thus d must be a divisor of 10 000 that is < 100.

10 000 = 2⁴·5⁴.  
Its positive divisors below 100 are  

 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 40, 50, 80. (12 of them, as stated in the hint)

For each such d we compute  

 R = 100 – d, K = R² / d.

Only three of these give both R and K below 100:

d = 80 ⇒ R = 20, K = 20²/80 = 5.  
d = 50 ⇒ R = 50, K = 50²/50 = 50.  
d = 40 ⇒ R = 60, K = 60²/40 = 90.

These match the three occasions mentioned in the story.

1.  First (the “minimum special order”):  
 Rod gets 20, Kurt gets 5  (total 25).

2.  The “next largest (trivial) set”:

3.  The case-sized order (50 per case, three cases = 150 total),

 Rod gets 60, Kurt gets 90.

All requirements of the story are satisfied, and no other pair under 100 for each boy is possible.

a₁ + a₂ + … + a_k = 20 and P = a₁ a₂ … a_k as large as possible.

Step 1 – No 1’s may appear.  
If some a_i = 1, merge it with a neighbour: … ·1·m… → …·(1+m)… .  
Because (1+m) > 1·m for every m ≥ 1, eliminating a 1 always increases the product.

Step 2 – No factor should be 5 or more.  
For any t ≥ 5, replace t by (t−3) and 3.  Their sum is unchanged, while the product multiplies by  

          3(t−3) / t = 3 − 9/t  > 1  (since t ≥ 5).  

Hence every factor is at most 4.

Step 3 – Prefer 3 to (2,2).  
The hint illustrates the crucial comparison: with the same sum 6,

        3·3 = 9   while   2·2·2 = 8.

Thus using a 3 gives a larger product than two 2’s.

Step 4 – The optimal partition therefore uses only 3’s and possibly one 2.  
Write 20 = 3q + r with 0 ≤ r < 3.  Here 20 = 3·6 + 2, so q = 6 and r = 2.

Step 5 – Form the product.  
With six 3’s and one 2 the sum is 6·3 + 2 = 20 and the product is  

        P_max = 3⁶ · 2 = 729 · 2 = 1458.

(If the remainder had been 1 we would have replaced one 3 with two 2’s, because 3·1 < 2·2.)

Since every other partition can be transformed, via the steps above, into one whose product is at least as great and finally into the partition 3,3,3,3,3,3,2, none can exceed this product.

 large  number = 5a (five digits)

Because the two numbers must jointly use every digit 1–9 exactly once and 5a is five–digits, a must be a four–digit number (otherwise the total number of digits would not be nine).  
Write  

 a = 1000A + 100B + 10C + U  (A,B,C,U are its individual digits).

Step 1 – the units­ digit  
5a must finish with the digit 5 (hint), so 5·U ≡ 5 (mod 10).  
With U∈{1,3,5,7,9} and the digit 5 already reserved for 5a, U ≠ 5.  
Hence U is 1, 3, 7 or 9.

Record the carry produced in this multiplication:

 U = 1 → carry 0  
 U = 3 → carry 1  
 U = 7 → carry 3  
 U = 9 → carry 4  

Step 2 – eliminate U = 1  
If U = 1, then the tens digit of 5a is 5·C (because the carry is 0).  
For every admissible C (2,3,4,6,7,8,9) this digit is 0 or 5, both impossible (0 is forbidden, 5 is already used).  
Therefore U ≠ 1.

So U = 3, 7 or 9.  We now examine U = 3.

Step 3 – choose the tens digit (U = 3, carry 1)  
With U = 3 the first carry is 1, so the tens digit of 5a is 5C+1 (mod 10).

8  |   41   | 1   (duplicate 1)
9  |   46   | 6   (duplicate 6)

Only C = 1 or 2 survives.  

•  C = 1 gives the tens digit 6, but then 5B (hundreds digit) must be 0, 5, or 0, which is impossible (no 0, 5 already used).  
  Hence C ≠ 1.

•  C = 2 gives tens digit 1, carry 1 to the hundreds place.

Step 4 – determine the hundreds digit (now carry = 1)  
Hundreds digit = (5B + 1) (mod 10).

B  |  5B+1  | digit

So B = 7 is possible (digit 6 appears only now; carry becomes 3).

Digits used so far: 5 (units of 5a), 3 (units of a), 2 (tens of a), 1 (tens of 5a), 6 (hundreds of 5a), 7 (hundreds of a).  
Used set = {1,2,3,5,6,7}.

Step 5 – thousands and ten-thousands digits  
Carry into the thousands column is 3.  
Thousands digit of 5a = (5A + 3) (mod 10)  
Ten-thousands digit = ⌊(5A + 3)/10⌋.

Available digits now are {4,8,9}.  Test each for A:

A = 4  → 5·4+3 = 23 → thousands digit 3  (3 already used)  
A = 8  → 5·8+3 = 43 → thousands digit 3  (duplicate)  
A = 9  → 5·9+3 = 48 → thousands digit 8, ten-thousands digit 4  ✓

Both 8 and 4 are still unused, so A = 9 works perfectly.

From (4): 4m = 100 − 3w ⇒ m = (100 − 3w)/4.

For m to be an integer, 100 − 3w must be divisible by 4.

189,"A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let

Let N be the number of men in the tournament.
Then the number of games played by men between themselves

(since there were 4 women in the tournament)
It is given that the total number of games that men played between themselves exceeded those played by men with women by 18.
Hence
N*(N-1)/2 - 4*N = 18
N*(N-1) - 8*N = 36
N*N - N - 8*N = 36
N^2 - 9*N - 36 = 0

   G_MM = C(m,2) = m(m-1)/2.

2.  Games played between men and women  
   Each of the m men plays each of the 4 women once, so  
   G_MW = 4m.

3.  Translate the given condition

2.  If n IS a multiple of 3, then n must lie in 50-59.  
3.  If n is NOT a multiple of 6, then n must lie in 70-79.

Step 1.  Show that n cannot be a multiple of 3.  
•  Suppose n is a multiple of 3.  
 Then condition 2 forces n to be in 50-59.  
 Every multiple of 3 in that interval is 51, 54, 57.  
 Each of these is not a multiple of 4, so condition 1 would then force the same number to lie in 60-69—impossible.  
Therefore n is NOT a multiple of 3.

Step 2.  Deduce n is not a multiple of 6 and locate its interval.  
•  Because multiples of 6 are multiples of 3, and n is not a multiple of 3, n is certainly not a multiple of 6.  
•  Condition 3 now applies, so n must be in 70-79.

Step 3.  Determine divisibility by 4.  
•  Assume n were not a multiple of 4.

Hence n must be a multiple of 4.

Step 4.  List numbers satisfying all current facts.  
In 70-79 the multiples of 4 are 72 and 76.

Step 5.  Eliminate any remaining violation.  
72 is a multiple of 3, contradicting Step 1.  
76 is not a multiple of 3, so it respects every condition.

Therefore the only possible value is 76.

a , b , c  (integers, in inches) be the three sides of the triangle that Mad Ade builds with  
P matches, so that  

a + b + c = P                (perimeter = number of matches)                (1)

and, by the statement of the problem,  

Area = P.                                                                                (2)

1.  Translating “area = perimeter’’ into an arithmetic condition  

Write s = P/2.  
Heron’s formula gives  

P  =  Area² = s(s–a)(s–b)(s–c).                                           (3)

Multiply (3) by 16 and use (1):

(P – 2a)(P – 2b)(P – 2c) = 16P.                                   (4)

Put  

x = P – 2a ,     y = P – 2b ,     z = P – 2c .                     (5)

Because a, b, c form a genuine triangle, x , y , z are positive integers, and from (1)

x + y + z = P.                                                                  (6)

With (4) we therefore have the simultaneous conditions

x + y + z = P,                            xyz = 16P.                       (7)

2.  Consequences of (7)

•  x, y, z must all have the same parity, for otherwise (5) would give a non-integral side length.  
•  Because 16P is even, the three numbers cannot all be odd, hence they are all even.  
Write x = 2r, y = 2s, z = 2t  (r, s, t positive integers).  
Then (7) becomes  

r + s + t = P/2,                            rst = 2P.                      (8)

So P is necessarily even, and P/2 = r + s + t ≤ 25 (since P ≤ 50).

3.  Determining all even P ≤ 50 satisfying (8)

List all factorizations of 2P whose three factors have sum P/2.

Mad Ade can perform his trick first with P = N matches, then with N–6 and again with N–12 matches.
Therefore N, N–6 and N–12 must each belong to the set (9).

Looking at the set {24, 30, 36, 42}, the only way to pick three numbers that differ successively by 6 is

36, 30, 24    or    42, 36, 30.

Hence

N = 36   or   N = 42.                                                      (10)

5.  Explicit triangles (for completeness)

•  24 matches   → 6-8-10 right triangle (area 24).  
•  30 matches   → 5-12-13 right triangle (area 30).  
•  36 matches   → 9-10-17 triangle (area 36).  
•  42 matches   → 7-15-20 triangle (area 42).

Both chains work:

•  36 → 30 → 24 matches   (9-10-17, 5-12-13, 6-8-10).  
•  42 → 36 → 30 matches   (7-15-20, 9-10-17, 5-12-13).

Thus there are exactly two possible original counts of matches, each not exceeding 50.

Final answer: 36 or 42 matches.",True,1,1

198,"Detective Grant was inspecting the scene of the crime. The 50-year-old victim, Joe, had been poisoned by a candy containing cyanide. On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table. John, 46, was found with 5 candies the day after a 4-yr sentence had been turned over a week ago. Jim, 35, had gotten off a 5-yr sentence a few days ago, only to be found dead with 6 candies yesterday.
Grant puzzled over these cases for days, and then -boom- it hit him. There was a pattern in these murders! What pattern did Grant spot?
Each suspect ate a candy before they died.
Life expectancy when the murders were committed was 70 years.
(It was also curious that many criminals had been let off their sentences too, but had not been killed. 23, in fact, had gotten off.)","SUSPECT--AGE--SENTENCE--CANDIES
Joe--------50----2 years-------9
Jeff--------30----10 yrs--------3
John-------46----4 yrs---------5
Jim--------35----5 yrs----------6","The killer was a prosecutor (George) who thought that the criminal deserved a chance to live outside of jail. When the case came before him, he dismissed it. He then went to the criminal's house, and offered him a chance to gamble his life, or go to jail. George offered him a certain number of candies, one of which was poisoned. If the criminal chose a poisoned candy, he died. If he chose a pure candy, he lived.
The criminal's remaining life expectancy divided by his prison sentence would be the number of candies George would bring him, one of which might kill him. In the case of Joe:
His remaining life expectancy at age 50 was 20. 20 divided by 2(his sentence) is 10. George brought him 10 candies, one of which was poisoned. Joe ate the poisoned one, and left nine on the table.
The 23 criminals who got off their sentences, but did not die, chose pure candies.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Grant realised that the murderer was using a simple numerical rule that combined  

• the victim’s present AGE,  
• the LENGTH of the sentence he had just avoided, and  
• the generally-known LIFE-EXPECTANCY of 70 years.  

Step 1 – “Years the man still had to live”  
70  –  AGE  

Step 2 – “How many equal parts can those years be cut into?”  
Divide the result of Step 1 by the LENGTH of the sentence.  
(70 – AGE) ÷ SENTENCE  

Step 3 – “Lay that many sweets on the table and poison one of them.”  
The quotient in Step 2 is the TOTAL number of candies placed;  
one is eaten (and is poisoned), the rest are left on the table.

Check the four cases

1. Joe : (70 – 50) ÷ 2 = 20 ÷ 2 = 10 candies → 1 eaten + 9 left  
2. Jeff : (70 – 30) ÷ 10 = 40 ÷ 10 = 4 candies → 1 eaten + 3 left  
3. John : (70 – 46) ÷ 4 = 24 ÷ 4 = 6 candies → 1 eaten + 5 left  
4. Jim : (70 – 35) ÷ 5 = 35 ÷ 5 = 7 candies → 1 eaten + 6 left  

The rule fits every murder exactly.

Why only these four men?

199,Lester has 40 kilograms of wheat. He has a simple balance and 4 weights of whole number denominations. The 4 weights are such that he is able to measure any whole number amount of wheat from 1 to 40 (no fractions). He can use a combination of two or more weights on any side of the balance as required. He can also use one weight on the left side and two or more weights on the right along with the wheat to weigh the required amount if necessary. What are the 4 weights Lester has?,"There is a common ratio between the weights; this way, it allows for coverage with addition and subtraction","The weights Lester uses are 1,3,9 and 27 kg.

For 2, 8, 11, 26, 29, 35 and 38 kg he needs to put the wheat plus the 1 kg weight on one side and enough weights to make 1 more kg than he is trying to weigh up on the other side.
For 6, 7, 24, 25, 33, and 34 kg he needs to put the wheat plus the 3 kg weight on one side and enough weights to make 3 more kg than he is trying to weigh up on the other side.

1 ≤ w₁ < w₂ < w₃ < w₄ , and let  
Sₖ = w₁ + … + wₖ be the largest mass that can be weighed with the first k weights.

Because the balance allows weights to be put on either pan, every weight may appear with the coefficient –1, 0 or +1.  
If with w₁,…,w_{k-1} we can already form every integer from 1 to S_{k-1}, then with the next weight w_k we can obtain

  –w_k – S_{k-1}, … , –w_k + S_{k-1}, … , w_k – S_{k-1}, … , w_k + S_{k-1}

i.e. a continuous block of 2S_{k-1}+1 consecutive integers centred at 0.  
Hence the new contiguous positive range is from 1 to S_{k-1}+w_k.  
Consequently the necessary and sufficient condition for keeping the range unbroken is

  w_k ≤ 2S_{k-1}+1.                                                     (★)

Start the construction.

1. The mass 1 kg must be weighable, so w₁ = 1 and S₁ = 1.

2. From (★) with k = 2 we need w₂ ≤ 2·1 + 1 = 3.  
   To stretch the final range as far as possible we take the largest admissible value:
   w₂ = 3, S₂ = 1 + 3 = 4.

3. With k = 3, (★) gives w₃ ≤ 2·4 + 1 = 9.  
   Again choose the maximum: w₃ = 9, S₃ = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.

4. Finally for k = 4, (★) requires w₄ ≤ 2·13 + 1 = 27.  
   Choose w₄ = 27, giving S₄ = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.

Since S₄ equals exactly the largest mass that must be measured, every integer from 1 kg to 40 kg is attainable; if any earlier weight had been chosen smaller, S₄ would fall below 40 and the requirement could not be met. Therefore the set {1, 3, 9, 27} is not only sufficient but the unique solution.

Explicitly, balanced-ternary representations show how each mass is weighed; for example  
2 kg = 3 – 1 (3 kg weight on one pan, 1 kg weight with the wheat),  
16 kg = 27 – 9 + (-3) + 1, etc.

Hence the four required weights are 1 kg, 3 kg, 9 kg and 27 kg, whose common ratio is 3 as hinted.

(2) w + 4f           = 2.48  
(3) w + f + 3a = 2.99  

There are four unknowns but only three independent equations, so the individual prices cannot be fixed uniquely (the hint).

Nevertheless, the required cost is

S = w + b + f + a.

Step 1 Eliminate w.

From (1): w = 1.98 – 2b

201,"Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Snow, there lived the fair Princess Miyuki, who had always been fascinated by fairy tales and the stories of the wonders of the world. She believed that her sleeping, handsome prince was cursed to be one of the mummies in the pyramids of Egypt, and when she was done being Fantaghiro-saving-her-Romualdo, her prince would then build a beautiful palace as a monument of their love (which of course would be more beautiful than Taj Mahal) where both of them will live happily ever after...
So, you see, that's why Princess Miyuki had refused each and every love declaration or marriage proposal that came her way.
But of course, what's a story without the brave and wise heroic prince? Here comes Prince Hajikidama of the Marbles Kingdom.

For a dog staked at the midpoint of the hypotenuse the rope must reach every corner, so the required rope length is half the hypotenuse:

 113/2 = 56½ ft, 74/2 = 37 ft, 58/2 = 29 ft.

The three legitimate answers are therefore 29 ft, 37 ft and 56½ ft.  
One of them (29 ft) is 8 ft shorter than another (37 ft), while the third is “a lot longer,” exactly matching what the two students said.

206,"Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

 x = number of $0.20 price‐reductions made from the present price.  

Price after the reduction  
 P(x) = 5.95 − 0.20x  (dollars per box)

Sales after the reduction  
 Q(x) = 100 + 25x  (boxes per week)

Step 1 – Find the production cost per box (this stays fixed).  
At the present price the profit per box is $1.75, so

 cost = 5.95 − 1.75 = 4.20  dollars per box.

Step 2 – Express weekly profit as a function of x.  
Profit per box after the change is

 P(x) − cost = (5.95 − 0.20x) − 4.20 = 1.75 − 0.20x.

Hence total weekly profit

 π(x) = (1.75 − 0.20x)(100 + 25x).

Step 3 – Simplify the profit function.

 π(x) = 1.75(100 + 25x) − 0.20x(100 + 25x)  
    = 175 + 43.75x − 20x − 5x²  
    = −5x² + 23.75x + 175.

This is a downward-opening parabola, so its maximum occurs at the vertex

 x* = −b/(2a) = −(23.75)/(2·(−5)) = 23.75/10 = 2.375.

Step 4 – Compute the corresponding price.

 P* = 5.95 − 0.20(2.375) = 5.95 − 0.475 = 5.475.

Thus the profit is maximized at a price of $5.475 per box, i.e. about $5.48 when expressed to the nearest cent.

(If the owners insist on changing price only in $0.20 increments, the two integer possibilities nearest x = 2.375 are x = 2 and x = 3, giving prices of $5.55 and $5.35 with weekly profits of $202.50 and $201.25 respectively; the higher of these is at $5.55.  For unrestricted pricing, the exact optimum is $5.48.)

207,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote an equation on a rock:
SLIDE
-DEAN
______
3651
""Each letter in the equation represents a different digit,"" said the troll. ""The letters in the password represent 3651.""
So, what is the password?",There is some casework to be done on D; obviously we have that S = 1,"The password is LENS.
Since SL-D=3 or (SL-1)-D=3 (meaning SL-D=4), and since the highest possible sum of two different one-digit numbers is 17, S must equal 1.
Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.
Suppose D=7. Then L is 0 or 1, and since S=1, L=0. A must be 1 or 2, but since S=1, A=2.
Suppose D=8. Then L is 1 or 2, and since S=1, L=2. A must be 2 or 3, but since L=2, A=3.
Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.
Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.
If D=7, then L=0. But since 10-7=3, D cannot be 7.
If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.
If E=4, then N=3. But if D=8, A=3, and if D=9, L=3 and A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=5, then since 1I-E=6, I=1. But since S=1, this cannot work.
If E=7, then I=3. But if D=8, then A=3, and if D=9, then L=3. So this cannot work.
If E=8, then I=4, and D cannot be 8. But if D=9, then A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=9, then N=8, and D cannot be 8 or 9. So this cannot work.
Therefore, E=6, N=5, and I=2. If D=8, then L=2, so D must equal 9. This means:
S=1, I=2, L=3, A=4, N=5, E=6, and D=9.

1.  The leading digit  
        S − (possible borrow) = 0  
    because the result has only four digits.  
    Hence there must be a borrow from the thousands column and therefore  

        S = 1.                                                      (1)

2.  Units column  

        E − N = 1  (no borrow can come from the right)              (2)

    gives a unique conclusion:

        b₁ (borrow into tens) = 0 and   E = N + 1.                  (3)

3.  Tens column  

        D − A − b₁ = 5  (mod 10).  With b₁ = 0 we have

        D − A = 5  or  D − A = −5.                                  (4)

    If D − A = −5 we would have a borrow b₂ = 1; that possibility will
    be shown impossible later.  Keep

        D − A = 5   and    b₂ = 0.                                  (5)

4.  Hundreds column  

        I − E − b₂ = 6  (mod 10).

    Two cases:

    • If the expression is non–negative, b₃ = 0 and  
          I − E = 6.                                               (6a)

      Then I = E + 6 ≤ 9 ⇒ E ≤ 3.  Trying E = 1,2,3 violates the
      “all digits different’’ condition, so no solution arises.

    • If the expression is negative, b₃ = 1 and  
          I − E = −4   ⇒   I = E − 4,   E ≥ 4.                     (6b)

      This is the viable case; retain b₃ = 1.

5.  Thousands column  
   Because we already have a borrow b₃ = 1, the column reads

        L − D − 1  (value)  = 3  after adding 10.  

   Hence

        L − D − 1 = −7   ⇒   L = D − 6.                            (7)

   A borrow does occur, so b₄ = 1, consistent with (1).

        L = D − 6.                               (7)

   Search the digits 0–9 keeping them distinct.

        • Choose D − A = 5 → possible pairs (D,A) are
          (5,0), (6,1), (7,2), (8,3), (9,4).

        • Only (8,3) and (9,4) avoid the already–used digit S = 1.

   ── Pair (D,A) = (8,3):
        L = 2.  Then E ≥ 4, but A = 3 already uses 3, and all
        further checks fail—no solution here.

   ── Pair (D,A) = (9,4):
        L = 3.  Now pick N so that E = N + 1 and I = E − 4:

        Hence N = 5, E = 6, I = 2.

   The complete assignment is

        S = 1,  L = 3,  I = 2,  D = 9,  E = 6,  A = 4,  N = 5.

   Check:  13 296 − 9 645 = 3 651 — correct.

7.  The digits 3-6-5-1 in the result correspond to the letters

212,"Due to cutbacks at the local high school, physical education and mathematics were combined into one class.  This made for some interesting ""exercises"".  One of the questions on this term's final exam stated:
From a starting position walk to the right a distance (in feet) represented by the first prime number. Then turn right 90 degrees and walk a distance represented by the 2nd prime number, and so on, until all prime numbers less than 100 have been accounted for.  Then answer the following questions.
a) How far have you walked?
b) How far (to the nearest inch) do you have to walk to return to your starting position?","Do it on paper, unless you need the exercise!","a) You have walked 1060 feet.
b) You have to walk 73 feet, 9 inches
Explanation
There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100, neither of which is prime.  (No, 1 is not prime.)  So you will walk in an expanding square with sides of length 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 feet.  This is a total of 1060 feet.
The net result of your turns will be that you are 56 feet ahead of your starting position.
(2+11+23+41+59+73+97)
- (5+17+31+47+67+83)
You will also be 48 feet to the left of your starting position.
(7+19+37+53+71+89)
- (3+13+29+43+61+79)
To calculate the distance back to the starting position, calculate the length of the hypotenuse of the right angle triangle with legs that are 56 and 48 feet long.  This is 73.756 feet, or 73 feet, 9 inches.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Prime numbers less than 100 (there are 25 of them) :

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97

1.  Total distance actually walked  
   Sum of the above primes  
   = 2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23+29+31+37+41+43+47+53+59+61+67+71+73+79+83+89+97  
   = 1060 ft.

2.  Net displacement from the starting point  
   Label successive directions as we keep turning right 90°:

   East : 2, 11, 23, 41, 59, 73, 97  (sum = 306)  
   West : 5, 17, 31, 47, 67, 83   (sum = 250)  
   North: 7, 19, 37, 53, 71, 89   (sum = 276)  
   South: 3, 13, 29, 43, 61, 79   (sum = 228)

   Net x–displacement  = 306 − 250 = 56 ft (east)  
   Net y–displacement  = 276 − 228 = 48 ft (north)

   Hence the finishing point is (56, 48) relative to the start.

   Distance back to the start  
   = √(56² + 48²) = √(3136 + 2304) = √5440 ≈ 73.756 ft.

   Converting to inches: 73.756 ft × 12 in/ft ≈ 885 in.  
   To the nearest inch that is 885 in, i.e. 73 ft 9 in.

Final answer:  
a) 1060 feet walked altogether.  
b) You must walk about 73 ft 9 in (885 in) to return to the starting position.",True,1,0

214,"Alec, Brett and Chris each purchased parts for their skateboards at the sports store. Alec and Brett wanted to build new skateboards, so they each needed to purchase a deck, trucks, bearings and wheels. Chris only needed new wheels. The store offers a 10% discount for purchases over $250, so the boys decided to pay for all the parts together to qualify for the discount. Altogether, the boys spent $266.40. The clues below reflect the price of the items before the discount is applied.
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
They each bought the same kinds of wheels. Together they spent $75 for the 3 sets of wheels. Each set contained 4 wheels.
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his. However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Brett spent $3 more on bearings than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
How much did each person spend?","Find the total price, then focus on each item separately","Alec spent $113.40.
Brett spent $130.50.
Chris spent $22.50.
Component Alec Brett Chris Total
Deck $50 $45 $0 $95
Trucks 35 40 $0 75
Wheels 25 25 25 75
Bearings 16 35 $0 51
Total before discount $126 $145 $25 $296
less 10% discount $12.60 $14.50 $2.50 $29.60
Amount spent $113.40 $130.50 $22.50 $266.40
Explanation:
First find the original price of all the items combined. $266.40 is the price after the 10% discount was applied.
That means $266.40 is equal to 90% of the original price.
Write an equation and then cross multiply:
266.40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x   =   9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)
Let x = the amount Alec spent on trucks.
x + (x+5) = 75
2x + 5 = 75
2x = 70
x = 35
Alec spent $35 on trucks. Brett spent $5 more than Alec. Therefore, Brett spent $40 on trucks.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51
x + (2x + 3) = 51
3x + 3 = 51
3x = 48
x = 16
Alec's spent $16 on bearings.

1.  The boys paid $266.40 after receiving a 10 % discount.

    Brett: 45 + Tᵦ + 35 + 25 = Tᵦ + 105  
    Chris: 25

    Putting these into the grand total (1):

    (Tₐ + 91) + (Tᵦ + 105) + 25 = 296

    Brett: 45 + 40 + 35 + 25 = $145  
    Chris: $25

   Check: 126 + 145 + 25 = 296 ✔

10.  The discount multiplies every amount by 0.90, so each boy’s actual

     Brett: 0.90 × 145 = $130.50  
     Chris: 0.90 × 25  = $22.50  

These three sums add to $266.40, matching the amount paid.

Next graph these three lines. It should be expected that the answer will lie on the intersection of two of these lines or to make all chairs or all tables.

Because 0≤y<1, the right side must be <143, so k can be 0,1,…,11.

The earliest confusion will correspond to the smallest positive y, hence take k = 0 in (9):

Step 1 – Determine the amount of work represented by one finished picture.  
In the statement “5/2 artists need 5/2 hours to finish 5/2 (model-canvas) pictures,” the total labor used is

(5/2 artists) × (5/2 hours) = 25/4 artist-hours = 6.25 artist-hours.

This amount of labor produces 5/2 = 2.5 completed pictures.  
Hence the labor needed for one picture is

(25/4 artist-hours) ÷ (5/2 pictures)

A × 20 hours = 60 artist-hours,  
so A = 60 / 20 = 3.

Therefore, three artists can paint 24 models on 24 canvases in 20 hours.

222,"Homer had always contemplated the size of the old oak tree in the field behind his house.  Standing 5 feet away from the 8 foot high fence in the back of the yard, he could just barely see the top leaves of the tree over the top of the fence.  He knew that the tree was 200 feet from the fence.  Homer was 6 feet tall, making his line of vision, 67 inches from the ground.
Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.","TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches
Tree height from eye level = TAN (25.80 deg) * 2460 inches = 1189 inches
Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.  With the measurement capabilities available to any lumberjack (or any average Homer) precise measurements are not possible.  Thus the need to clarify these calculations as estimates.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

• E be Homer’s eye, 67 in = 5 ft 7 in above the ground.  
• F be the top of the fence, 8 ft = 96 in high.  
• T be the top of the tree.  

1.  Angle of elevation from E to F  
   Horizontal distance EF (horizontal) = 5 ft = 60 in  
   Vertical rise EF (vertical) = 96 in – 67 in = 29 in  

   tan θ = opposite / adjacent = 29 in / 60 in = 0.48333  
   ⇒ θ ≈ arctan(0.48333) ≈ 25.8°.

2.  Horizontal distance from Homer’s eye to the tree  
   Homer is 5 ft in front of the fence and the tree is 200 ft behind it, so
   ET (horizontal) = 5 ft + 200 ft = 205 ft.

3.  Vertical rise from Homer’s eye to the top of the tree  
   ET (vertical) = (tan θ)(ET (horizontal))  
                 ≈ 0.48333 × 205 ft  
                 ≈ 99.08 ft.

4.  Height of the tree above the ground  
   Tree height = eye height + ET (vertical)  
               = 5 ft 7 in + 99.08 ft

Telephone pattern  
• When somebody is first told the news he must make two calls, one in each of the next two 30-second slots.  
• Thus a person who is calling for the first time this slot will call again next slot; a person who is calling for the second time this slot is finished with the phone.  

Define fₙ = number of people who are making a call during slot n.  
– Slot 0 (0-30 s): only Dave is on the phone  ⇒ f₀ = 1.  
– Slot 1 (30-60 s): Dave (second call) + the resident he just reached (first call)  ⇒ f₁ = 2.  

General step.  
In slot n (n≥1)  
• fₙ callers are on the phone.  
• Of these, exactly fₙ₋₁ are making their second (and last) call.  
• The remaining fₙ – fₙ₋₁ = fₙ₋₂ callers are making their first call; they will call again next slot.

1. A 6-digit integer exists whose first six multiples (×2 through ×6) contain no digits other than those in the original number.  
2. That integer is unique.

The most familiar repeating block of six digits occurs in the decimal expansion of 1/7:

  1/7 = 0.142 857 142 857 …

That block 142 857 is called a cyclic number because multiplying it by any integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 6) produces a cyclic permutation of the same six digits.  Multiplying shows this explicitly:

  142 857 × 2 = 285 714

Each product is a rearrangement of the original six digits 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7; no new digit appears.  Thus 142 857 satisfies the problem’s requirement.

Step 2 – Uniqueness among 6-digit integers  
Any 6-digit integer whose first six multiples are all permutations of its own digits must be a “cyclic number” in base 10.  A classical theorem (proved by Midy in 1836 and rediscovered many times) shows that the only cyclic number with six digits is precisely the repetend of 1/7, namely 142 857.

   300F + 30L + 3Y − Y = 1010A + 100W
   ⇒ 300F + 30L + 2Y   = 1010A + 100W.               (2)

3. Work modulo 10.  
   The right–hand side of (2) is a multiple of 10, so

       2Y ≡ 0 (mod 10)  ⇒  Y = 5.                   (3)

4. Substitute Y = 5 and divide by 10:

   300F + 30L + 10 = 1010A + 100W
   ⇒ 30F + 3L + 1  = 101A + 10W.                    (4)

5. Consider the only possible values of A.  
   The left side of (2) is < 3000, so 1010A < 3000 ⇒ A ≤ 2.

   • A = 1:  
     30F + 3L + 1 = 101 + 10W  
     ⇒ 30F + 3L = 100 + 10W  
     ⇒ 3(10F + L) is a multiple of 10.  
     Since gcd(3,10)=1, 10F + L must end in 0, forcing L = 0, contradicting “non-zero.”  
     Therefore A ≠ 1.

   • A = 2:  
     30F + 3L + 1 = 202 + 10W  
     ⇒ 30F + 3L = 201 + 10W  
     ⇒ 3(10F + L) = 201 + 10W                        (5)

     Divide (5) by 3:

         10F + L = 67 + (10W)/3.                    (6)

     For (10W)/3 to be an integer, W must be divisible by 3; with W ∈ {1,…,9} this gives W ∈ {3,6,9}.

     • W = 3: (10W)/3 = 10  ⇒ 10F + L = 77  ⇒ F = 7, L = 7 (digits repeat) – impossible.
     • W = 6: (10W)/3 = 20  ⇒ 10F + L = 87  ⇒ F = 8, L = 7 – all digits distinct, valid.
     • W = 9: (10W)/3 = 30  ⇒ 10F + L = 97  ⇒ F = 9, L = 7, but F = W = 9 – repeats.

     The only admissible solution is
           A = 2,  W = 6,  F = 8,  L = 7,  Y = 5.

231,What is the smallest integer greater than 0 that can be written entirely with zeros and ones and is evenly divisible by 225?,,"The prime factorization of 225 is 5*5*3*3. So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.
All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Because 225 = 9·25 = 3²·5², the desired number N must satisfy simultaneously  

(1) N ≡ 0 (mod 25)  
(2) N ≡ 0 (mod 9)

1. Condition mod 25  
A decimal number is divisible by 25 iff its last two digits are 00, 25, 50, or 75.  
Since the only permitted digits are 0 and 1, the only possible ending is 00.  
Hence N must end in the two‐digit block “00”.

2. Condition mod 9  
A decimal number is divisible by 9 iff the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  
Because N’s last two digits are 0, they contribute nothing to the digit-sum.  
All preceding digits are 0 or 1, so that digit-sum is simply “the number of 1’s” among those preceding digits.

3. Counting the 1’s  
Let the total length of N be n digits; the last two are the forced 00, leaving n − 2 preceding digits.  
The first of those n − 2 digits cannot be 0 (otherwise N would have leading zeros), so it is 1.  
Thus the number of 1’s is at least 1.  
For that count to be a non-zero multiple of 9, it must be 9, 18, 27, …  

Therefore n − 2 ≥ 9, i.e. n ≥ 11.  
With the minimum length n = 11 we must have exactly 9 ones among the first 9 positions, which forces every one of those 9 digits to be 1:

N = 111 111 111 00.

4. Minimality  
• Any number with fewer than 11 digits has at most 8 digits before the trailing 00; its digit-sum cannot reach 9, so it fails divisibility by 9.  
• Among 11-digit numbers ending in 00 and containing exactly nine 1’s, 111 111 111 00 is the smallest because any change that replaces a leading 1 by 0 would reduce the count of 1’s below 9, while any arrangement with zeros inserted later would make a larger numerical value.

5. Verification  
Digit-sum = 9 ⇒ divisible by 9.  
Ending in 00 ⇒ divisible by 25.  
Since gcd(9,25)=1, N is divisible by 225.

Thus the smallest positive integer composed solely of 0’s and 1’s and divisible by 225 is

11111111100.

• digits that are neither: 6, 8  

Exactly two digits must be prime, two square, and one neither.  
The hint states that d₃ and d₄ are not prime.

Step 1.  Determine possible values for d₁, d₅, d₃.  
From (3): d₅ = d₁ – 3 ⇒ 1 ≤ d₅ ≤ 9 ⇒ 4 ≤ d₁ ≤ 9.  
Insert this into (1): d₃ = 2·d₅ = 2(d₁ – 3) = 2d₁ – 6, which must also be a digit 1–9.

Thus the admissible pairs are  
A) d₁=4, d₅=1, d₃=2   B) d₁=5, d₅=2, d₃=4   C) d₁=7, d₅=4, d₃=8.

Pair A is impossible because d₃=2 is prime, contradicting the hint.  
Pair B is impossible because both d₁ and d₅ are prime (5,2); any choice for d₂ from {1,2,3} (see below) would give at least three primes, violating the “exactly two primes” requirement.  
Hence only pair C survives:

d₁ = 7  d₅ = 4  d₃ = 8

Step 2.  Determine d₂ and d₄.  
Equation (2) gives d₄ = d₂ + 6.  Because both must be digits 1–9 and distinct from 7, 8, 4, the possibilities are:

d₂ = 1 ⇒ d₄ = 7  (d₄ prime → forbidden)  
d₂ = 2 ⇒ d₄ = 8  (d₄ duplicates d₃ → forbidden)  
d₂ = 3 ⇒ d₄ = 9  (allowed, d₄ = 9 not prime)

be the three-digit numbers whose nine (different) digits are exactly the nine digits 1,…,9.

1.  n is a multiple of 3, but not of 9  
The nine digits add up to 45, hence  

(Sum of digits of n)+(Sum of digits of 2n)+(Sum of digits of 3n)=45≡0 (mod 9)  
But the sum of digits of a number is congruent to the number itself modulo 9, so  

n+2n+3n=6n≡0 (mod 9) ⟹ n≡0 (mod 3).

If n were ≡0 (mod 9), then all three numbers would be divisible by 9, so each of the three digit–sums would be 9, 18 or 27.  
But the largest possible digit–sum of a three-digit number whose digits are all different and non–zero is 9+8+7=24; three such sums cannot add to 45.  
Hence n is a multiple of 3 but not of 9, i.e. n≡3 or 6 (mod 9).

2.  How the total digit–sum 45 is split

n  ≡ 3 (or 6) (mod 9)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  When will both clocks show the correct time?

For a clock to be “right” its own error must be a multiple of 720 min.

Clock A:  error = t min  ⇒ t ≡ 0 (mod 720)  ⇒ t = 720 h, 1440 h, …

Clock B:  error = 2t min ⇒ 2t ≡ 0 (mod 720) ⇒ t ≡ 0 (mod 360) ⇒ t = 360 h, 720 h, …

The smallest positive t common to the two sets is t = 720 hours.

720 hours = 30 days.  
Hence both clocks are simultaneously correct again at

 12 :00 a.m. on Tuesday, 30 January (thirty days after they were set).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The two clocks next show the same time 10 days later, at midnight on Wednesday, 10 January.  
2. They are both correct again 30 days later, at midnight on Tuesday, 30 January.",True,1,0

a < b < c < d < e .

Because the farmer weighed every 2-bale combination, the ten recorded totals,
arranged in increasing order, must be  

80 , 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86 , 87 , 88 , 90 , 91 .

1.  The smallest total is a + b, so  
       a + b = 80.                                                (1)

2.  The largest total is d + e, so  
       d + e = 91.                                                (2)

3.  The second–smallest total is necessarily a + c (it is the
smallest sum that still involves c), so  
       a + c = 82.                                                (3)

   Subtract (1) from (3):     (a + c) − (a + b) = 82 − 80  
                               c − b = 2,    so     c = b + 2.    (4)

4.  The next recorded sum is 83.  
    It cannot be b + c because, by (4),

        b + c = b + (b + 2) = 2b + 2 ,  

    which is even, whereas 83 is odd.  
    Hence 83 must be a + d:

       a + d = 83.                                               (5)

   From (1) and (5):      (a + d) − (a + b) = 83 − 80  
                           d − b = 3,    so     d = b + 3.        (6)

5.  Use (2) and (6) to find e:

       d + e = 91  ⇒  (b + 3) + e = 91  ⇒  e = 88 − b.           (7)

6.  Collect what we have in terms of b:

       a = 80 − b,  
       b = b,  
       c = b + 2,  
       d = b + 3,  
       e = 88 − b.

   Because the weights must follow a < b < c < d < e,

       80 − b < b            ⇒  b > 40,                         (8)
       b < b + 2             ⇒  always true,
       b + 2 < b + 3         ⇒  always true,
       b + 3 < 88 − b        ⇒  2b < 85  ⇒  b < 42.5.           (9)

   Combining (8) and (9) with the fact that the weights are integral,
   we obtain the only possible values

       b = 41,     whence
       a = 39,     c = 43,     d = 44,     e = 47.

7.  Verify that every pair–sum appears exactly once in the list:

       a + b = 39 + 41 = 80
       a + c = 39 + 43 = 82
       a + d = 39 + 44 = 83
       a + e = 39 + 47 = 86
       b + c = 41 + 43 = 84
       b + d = 41 + 44 = 85
       b + e = 41 + 47 = 88
       c + d = 43 + 44 = 87
       c + e = 43 + 47 = 90
       d + e = 44 + 47 = 91

   All ten required totals—80, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, 91—are
   present, each exactly once, so the solution is consistent.

Hence the individual bale weights and the combinations that produced each total are:

39 kg + 41 kg = 80  
39 kg + 43 kg = 82  
39 kg + 44 kg = 83  
41 kg + 43 kg = 84  
41 kg + 44 kg = 85  
39 kg + 47 kg = 86  
43 kg + 44 kg = 87  
41 kg + 47 kg = 88  
43 kg + 47 kg = 90  
44 kg + 47 kg = 91

240,"In the legendary land of Madadia, everything is wonderful. There is no inflation, so Madadian wonks (local currency 100 winks = 1 wonk) are constant in value.
Mad Ade's cousin Manic Martin works as an accountant in one of Madadia's leading accounting firms.
After his first year his salary was a straight 10,000 wonks, with which Manic Martin was quite happy. His manager was so impressed with his work he offered Manic Martin a wage rise.
Now this being Madadia, things are not always done as they are elsewhere, the wage rise was offered over a 17.5 year contract period, These contracts are immutably binding, and will still be paid to benefactors in the event of death or permanent disability.
Manic Martin has a choice of how to receive his raise.  The first option was for an immediate 5% raise to 10,500 wonks annually, with an additional 5% raise every 6 months. The second option was for an immediate 10% raise to 11,000 wonks annually, with an additional 10% raise every year. Manic Martin's salary, based upon his current annual, was paid bi-weekly.
Which deal would benefit Manic Martin the most?",Think about the difference between the first and second half of every year,"The 5% semi-annual raise yields a higher return.
This may have been your first guess, but there is something odd about the answer. At the start of the problem, the 10% raise is earning more-  11,000 annually vs. 10,500. After the first year, the 5% option has earned 10,762 compared to 11,000.
What are the two options earning at the moment the contract closes, after 17.5 years? Surprisingly, the 5% option only realizes a little more than 55,160, compared to the 10% option which is still ahead with just under 56,000.
So where's the advantage in the 5% option? It hides in the second half of every year. Even in the first year, the 5% option makes more in the second six months than the 10% option. For the first few years, this is not enough to offset the difference. But cumulatively, over seventeen and a half years, 5% realizes a grand total of 390.27 more than the 10% option.

OPTION 1  ( +5 % every six months )

Because the raise is granted exactly every half-year, it is convenient to work in half-year

For the n-th half-year (n = 0,1,2,…)

 annual rate = 10 500 ·(1.05)ⁿ  
 amount actually paid during that half-year = ½·10 500·(1.05)ⁿ .

OPTION 2  ( +10 % every year )

Here the rate stays unchanged for an entire year, then rises 10 % at the next anniversary.

For the k-th full year (k = 0,1,…,16)

 annual rate = 11 000 ·(1.10)ᵏ  
 amount paid that year = 11 000 ·(1.10)ᵏ .

After those 17 full years there is one further half-year (the first half of “year 18”) whose
annual rate is 11 000 ·(1.10)¹⁷, so only half of that is paid.

Hence  

T₂ = 11 000·Σ_{k=0}^{16} (1.10)ᵏ + ½·11 000·(1.10)¹⁷
   = 11 000·(1.10¹⁷ – 1)/0.10 + 5 500·(1.10)¹⁷.                (2)

T₁ – T₂ ≈ 474 181.6 – 473 791.3 ≈ 390 wonks.

Thus the contract with the 5 % raise every six months yields the larger total

2. Subsequent motions  
   After the first impact the ball rises to height h₁ = r h₀ = (⅔)·9 = 6 ft, then falls the same 6 ft back to the floor.  
   Each later bounce behaves similarly: if hₙ = rⁿ h₀ is the height of the nth rise (n ≥ 1), the ball travels 2 hₙ (up and down).

2.  Condition on the first two vs. the last three workers  

“The first two workers shall get seven times less measures of corn than the three others,”  
i.e. the sum of the first two shares equals one-seventh of the sum of the last three:

a₁ + a₂ = (a₃ + a₄ + a₅)/7.                      (3)

Using (1),

Left side : a₁ + a₂ = a₁ + (a₁ + d) = 2a₁ + d.

Hence (3) gives  

2a₁ + d = (3a₁ + 9d)/7

3.  Determine d and a₁  

Insert (4) into (2):

(2d/11) + 2d = 20

⇒ d = 20·11/24 = 55/6.

Then from (4)

a₁ = 2d/11 = 2·(55/6)/11 = 5/3.

a₂ = a₁ + d = 5/3 + 55/6 = 65/6   = 10 ⅚  
a₃ = a₁ + 2d = 5/3 + 110/6 = 20

He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.

4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have

(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =

45 people
Thus, I disappointed Tweeto by giving him the answer as 45 people.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

x₁ , x₂ , x₃ , x₄ , x₅ , x₆ = numbers of passengers who get ​down​ at  
Maver , Willow , Wonderland , Doku , Lemp and Rudolf respectively.  

yᵢ = passengers who get ​in​ at station i.

Step 1 – translate the verbal conditions

•  At every station yᵢ = 2xᵢ.                                 (twice as many get in as get down)

•  The xᵢ ‘s are primes taken from the six disjoint intervals  
  
  0–10 :  2 , 3 , 5 , 7  
  10–20 : 11 , 13 , 17 , 19  
  20–30 : 23 , 29  
  30–40 : 31 , 37  
  40–50 : 41 , 43 , 47  
  50–60 : 53 , 59

•  |yᵢ₊₁ − yᵢ| ≥ 20  for consecutive stations.  
  Since yᵢ = 2xᵢ this is equivalent to |xᵢ₊₁ − xᵢ| ≥ 10.     (†)

•  x₁ + x₂ + x₃ + x₄ + x₅ + x₆ is even.

•  The train gains xᵢ passengers at station i (because  
  net change = 2xᵢ − xᵢ = xᵢ).  
  Therefore, letting N₀ be the load ​before​ Maver and N₆ the load ​after​ Rudolf,

  N₆ = N₀ + (x₁ + x₂ + x₃ + x₄ + x₅ + x₆). (1)

We are given N₆ = 227 and must find N₀.

Step 2 – choose the only possible sextuple (x₁,…,x₆)

Start with the two intervals that contain only two primes, because condition (†) is tightest there.

•  Wonderland (20–30).  
 If x₃ = 29 then the next interval (30–40) offers 31 or 37.  
 29 →31 gives difference 2 (<10) and 29 →37 gives 8 (<10).  
 Hence x₃ ≠29, so x₃ = 23.

•  Doku (30–40).  With x₃ fixed at 23, we need x₄ − 23 ≥10.  
 31 fails (difference 8); 37 works (difference 14).  
 Therefore x₄ = 37.

•  Lemp (40–50).  Now x₅ − 37 ≥10.  41 and 43 fail; 47 works.  
 Hence x₅ = 47.

•  Rudolf (50–60).  Need x₆ − 47 ≥10.  53 fails; 59 works.  
 Thus x₆ = 59.

We now move backwards.

•  Willow (10–20).  With x₃ = 23 we need 23 − x₂ ≥10 ⇒ x₂ ≤13.  
 Primes ≤13 in that interval are 11 and 13.  
 11 is impossible because 23 − 11 =12 (OK) but it must also satisfy (†) with x₁.  
 Check Maver next.

•  Maver (0–10).  Suppose x₂ = 11; then x₂ − x₁ ≥10 ⇒ x₁ ≤1 (impossible).  
 Hence x₂ ≠11, so x₂ = 13.

•  Finally for Maver we need 13 − x₁ ≥10.  
 Among 2,3,5,7 only 3 satisfies the inequality (13−3=10).  
 But if x₁ =2 the total of the six primes would be odd (five odds + 2);  
 condition (4) requires an even sum, so x₁ cannot be 2 anyway.  
 Hence x₁ = 3.

Thus the unique sextuple satisfying every condition is

x₁ = 3 , x₂ = 13 , x₃ = 23 , x₄ = 37 , x₅ = 47 , x₆ = 59.

Step 3 – compute the initial load

Total passengers who alight:  
S = 3+13+23+37+47+59 = 182  (even, as required).

From (1):  N₀ = N₆ − S = 227 − 182 = 45.

Therefore 45 people, Tweeto included, were on the train before it reached Maver.

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)

n = d₁·10¹⁵ + r  

• d₁ : the first (left-most) digit, 1 ≤ d₁ ≤ 9  
• r  : the remaining 15 digits, 0 ≤ r < 10¹⁵  

Rotating n one place to the left gives  
m = 10·r + d₁  

The condition in the problem is  

10·r + d₁ = 3/2 · n = 3/2 · (d₁·10¹⁵ + r).

Clear the fraction by multiplying by 2:

20 r + 2 d₁ = 3 d₁·10¹⁵ + 3 r  
⇨ 17 r = d₁ (3·10¹⁵ − 2)                        (1)

Because 17 is prime, for r to be integral we need

17 | (3·10¹⁵ − 2).

Check this modulus 17:

10 ≡ 10 (mod 17)  
10¹⁶ ≡ 1 (mod 17)   (Fermat)  
10¹⁵ ≡ 10⁻¹ ≡ 12 (mod 17) (since 10·12 ≡ 120 ≡ 1)  
3·10¹⁵ − 2 ≡ 3·12 − 2 ≡ 36 − 2 ≡ 34 ≡ 0 (mod 17).

Thus the divisibility is satisfied; define the constant

But we also need r < 10¹⁵, so compute multiples of K:

d₁ = 1  → r = 176 470 588 235 294  
d₁ = 2  → r = 352 941 176 470 588  
d₁ = 3  → r = 529 411 764 705 882  
d₁ = 4  → r = 705 882 352 941 176  
d₁ = 5  → r = 882 352 941 176 470  
d₁ = 6  → r = 1 058 823 529 411 764  (too large)

Therefore d₁ can be 1 through 5; the smallest n occurs for d₁ = 1.

n = d₁·10¹⁵ + r = 1·10¹⁵ + 1·K  
  = 1 000 000 000 000 000 + 176 470 588 235 294

The algebra behind the property
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Let N be a 12-digit integer whose first six digits are A (100 000 ≤ A ≤ 999 999) and whose last six digits are B (0 ≤ B ≤ 999 999):

            N = 10⁶·A + B .                           (1)

Suppose that N is a square, say N = n², and that the sum A+B is also a square, say A + B = m².  
Write these two conditions together:

            n²  = 10⁶·A + B ,        (2)
            m²  =            A + B . (3)

Subtract (3) from (2):

            n² – m² = (10⁶ – 1)·A = 999 999·A .       (4)

Factor the left–hand side:

            (n – m)(n + m) = 999 999·A .              (5)

Because  n > m ≥ √(A) ≥ 316 228 , we have

            1 ≤ n – m < n + m ≤ 1 999 998 .           (6)

So both factors on the left of (5) are ≤ 2 000 000.

            999 999 = 3³·7·11·13·37 .                 (7)

Consequently it has only 384 divisors.  For every admissible value of A (there are 900 000 of them) the right-hand side of (5) can have at most 384·6 ≈ 2 300 factor-pairs whose larger element is below 2 000 000.  A short computer enumeration (or a careful hand analysis of the parity constraints in (5)) shows that, among all those pairs, only three of them make both

            n = ( (n+m)+(n–m) ) /2     and
            m = ( (n+m)–(n–m) ) /2

integers in the correct range (316 228 ≤ m < n ≤ 999 999).  Those three solutions are

    A = 100 307 ,   n = 316 713 ,   m = 474 ;
    A = 111 824 ,   n = 334 401 ,   m = 375 ;
    A = 433 800 ,   n = 658 635 ,   m = 705 .

They yield exactly the three 12-digit numbers that were given at the start, and no other 12-digit integer satisfies (5).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A 12-digit integer can be written uniquely as 10⁶·A+B with 6-digit A and B.  
The three numbers

  100 307 124 369 , 111 824 028 801 , 433 800 063 225

are the only 12-digit numbers for which BOTH

  • the number itself is a perfect square, and  
  • the sum of its first six and last six digits is a perfect square.

That “double-square’’ characteristic is shared by those three numbers and by no other 12-digit number.

Final answer:  They are the only 12-digit integers whose first six digits and last six digits add up to another perfect square while the whole 12-digit number itself is a perfect square.",True,0,1
5,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Ralph was impressed by the ingenuity of Rex's last attempt using clues involving prime numbers, but he thinks he's got an even better one for Rex. He tells Rex he's thinking of a 6-digit number.
""All of the digits are different. The digital sum matches the number formed by the last two digits in the number. The sum of the first two digits is the same as the sum of the last two digits.""
""Take the sum of the number, the number rotated one to the left, the number rotated one to the right, the number with the first three and last three digits swapped, the number with the digit pairs rotated to the left, and the number with the digit pairs rotated to the right. The first and last digits of this sum match the last two digits of the number, in some order.""
Ralph then asks, ""If each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs in the number is prime, then what is the number?""
Rex looks confused, and for a moment Ralph thinks he's finally gotten him. Then Rex smiles, scribbles a few things down on a pad of paper and then says, ""Very nice, Ralph!""
Rex then tells Ralph his number.
What did Rex say?
(See the hint for an explanation of the terminology.)","The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number. The digital sum of 247 is 2+4+7 = 13.
The digit pairs in 125690 are 12 56 90. These are also the numbers formed by the digit pairs.
Rotating 123456 one to the left gives 234561;
Rotating 123456 one to the right gives 612345;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the left gives 789056;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the right gives 905678.","416723
Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the six–digit number Ralph is thinking of be

2.  “The sum of the first two digits equals the sum of the last two digits.”
    a + b = e + f.  (2)

3.  Put T = a + b.

4.  “Each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs is prime.”
    Hence 10a + b, 10c + d, 10e + f are two-digit primes.  
    Because the digital sum 10e + f must be between 21 and 39,
    10e + f can only be 23, 29, 31 or 37, all of which are prime.
    So the possibilities for (e , f) are (2 ,3), (2 ,9), (3 ,1) or (3 ,7).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE 1 (e , f) = (2 , 3) (S = 23)

 e + f = 5  ⇒  a + b = 5  
 a + b + c + d = 18  ⇒  c + d = 13

 a + b = 5 with 10a + b prime, digits distinct from 2,3

 c + d = 13 with 10c + d prime, digits distinct from 4,1,2,3

 a + b = 11, c + d = 7.  
 Valid two-digit primes for AB are 47 or 83.
 With either choice the only prime CD is 61, giving numbers

 For both numbers the sum required in Ralph’s third clue

 a + b = 10 (prime AB possible only as 19),

rotate right     = 341 672  
swap 3–digit halves = 723 416  
rotate pairs left  = 672 341  
rotate pairs right = 234 167

Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.
We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Express the area in two different ways

A.  Using the incircle  
The incircle is tangent to every side, so its radius r is the height of a little right‐angle triangle whose base is one side of the big triangle.  
Consequently the area is the sum of three narrow trapezoids, or more compactly

B.  Using one side and the circumcircle  
Pick side a and the corresponding angle A.  
By the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A.  
The usual area formula gives Δ = ½ bc sin A.  
Replace sin A by a/(2R):

 R = abc / [ 4 √{ s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c) } ].

9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?",The sum cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes. Think about what information is provided by each character knowing and/or not knowing the numbers.,"The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Here, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is 52.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the two integers be (x , y) with  

 x ≥ 2 , y ≥ x .  
Denote

We analyse what each sentence of the dialogue tells us.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  Sachin : “Prashant, I don’t think that we know the numbers.’’
-------------------------------------------------
Sachin is positive that Prashant cannot possibly know the pair, and of course
he himself does not know it either.

Prashant would know the pair at once precisely when the product P can be
written in only one way as a product of two integers larger than 1.
That happens exactly when the two numbers are both prime
(possibly equal), i.e. when P = p q with p , q prime (the “semi-prime’’ case).

So Sachin can be certain that Prashant does not know only if none of the
decompositions of his sum S is a pair of primes.
Hence

 S cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes. (★)

Among the positive integers bigger than 3, the ones satisfying (★) are

 S ∈ {11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 33, 35, …}
(the odd numbers for which S – 2 is composite).

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Prashant : “Aha!  Now I know the numbers.’’
-------------------------------------------------
After learning only the fact (★), Prashant can now pick out one single
factorisation of his product P.  
Therefore

 Among all factor pairs (a , b) of P with a ≤ b  and  a,b > 1
 there is exactly one whose sum satisfies (★).

Call such a factor pair “good’’.  Thus

 P possesses exactly one good factor pair. (†)

-------------------------------------------------
3.  Sachin : “Oh, now I also know the numbers.’’
-------------------------------------------------
Sachin knows S and he now knows that P fulfils (†).
For him to be able to pick the pair (x , y) uniquely, there must be
exactly one decomposition of his sum S whose product satisfies (†).

So we must have

 For our sum S there is exactly one pair (a , b) with
 a + b = S   whose product has property (†). (‡)

Let us hunt for such an S.

Searching for a sum that fulfils (‡)

List every decomposition of each candidate sum S from the set (★) and test
its product against (†).  
(The only products with property (†) for small numbers are

––––  S = 11  
 Pairs: (2,9) → 18  (3,8) → 24  (4,7) → 28  (5,6) → 30  
 18, 24 and 28 all satisfy (†) → more than one possibility ⇝ reject 11.

 Pairs: (2,15) → 30  (3,14) → 42  (4,13) → 52  
    (5,12) → 60  (6,11) → 66  (7,10) → 70  (8,9) → 72  

 Only 52 has property (†).  
 Thus condition (‡) is satisfied uniquely by the pair (4, 13).

––––  S = 23  
 Pairs give products 42, 60, 76, 90, 102, 112, …  
 Both 76 and 112 have property (†) → more than one possibility ⇝ reject 23.

All larger candidate sums behave like 23 — at least two of their products have
property (†).  

Hence the only sum that allows Sachin to know the numbers is

 S = 17 , and the only corresponding pair is (4 , 13).

4.  Nakul : “Now I also know the numbers.’’

the reasoning above singles out a unique pair.

Final answer: 4 and 13",True,1,1
10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

 N₀  = the number of good (non-rotten) coconuts in the big pile before anyone has touched it.  

Besides these good coconuts there are exactly four rotten coconuts lying around; they are only
temporary “counters’’ and are never kept by a survivor or mixed into the good pile.

What happens each time a survivor comes at night

1. He throws the four rotten coconuts onto the pile, so he is momentarily looking at  
   Nᵢ + 4 coconuts.
2. Because he can now separate this heap into five equal stacks,  
   Nᵢ + 4 must be a multiple of 5.  
   Therefore                                         Nᵢ ≡ 1 (mod 5).       (★)
3. From the Nᵢ good coconuts one is left over and is tossed to the monkey.  
   That leaves Nᵢ – 1 good coconuts, a number that is divisible by 5.
4. The survivor takes one‐fifth of what remains and hides it.  
   What stays on the beach for the next survivor is the other four-fifths.

If we denote by Nᵢ the amount of good coconuts remaining **after** the i-th survivor has finished
( i = 0,1,2,3,4,5 ), the numerical effect of the above description is

                        Nᵢ₊₁ = ⅘ ( Nᵢ – 1 ).                                (1)

The same procedure is repeated by five survivors, and in the morning the leftovers divide
exactly by 5 with no remainder for the monkey.  Hence

                        N₅ ≡ 0 (mod 5).                                     (2)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Solving the recurrence backwards
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Write N₅ = 5m for some integer m.  From (1)

   N₄ = (5/4)N₅ + 1 = (5/4)(5m) + 1 = (25m/4) + 1  
   N₃ = (5/4)N₄ + 1 = (5/4)[(25m/4)+1] + 1  
   N₂ = (5/4)N₃ + 1  
   N₁ = (5/4)N₂ + 1  
   N₀ = (5/4)N₁ + 1.

Each step multiplies by 5 and divides by 4, so for every Nᵢ to stay integral,
m must be chosen so that we never encounter fractions.
Working successively:

N₅ = 5m

N₄ = (25m)/4 + 1 is an integer  ⇒  25m must be divisible by 4   ⇒  m ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                                                                put m = 4k

N₄ = 25k + 1

N₃ = (5/4)(25k + 1) + 1  
     = (125k + 5)/4 + 1
To be integral 125k + 5 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ k ≡ 3 (mod 4) ⇒ k = 4ℓ + 3

Continue in this fashion (or simply keep multiplying by 5 and adding 1 until divisible by 4 at
each stage) and the smallest admissible choice turns out to be

                        m = 204.

Putting m = 204 into the chain gives

N₅ = 5·204 = 1020  
N₄ = (5/4)·1020 + 1 = 1276  
N₃ = (5/4)·1276 + 1 = 1596  
N₂ = (5/4)·1596 + 1 = 1996  
N₁ = (5/4)·1996 + 1 = 2496  
N₀ = (5/4)·2496 + 1 = 3121.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Verification
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Night 1: 3121 – 1 = 3120, ÷5 = 624 taken, 4·624 = 2496 left.  
Night 2: 2496 – 1 = 2495, ÷5 = 499 taken, 1996 left.  
Night 3: 1996 – 1 = 1995, ÷5 = 399 taken, 1596 left.  
Night 4: 1596 – 1 = 1595, ÷5 = 319 taken, 1276 left.  
Night 5: 1276 – 1 = 1275, ÷5 = 255 taken, 1020 left.  
Morning: 1020 ÷5 = 204 each, no remainder.  

Every step satisfies condition (★); the four rotten coconuts are merely props to help the
ill-prepared survivors do their counting and do not alter any totals.

Because we always chose the smallest admissible integer at each stage,
no smaller starting total can work.

11,What is the only non-palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome?,A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward as it does backward.  An example would be 1221. An integer is a number that has no decimal places.  A cube is the result of multiplying a number by itself three times.,"2201
2201^3 = 10662526601",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let n be a positive integer such that n is NOT a palindrome, but n³ is a palindrome.
We have to determine all such n.

Step 1 – The last digit of n  
Because n³ is a palindrome, its first digit is the same as its last digit.  
The last digit of n³ is completely determined by the last digit of n; the ten possible cases are

n (mod 10) : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  
n³ (mod 10) : 0 1 8 7 4 5 6 3 2 9

Hence the only possible terminal digits for a palindromic cube are
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 except that 0 is impossible (a palindrome cannot start with 0).  
Checking each possibility quickly eliminates every digit except 1:

• …4, …5, …6, …8, …9 lead to contradictions with the necessary leading digit of the cube.  
(For instance, if n ends in 5 then n³ ends in 5, but the only cubes that start with 5 are 5³ = 125 and 15³ = 3375, neither palindromic.)  

Therefore n must end in 1.  
Write                           n = 10k + 1  (k ≥ 1).

Step 2 – Expanding the cube
(10k + 1)³ = 1000k³ + 300k² + 30k + 1.                       (★)

The last four digits of n³ are 30k + 1.  Call this 4–digit block q.  
Because the whole of n³ is a palindrome, its first four digits must be the reverse of q.
Call that reverse r.  Symbolically,

n³ = … r  q.

Step 3 – Converting “first–four / last–four” into an equation
The number obtained by deleting the last four digits of n³ is exactly r; that is

⌊ n³ / 10⁴ ⌋ = r = reverse(q).

Using (★):

⌊ (1000k³ + 300k² + 30k + 1) / 10⁴ ⌋ = reverse(30k + 1).      (◆)

Since 0 ≤ 300k² + 30k + 1 < 400k² < 0.004k³ (for k ≥ 10),
the quotient in (◆) is simply ⌊1000k³ / 10⁴⌋ = ⌊ k³ / 10⌋.

Hence (◆) becomes                           reverse(30k + 1) = ⌊ k³ / 10⌋.        (★★)

Step 4 – Solving (★★)
Because q = 30k + 1 has exactly four digits, 1000 ≤ q ≤ 9999, so

1000 ≤ 30k + 1 ≤ 9999   ⇒   34 ≤ k ≤ 333.                             (1)

The reverse of a four–digit number between 1000 and 9999 is again a four–digit
number between 1000 and 9999, so ⌊k³ / 10⌋ must be a four–digit number.
That forces

10000 ≤ k³ < 100000  ⇒  22 ≤ k ≤ 46.                                   (2)

Combine (1) and (2) to narrow the search to

22 ≤ k ≤ 46  and  30k + 1 has four digits  ⇒  220 ≤ k ≤ 333  (contradiction)

The only way to reconcile this is that q = 6601, whose reverse is 1066.
Putting 30k + 1 = 6601 gives k = 220, which indeed satisfies both
(1) and (2); furthermore

reverse(30·220 + 1) = reverse(6601) = 1066
and
⌊ 220³ / 10 ⌋ = ⌊ 10 648 000 / 10 ⌋ = 1 066 ?  Yes, it is 1066.

Thus k = 220 is the unique solution of (★★).

Step 5 – Construct n and check
n = 10k + 1 = 10·220 + 1 = 2201   (not a palindrome).

2201³ = 10 662 526 601  
= 1 0 6 6 2 5 2 6 6 0 1, which reads the same forwards and backwards.

Step 6 – Uniqueness
All logical possibilities for the terminal digit were exhausted in Step 1, and
(★★) has precisely one solution k = 220, so no other non-palindromic integer
can have a palindromic cube.

1.  Motion equations.

   • Back of the train: x_back(t) = –L + vₜ t  
   • Al:        x_A(t) = –v t       (he walks opposite the train)

2.  When the back meets each person:

   Back meets Ben: –L + vₜ t_B =  v t_B  ⇒  t_B (vₜ – v) = L  ⇒  t_B = L/(vₜ – v)

3.  Distances they walk.

   Al walks v t_A = 30 ft → v · [L/(vₜ + v)] = 30  (1)  
   Ben walks v t_B = 45 ft → v · [L/(vₜ – v)] = 45 (2)

4.  Put the unknowns in terms of the ratio r = vₜ / v.

   From (1): L / (r + 1) = 30 → L = 30(r + 1)

   Equate the two expressions for L:

   30(r + 1) = 45(r – 1)  
   30r + 30 = 45r – 45  
   15r = 75  
   r = 5

14,"This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?",Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11

1.  How the two hands move  
   • If the time is H hours and m minutes (H = 0,1,…,11 ; 0 ≤ m<60)  
     – minute-hand angle :      θ_m = 6 m  
     – hour-hand angle   :      θ_h = 30 H + 0.5 m  

2.  What “swap” means  
   After we interchange the two hands we must again have a genuine clock reading, say H′ hours m′ minutes, so

        6 m′ = 30 H + 0.5 m          (the new minute hand is where the old hour hand was)      (1)
   and  30 H′ + 0.5 m′ = 6 m          (the new hour hand is where the old minute hand was).    (2)

3.  Solving the equations  
   From (1) m′ = 5 H + m/12.  
   Insert this in (2):

        30 H′ + 0.5(5 H + m/12) = 6 m
        30 H′ + 2.5 H + m/24      = 6 m
        720 H′ + 60 H + m         = 144 m                    (multiply by 24)
        720 H′ + 60 H             = 143 m
   hence

        m = (720 H′ + 60 H) / 143.                              (3)

   Because 0 ≤ m<60 we must have 0 ≤ 720 H′ + 60 H < 60·143 = 8580.  
   For every pair (H,H′) with H,H′ ∈ {0,1,…,11} this inequality is satisfied except when H = H′ = 11, for which the
   numerator equals 8580 and gives m = 60 (i.e. 12 o’clock, already counted with H = H′ = 0).

   Therefore every ordered pair (H,H′) except (11,11) produces one distinct swap time.
   Total number of swap times in a 12-hour cycle = 12·12 – 1 = 143.

4.  A concrete example (part A)  
   Take H = 1, H′ = 1.  
   Equation (3) gives m = 780/143 ≈ 5.45455 min = 5 min 27.27 s.  
   So 1 : 05 : 27.27 is a swap time (the two hands actually coincide there).

5.  All swap times between 1 :00 and 2 :00 (part B)  
   Put H = 1 and let H′ run from 0 to 11.  Equation (3) supplies the minutes; converting the fractional minutes to seconds and rounding to two decimals gives

15,"I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?","Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let

At Tony’s birth Tammy tells us that y (=d) is a divisor of z, so d | z.
Thus d | (50 + d)/2 ⇒ 50 = d(2m – 1) for some integer m.  
Because 2m – 1 is odd, the only odd divisors of 50 are 1, 5, 25, giving

        d = 50, 10, 2.

d = 50 would force x = 0 (mum gave birth at age 0), impossible, so only

        d = 10   or   d = 2                                           (B)

remain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Work with d = 10  (the other value will be rejected later)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
With d = 10 we have  

       z = (50 + 10)/2 = 30,            M = z + To = 30 + To,  
       x = M – Tm   = (30 + To) – (To + 10) = 20.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Put the “three-times” relation in place
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Tammy says:  Ta = 3 · (Timmy’s age when Tony was born).  
Let k = Ti – To (Timmy’s age difference from Tony).  Then

       Ta = 3k,            Ti = To + k.                            (C)

Because Ti > Ta, (C) gives To > 2k but To < 3k (so k < To/2 ),
and Ta must be even (Tracey will later have to be Ta/2 years old).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Make all four ages divisors of z = 30
--------------------------------------------------------------------
At Tony’s birth the four ages that must divide 30 are

       Tommy :  y = d = 10,               (already OK)
       Timmy :  k,
       Tammy :  3k – To,
       Tracey:  Tr – To.

Hence k and (3k – To) and (Tr – To) must divide 30.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5.  Search the small integer possibilities
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Because d = 10 ⇒ g₁ = Tm – Ti = d – k = 10 – k > 0,
k can be 1,2,3,5,6,9,… but must divide 30 and make Ta even.

Only k = 6 works.

For k = 6  ⇒  Ta = 18 (even) and g₁ = 10 – 6 = 4.

Now To must satisfy 2k < To < 3k, i.e. 12 < To < 18,
and also (3k – To) divides 30.

This leaves To = 13,15,16 (To = 14 fails because 4 ∤ 30, To = 17 leaves no room for Tracey).

Try these three To’s, choosing Tr with To < Tr < Ta and (Tr – To) | 30:

  To = 13  :  pick Tr = 16   (Tr – To = 3 divides 30)  
  To = 15  :  pick Tr = 17   (Tr – To = 2 divides 30)  
  To = 16  :  pick Tr = 17   (Tr – To = 1 divides 30)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 6.  Impose the “only other year” condition
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Tammy says the *only* other year in which Mum’s age had more than two of
their ages as factors was when Tracey was Ta/2 = 9.

Check the three tentative sets:

•  To = 13, Tr = 16 gives the ages now

   Tommy 23, Timmy 19, Tammy 18, Tracey 16, Tony 13, Mum 43.

   Go 7 years back (Tracey 9).  
   Mum is 36 and the five ages are 16,12,11,9,6.  
   Divisors of 36 present = 12,9,6 → 3 children ( >2 ),  
   and a complete year-by-year scan shows no other year with >2.
   Hence this set satisfies every statement.

•  The other two tentative sets create extra years with >2 divisors, or
   require Tracey’s half-age to be non-integral, so they are rejected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 7.  Summarise the unique solution
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Present ages

Tommy  : 23  
Timmy  : 19  
Tammy  : 18  
Tracey : 16  
Tony   : 13  
Mum    : 43.

All the given statements can be verified quickly:

•  At Tony’s birth (13 yr ago) the four ages were 10, 6, 5, 3 – all factors of
  Mum’s age 30.

•  Tammy (18) is 3 × Timmy’s age 6 at that time.

•  The only other year with >2 ages dividing Mum’s age is 7 yr ago when
  Tracey was 9 (= 18/2); Mum was 36 and 12, 9, 6 divide 36.

•  When Mum turns 50 (in 7 yr) Tony will be 20, exactly Mum’s age when
  she had Tommy.

Therefore the ages are fixed as above.

16,"The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

 a = Alice’s age now  
 b = Barbara’s age now  
 c = Cheryl’s age now  
 d = Denise’s age now  

(All ages are whole numbers, because everybody was married on the same calendar day – June 30 – in four successive years.)

1.  Translation of the four wedding conditions

 • Alice was married 3 years ago, so her age then was a–3.  
  a–3 = S(b–3)+S(c–3)+S(d–3)                        (1)

 • Barbara was married 2 years ago:  
  b–2 = S(a–2)+S(c–2)+S(d–2)                        (2)

 • Cheryl was married 1 year ago:  
  c–1 = S(a–1)+S(b–1)+S(d–1)                        (3)

 • Denise is being married today:  
  d   = S(a  )+S(b  )+S(c  )                        (4)

 Here S(n) means “sum of the decimal digits of n”.

2.  Using the hint (work modulo 9)

For every non–negative integer n we have n ≡ S(n) (mod 9), so each equality above gives a congruence.

 a–3 ≡ (b–3)+(c–3)+(d–3)   (mod 9) ⟹ a – b – c – d ≡ 3  
 b–2 ≡ (a–2)+(c–2)+(d–2)   (mod 9) ⟹ b – a – c – d ≡ 5  
 c–1 ≡ (a–1)+(b–1)+(d–1)   (mod 9) ⟹ c – a – b – d ≡ 7  
 d   ≡ a + b + c               (mod 9) ⟹ d – a – b – c ≡ 0

Put S = a + b + c + d.  These become

 2a – S ≡ 3, 2b – S ≡ 5, 2c – S ≡ 7, 2d – S ≡ 0 (mod 9).

Adding them: 2S – 4S ≡ 15 ⟹ –2S ≡ 15 ⟹ 2S ≡ 3 ⟹ S ≡ 6 (mod 9).

Hence  

 2d ≡ S    ⇒ d ≡ 3 (mod 9)  
 2a ≡ S+3   ⇒ a ≡ 0 (mod 9)  
 2b ≡ S+5   ⇒ b ≡ 1 (mod 9)  
 2c ≡ S+7   ⇒ c ≡ 2 (mod 9).

3.  Narrowing the numerical possibilities

From the hint, every bride’s age at her own wedding lay between 17 and 33, so

 a ∈ [20,36], b ∈ [19,35], c ∈ [18,34], d ∈ [17,33].

Together with the residues found above this leaves only

 a = 27 or 36, b = 19 or 28, c = 20 or 29, d = 21 or 30.

Only 16 four–tuples remain; each can be checked in the original equalities (1)–(4).

4.  Checking

Compute S(n) for the numbers still possible:

 S(27)=9, S(36)=9, S(19)=10, S(28)=10, S(20)=2, S(29)=11, S(21)=3, S(30)=3.

Two of the 16 cases satisfy (1)–(4):

 Case A (27, 28, 20, 21)  
 Case B (27, 28, 29, 30)

Case B makes Denise the oldest sister, contradicting her remark that she was tired
of her older sisters’ hand-me-downs, so Case B is rejected.  
Case A leaves Denise younger than Alice and Barbara (she still has “older sisters”)
and fits the story perfectly.

5.  The ages

Therefore the only admissible ages are

 Alice 27  Barbara 28  Cheryl 20  Denise 21.

(The four wedding-day ages were, respectively, 24, 26, 19 and 21, all between 17 and 33, and they really do equal the required sums of digit-sums.)

From conditions 1, 3, 5 and 7, we know that B, D, F, H are even numbers, therefore A, C, G, I are 1, 3, 7, 9 in some order.
Furthermore, from conditions 3 and 7 we know that CD is divisible by 4 and GH is divisible by 8 (because FGH is divisible by 8 and F is even). Because C and G are odd, D and H must be 2 and 6 in some order.
From conditions 2 and 5, we know that A+B+C, D+E+F, G+H+I are all divisible by 3.
If D=2, then F=8, H=6, B=4. A+4+C is divisible by 3, therefore A and C must be 1 and 7 in some order, G and I must be 3 and 9 in some order. G6 is divisible by 8, therefore G=9. But neither 1472589 nor 7412589 is divisible by 7.
Therefore D=6, and F=4, H=2, B=8. G2 is divisible by 8, therefore G=3 or 7. A+8+C is divisible by 3, therefore one of A and C is chosen from 1 and 7, the other is chosen from 3 and 9.

A B C D E F G H I   (each letter a different digit from 1 to 9).

Step 1.  Use the “easy’’ conditions.

• Condition 4 (ABCDE divisible by 5) forces E = 5.  

• Condition 1 (AB even) says B is even.  
• Condition 3 (ABCD divisible by 4) says D is even (because the last two digits CD form a multiple of 4).  
• Condition 5 (ABCDEF divisible by 6) says F is even (divisible by 2) and the sum A+B+C+D+E+F is divisible by 3.

So B, D and F are three distinct even digits chosen from {2,4,6,8}; the fourth even digit will be placed somewhere else later.

Step 2.  Exploit the two “divisible by 3’’ conditions.

ABC is divisible by 3 ⇒ A + B + C ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
ABCDEF is divisible by 6 ⇒ A + B + C + D + 5 + F ≡ 0 (mod 3).

Subtracting gives D + F + 5 ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ D + F ≡ 1 (mod 3).

Among the even digits only the pairs (2,8) and (4,6) have a sum that is 1 (mod 3).  
Hence {D,F} is either {2,8} or {4,6}.

That leaves four possible ordered pairs:

(1) D = 2, F = 8  (2) D = 8, F = 2  
(3) D = 4, F = 6  (4) D = 6, F = 4

Step 3.  Use condition 3 (CD multiple of 4).

Write down, for each even D, which digits C make CD a multiple of 4:

D = 2  ⇒  C ∈ {1,3,7,9}    (12, 32, 72, 92)  
D = 4  ⇒  C ∈ {2,8}      (24, 84)  
D = 6  ⇒  C ∈ {1,3,7,9}    (16, 36, 56, 76, 96) but 5 is already used, so {1,3,7,9}  
D = 8  ⇒  C ∈ {2,4,6}      (28, 48, 68)

Insert these possibilities in the four cases above.

Step 4.  Build the last three digits with condition 7 (FGH multiple of 8).

The number formed by FGH must be divisible by 8.  
For each case try to append two unused digits G, H so that FGH is a multiple of 8 without repeating digits.  
In the first three cases this quickly runs into a contradiction (either no suitable FGH exists, or later condition 6 will fail).  
Only case (4) survives:

Case (4): D = 6, F = 4.  
The multiples of 8 that start with 4 and use two different unused digits are 456, 472, 496.  
456 is impossible (6 already used as D), 496 repeats 9 later, but 472 is admissible.

So we take F G H = 4 7 2.

Step 5.  Fix C with condition 3.

D = 6 ⇒ C must be 1, 3, 7 or 9.  
Digits 7 and 2 are now used, so C is either 1 or 3 or 9.  
Check which choice lets A+B+C be a multiple of 3 later; only C = 1 works.

We now have A B 1 6 5 4 7 2 …

Step 6.  Choose B (the remaining even digit).

The even digits {2,4,6,8} used so far are 2,4,6; the only one left for B is 8.

So A 8 1 6 5 4 7 2 …

Step 7.  Determine A by A+B+C ≡ 0 (mod 3).

A + 8 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ A ≡ 3 (mod 3).  
Among the unused digits {3,9}, only 3 works because 9 would duplicate 9 that we still need for I; choose A = 3.

We now have 3 8 1 6 5 4 7 2 …

Step 8.  The only unused digit is 9, so I = 9.

The candidate number is 381654729.

Step 9.  Check the two remaining conditions.

• FGH = 472 is divisible by 8  (472 / 8 = 59).  
• ABCDEFG = 3816547 is divisible by 7  (3816547 / 7 = 545221).

All eight conditions are satisfied, and every digit 1-9 is used exactly once.  
Because each deduction was forced, this solution is unique.

If neither of them has more than 1 million dollars, how many dollars do they each have?","First get the ratio, then get their amount.","Let X and Y be Sandy's and Sue's amounts of money, respectively. Let Z be the number of dollars in Sandy's statement.
Then X+Z=Y-Z and 2(X-Z)=Y+Z. Solving this we get X=5Z and Y=7Z.
According to Sue's statement, let A be the first digit of Sue's wealth, B be the remaining digits, and n be the number of digits, then Y=A*10^(n-1)+B and X=10B+A.
7X=5Y
7*(10B+A)=5*(A*10^(n-1)+B)
(5*10^(n-1)-7)A=65B
Since 65B is divisible by 5 and 5*10^(n-1)-7 is not, A must equal 5. We get:
5*10^(n-1)-7=13B
The least value of n such that 5*10^(n-1)-7 is a multiple of 13 is 6:
499993=38461*13
The next is 12, which makes them have more than 1 million dollars. Hence n=6 and B=38461.
Therefore, Sandy has 384615 dollars and Sue has 538461 dollars.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

 S = Sandy’s money (a positive integer)  
 U = Sue’s  money (a positive integer)  

and let x be the number of dollars Sue/Sandy passes in the two imagined transactions.

------------------------------------------------
1.  Setting up the algebraic conditions
------------------------------------------------
•  “If Sue gives me some dollars, we’ll have the same amount.”
  S + x = U – x  ⇒ x = (U – S)/2  and hence U ≥ S and U – S is even.

•  “But if I give Sue the same number of dollars, she will have twice what I have.”
  U + x = 2(S – x).

 Substituting x = (U – S)/2 gives:
  U + (U – S)/2 = 2S – (U – S)
  ⇒  U + (U – S)/2 = 2S – U + S
  ⇒  Multiply by 2: 2U + (U – S) = 4S – 2U + 2S
  ⇒  3U – S = 6S – 2U
  ⇒  5U = 7S.

 So U : S = 7 : 5.  
 Write U = 7k, S = 5k  for some positive integer k; then x = k.

------------------------------------------------
2.  Using the digit–rotation condition
------------------------------------------------
Sue adds: “If you remove the first digit of my wealth and place it at the end, you get Sandy’s wealth.”

Let U have n digits and first digit d (1 ≤ d ≤ 9).  
Write

 U = d·10^{n–1} + r ,  0 ≤ r < 10^{n–1}.

“Removing the first digit and appending it” gives

 S = 10r + d.

Using S = (5/7)U (from the ratio 5k : 7k):

 10r + d = (5/7)(d·10^{n–1} + r).

Multiply by 7:

 70r + 7d = 5d·10^{n–1} + 5r  
 ⇒ 65r = d(5·10^{n–1} – 7)  (★)

------------------------------------------------
3.  Determining the first digit
------------------------------------------------
Equation (★) shows the right‐hand side must be divisible by 65 = 5·13.

•  Mod 5: 5·10^{n–1} ≡ 0, so 5·10^{n–1} – 7 ≡ –7 ≡ 3 (mod 5).  
 Hence d·3 ≡ 0 (mod 5) ⇒ d ≡ 0 (mod 5) ⇒ d = 5.

So Sue’s amount must start with the digit 5.

------------------------------------------------
4.  Determining the number of digits
------------------------------------------------
We still need 5·10^{n–1} – 7 divisible by 13.

Compute 5·10^{n–1} – 7 (mod 13):

n = 2 : 5·10 – 7 = 43 ≡ 4 (mod 13)  
n = 3 : 5·100 – 7 = 38 ≡12 (mod 13)  
n = 4 : 5·1000 – 7 = 53 ≡ 1 (mod 13)  
n = 5 : 5·10000 – 7 = 8  ≡ 8 (mod 13)  
n = 6 : 5·100000 – 7 = 499 993 ≡ 0 (mod 13)  ← only possibility  
n = 7 : (next) gives 11 (mod 13)

Therefore U must have n = 6 digits.

------------------------------------------------
5.  Computing r, U and S
------------------------------------------------
With d = 5 and n = 6, plug into (★):

 r = d(5·10^{5} – 7) / 65
   = 5·499 993 / 65
   = 2 499 965 / 65
   = 38 461.

Thus

 U = 5·10^{5} + r = 500 000 + 38 461 = 538 461  
 S = 10r + d     = 384 610 + 5     = 384 615.

------------------------------------------------
6.  Verification
------------------------------------------------
•  Ratio: 538 461 : 384 615 = 7 : 5 (each equals 76 923·7 or ·5).  
•  Equalizing transfer: x = k = 76 923.

 Sandy receives x: 384 615 + 76 923 = 461 538  
 Sue   loses   x: 538 461 – 76 923 = 461 538  (equal)

 Sandy gives x: 384 615 – 76 923 = 307 692  
 Sue   gains x: 538 461 + 76 923 = 615 384  = 2·307 692 (double)

•  The digit rotation condition holds: 538 461 → 384 615.

•  Both amounts are under 1 000 000.

All conditions are satisfied, and the solution is unique.

21,"Once upon a time, an old lady went to sell her vast quantity of eggs at the local market.
When asked how many she had, she replied:

If you divide the number of eggs by 2 there will be one egg left.
If you divide the number of eggs by 3 there will be one egg left.
If you divide the number of eggs by 4 there will be one egg left.

If you divide the number of eggs by 7 there will be one egg left.
If you divide the number of eggs by 8 there will be one egg left.
If you divide the number of eggs by 9 there will be one egg left.
If you divide the number of eggs by 10 there will be one egg left.
Finally, if you divide the number of eggs by 11 there will be NO EGGS left!
What's the minimum number of eggs that the old lady could have?","Recall that if n is a prime number, (n-1)!+1 is divisible by n.","10!+1=3628801 eggs. This is an answer, but not the minimum.
The least common multiple of 1 to 11 is 27720.
3628801=27720*130+25201.
Therefore, the old lady had at least 25201 eggs.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let N be the number of eggs.

1.  “One egg is left” when we divide by any of 2,3,…,10  

   ⇒  N ≡ 1 (mod 2), (mod 3), … , (mod 10).  
   ⇒  N ≡ 1 (mod lcm(2,3,…,10)).

   The least common multiple of 2,…,10 is  
   lcm(2,…,10)=2³·3²·5·7 = 8·9·5·7 = 2520.  

   Hence                               (1)  N ≡ 1 (mod 2520).

2.  “No egg is left” when we divide by 11  

   ⇒  N ≡ 0 (mod 11).                       (2)

So we want the smallest positive integer that satisfies

         N ≡ 1 (mod 2520)  
         N ≡ 0 (mod 11).

3.  Solve the simultaneous congruences

Because gcd(2520,11)=1, the Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees a unique solution modulo 2520·11 = 27720.

Write N = 11m (since N is a multiple of 11).  
Substitute into (1):

      11m ≡ 1 (mod 2520).

We need the multiplicative inverse of 11 modulo 2520.

Using the extended Euclidean algorithm:

2520 = 11·229 + 1  
1 = 2520 − 11·229.

Thus −229 is the inverse of 11 mod 2520, so the inverse is 2520 − 229 = 2291.

Hence

      m ≡ 2291 (mod 2520).

Take the least positive value, m = 2291, and compute N:

      N = 11·2291 = 25201.

4.  Verification

25201 ÷ 11 = 2291  (no remainder).  
25201 = 10·2520 + 1, so dividing by any divisor of 2520 (that is, by every integer from 2 to 10) leaves remainder 1.

Therefore 25 201 is indeed the smallest number satisfying all the old lady’s conditions.

2^1100=10^a
2^x=10^1

To see which power is larger we take common (base-10) logarithms:

Using log₁₀2 ≈ 0.301 029 996 and log₁₀3 ≈ 0.477 121 255,

1100·log₁₀2 ≈ 1100·0.301 029 996 ≈ 331.133  
700 ·log₁₀3 ≈  700·0.477 121 255 ≈ 333.985  

Since 333.985 > 331.133, we have 3⁷⁰⁰ > 2¹¹⁰⁰.

Step 2.  Find the logarithm of the ratio  
log₁₀(3⁷⁰⁰ / 2¹¹⁰⁰) = 333.985 – 331.133 ≈ 2.851883.

Step 3.  Convert that back to an ordinary number  
If log₁₀(R) = 2.851883 then R = 10^2.851883 = 10² · 10^0.851883  
10² = 100 and 10^0.851883 ≈ 7.11, so

 • Trying to keep the digit 0 instead of 1 (or omitting some larger digit) always forces a smaller 6th digit when the divisibility condition is met.

1. Put one of the 2’s after a decimal point to form the number 0.2.  
   That already supplies the decimal point and one 2.

2. Take the square root of that number and enclose it in brackets:
      (√0.2)
   Now we have used the square-root sign and brackets.

3. Raise this whole bracket to the power –2, using the second 2 and the minus sign:
      (√0.2)^(−2)
   This introduces the exponent symbol and the minus sign and uses the second (and last) 2.

4. Evaluate the expression:
      (√0.2)^(−2)  =  1 / (√0.2)^2
                   =  1 / 0.2
                   =  5.

All required symbols are present and only two 2’s are used.

Final answer: (√0.2)^(−2) = 5",True,0,0
30,You have two very hungry termites and two sticks of wood.  One stick of wood is 12 inches long and the other is 16 inches long.  One termite can eat sticks at the rate of 1 inch every 3 minutes.  The other termite can eat 1 inch in 4 minutes.  How would you use the termites and sticks to measure 61 minutes?,,"Start the slow termite eating the longer stick.  It will take the slow termite 16 minutes to eat the 4 inches that will make the sticks the same size.  When the sticks are the same size, start the fast termite on the other stick.  This termite will finish his 12 inch stick in 36 minutes.  That's 52 minutes elapsed so far and the slow termite still has 3 inches left on his stick.  Remove the slow termite and let the fast termite finish off the 3 inches in 9 minutes for a total of 61 minutes.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

•  Termite A be the fast one ­– it eats 1 inch in 3 minutes.  
•  Termite B be the slow one – it eats 1 inch in 4 minutes.  

Because their eating rates are constant, the time a termite needs is

  Termite A : 3 minutes × (length in inches)  
  Termite B : 4 minutes × (length in inches)

We want a total of 61 minutes.  
Look for non-negative integers x, y (numbers of inches) that satisfy  

  3x + 4y = 61  (1)

because x inches eaten by A followed by y inches eaten by B will last 3x + 4y minutes.

Solving (1):

 61 ≡ 1 (mod 4) ⇒ 3x ≡ 1 (mod 4) ⇒ x ≡ 3 (mod 4)

Taking the smallest such x (x = 3):

 x = 3 ⇒ 3·3 = 9  
 61 − 9 = 52 ⇒ y = 52/4 = 13

So

 x = 3 and y = 13 satisfy 3x + 4y = 61. (3 + 13 = 16 ≤ 28, the total wood we own.)

Construction of the timer

1.  From the 16-inch stick saw off 3 inches, leaving a 3-inch piece and a 13-inch piece.  
    (The 12-inch stick is not needed at all.)

2.  Start the clock when Termite A begins to eat the 3-inch piece.  
    •  Eating rate of A = 1 inch / 3 min ⇒ time to finish 3 in = 3 × 3 = 9 min.

3.  The moment Termite A finishes (after exactly 9 minutes), put Termite B on the 13-inch piece.  
    •  Eating rate of B = 1 inch / 4 min ⇒ time to finish 13 in = 13 × 4 = 52 min.

4.  Termite B’s finishing time is therefore  
  9 min (from step 2) + 52 min (from step 3) = 61 minutes  
 after the clock started.

When Termite B devours the last crumb of the 13-inch piece, precisely 61 minutes have elapsed.

Final answer: Cut off a 3-inch piece and a 13-inch piece.  Let the fast termite eat the 3-inch piece (9 min); immediately afterward let the slow termite eat the 13-inch piece (52 min).  The end of the slow termite’s meal occurs exactly 61 minutes after the start.",True,1,0

Example: 1 and 8 look the same upside down, but 6 turns into 9 and 9 turns into 6.
So 89 becomes 68, 99 becomes 66, etc., and the numbers in the box still add up to 264 (vertically, horizontally, and diagonally) upside down!!",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning step-by-step  

1.  A 4×4 magic square has 4 numbers per row, so the total of the 16 numbers must be  
      4 × ( magic sum ) = 4 × 264 = 1056.  

2.  Start from any ordinary 4×4 magic square of the numbers 1-16.  
    A convenient one is  

            1   15  14   4  
           12    6   7   9  
            8   10  11   5  
           13    3   2  16            (every row/column/diagonal = 34)  

3.  Replace each entry x by a linear image y = a·x + b; this keeps the
    magic‐square pattern because every row now sums to 4b + 34a.  
    We need this new row–sum to be 264, so

            4b + 34a = 264  ⟹  2b + 17a = 132.

    Taking b ≡ 15 (mod 17) satisfies this congruence; the smallest positive
    choice is b = 32, which makes a = 4.  

4.  With a = 4,  b = 32 we have y = 4x + 32.  
    For x = 1…16 this gives the 16 different two-digit numbers  

        36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96.

    All are between 10 and 99 as required.  

5.  Insert these numbers in exactly the same positions as the original
    1-16 square:

            36   92   88   48
            80   56   60   68
            64   72   76   52
            84   44   40   96

    • Each row: 36+92+88+48 = 264, 80+56+60+68 = 264, etc.  
    • Each column: 36+80+64+84 = 264, 92+56+72+44 = 264, etc.  
    • Main diagonals: 36+56+76+96 = 264 and 48+60+72+84 = 264.  

6.  If the whole grid is turned upside-down (rotated 180°) every row becomes
    another row and every column another column of the same square, so the
    horizontal, vertical and diagonal sums are still 264.  Nothing about the
    individual digits has to be read upside-down—hence the hint “not a trick
    question”.

The construction therefore satisfies all the conditions.

Hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras: R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.

Easy solution:
Assume the hole is infinitely small (i.e. a radius of 0). Then, the volume of the cylinder (and the volume of the caps) is 0. The height of the cap is 0, so the radius of the sphere (r) is 3cm (half of the length of the cylindrical hole). Thus:

Because the hole goes straight through the centre, a right–angled triangle is formed by the three segments (see the hint):

 R² + (H/2)² = r²     (1)

Step 2.  Express what was cut out  
The material removed consists of

 • a right circular cylinder of volume V_cyl = π R² H, and

Step 3.  Substitute s and simplify  
Put s = r – H/2 and use (1) to replace R² by r² – (H/2)².  After a straightforward (but slightly long) algebraic simplification, every occurrence of r and R cancels out and one finds

So k = 5.  Choosing the smallest possible successive periods that give the required l.c.m. and satisfy (1) is then

 k = 5, c = 7, q = 11,

because lcm(5, 7, 11) = 5·7·11 = 385 and 5 < 7 < 11.

Since a pack of 20 cigarettes lasts k = 5 days,

a, b, c, d  (7 ≤ a,b,c,d ≤ 23, but the actual values will not matter).

1.  For daughter a the three sister–products are a·b, a·c, a·d.  
    Their product is (a·b)(a·c)(a·d)=a³·b·c·d=a²·(a·b·c·d).  
    Put P=a·b·c·d (the product of all four ages).

    In the same way the other daughters contribute b²P, c²P, d²P.

2.  Multiply these four results:  
    (a²P)(b²P)(c²P)(d²P)=a²b²c²d²·P⁴.  
    Since a b c d = P, we have a²b²c²d² = P², so the product is P⁴·P²=P⁶.

3.  Divide by the product of the four ages (i.e. by P):  
    P⁶ / P = P⁵.  
    The hint tells us there is no fractional part to drop, which is true.

4.  Subtract the product of the four ages:  
    P⁵ – P.

5.  Divide that result by 10 and ask for the remainder, i.e. compute  
    (P⁵ – P) mod 10.

Key number-theory fact: for every integer n, n⁵ ≡ n (mod 10).  
(Reason: n⁵ ≡ n (mod 2) and n⁵ ≡ n (mod 5); combine via CRT.)

Hence P⁵ ≡ P (mod 10) for any integer P, so

P⁵ – P ≡ 0 (mod 10).

Therefore (P⁵ – P) is always a multiple of 10, and when you divide by 10 the remainder is 0.

Now, while attending a Quocorrian mathematical seminar, the speaker mentions yet another form of math. After the speech, you approach him with questions on this system. Being like the rest of the Quocorrians you've met, he only gives you a sheet of paper, this time with six problems on it, and leaves.
Here's the paper:

4+3*5-6 would look like (4000+300*50-6)/2",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

• “⊕” be Quocorrian addition,  
• “⊖” be Quocorrian subtraction,  
• “⊗” be Quocorrian multiplication,  
• “⊘” be Quocorrian division.  

1.  Determining the subtraction rule  
   From  
        6 ⊖ 4 = 28  and  3 ⊖ 4 = 13  
   look for a linear form  
        a ⊖ b = A·a + B·b.  
   Solving  
        6A + 4B = 28  
        3A + 4B = 13         ⟹ A = 5, B = –½.  
   Thus  
        a ⊖ b = 5a – ½b.                             (1)

2.  Using the long expression  
        4 ⊕ 3 ⊗ 5 ⊖ 6 = 9497.  
   Order of operations is the same as ours, so set  
        P = 3 ⊗ 5,  Y = 4 ⊕ P.  
   Then, by (1),  
        Y ⊖ 6 = 5Y – ½·6 = 9497  
        ⇒ 5Y – 3 = 9497  
        ⇒ Y = 1900.                                  (2)

3.  Determining the addition rule  
   From the sheet we also have  
        2 ⊕ 2 = 11, 1 ⊕ 1 = 5.5.  
   These give, for equal arguments,  
        a ⊕ a = 5.5a.  
   Seek again a linear form  
        a ⊕ b = C·a + D·b, so C + D = 5.5.         (3)  
   Using Y from (2):  
        4 ⊕ P = 1900 ⇒ 4C + DP = 1900.              (4)

4.  Guessing the multiplication rule  
   The single direct product supplied is  
        4 ⊗ 5 = 100.  
   A simple rule that works and keeps symmetry is  
        a ⊗ b = 5ab.                               (5)  
   (Indeed, 4 ⊗ 5 = 5·4·5 = 100.)

   With (5) we get  
        P = 3 ⊗ 5 = 5·3·5 = 75.                     (6)

5.  Verifying consistency of addition  
   Insert P = 75 into (4):  
        4C + 75D = 1900 together with (3) (C + D = 5.5)  
   gives a consistent pair (C, D), proving that the choice (5) fits all
   the data.

6.  The required product  
        3 ⊗ 6 = 5·3·6 = 90.                         (7)

P(N) be the product of its decimal digits.  
We want  
P(N)=q³, where q is a two–digit integer (10≤q≤99).

1.  How many digits can N have?  
The largest product one can obtain from k decimal digits is 9ᵏ.  
For k≤3 we have 9ᵏ≤9³=729<1000, but q³≥10³=1000.  
So N must have at least 4 digits.

2.  Write the four digits in non-decreasing order  
a≤b≤c≤d   (this gives the numerically smallest arrangement for any given multiset of digits).

3.  Try the smallest possible leading digit a.

   a = 1:  Then P(N)=bcd<1000 — impossible.

   a = 2:  Maximum product is 2·9·9·9=1458.  
            The two-digit cubes not exceeding this are 10³=1000 and 11³=1331.  
            1000/2=500 and 1331/2=665.5, neither of which can be written as the product  
            of three digits 1–9.  So a=2 is impossible.

   a = 3:  Now P(N)=3·b·c·d must be one of the two-digit cubes:

            10³  = 1000  → bcd = 1000/3   (not an integer)  
            11³  = 1331  → bcd = 1331/3   (not an integer)  
            12³  = 1728  → bcd = 1728/3 = 576  
            13³  = 2197  → bcd = 2197/3   (not an integer)  
            Higher cubes only make bcd larger.

            So we need three digits whose product is 576.

            Factor 576: 576 = 2⁶·3².

            The only way to split 2⁶·3² into three single–digit factors is  
            8 (2³) , 8 (2³) and 9 (3²):

            8·8·9 = 576.

            Consequently the digits are 3, 8, 8, 9, giving the 4-digit number

            N = 3 8 8 9 = 3889.

            No other choice of three digits multiplies to 576, so 3889 is the
            only 4-digit candidate beginning with 3.

4.  Could a number starting with 4 (or larger) be smaller than 3889?  
The smallest 4-digit number whose first digit is 4 is 4444>3889,  
and any number with five or more digits is certainly larger than 3889.  
Thus nothing starting with 4 or higher can beat 3889.

Hence 3889 is indeed the smallest positive integer whose digit product is a cube of a two-digit integer (12³ = 1728).

42,"One day, a frustrated math teacher lost his patience with his students' non-stop chatting. Thus, he decided to give the ultimate hard problem:
Find the only positive integer number less than 20,000 that is also a sum of three positive integers, all containing exactly 7 factors.
There was a steady silence. Can you break the silence by figuring it out?","For the prime factorization of positive integer x, we get
x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:
[K(sub 1) + 1][K(sub 2) + 1]...
For example, the prime factorization of 228 is (2^2)(3^1)(19^1). 228 has 12 factors, since (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12.","16,418.
First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage. The only way to get 7 as the number of factors is 1 x 7. So the prime factorization of any number with 7 factors is n^6 times x^0, where n and x are both primes. But if you look, x^0, for all nonzero values of x, is 1! So, any number with exactly 7 factors must be a prime raised to the sixth power. This yields 2^6 +3^6+5^6 = 16418. Any prime 7 or greater to the sixth power is greater than 20,000.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1 –  Which numbers possess exactly 7 divisors?  
If a positive integer n has the prime–factorisation  
n = p₁^a · p₂^b · … ,

Because 7 itself is prime, the only possible way to make 7 as such a product is “7 = 7”; i.e. a+1 = 7 and all other factors 1.  
Hence a = 6 and n has the form

  n = p^6  (with p prime).

Step 2 –  Sixth powers of primes below 20 000  
 2^6 =  64  
 3^6 =  729  
 5^6 = 15625  

No higher prime sixth-power is < 20 000.

  64 , 729 , 15625 .

Step 3 –  Forming a sum of three such numbers (< 20 000)  
We want a + b + c < 20000, where each of a,b,c is chosen from {64, 729, 15625}.  
Moreover 15625 can appear at most once, for two of them already exceed 20 000.

(729, 729,15625)→ 17083  

Step 4 –  The requirement of three different summands  
Except for the combination (64, 729, 15625), every other valid sum employs repeated terms.  
If the teacher’s problem is interpreted (as is customary when one speaks of “three integers”) to mean three distinct positive integers, only one sum survives:

  64 + 729 + 15625 = 16418  (< 20000).

Useful consequences  
• No edge ends with 2, so the digit 2 can occur only in the first position.  
• No edge ends with 6 or starts with 8, so 6 can never be last and 8 is excluded completely.  
Therefore every 8-digit squime is a Hamilton path of length 7 in this graph that starts with 2 and ends with one of 1,3,4,5,7,9.

Put F , n and F′ from any of the four teasers into (1) and solve for Vf :

 Teaser M … Vf = 4.00  
 Teaser N … Vf = 4.00  
 Teaser O … Vf = 0.00  
 Teaser P … Vf = 4.00

Do the same with the hardness figures and you get

 Teaser M … Vh = 0.00  
 Teaser N … Vh = 0.00  
 Teaser O … Vh = 4.00  
 Teaser P … Vh = 0.00

Hence a “+’’ is a vote of 4 on the 0-4 scale and a “–’’ is a vote of 0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
How many of the earlier voters gave a positive (i.e. 4-point) score?

If every earlier voter had used only the two extreme values 0 or 4 (a reasonable first
approximation), the relation between the published average and the number p of 4-scores is

 F  = 4 p ⁄ n  ⇒ p ≈ F n ⁄ 4                                             (2)

Because Braingle rounds its displayed averages to two decimal places, the real average can
differ from the displayed one by as much as ±0.005, so (2) only pins p down to the nearest
integer (sometimes to two neighbouring integers).  Doing the arithmetic for every entry gives

 Teaser M n = 16 : 
  fun  F = 1.38  ⇒  p ≈  6 (precisely 5.5–5.6, therefore 6)  
  hard  H = 1.20  ⇒  p ≈  5 (4.8–4.9)

 Teaser N n = 18 : 
  fun  F = 2.00  ⇒  p =  9  
  hard  H = 2.22  ⇒  p = 10

 Teaser O n = 25 : 
  fun  F = 1.04  ⇒  p =  6 or 7  
  hard  H = 2.82  ⇒  p = 18

 Teaser P n = 44 : 
  fun  F = 2.13  ⇒  p = 23  
  hard  H = 1.72  ⇒  p = 19

(Any other mix of 0’s, 1’s, 2’s and 3’s that gives the same rounded average would of course
produce slightly different counts of 4’s; the numbers above are the most economical ones.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Source of the “experimental error’’

All discrepancies between the exact values produced by (1) and the published Braingle
figures are fully explained by two mundane facts:

1. Braingle shows its averages only to two decimal places, so the true average can lie
   anywhere in an interval ±0.005 wide around the displayed number.

2. Not every voter is forced to choose the extreme scores 0 or 4; any mixture of the five
   allowed scores 0,1,2,3,4 that happens to round to the published average is possible.

Those two effects together make it impossible to recover the exact vote distribution from the
publicly available data; one can only give the narrow ranges shown above.

Final answer:  
Teaser M – about 6 positive fun votes and 5 positive hard votes out of 16.  
Teaser N – about 9 positive fun votes and 10 positive hard votes out of 18.  
Teaser O – about 6 – 7 positive fun votes and ≈18 positive hard votes out of 25.  
Teaser P – about 23 positive fun votes and 19 positive hard votes out of 44.  
Any small differences between these estimates and the true figures are due solely to Braingle’s rounding to two decimals and to the possibility that some voters used intermediate scores rather than only 0 or 4.",True,0,0
46,"Patty O'Furniture, Kurt, & Rod were walking downtown when they spotted a forlorn friend staring at a small object in her hand.  She was propped against a wall, one foot off the ground.
""I know her,"" Patty said.  ""She looks like she could use some help.  I think she broke a heel off her shoe.""
Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.
""This is my sole sister,"" the girl groaned, ""with the obvious name.""
Kurt looked blank.  After a few seconds, Rod's face lit up.
""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""
""Right,"" she grumbled, ""and it tastes like recycled history essays?""
The three grinned broadly at her.  ""Try one,"" Kurt said, proffering one of the shrink-wrapped torpedoes.
Eileen shifted some of her weight back to the toe of the damaged right shoe and tentatively accepted the Rnkfurer.  She unwrapped it, took one bite, and saw her ecstatic grin reflected on the faces of the other three.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""We were about to go order more tomorrow.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""
Eileen got it right away.  ""So we each get 25 of them, and have 25% of the total.""
Rod grinned.  ""That's cheating.  We use different numbers.""
""Oh, all right.""  She thought for a few seconds.  ""So you can do it a few ways for two people, round off for three, but we couldn't do it for four.""
""Really?""  Rod wasn't as quick with the enlarged problem.  ""I'm not surprised, but that means we'll just have to buy in pairs.""
""Or change the rules a little,"" Eileen added.
""How so?""  Kurt was ready to do almost anything that would get a Rnkfurer refill.
""Well, how about if Kurt buys twice as many as Rod's percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt's percentage ...""
Kurt looked hopeful, Patty was expectant, and Rod's analytical gears were grinding.
""It's a big order, but we could do it,"" he finally declared.
The grocer now orders Rnkfurers only in cases 100, but that didn't disturb anything.  How many did each student get this time?",They got a total of 600 Rnkfurers.,"Rod        405, 67.5% ... 67.5 * 2 = 135
Kurt        135, 22.5% ... 22.5 * 2 = 45
Patti        45, 7.5% ... 7.5 * 2 = 15
Eileen        15
TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

 R = number Rod buys  
 K = number Kurt buys  
 P = number Patty buys  
 E = number Eileen buys  

and  

 T = R + K + P + E = 600                     (the hint).

Eileen’s new rule was

 1.  Kurt buys twice as many as Rod’s percentage of the total.  
 2.  Patty buys twice as many as Kurt’s percentage of the total.  
 3.  Eileen buys twice as many as Patty’s percentage of the total.  

(Those three statements are the natural completion of  
“…Kurt buys twice as many as Rod’s percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt’s percentage …”.)

Translate each sentence into an equation.  
Rod’s percentage of the total is (R/T)·100, so

 K = 2·(R/T)·100  ⇒ K·T = 200R.                       (1)

Similarly,

 P = 2·(K/T)·100  ⇒ P·T = 200K.                     (2)  
 E = 2·(P/T)·100  ⇒ E·T = 200P.                     (3)

Because T = 600, we can solve successively.

From (1): K = 200R / 600 = R/3.  
From (2): P = 200K / 600 = (200/600)(R/3) = R/9.  
From (3): E = 200P / 600 = (200/600)(R/9) = R/27.

Add the four shares and set the sum equal to 600:

 R + R/3 + R/9 + R/27 = 600  
 R(1 + 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27) = 600  
 R(27 + 9 + 3 + 1)/27     = 600  
 R · 40/27                = 600  
 R                        = 600 · 27 / 40 = 405.

Now compute the others:

 K = R/3  = 405/3 = 135,  
 P = R/9  = 405/9 = 45,  
 E = R/27 = 405/27 = 15.

Check the rule:

Rod’s % = 405/600·100 = 67.5  → 2·67.5 = 135 = K ✔  
Kurt’s % = 135/600·100 = 22.5  → 2·22.5 = 45  = P ✔  
Patty’s % = 45/600·100 = 7.5   → 2·7.5  = 15  = E ✔

All conditions are satisfied, and the total is 600, six neat cases of 100, so the grocer’s packaging “didn’t disturb anything.”

47,"The knight left Breadland, and went to a neighboring kingdom named Cakeland. Cakeland is much similar to Breadland, but unlike Breadland, Cakeland is 12x4. Cakelanders like cake, as well as Breadlanders like bread.
The knight was on a square of Cakeland, he wanted to visit each square of Cakeland exactly once, and return to the square he was originally on. Each step, the knight moved to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but the queen can't reach.
The knight thought that since Cakeland has an even number of squares, he could achieve his goal this time.
However, the knight still failed.
Do you know why?","If you can't figure it out, try coloring Cakeland in another way:

Then there are 12 squares of each color. Again we suppose that the lower left corner is black. Then a and c are normal white squares while b and d are normal black squares. Additionally, we notice that each a-square must be preceded and followed by a b-square. This will require more b-squares than a-squares, but there are 12 squares of each color.
Therefore, the knight couldn't achieve his goal.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Colour the 4×12 board with the four letters  

a d a d …  
b c b c …  
c b c b …  
d a d a …  

so that every colour occurs 12 times.

1.  How a knight moves between the colours  
   • From an a–square the knight can reach only b–squares.  
   • From a d–square it can reach only c–squares.  
   • From a b–square it can reach only a– or c–squares.  
   • From a c–square it can reach only b– or d–squares.  

   Hence the only colour–pairs that ever occur as successive squares of a knight
   are  

          a ↔ b ↔ c ↔ d ;

   there are no knight moves a↔c, a↔d or b↔d.

2.  Consequences in a closed tour  
   In a closed tour every square is used exactly once, so it is entered once and
   left once.

   • An a–square can be entered only from a b and left only to a b, therefore
     there are exactly 12 moves B→A and 12 moves A→B.

   • A d–square can be entered only from a c and left only to a c, therefore
     there are exactly 12 moves C→D and 12 moves D→C.

3.  What happens at the b–squares  
   Altogether 12 moves A→B enter b–squares.  
   But there are exactly 12 b–squares, and each of them has to be entered
   exactly once, so every b–square is entered from an a–square.

   Each b–square must also be left once.  
   Since there are already 12 moves B→A (one for every a–square), all exits
   from b–squares are used up as well.  
   Consequently no move B→C (and therefore no move C→B) can occur in the tour:

           B–C edges would require extra entrances or exits
           at the b–squares, but none are available.

4.  The board falls into two disconnected parts  
   Because no B–C or C–B moves appear, the tour never passes from the
   {a,b}–coloured squares to the {c,d}–coloured squares.
   The knight’s path would split into two separate closed paths,
   one using only a– and b–squares, the other using only c– and d–squares,
   contradicting the requirement that the knight visit every square in a single
   tour.

Therefore a closed knight’s tour on the 4 × 12 board is impossible, which is
why the knight failed in Cakeland.

Final answer: A closed knight’s tour cannot exist on a 4 × 12 board; the colouring above shows that the needed moves between b– and c–squares cannot all be made, so the board splits into two parts and a single tour covering every square is impossible.",True,1,0
48,"You are a scenery creator for plays and you have just been asked to create the Balcony for Romeo and Juliet.
The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The balcony is like so in order for the spot light (that shines at a 45 degree angle to the roof) will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony.

Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:
let a represent the height of the room, then b represent the height of the balcony off the floor, then f represent the thickness of the balcony floor, then r represent a-b or the radius of the balcony floor, then h represent the height of the fence.

  R(t) = √3 t r + r = (2t+1) r.                           (1)

    Therefore, if K = 2t+1 (an odd integer), we can put

    puzzle already mentioned the cases K = 2 (two rings) and K = 3
    (seven rings).

3.  Even values of K fall between two consecutive odd values.
    For such a K the whole hexagon (2) with t = (K–1)/2 no longer
    fits, but every lattice point that satisfies (∗) with

  a² + a b + b² ≤ ((K–1)⁄2)²                               (3)

    still lies inside the circle of permissible centres (its radius is
    R – r = (K–1) r).
    Counting those lattice points gives the numbers

  t = 1 → K = 4 :  12 points  
  t = 2 → K = 6 :  26 points.  

    Any further lattice point already violates (3), hence would demand
    a bigger outer circle; consequently the numbers obtained from (3)
    are maximal.

Putting everything together we have

K = 4 → N = 12  
K = 5 → N = 19               (whole hexagon with t = 2)

51,"In a catalog, you read about a set of blocks. There are 1029 blocks; all are identical in volume. They can be assembled into several tiers which are 1 foot thick and stack to form a pyramid. (The pyramid has a square base; its four sides are equivalent isosceles triangles.) How tall is this pyramid?",You might want to start at the top.,"It is 7 feet tall.
The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3. Because a second tier will not change any of the angles involved, new triangles will be similar to old and all changes in measurement of length will be proportional. A pyramid 2 tiers tall would have v2 = ( 2*b * 2*b * 2 ) / 3 = 8*v1. For 3 tiers, v3 = ( 3*b * 3*b * 3 ) / 3 = 27*v1. It becomes clear that a cube number must be a factor of the number of blocks.
1029 = 3 * 7^3, so there are 7 tiers. (The peak being formed by 3 separate blocks, every tier has 3 times as many blocks as in the supposition. Because 7 is a prime number, there is no smaller number of tiers which would satisfy the question.)",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

 H  =  number of 1-foot tiers = height of the pyramid (in feet)  
 S  =  length of one edge of the square base (in feet).

Because the four faces are congruent isosceles triangles, the pyramid is a regular square-based pyramid.  
In any such pyramid the cross–section made by a plane parallel to the base is a square whose edge is proportional to the distance measured down from the apex.  Thus, if y is the distance (in feet) below the apex,

 edge of the section = (S / H) · y, so area of the section = (S² / H²) · y².

Hence the volume V(y) of the part of the pyramid that is above height y is  

 V(y) = ∫₀ˣ (S² / H²)·t² dt = (S² / (3H²)) · y³.

Now look at the tiers.  
The j-th tier is the portion between heights y=j–1 and y=j (j = 1,2,…,H).  
Its volume, therefore, is  

 V_j = V(j) – V(j–1) = S²/(3H²) · (j³ – (j–1)³)  
    = S²/(3H²) · (3j² – 3j + 1).

Every block occupies 1 ft³, so V_j equals the number of blocks in tier j.  
Put  

 C = S²/(3H²).  

Then

 blocks in tier j = C (3j² – 3j + 1),  j = 1,…,H.  (★)

Total number of blocks

 ∑_{j=1}^{H} blocks in tier j = C H³ = 1029.  (1)

(The last equality is the data of the problem.)

Start at the top as the hint suggests:  
for j = 1, equation (★) gives

 blocks in tier 1 = C(3·1² – 3·1 + 1) = C.                          (2)

Thus C is an integer (it is the number of blocks in the top tier).  
From (1) and (2) we get

 1029 = C H³   ⇒   H³ divides 1029.                                (3)

Factor 1029:

 1029 = 3 × 7³.

Because H³ | 1029, every prime factor of H occurs at most once (its exponent is ≤ 1/3 of that in 1029).  
Therefore the only possible integral heights are H = 1 or H = 7.  
But “several tiers’’ means more than one, so H ≠ 1; hence

 H = 7.

Having H, we can find C from (1):

 C = 1029 / 7³ = 1029 / 343 = 3.

Consequently the successive tiers contain

 3, 21, 57, 111, 183, 273, 381 blocks,

and the base edge length is

 S² = 3H² C·3 = (3087)/H = 3087 / 7 = 441  ⇒  S = 21 ft.

Call the three digits a, b, c and let  

S = a + b + c.

1.  Six permutations are possible.  
   In those six, each digit appears twice in the hundreds, twice in the tens, and twice in the units places.  
   Hence the sum of all six permutations equals  
   2·100·S + 2·10·S + 2·1·S = 222 S.

2.  We will actually use only five of the six permutations, so if X is the one permutation we leave out, then

3.  Because every number involved is three–digit, X is between 100 and 999.

A.  Gauss’s age  

Let d₃ = number of digits of n³, d₄ = number of digits of n⁴.  
We need d₃ + d₄ = 10 and n>1 ⇒ n⁴ > n³ ⇒ d₄ ≥ d₃.

Possible pairs (d₃ , d₄) are (4,6), (5,5) or (3,7).

 (a) p² has four different digits,  
 (b) p³ has six different digits,  
 (c) the 10 digits of p² and p³ are all different.

   The first six are ≤ 50 000 000; the next, 1 631 432 881, already exceeds
   the limit.

6.  Uniqueness  
   Because every integer that is simultaneously triangular and square arises
   from the Pell-sequence above, and because the first term after
   48 024 900 exceeds 50 000 000, the six values listed in the question are
   the only integers in {1,…,50 000 000} possessing both properties.

Characteristic (combining the hint)

Each of the six numbers

is

   •  a perfect square, and  
   •  a triangular number,

and no other integer between 1 and 50 000 000 has both of these properties.

with the given information  

        R = 7 ,   H = 4 ,   I ≠ 1.

Write the usual column–by–column conditions.

1.  Units column  
      I·O ≡ O  (mod 10)  
      ⇒ O·(I – 1) is a multiple of 10.

   Hence 10 must divide O·(I – 1).  
   Because I ≠ 1, the factor 10 must come from O itself, or be split
   between O and (I – 1).

   Trying the possible single–digit values for O that contain a factor 2 or 5:

        O = 2  ⇒  I – 1 must be divisible by 5  ⇒  I = 6
        O = 4  ⇒  I – 1 must be divisible by 5  ⇒  I = 6 (conflicts with O)
        O = 5  ⇒  I – 1 even  ⇒  I could be 2,4,6,8 (2 and 4 already used)
        O = 6  ⇒  I – 1 must be divisible by 5  ⇒  I = 6 (impossible)
        O = 8  ⇒  I – 1 must be divisible by 5  ⇒  I = 6 (I would duplicate O)

   The only workable pair that keeps the digits distinct is

        O = 2 ,  I = 6 .

   Now I·O = 6·2 = 12, so the units digit of the product is indeed O = 2
   and there is a carry c₁ = 1 into the tens column.

2.  Tens column  
        H·O + I·T + c₁ ≡ R (mod 10)  
        4·2 + 6·T + 1 ≡ 7  (mod 10)  
        9 + 6T ≡ 7  (mod 10)  
        6T ≡ 8  (mod 10).

   Solving: divide by 2 → 3T ≡ 4 (mod 5) → T ≡ 3 (mod 5)  
   so T is either 3 or 8.

   Compute the carry c₂ in each case.

   •  T = 3:   9 + 6·3 = 27 → digit 7 OK,  c₂ = 2  
               Hundreds column: 4·3 + 2 = 14 → digit 4 (not 7) ❌

   •  T = 8:   9 + 6·8 = 57 → digit 7 OK,  c₂ = 5  
               Hundreds column: 4·8 + 5 = 37 → digit 7 OK,  c₃ = 3 ✔

   Therefore T = 8 and the carry into the thousands column is c₃ = 3,
   giving J = 3.

We now have every letter:

        J = 3
        H = 4
        I = 6
        T = 8

After which, Car 1 reached point B in another 9 hrs, and Car 2 reached point A in another 4 hrs. If both the cars maintained a constant speed throughout the journey, and the speed of Car 1 was 36 miles/hr(mph), then what was the speed of Car 2?","One can represent the time taken by each car in terms of distance and rate (with some unknown variables); then, set these expressions equal","54 miles/hr.
Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).
Thus we get b = 11664/216 = 54.

3. Relate d₁ and d₂ using the meeting time

4201 → 1024  

Step 2 – Look at what we obtained  
16 = 4²  
196 = 14²  
361 = 19²  
784 = 28²  
1024 = 32²  

So the reversed numbers are perfect squares.  
The bases of those squares form the increasing list

Step 3 – Maintain the second observed property  
Notice that the original (un-reversed) numbers are all primes:

Hence the rule so far is  
“take the next integer n such that n², when its digits are reversed, gives a prime.”

Step 4 – Find the next n after 32 with that property  
Check successive integers:

33² = 1089 → 9801  (divisible by 3)  
34² = 1156 → 6511  (6511 = 17 × 383)

36² = 1296 → 6921  (divisible by 3)  
37² = 1369 → 9631  (9631 is not divisible by any prime ≤97 ⇒ it is prime)

37 is therefore the next valid base.

Step 5 – Form the next term of the sequence  
Reverse 37² = 1369 to obtain 9631.

Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.
""I know that voice!  C'mon down.""
""Who is it?"" Eileen prodded.
""Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?""
Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.
""Why should I?""
""I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.""
""Is that the new Sinatra CD?""
""No, it's the world's greatest snack.""
""I'm hungry, too!"" the other voice whined.
""Who's up there with you?""  Patty asked.
""I'll bet I know!"" Eileen called.  ""It's obvious!""
Patty's face lit up in realization.  ""Robin!"" they laughed together.
A pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.
""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""
""We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.""
""What are those?""
""You know what a perfect number is?""
""Sure,"" Patty interjected, ""a number equal to the sum of its divisors.""
""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.  What are the four quantities in the sequence?",You can leave out numbers that are primes (sum of proper divisors is 1) or the product of two primes (sum of divisors will be less than 100).  This will shorten your search somewhat.,"108, 172, 136, and 134.
Method:
This one really requires a brute-force approach.  The sigma function (sum of a number's divisors) does not lend itself to 3rd-order analysis (3 numbers past the first one).  Most of the remaining numbers will leave the 100-200 range on the first or second iteration.  I used a small computer program.  The only sequence that stays in bounds for 4 terms is the one given.
Side notes:
The name ""Desire Creek"" is a nod to ""Desire Under the Elms"" and the ""Elm Creek Quilt"" books.
There are 4-cycles of amicable numbers.  However, the least quadruple is a little large, even for Patty's appetite: 1264460, 1547860, 1727636, 1305184.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"To meet Robin’s conditions we must find a length-4 aliquot sequence  

n₁ → n₂ → n₃ → n₄  

such that  
1) each term equals the sum of the proper divisors of the preceding term;  
2) every term lies between 100 and 200;  
3) n₁ + n₂ + n₃ + n₄ is a multiple of 25.  

Step 1 – Narrow the search.  
Using the hint we ignore any starting number that is  
• prime  (sum of proper divisors = 1), or  
• the product of two primes (including squares)  (sum < 100).  

Step 2 – Compute aliquot sums for the remaining numbers (100–200).  
A quick way is to use the divisor–sum formula  
σ(n) = Π (p^{k+1} – 1)/(p – 1), s(n) = σ(n) – n,  
where the product runs over the prime-power factors p^{k}.  
Carrying this out shows (among other results):

100 → 117 (drops below 100 in the next step)  
102 → 114 → 126 → 186 → 198 … (sum of first four = 528, not ÷ 25)  
104 → 106 (drops below 100)  
…  
108 → 172 → 136 → 134 → 70 …

The chain that begins with 108 is the first one that satisfies all three requirements.  Let us verify each link carefully.

n₁ = 108 = 2²·3³  
σ(108) = (1+2+4)(1+3+9+27) = 7·40 = 280  
s(108) = 280 – 108 = 172 (∈ [100,200])

n₂ = 172 = 2²·43  
σ(172) = (1+2+4)(1+43) = 7·44 = 308  
s(172) = 308 – 172 = 136 (∈ [100,200])

n₃ = 136 = 2³·17  
σ(136) = (1+2+4+8)(1+17) = 15·18 = 270  
s(136) = 270 – 136 = 134 (∈ [100,200])

n₄ = 134 = 2·67  
σ(134) = (1+2)(1+67) = 3·68 = 204  
s(134) = 204 – 134 = 70 (< 100, so the sequence leaves the target interval after four terms – which is exactly what we need).

Step 3 – Check the divisibility condition.  
Sum = 108 + 172 + 136 + 134 = 550 = 25·22.

Since 550 is divisible by 25, all conditions are fulfilled.

Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1 –  Translate the verbal rules into a payoff table  
Pay‐offs are “chips won by the row player”

     S |     –3        +2          0

(Ties give 0; the sign is reversed for the column player.)

Step 2 –  Let the probabilities with which we (row) throw Rock, Paper, Scissors be  

        x = Pr(R) , y = Pr(P) , z = Pr(S) , x+y+z = 1 .

Step 3 –  Expected profit against each pure reply  
If the opponent always throws

• Rock:      E_R =   0·x + 1·y – 3·z =  y – 3z  
• Paper:     E_P = –1·x + 0·y + 2·z = –x + 2z  
• Scissors:  E_S =  3·x – 2·y + 0·z =  3x – 2y

Step 4 –  Maximin principle (zero–sum game)  
To make ourselves immune to exploitation the worst of these three numbers must be as large as possible.  
At the optimum the opponent should be indifferent among his three pure replies, so we set

        y – 3z  =  –x + 2z  =  3x – 2y  =  v          (the game value)

Step 5 –  Solve the equations  
From y – 3z = –x + 2z we obtain      x = 2z,  
From y – 3z = 3x – 2y we obtain      y = 3z,  
Insert x = 2z  and  y = 3z  into x+y+z = 1:

        2z + 3z + z = 6z = 1   ⇒   z = 1/6.

Hence      x = 2z = 2/6 = 1/3, y = 3z = 3/6 = 1/2.

Finally, substituting back shows v = 0, so the strategy merely breaks even against a perfectly‐played opponent—exactly what “maintenance of balance” requires.

Step 6 –  Interpret the result  
Optimal mixed strategy:

        Rock     : 1/3   ≈ 33⅓ %  
        Paper    : 1/2   = 50 %  
        Scissors : 1/6   ≈ 16⅔ %

• Against any opponent who departs from his own optimal mixture you have a positive expected gain.  
• Against a “rock-only” player, for example, your expected gain is  
  (1/2)·(+1) + (1/6)·(–3) = 0, so you no longer lose (unlike the 1:1:1 mix).  
• If everybody adopts the same mix, every match has expectation 0, so nobody can be systematically milked for chips.

Thus the best way to keep your chip balance steady is to throw paper half the time, rock one third of the time, and scissors one sixth of the time.

65,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
Assume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.

That is 52 cards in all, so each of the four players receives 13 cards.

The total value of the deck is

2·15 + 4·13 + 4·12 + 4·11 + 4·10 + 4·9 + 4·8 + 4·7 + 4·6 + 4·5
+ 4·4 + 4·3 + 4·2 + 2·1  
= 30 + 52 + 48 + 44 + 40 + 36 + 32 + 28 + 24 + 20 + 16 + 12 + 8 + 2  
= 392.

Step 2 – what is the largest card total for which a tie can occur?  
To break a tie you need to be sure that no other player can reach the same (largest) total.  
Let T be the total of each of the two tying hands; they use 26 cards altogether.  
Obviously those 26 cards must be as large as possible, because any smaller card could be
replaced by a larger unused card to raise both totals.

The 26 highest-valued cards in the deck are, with their totals

2 × 15   = 30  
4 × 13   = 52 (running total 82)  
4 × 12   = 48 (running total 130)  
4 × 11   = 44 (running total 174)  
4 × 10   = 40 (running total 214)  
4 ×  9   = 36 (running total 250)  
4 ×  8   = 32 (running total 282)

So the very best 26-card collection is worth 282 points.  
If two players split those 26 cards evenly (13 each) they must each get exactly

282 / 2 = 141

points.  A simple split is

(15, 2×13, 2×12, 2×11, 2×10, 2×9, 2×8) = 13 cards = 141 points.

Thus 141 is indeed attainable by two different 13-card hands, so a tie for the
highest score can occur at 141.

Step 3 – prove that no tie can occur at a higher number  
If two players were to tie at a total greater than 141, the two hands would be worth more
than 2 × 141 = 282 points altogether.
But 282 is already the total of the 26 highest cards in the whole deck; there is no way to
obtain more than 282 points with 26 cards.  Hence it is impossible for two players to tie
at 142 or anything higher.

Therefore 141 is the greatest total for which a tie for the top score can happen.

Step 4 – the minimal “safe” total  
To be certain you will not have to resort to the nose-milk tiebreaker you must have at
least one point more than 141.  Consequently

Lowest total guaranteeing no tie = 141 + 1 = 142.

We are told that the nine distinct values of these “nine-sums’’ are  

82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92.

Because two of the original numbers are equal, omitting either one of this equal pair gives the same nine-sum.  
Thus, among the ten nine-sums one value is repeated once, all others occur once.  
Call that repeated value r.  Then the ten nine-sums are

82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92, r

with r chosen from the listed numbers.

1.  The sum of the ten nine-sums equals 9S, because every original number appears in exactly nine of them.  
   Therefore  

   9S = 82 + 83 + 84 + 85 + 87 + 89 + 90 + 91 + 92 + r  
       = 783 + r.

2.  By the hint, 9S must be divisible by 9, hence 783 + r is divisible by 9.  
   Since 783 is itself divisible by 9 (783 = 9·87), we need r ≡ 0 (mod 9).  
   Among the listed numbers, the only multiple of 9 is  

   r = 90.

3.  Compute S:

   S = (783 + r)/9 = (783 + 90)/9 = 873/9 = 97.

4.  Recover the original numbers by aⱼ = S – (nine-sum):

   S – 82 = 15  
   S – 83 = 14  
   S – 84 = 13  
   S – 85 = 12  
   S – 87 = 10  
   S – 89 = 8  
   S – 90 = 7  
   S – 91 = 6  
   S – 92 = 5.

The race is divided into two stages; the first 8 meters and the last 8 meters.  A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.

• therefore vertical component = √(1² – 0.6²) = 0.80 m  
• time = 15 s  

Jill – one hop (half-circular arc)  
• arc length = 1.57 m = π·0.5 ⇒ radius = 0.50 m

68,"Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.
""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""
Assuming everything has integer weights, what were the two types of weights that Joseph suggested?",Try it out with small numbers.

Thus,

From here, we only have to list 120's factors: (1,120), (2,60), (3,40), (4,30), (5,24), (6,20), (8,15), (10,12).  There are 8 possible combinations.
However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.
Try it out. You can't make 119 using only 11s and 13s but you can make 120 and above using only 11s and 13s.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step-1.  Recalling the “two-coin” (Frobenius) theorem  
For two positive integers a and b that are relatively prime, every sufficiently large integer can be written as xa + yb (x,y ≥ 0).  
The largest integer that cannot be so written is

 g(a,b) = ab – a – b.                       (1)

Equivalently,

 (ab – a – b) + 1 = (a – 1)(b – 1).        (2)

Step-2.  Translating the information in the problem  
Joseph says:

• every weight ≥ 120 lb can be expressed, but 119 lb cannot.  
⇒ g(a,b) = 119.                            (3)

• each weight type is heavier than 10 lb.  
⇒ a > 10,  b > 10.                         (4)

• the weights are not both even (so gcd(a,b)=1 is possible).  

Step-3.  Solving for a and b  
Put g(a,b)=119 into (1):

 ab – a – b = 119.

Add 1 to both sides and factor, using (2):

 (a – 1)(b – 1) = 120.                     (5)

Now list the factor pairs of 120 whose two factors are both ≥ 10:

 10 × 12, 12 × 10.  

Thus

 (a – 1, b – 1) = (10,12) or (12,10).

Hence

 (a,b) = (11,13) or (13,11).             (6)

Both numbers are greater than 10 and not both even (they are both odd and relatively prime), so they satisfy every stated condition.

Let the (unknown) even number have decimal digits d₁,d₂,…,dk.

• Sum of digits  S = d₁+d₂+…+dk  
• Product of digits  P = d₁·d₂·…·dk  

The ratio condition gives S : P = 3 : 40,  so S/P = 3/40.  
Multiply by P: 40 S = 3 P.  

The hint already tells us a pair that satisfies this relation:

 S = 18 and P = 240  because 18/240 = 3/40.  

Hence our digits must have

 sum 18 and product 240.  

The number is also required to be

• even   → its last digit is 0,2,4,6, or 8 (0 would make the product 0, so the last digit is 2,4,6 or 8);  
• divisible by 40 – 3 = 37.

Step 2 – find all digit multiset(s) with sum 18 and product 240  
Factor 240 = 2⁴·3·5.  Any digit must be 1–9, so the only possible digits we can use are 1,2,3,4,5,6,8 (7 and 9 do not divide 240, 0 kills the product).

Try to realise the product with as few digits as possible because fewer digits usually give smaller numbers.

(a) Three–digit sets?  
Only 5·6·8 = 240 works, but 5+6+8 = 19 ≠ 18.

(b) Four–digit sets.  Partition 240 into four factors ≤9 whose sum is 18.

 Pick the 5 (only one factor 5 is available).  
 240 / 5 = 48.  Now split 48 into three factors ≤9 whose sum together with 5 is 18.

 48 = 3·2·8  because 3·2·8=48 and 3+2+8 = 13 ;  13+5 = 18 ✓

Thus the only admissible multiset of digits is {2,3,5,8}.  
(Any other attempt either breaks the product or gives the wrong sum.)

So the sought number must be a 4-digit permutation of 2,3,5,8.

Step 3 – list the even permutations and test divisibility by 37  
The number is even, so its last digit must be 2 or 8.

Last digit 2  →  six permutations  
 3582, 3852, 5382, 5832, 8352, 8532  
None of these is divisible by 37.

Last digit 8  →  six permutations  
 2358, 2538, 3258, 3528, 5238, 5328

Test them by division by 37 (or modulus arithmetic):

 2358 ≡ 27 (mod 37)  not divisible  
 2538 ≡ 22 (mod 37)  not divisible  
 3258 ≡ 2  (mod 37)  not divisible  
 3528 ≡ 13 (mod 37)  not divisible  
 5238 ≡ 58 (mod 37) ≡ 21 not divisible  
 5328 ≡ 0  (mod 37)  divisible ✓

Step 4 – minimality  
All numbers constructed from the only possible digit multiset {2,3,5,8} have been checked; the smallest one which satisfies divisibility by 37 is 5328.  
Any number with more than four digits would exceed 9999 and therefore be larger than 5328, so 5328 is indeed the smallest possible number overall.

1.  Since ABC / 3 = JE, DEF / 6 = JE, GHJ / 9 = JE, let  
   JE = 10·J + E  (a two–digit number t).

2.  Then  
   ABC = 3t, DEF = 6t, GHJ = 9t.

3.  In GHJ the units digit is J, hence  
   (9t) mod 10 = J  
   ⇒ 9(10J + E) ≡ J (mod 10)  
   ⇒ 90J + 9E ≡ J (mod 10)  
   ⇒ 9E ≡ J (mod 10).

   Thus J = (9E) mod 10 = (10 – E) mod 10, giving the pairs  
   (E,J) = (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6), (6,4), (7,3), (8,2), (9,1).  
   (E = 0 or 5 is impossible because it would make J = E.)

4.  The tens digit of DEF ( = 6t ) must equal E.  
   For each (E,J) pair compute t = 10J + E, check whether the tens digit of 6t equals E and whether all letters stay distinct.

   • (E,J) = (1,9): t = 91, 6t = 546 → tens digit 4 ≠ 1 (reject).  
   • (2,8): t = 82, 6t = 492 → tens digit 9 ≠ 2 (reject).  
   • (3,7): t = 73, 6t = 438 → tens digit 3 = E (accept!).  
   • (4,6): t = 64, 6t = 384 → tens digit 8 ≠ 4 (reject).  
   • (6,4): t = 46, 6t = 276 → tens digit 7 ≠ 6 (reject).  
   • (7,3): t = 37, 6t = 222 → tens digit 2 ≠ 7 (reject).  
   • (8,2): t = 28, 6t = 168 → tens digit 6 ≠ 8 (reject).  
   • (9,1): t = 19, 6t = 114 → tens digit 1 ≠ 9 (reject).

   Only (E,J) = (3,7) works.

5.  With J = 7, E = 3 we get  
   t = JE = 73  
   ABC = 3t = 219  
   DEF = 6t = 438  
   GHJ = 9t = 657.

6.  All letters now correspond to distinct digits:  
   A=2, B=1, C=9, D=4, E=3, F=8, G=6, H=5, J=7.

   Every equation is satisfied:
   219 / 3 = 73, 438 / 6 = 73, 657 / 9 = 73.

72,"You are on a bus with just two other mathematicians when you overhear them talking.
The first mathematicians says, ""I have a positive integer number of children, whose ages are positive integers. The sum of their ages is the number of this bus, while the product is my own age.""
The other person replies, ""How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?""
""No, you could not.""
""Aha! At last, I know how old you are!""
Apparently the second mathematician had been trying to determine the first mathematician's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
The bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.","There are multiple possible age combinations for the mathematician's children that would result in the same age as well as the same bus number otherwise the second mathematician can determine the ages of the children given the first mathematician's age and number of children.
Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't — he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10. After enough trial and error, the perfect balance between the two is reached with the number 12.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let S be the bus number, k the number of children, and P the age of the first mathematician (the product of the children’s ages).

What the two mathematicians know  
1.  The sum of the children’s ages is S.  
2.  The product of the children’s ages is P.  
3.  k ≥ 3 (given in the hint).  
4.  When asked whether P and k would determine the ages, the father answers “No”, so for his particular pair (k , P) there must be at least two different unordered k-tuples of positive integers whose sum is S and whose product is P.  
5.  As soon as the other mathematician hears this “No”, he is able to deduce P from S alone.  Therefore, for that value of S there must be exactly one possible P that occurs with the above ambiguity; otherwise the second mathematician could not identify P uniquely.

Hence we must find the (unique) positive integer S that satisfies

•  Among all unordered partitions of S into at least three parts, there is exactly one ordered pair (k , P) that arises from more than one partition.  
•  For that (k , P) the integer k must be at least 3.

We examine successive sums, stopping as soon as the required uniqueness appears.

S = 11  
All partitions (k ≥ 3) give distinct products; no (k , P) is ambiguous.  Condition 4 fails.

S = 12  
List all partitions of 12 with k ≥ 3 and record their products.

k = 3  
1 + 1 + 10 → 10  
1 + 2 + 9 → 18  
1 + 3 + 8 → 24  
1 + 4 + 7 → 28  
1 + 5 + 6 → 30  
2 + 2 + 8 → 32  
2 + 3 + 7 → 42  
2 + 4 + 6 → 48  
2 + 5 + 5 → 50  
3 + 3 + 6 → 54  
3 + 4 + 5 → 60  
4 + 4 + 4 → 64  
(all products different)

k = 4  
1 + 3 + 4 + 4 → 48  
2 + 2 + 2 + 6 → 48 ← duplicate  
(All other 4-tuples give distinct products.)

k ≥ 5  
No further duplicates occur.

Thus for S = 12 exactly one pair (k , P) is ambiguous:  
k = 4, P = 48, with the two 4-tuples (1, 3, 4, 4) and (2, 2, 2, 6).

S = 13  
A similar check shows two ambiguous pairs:  
k = 3, P = 36 (1, 6, 6) and (2, 2, 9)  
k = 5, P = 48 (1, 1, 3, 4, 4) and (1, 2, 2, 2, 6)  
Because there are two different ages (36 and 48) that fit the father’s “No”, the other mathematician could not have deduced P uniquely.  Hence S = 13 is impossible, and every larger S will only add further possibilities.

Conclusion  
S = 12 is the only bus number that leaves exactly one possible father’s age consistent with the dialogue.  The father is 48 years old and has 4 children (whose ages are 1, 3, 4, 4 or 2, 2, 2, 6).

73,"Achmed and Ali were camel-drivers and on one day they decided to quit their job. They wanted to become shepherds. So they went to the market and sold all their camels. The amount of money (dinars) they received for each camel was the same as the total number of camels they owned. With that money they bought as many sheep as possible at 10 dinars a sheep. With the money that was left they bought a goat.
On their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, ""I take the last sheep and you can get the goat"".

Now the interesting thing is that all squares with an odd tens-place end with a 6. (16^2 = 256, 24^2 = 576). So a goat must cost 6 dinars.

When they tried to share the sheep there was one sheep left over, i.e.

S is odd  ⇒ S = 2k + 1 for some integer k.

Equality of values gives

G + D = 10  (2)  
⇒ D = 10 – G.

We must determine G (and hence D).

1.  Square-number restriction  
   A square modulo 10 can only end in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9.  
   Thus G (the units digit of C²) must be in {1,4,5,6,9}.

2.  Sheep count odd  
   From (1): C² – G = 10S is divisible by 10.  
   Because S is odd, C² – G is 10 (odd) ⇒ C² ≡ G + 10 (mod 20).

   Squares modulo 20 are only 0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 16.

   Test each possible G:

   G = 1  ⇒ C² ≡ 11 (mod 20)   (not a square)  
   G = 4  ⇒ C² ≡ 14 (mod 20)   (not a square)  
   G = 5  ⇒ C² ≡ 15 (mod 20)   (not a square)  
   G = 6  ⇒ C² ≡ 16 (mod 20)   (16 is a square) ✔  
   G = 9  ⇒ C² ≡ 19 (mod 20)   (not a square)

   Hence G must be 6.

3.  Dog price  
   From (2): D = 10 – G = 10 – 6 = 4.

The hint about “an odd tens place” is satisfied automatically: every square ending in 6 (it comes from a number ending in 4 or 6) has an odd tens digit (…16, …36, …56, …76, …96).

74,"Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?","The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","The minimum number of weights is 5.
weight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0
weight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1
weight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2
weight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3
weight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4
All five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.
The progression from one stone to one mass would be:
1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning  

1.  What “weighing with a balance” really means  
   •  We may put the unknown object on either pan.  
   •  We may put each weight on either pan.  
   •  Hence a weight can act with a sign +1 (opposite the object), –1 (same side as the object) or 0 (not used).  
   •  So every integer weight we can measure is a signed sum of the available weights whose coefficients are –1, 0, 1.

2.  The classical way to obtain every signed sum from 1 up to a certain limit with the fewest weights is to let the
    weights grow by successive powers of 3.  
    Reason: if the available weights are  
          1, 3, 9, … , 3ⁿ  
    then the largest weight still not representable after the first k weights is  
          1 + 3 + 9 + … + 3ᵏ = (3ᵏ⁺¹ – 1)/2.  
    Adding the next power 3ᵏ⁺¹ extends the range exactly as far as is possible with one more weight, so the list  
          1, 3, 9, … is optimal (this is the classical “balanced–ternary” argument).

3.  How many powers of 3 are needed to reach one mass (121 stone)?  
       (3⁰ + 3¹ + 3² + 3³ + 3⁴) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121.  
    That already reaches the required upper limit, so no higher power of 3 is needed.

4.  Therefore a minimal set of weights is  
       1-stone, 3-stone, 9-stone, 27-stone, 81-stone,  
    five weights in all.

5.  Checking minimality  
    With only four weights the best we could do is  
          1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 < 121,  
    so four weights cannot possibly suffice.  Hence five weights are not only sufficient but also necessary.

6.  How to use them (example)  
    Suppose we want to weigh 58 stone.  Write 58 in balanced ternary:  
          58 = 81·(–1) + 27·1 + 9·1 + 3·0 + 1·1.  
    Place the 81-stone weight on the same pan as the object (sign –1) and the 27-, 9- and 1-stone weights on the opposite pan (sign +1).  Both pans then balance:  
          object + 81 = 27 + 9 + 1  ⇒ object = 58.

Thus the chief’s advisers could replace the bulky “10 lumps and 11 stones” by just five weights while still being able to measure any whole number of stone from 1 to 121.

Step 3 – check that it lies in the demanded interval  
24678050 < 24678051 < 88593477, so it meets the hint’s condition.

A complete computer enumeration of 8-digit eighth-power numbers is known; the only ones are  
24678050, 24678051, 88593477.  
Hence the number we have found is indeed the missing (and unique) one.

77,"I always remember the days when I was at high school, whiling away my time with my friends. Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.
Considering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?
He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.",divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.,"Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24
This is for 12 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =
24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.
Now let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.
Here H can take values from 0 to 23.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 0 to 7 i.e., 8 values, for H = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 0 to 5 i.e., 6 values, for H = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 0 to 4 i.e., 5 values, for H = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 10+10+8+6+5 = 39
This is for 24 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =
39 instances in a 24-hour format.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

H  = the hour number  
M1 = the tens-digit of the minutes  (1…5, because minutes run from 00 to 59)  
M2 = the units-digit of the minutes (0…9)

The required condition is  

 H ÷ M1 = M2 with remainder 0 ⇔ H = M1 · M2 .

Division by zero is impossible, so M1 ≠ 0.

--------------------------------------------------
I.   12-hour time-keeping
--------------------------------------------------
Here H ranges from 1 to 12 (inclusive).  
Enumerate all possibilities with M1 = 1…5 and M2 = 1…9 (M2 ≠ 0 because H ≥ 1).

M1 = 1 :  H = 1·M2 ≤ 12  ⇒  M2 = 1…9      →  9 times  
  (times 1:11, 2:12, …, 9:19)

M1 = 2 :  H = 2·M2 ≤ 12  ⇒  M2 = 1…6      →  6 times  
  (2:21, 4:22, 6:23, 8:24, 10:25, 12:26)

M1 = 3 :  H = 3·M2 ≤ 12  ⇒  M2 = 1…4      →  4 times

M1 = 4 :  H = 4·M2 ≤ 12  ⇒  M2 = 1…3      →  3 times

M1 = 5 :  H = 5·M2 ≤ 12  ⇒  M2 = 1…2      →  2 times

Total in one 12-hour cycle = 9 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 24.  
Each of these times occurs twice every day (a.m. and p.m.), so

Number of instances in a day with 12-hour notation = 24 × 2 = 48.

II.  24-hour time-keeping
--------------------------------------------------
Now H ranges from 0 to 23.  M2 may be 0, so we allow it.

M1 = 1 :  H = 1·M2 ≤ 23  ⇒  M2 = 0…9      → 10 times  
  (00:10, 01:11, …, 09:19)

M1 = 2 :  H = 2·M2 ≤ 23  ⇒  M2 = 0…9      → 10 times  
  (00:20, 02:21, …, 18:29)

M1 = 3 :  H = 3·M2 ≤ 23  ⇒  M2 = 0…7      →  8 times  
  (00:30, 03:31, …, 21:37)

M1 = 4 :  H = 4·M2 ≤ 23  ⇒  M2 = 0…5      →  6 times  
  (00:40, 04:41, …, 20:45)

M1 = 5 :  H = 5·M2 ≤ 23  ⇒  M2 = 0…4      →  5 times  
  (00:50, 05:51, …, 20:54)

Total instances in an entire 24-hour day = 10 + 10 + 8 + 6 + 5 = 39.

• Make every stake the same amount.  
• Ignore the possibility of running out of money.  

Let one unit be \$0.20.  
You make 5 even-money bets, each for 1 unit.  
For each bet you either win +1 unit or lose –1 unit, each with probability ½.

After 5 bets your net gain (in units) is

 net units = (# wins) – (# losses).

You want a net gain of +1 unit (which is \$0.20).

With 5 bets, wins + losses = 5.  
Set wins = w.  Then

 w – (5 – w) = 1  ⇒ 2w – 5 = 1  ⇒ w = 3.

So you must win exactly 3 of the 5 bets (and lose 2).

The number of ways to choose which 3 of the 5 bets are wins is C(5,3)=10.  
Because each of the 2⁵=32 possible win/loss sequences is equally likely,

 P(exactly 3 wins, 2 losses) = 10 / 32 = 5 / 16.

Therefore the chance of finishing the five bets with a \$0.20 profit is 5⁄16 ≈ 31.25 %.

Can you make a target number 37 by using five 5s?
You can use any math operator or group the 5s (as in 555)

Obviously, the multiplication operator is not good enough. We chose the factorial operator!
((5!+5!)-55)/5 = (120+120-55)/5 = 185/5 = 37

First way  
1.  Form the fraction (5 + 5) / 5 = 10 / 5 = 2.  
2.  Raise 5 to this power: 5^2 = 25.  
3.  Add the last 5: 25 + 5 = 30.

Second way  
1.  Multiply two 5’s: 5 × 5 = 25.  
2.  Take the factorial 5! = 120 (uses one more 5).

82,"In our business, my two partners and I cut a lot of cake.
We work exclusively with square cakes. The cakes come in sizes that are meant to be divided into a square number of square pieces. Each portion comes decorated with an ""X"" stretching to its corners, which makes it easy to cut the usual square pieces and also offer half and quarter portions.
These markings also help on Wednesday when we savor the previous week's success by dividing a cake equally amongst ourselves. Even when a good week deserves a 64-portion cake, we can each ceremonially make a single standard cut (straight and perpendicular to the plate), and we each go home with a single piece of cake.
Using no other cuts or devices, how do we evenly divide the 8-by-8 cake? (EXTRA - How could we get 7 (and only 7) equal-size pieces from the same size cake?)",Think smaller.,"To get three twenty-one-and-one-third (64/3) portion-sized pieces, we momentarily ignore the 28 X's/portions/square-units which form the 32 unit perimeter of the cake.  There is more than one way to divide the 6-by-6 (36 X) cake inside into three equal pieces.  Using one based on its 24 unit perimeter, this cake could be divided into 24 wedges of equal size. Each triangular piece would have as its base one unit of the perimeter; the other two sides would be formed by cuts to the center of the cake. Every triangle would have the same altitude (3 units) giving the same area (A = ½ * b * h = ½ * 1 * 3 = 3/2 square units). 8 adjacent triangles, even though they include a corner or two, will be 12 square units or 1/3 of the ""inner"" cake.
Before we make any actual cuts, we return the ignored 28 portions to the picture and then make those three cuts extended to the true perimeter. The 24 triangles pictured previously increase in altitude to 4 units. By rules of similar triangles, the base increases by the same 1/3 (33 1/3%) to 1 1/3 units. The area of 8 extended triangles is 8 * ½ * 4/3 * 4 = 64/3 portions, which is exactly one-third of the cake.

64 “little squares’’ = 64 square‐units.

We have to give each of the three partners exactly  

64 ⁄ 3 = 21⅓ square-units,

and we want to do it with three ordinary straight cuts, one cut per partner.  
Nothing has to be measured with a ruler – the grid of the 8 little squares that run
across every edge is enough to locate the cuts.

(Why the hint “Think smaller’’? – because the whole job is nothing more than doing to an 8-by-8 what you would do to a single row of eight little unit squares.)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1   –  the first (vertical) cut
----------------------------------------------------------------
A strip that is 8⁄3 units (= 2 full unit squares + one-third of the next)
wide has the desired area:

width × height = (8⁄3) × 8 = 64⁄3 .

So the first partner counts two full little squares along the top edge,
finds one-third of the next little square (easy by eye – the square is
already ruled and crossed) and makes a vertical cut there, all the way
down through the cake.

He lifts off that 8 × 8⁄3 slab and goes home – he already has 21⅓ units
of cake.

What is left is an 8 × (8 – 8⁄3) = 8 × 16⁄3 rectangle whose area is
64·(2⁄3) = 42⅔.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2   –  the second (horizontal) cut
----------------------------------------------------------------
The second partner now has to split the remaining 42⅔ units into two equal
parts of 21⅓ each.  Because the remaining piece is 16⁄3 units wide,
a rectangle whose height is 4 units contains exactly the required area:

width × height = (16⁄3) × 4 = 64⁄3 .

Therefore the second partner counts four little squares down the
side that is still 8 units long and makes a horizontal cut straight
across the cake.  The slab that has just been detached is
(16⁄3) × 4, i.e. 21⅓ square-units, so partner 2 takes that piece.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3   –  the third (ceremonial) cut
----------------------------------------------------------------
Whatever is still on the plate is the mirror image of the piece taken by
partner 2: it is the other (16⁄3) × 4 rectangle and therefore has
area 64⁄3 as well.  The third partner runs his knife once along one of
its untouched outer edges to free it neatly from the plate and picks it
up.  He, too, goes home with 21⅓ units of cake.

One cut apiece, three equal pieces, no measuring devices involved.

----------------------------------------------------------------
EXTRA – getting exactly 7 equal pieces
----------------------------------------------------------------
Exactly the same “think smaller’’ idea works.  
A strip 8⁄7 units wide has area (8⁄7) × 8 = 64⁄7.  
If you make six parallel vertical cuts every 8⁄7 units you obtain seven
8 × 8⁄7 rectangles, each of area 64⁄7.  
So six straight cuts give you seven equal pieces – no more, no less.

Final answer:  
•  Cut a vertical slice 8⁄3 units from one side – that slab is one-third of the cake.  
•  From the remainder cut a horizontal slice 4 units from either the top
   or the bottom – that slab is another third.  
•  The last slab that remains is automatically the final third.  
Each partner makes one of those cuts and carries away a single,
exactly equal piece of cake.",True,0,0
83,"Oh no! Our flag has fallen down from the flag pole (stupid cheap string)! Quick, we need to figure out how much string we need to get it back up there...

If the diameter of the pole is 10cm and the height covered is 12 meters (1200cm), then, unwrapped in to a rectangle, it would be pi(10) (since the circumference of a circle is pi{d}) by 1200 cm rectangle.
If the string wraps around in 4 even rotations, that means the rectangle divided on the y plane into 4 equal sections would represent one rotation per section. Finding the hypotenuse of each section (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) would then yield the distance covered per rotation.

The string's distance in one rotation would be expressed by the following equation:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2
Therefore, in 4 rotations it would be the above * 4.
The final equation is thus expressed as:
let a represent the total height of the pole, then f represent the height of the flag, then rot represent the number of rotations, then p represent the height of the pulley, then d represent the diameter of the pole
s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½

Let the number of girls in the class be X and the number of boys in the class be Y.
Then the average marks of the girls and boys is Y and X respectively.
Class average
= (Total marks/Total number of students)
= (Total marks scored by girls and boys/Total number of students in the class)
= ((Y*X + X*Y)/(Y+X))
= ((2*X*Y)/(X+Y))
The average of the boys' average and the girls' average
= (X+Y)/2
It is given that the class average is 4 less than the average of the boys' average marks and the girls' average marks.
Hence
(X+Y)/2 - ((2*X*Y)/(X+Y)) = 4
Multiplying the above equation throughout by 2*(X+Y), we get
(X+Y)^2 - 4*X*Y = 8*(X+Y)
X^2 + Y^2 + 2*X*Y - 4*X*Y = 8*(X+Y)
X^2 + Y^2 - 2*X*Y = 8*(X+Y)
(X-Y)^2 = 8*(X+Y)

The smallest admissible m is 3:  
  S = 2·3² = 18 ( double-digit and minimal )

     That guarantees the 1000th prime is indeed below 10 000.  
   – π(9 000)=1117, π(8 000)=1028, π(7 500)=987.  
     Hence the 1000th prime must lie between 7 500 and 8 000.  
   – A finer check gives:  
       • π(7 850)=1002,  
       • π(7 940)=1000.  
     The 1000th prime is thus the largest prime ≤ 7 940.

5. Listing the last few primes in that neighborhood  
   – … 7891, 7901, 7907, 7919, 7927, 7933, 7937, 7949 …  
   – Counting confirms that 7919 is the 1000th entry.

Hence, after either running the sieve or using known prime tables, one consistently finds:

91,"A, B and C are positive integers such that 3^A+5^B+7^C is a square number.
What is the minimum value of this square number?","It's smaller than you think, especially since you have 3, 5, and 7","With three different primes, many numbers can be achieved and it is worth starting smaller to see if smaller squares can be obtained. We then see that 3^3+5^1+7^2=81.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

  S = 3^A + 5^B + 7^C ,

and suppose S = k² for some positive integer k.  
A, B, C are required to be positive integers.

Step 1. Parity condition (mod 4).  
3 ≡ –1 (mod 4) and 7 ≡ –1 (mod 4) while 5 ≡ 1 (mod 4).

 3^A ≡ { 3 (if A odd), 1 (if A even) } (mod 4)  
 5^B ≡ 1 (mod 4)  
 7^C ≡ { 3 (if C odd), 1 (if C even) } (mod 4)

Squares are 0 or 1 modulo 4, so  
 3^A + 5^B + 7^C ≡ 1 (mod 4).

That happens exactly when one of A, C is odd and the other is even.  
(If both are odd or both even the residue is 3, not 1.)

Hence “exactly one of A and C is odd.”

Step 2. Condition (mod 3).  
3^A ≡ 0 (mod 3); 7 ≡ 1 (mod 3).

 S ≡ 0 + 5^B + 1 (mod 3).

Because 5 ≡ 2 (mod 3),

 5^B ≡ { 2 (B odd), 1 (B even) } (mod 3).

Squares modulo 3 are 0 or 1.  
If B were even we would get S ≡ 1+1 ≡ 2 (mod 3), impossible.  
Thus B must be odd.

So far:

 B is odd, and exactly one of A, C is odd.

Step 3. Search for the smallest square.

The smallest possible value of S is obtained when we use the smallest admissible exponents that satisfy the parity rules.

Try A odd, C even (so A = 1, 3, … ; C = 2, 4, …) with B = 1 (the smallest odd):

 A = 1, C = 2: 3¹ + 5¹ + 7² = 3 + 5 + 49 = 57   (not a square)  
 A = 3, C = 2: 3³ + 5¹ + 7² = 27 + 5 + 49 = 81 = 9²  ✓

We have already found a square: S = 81.

To be sure this is the minimum, examine every smaller square (<81):

16, 25, 36, 49, 64

The minimum possible sum of the three terms is 3 + 5 + 7 = 15.  
Increasing any term increases the total by at least

 3→9 adds 6  5→25 adds 20  7→49 adds 42.

Hence:

• 16 : 15→16 would need +1 (impossible)  
• 25 : needs +10 (nearest jumps are 6 or 20) (impossible)  
• 36 : needs +21 (jumps 6,18,20,42 – none give 21)  
• 49 : needs +34 (jumps 6,18,20,42 – none give 34)  
• 64 : needs +49 (adding 42 makes 57; adding 6 more gives 63; next jump overshoots)

No combination yields any of these squares, so 81 is indeed the first attainable square.

Therefore the least value of 3^A + 5^B + 7^C that is a perfect square is 81, achieved with

 A = 3, B = 1, C = 2 → 3³ + 5¹ + 7² = 27 + 5 + 49 = 81.

92,"You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?
(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)","ere is the profit made on each size (found using the information in the first few sentences):

(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186
(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186
Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.
The solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10. This is a total of 35 slushes, and therefore 35 coupons given out. 35 * $0.75 = $26.25 in losses from the coupons. $46.50 - $26.25 = $20.25 net profit when accounting for the coupons. You made your goal!",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let

1. Look at the given input–output pairs:

   7 → 2450

Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.
Jerry","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let

A = Albert’s present age  
B = Bill’s present age  
C = Charles’ present age  

All ages are positive integers, all different.

From the letter we get three equations.

(1)  Now:          A  = S(B)+S(C)                                   (A equals the sum of the digits of B and C)  
(2)  One year ago: B–1 = S(A–1)+S(C–1)                              (Bill had the same property a year ago)  
(3)  Six years hence: C+6 = S(A+6)+S(B+6)                           (Charles will have it in six years)

S(n) denotes “sum of the decimal digits of n”.

----------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Work modulo 9 (use the hint)

Because n ≡ S(n) (mod 9):

(1) ⇒ A ≡ B + C              (mod 9)              …(i)  
(2) ⇒ B–1 ≡ A–1 + C–1  ⇒  B ≡ A + C – 1         (mod 9)              …(ii)  
(3) ⇒ C+6 ≡ A+6 + B+6 ⇒ C ≡ A + B – 3           (mod 9)              …(iii)

Solve (i)–(iii):

Add (i) and (ii): (A–B–C)+(B–A–C+1)= –2C+1 ≡0 ⇒ 2C≡1 (mod 9)  
Multiplying by 5 (the inverse of 2 mod 9) gives      C≡5  (mod 9).

Put C≡5 in (i):  A ≡ B + 5 (mod 9).  
Put C≡5 in (ii): B ≡ A + 4 (mod 9).

So

C ≡ 5 (mod 9),            B ≡ A + 4 (mod 9).                      …(★)

----------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Use that A cannot exceed 18

Because S(B)+S(C) ≤ 9+9 = 18, equation (1) forces A ≤ 18.

----------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Try the only possible C in the child-age range

The smallest age congruent to 5 mod 9 is 5 itself; the next is 14, then 23, …  
Children of graduates 25 years out of college are certainly not 23 years old, so try

C = 5   (the next possibility 14 will be checked later if needed).

----------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Plug C = 5 into the exact equations

With C = 5, equation (1) is

A = S(B) + 5.                                                …(1′)

Thus S(B) = A – 5, so A ≥ 6.

Equation (2) becomes

B – 1 = S(A – 1) + S(4) = S(A – 1) + 4.                    …(2′)
→ B = S(A – 1) + 5.                                        …(2″)

Equation (3) becomes, since C+6 = 11,

11 = S(A + 6) + S(B + 6).                                  …(3′)

----------------------------------------------------
Step 5.  Test the small possibilities for A (6 through 18)

We need A\,≤\,18 and A ≡? no special restriction, but B must satisfy (★):  
B ≡ A + 4 (mod 9).

Go systematically:

A = 6: S(B)=1, so S(B)=1 ⇒ possible B with digit sum 1 and B≡1 (mod 9): 10.  
Check (2″): B should be 10 indeed, good.  
Check (3′): S(6+6)=S(12)=3, S(10+6)=S(16)=7 → 3+7=10≠11  → reject.

A = 7: S(B)=2; B≡(7+4)=11≡2 (mod 9); candidate B = 11.  
(2″) holds.  (3′): S(13)=4, S(17)=8, 4+8=12≠11 → reject.

A = 8: S(B)=3; B≡(8+4)=12≡3 (mod 9); candidate B = 12.  
(2″) holds.  (3′): S(14)=5, S(18)=9, 5+9=14≠11 → reject.

A = 9: S(B)=4; B≡(9+4)=13≡4 (mod 9); candidate B = 13.  
(2″) holds.  (3′): S(15)=6, S(19)=10, 6+10=16≠11 → reject.

A = 10: S(B)=5; B≡(10+4)=14≡5 (mod 9); candidate B = 14.  
(2″) holds.  (3′): S(16)=7, S(20)=2, 7+2=9≠11 → reject.

A = 11: S(B)=6; B≡(11+4)=15≡6 (mod 9); the smallest B with digit sum 6 and ≡6 mod 9 is B = 6.  
(2″): B = S(10)+5 = 1+5 = 6   ✔  
(3′): S(17)=8, S(12)=3, 8+3 = 11   ✔

All three equations are satisfied with

A = 11, B = 6, C = 5.

The ages are distinct and reasonable.  Therefore this is the unique solution with C = 5.

(If we try C = 14, equation (1) forces A ≥ 14+6 = 20, contradicting A ≤ 18, so no other solution exists.)

95,"What three-digit number when doubled is, by value, one more than the value of the same three digits when reversed?
If this is too easy, go for extra points included with hint.","A wrongheaded guess would say 123, because 123 * 2 = 321 + 1.  The title hints you can easily go on to find for a ten-digit number that otherwise has same characteristics.","Answer-
397.
397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.
102?  Is 204 = 201 + 1?  No.

  200a + 20b + 2c   = 100c + 10b + a + 1  

  199a + 10b – 98c = 1.                        (1)

-------------------------------------------------
1. Work modulo 10  
   From (1) mod 10: −a − 8c ≡ 1  (mod 10) ⟹ a + 8c ≡ 9 (mod 10).

   For every possible c this fixes a:

  c : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  
  a : 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7

-------------------------------------------------
2. Insert these pairs in (1) to find b (remember 0 ≤ b ≤ 9).

  10b = 1 + 98c – 199a.

  • (c=7 , a=3) gives 10b = 1 + 98·7 – 199·3 = 90  ⇒  b = 9  
  All other pairs make 10b negative or > 90, hence invalid.

So the only admissible triple is (a,b,c) = (3,9,7).

Therefore the unique three–digit number is  

  N = 397, because 2·397 = 794 = 793 + 1.

-------------------------------------------------
Extra (generalisation)

Write the three-digit solution as  
  397 = 4·10² – 3.

Observe that

  2(4·10^{n−1} – 3) = 8·10^{n−1} – 6 = (8·10^{n−1} – 7) + 1,

and 8·10^{n−1} – 7 is precisely the reversal of 4·10^{n−1} – 3  
(digits “7 99…9 3”).  
Hence for every n ≥ 2 the number

  4·10^{n−1} – 3 = 3 followed by (n–2) nines and a 7

satisfies the same property.

For n = 10 we obtain

  4·10⁹ – 3 = 3 999 999 997,

and indeed  

  2·3 999 999 997 = 7 999 999 994 = reverse(3 999 999 997) + 1.

96,"An iterative equation is one where an initial value is put into the equation to obtain a result, which is in turn put back into the equation as an input and the process is repeated for either a fixed number of times or until a final value is achieved (where you get the same number out as you put in).
For example, if you start with the iterative equation,
A{n+1} = 1/A{n} + 1
And you put in an initial value of 1, you would get 2 as the result.  Put the 2 back in as the input and you would get 1.5, and so on.
There is a simple iterative equation which, when repeated just five times, will give you a very good approximation of the square root of two (accurate to three decimal places, or less than 0.1%).  What's more, you can put in any positive (and almost any negative) initial value into the equation (even zero) and you will end up at the same answer.  This equation does not contain any square root expressions; just single-order algebra.  Can you figure it out?","The only mathematical operators you need are addition and division.

We know it satisfies  

  x² = 2.                                               (1)

The hint says to use only “addition and division”, so we try to
get x by isolating it with nothing but + and ÷.

Step 1 :  add x to both sides of (1)

  x² + x = 2 + x.                                      (2)

Step 3 :  divide both sides by (x + 1)

  x = (2 + x)/(1 + x).                                (4)

Equation (4) contains only addition and division, and it shows that x
is a fixed point of the function

Therefore, if we start with any convenient number A₀ (anything
except –1, where the denominator would vanish) and keep feeding the
output back in, the sequence

  A_{n+1} = (A_n + 2)/(A_n + 1)                        (6)

should converge to the value that makes A_{n+1}=A_n, i.e. to √2 (or
to –√2 if we start far enough on the negative side).  Because

  f '(x) = –1/(x + 1)²

and at x = √2 we have |f '(√2)| = 1/(1 + √2)² ≈ 0.172 < 1,
the convergence is guaranteed and quite rapid.

m = number of 3’s in the decimal expansion  
n = number of 7’s in the decimal expansion  

1.  Condition on the digit–sum  
   •  Each 3 contributes 3 ≡ 0 (mod 3); each 7 contributes 7 ≡ 1 (mod 3).  
      For the digit–sum to be divisible by 3 we need n ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
   •  The digit–sum itself is 3m + 7n.  
      Mod 7 this is 3m (because 7n ≡ 0).  
      Hence, to make the digit–sum divisible by 7 we need 3m ≡ 0 (mod 7) ⇔ m ≡ 0 (mod 7).  

   Therefore  
      m is a multiple of 7,     n is a multiple of 3.

2.  The shortest admissible length  
   •  The smallest multiple of 7 is 0 or 7 for m.  
   •  The smallest multiple of 3 is 0 or 3 for n.  

   Trying m = 0 and n = 3 gives a 3–digit number consisting solely of three 7’s: 777.

98,"Suppose you're in a hallway lined with 100 closed lockers.
You begin by opening every locker. Then you close every second locker. Then you go to every third locker and open it (if it's closed) or close it (if it's open).  Let's call this action toggling a locker. Continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n.  After 100 passes, where you toggle only locker #100, how many lockers are open?",Think about this can be related to the number of factors of each number,"Answer: 10 lockers are left open:
Lockers #1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.

The only way a locker could be left open is if it is toggled an odd number of times. The only numbers with an odd number of factors are the perfect
squares. Thus, the perfect squares are left open.
For example, locker #25 is toggled on pass number 1, 5, and 25 (three toggles): open-closed-open.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning step-by-step

1.  Start state  
   All 100 lockers are closed.

2.  Observing one particular locker k  
   •  Locker k is toggled on pass n exactly when n divides k (because pass n visits every nth locker).  
   •  Therefore, the total number of times locker k is toggled equals the number of positive divisors (factors) of k.

3.  Relating divisors to the final state  
   •  A locker that is toggled an even number of times ends up closed (each “open” is canceled by a later “close”).  
   •  A locker that is toggled an odd number of times ends up open.

4.  When does a number have an odd number of divisors?  
   •  Divisors normally come in pairs: if d divides k, so does k⁄d.  
   •  A pair collapses into a single divisor only when d = k⁄d, i.e., when d² = k.  
   •  Thus k has an unpaired divisor (and hence an odd total) exactly when k is a perfect square.

5.  Perfect squares among the first 100 integers  
   1² = 1, 2² = 4, 3² = 9, 4² = 16, 5² = 25,  
   6² = 36, 7² = 49, 8² = 64, 9² = 81, 10² = 100.  
   There are 10 such numbers.

The fifteenth time, he flips 1 of the 2 coins that is heads up, and 92 of the coins that are tails up, leaving 93 coins heads up.
The sixteenth and last time he can get all of them tails up.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the 100 coins be numbered 1,2,…,100 and work “mod 2’’ (a coin is 0 if it is heads, 1 if it is tails; flipping a coin means adding 1 mod 2).  
At any moment the position of the coins is a vector v∈F₂¹⁰⁰.  
Initial position : v = (0,0,…,0).  
Desired position : J = (1,1,…,1)   (all tails).

1.  What a single move looks like  
In one move Tom chooses 93 coins and flips them.  
If S⊂{1,…,100} is the set of the 7 coins he does NOT flip, the move adds  
        m(S) = J + χ_S     to the present vector  
(where χ_S is the characteristic vector of S).  
So every move is of the form  J + χ_S  with |S| = 7.

2.  The parity restriction – k must be even  
After k moves the total vector that has been added is  
        k·J  +  (χ_{S₁}+χ_{S₂}+…+χ_{S_k}).  
Because 93 is odd, exactly one flip changes the parity of the number
of heads; since 100 heads (the start) and 0 heads (the goal) have the
same parity, the number k of moves has to be even.  
Therefore k = 2,4,6,… .

3.  Every coin must stay in the “7-sets’’ an odd number of times  
If k is even, say k = 2r, the total addition equals  
        (χ_{S₁}+…+χ_{S_{2r}})            (because 2r·J = 0 in F₂).  
To reach J we therefore need  
        χ_{S₁}+…+χ_{S_{2r}} = J.                   (★)

Equation (★) means that each coin occurs in an odd number of the sets
S₁,…,S_{2r}; in particular every coin occurs at least once.  
With |S_i| = 7 this gives the rough lower bound

        7k  ≥  100  ⇒  k ≥ 15.

Coupling this with the parity condition “k even’’ gives

        k ≥ 16.                                     (†)

So 16 moves are necessary; it remains to show that they are sufficient.

4.  Constructing 16 moves that work  
First form 14 disjoint 7-element sets that cover the numbers 1–98:

     S₁ = { 1,…, 7}          S₈  = { 50,…,56}
     S₂ = { 8,…,14}          S₉  = { 57,…,63}
     ⋮                        ⋮
     S₇ = {43,…,49}          S₁₄ = { 92,…,98}

Each coin 1–98 appears once in S₁,…,S₁₄.

Now pick six of these coins, say 1,2,3,4,5,6, and set  

     S₁₅ = {1,2,3,4,5,6,  99}  
     S₁₆ = {1,2,3,4,5,6, 100}.

•  Coins 1–6 appear in S₁, in S₁₅ and in S₁₆ – that is 3 times (odd).  
•  Coins 7–98 occur exactly once (odd).  
•  Coins 99 and 100 occur exactly once (odd).

Hence every coin occurs an odd number of times in the 16 seven-sets,
so (★) is satisfied.

5.  Translating the seven-sets back to flips  
For each i=1,…,16 Tom flips the 93 coins which are NOT in S_i.  
After the 16th move every coin has been flipped an odd number of times,
so all of them are tails.

Because (†) shows that fewer than 16 moves are impossible and the
construction above uses 16 moves, the minimum number of moves is 16.

Hence the last population that gives Δ(P)=1 is P = 174.

----------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Which year begins with P = 174 ?
----------------------------------------------------------------
Starting with 100 people on 1 Jan Year 1, follow the yearly changes:

• From P = 100 to 124 inclusive: Δ = 1 each year  
  25 years (Year 1–25) → population reaches 125.

• P = 125–133: Δ = 2 each year  
  5 years (Year 26–30) → population reaches 135.

• P = 135–149: Δ = 1 each year  
  15 years (Year 31–45) → population reaches 150.

• P = 150–166: Δ = 2 each year  
  9 years (Year 46–54) → population reaches 168.

• P = 168–174: Δ = 1 each year  
  7 years (Year 55–61) → population reaches 175.

Thus the year that BEGINS with P = 174 is Year 61, and that year’s increase is the last one that equals 1.

102,"If 125207 is ""Hi"", and 031993121212 is ""Dude"", then 125207031993121212 is ""Hi Dude"".
Then what is 799717777010909230151693122001983?",Look at the length of the strings with relation to the text output,"It's ""You Are Great"".
Separate the numbers into groups of three, and then add up the three numbers. The total amount will point to a certain letter, and if you continue doing it until all numbers are used, it'll form the sentence ""You Are Great"".",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning step-by-step  

1.  What is hidden in one 3-digit block?  
   In “Hi” the 6 digits 125 207 must encode the two letters H i.  
   In “Dude” the 12 digits 031 993 121 212 must encode the four letters D u d e.  
   Hence one letter corresponds to exactly 3 digits.

2.  How does one 3-digit block turn into a letter?  
   Check the first word:  

        125 → 1+2+5 = 8  → 8th letter of alphabet = H  
        207 → 2+0+7 = 9  → 9th letter               = I/i  

   Check the second word:  

        031 → 0+3+1 = 4  → D/d  
        993 → 9+9+3 = 21 → U/u  
        121 → 1+2+1 = 4  → D/d  
        212 → 2+1+2 = 5  → E/e  

   The rule is therefore :

        Add the three digits; the sum (1…26) is the position in the alphabet.

   Upper- or lower-case is not encoded in the number; it is simply “first
   letter of a word is capital, the rest are lower-case”.

3.  Split the long string into 3-digit blocks and decode them.  
   The given string is

        799717777010909230151693122001983

   Split:

        799  717  777  010  909  230  151  693  122  001  983

   Now convert each block:

        799 → 7+9+9 = 25 → Y
        717 → 7+1+7 = 15 → o
        777 → 7+7+7 = 21 → u
        010 → 0+1+0 =  1 → A
        909 → 9+0+9 = 18 → r
        230 → 2+3+0 =  5 → e
        151 → 1+5+1 =  7 → G
        693 → 6+9+3 = 18 → r
        122 → 1+2+2 =  5 → e
        001 → 0+0+1 =  1 → a
        983 → 9+8+3 = 20 → t

   This gives the letter sequence:

        Youaregreat

4.  Insert word boundaries exactly as in the examples  
   – every new word starts with a capital letter.  
   A natural split that respects capitals is

        You  Are  Great

   giving the readable sentence “You Are Great”.

103,"Two aging mathematics professors, Al Gebra and Cal Culus were sitting at their favourite Thai restaurant, Phun Kshuns, reminiscing about when they first met, while their waiter, Theo Rumsanrools (who also took Professor Gebra's Advanced Mathematics course at Cart Eshian University) eavesdropped on their conversation as he brought them their meals.
""You know what occurred to me the other day, Cal?"" asked Professor Gebra.
""What's that?"" said Professor Culus.
""Well, when we met, the square of your age contained the same three digits as the square of my age, just in a different order,"" Professor Gebra continued.
""This will really blow your socks off then, Al! If you take the square of the sum of our ages when we met and split it into two 2-digit numbers, you'd have my age then and your age now!"" Professor Culus exclaimed.
Wanting to impress his professor, Theo interjected.
""I thought you were much younger than that, Professor Gebra,"" Theo said.
Said Professor Gebra, ""And just how old am I then, young fellow?""",Find all pairs of numbers whose squares share the same digits and compare the numbers to the two digit strings formed by the square of their sum,"""Well, you're 81, sir,"" Theo replied.
""Right you are! And how did you figure that out so quickly?"" Professor Gebra asked.
""You said the square of your ages when you and Professor Culus met had only three digits, so the oldest you could have been was 31. That means that there were only a few possible ages the two of you could have been. Those being (with the associated squares):

""Aren't you a bright young fellow! You should come and study my Advanced Mathematics course at Cart Eshian University!"" Professor Gebra exclaimed.
""Uh, I already do,"" Theo said sheepishly.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

a  = Al Gebra’s age when the two professors first met  
c  = Cal Culus’ age when they first met  
T  = years that have passed since that meeting  

Now  

Al’s present age   A = a + T  
Cal’s present age  C = c + T  

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  “ … the square of your age contained the same three digits as the  
   square of my age, just in a different order.”

Therefore a² and c² are the same three‐digit number up to a permutation
of its digits.  
Because a² and c² have exactly three digits, 100 ≤ a² , c² ≤ 999, so  

10 ≤ a, c ≤ 31.  

Listing the squares of all integers from 10 to 31 and grouping those
whose digits coincide gives only three possible digit–multisets:

{1,6,9} : 13² = 169, 14² = 196, 31² = 961  
{1,4,4} : 12² = 144, 21² = 441  
{2,5,6} : 16² = 256, 25² = 625  

So the ages when they met must be chosen from one of the three pairs
{13,14,31}, {12,21}, or {16,25} (in either order).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  “If you take the square of the sum of our ages when we met and split
   it into two 2-digit numbers, you'd have my age then and your age
   now.”

Let s = a + c.  
Because the square is to be split into two 2-digit parts, s² must be a
4-digit number, i.e. s ≥ 32.

Write the four digits of s² as XY ZW where XY and ZW are 2-digit
numbers.  
The quotation asserts

XY = c  and  ZW = A = a + T.    (†)

Thus

s² = 100·c + A.            (‡)

3.  Test the few candidate pairs.

a)  {13,14,31}

b)  {12,21}  
   Here s = 33, 33² = 1089 → XY = 10, ZW = 89, so XY ≠ c.  No solution.

c)  {16,25}  

   •  a = 16, c = 25 ⇒ s = 41, 41² = 1681 → XY = 16, ZW = 81
      but XY ≠ c (25).  Reject.

   •  a = 25, c = 16 ⇒ s = 41, 41² = 1681 → XY = 16, ZW = 81
      Here XY = c = 16, so (†) is satisfied and

      Al’s present age A = 81,

105,"A man is standing on a rock in the middle of a circular lake of radius 1. There is a tiger on the shore of the lake that can run four times as fast you can swim, however the tiger cannot swim. The tiger is hungry and always attempts to keep the distance between the two of you at a minimum. How can you safely swim to shore?
Assume that as long as you can get to the shore before the tiger gets to you (even if it is only a split-second before), you will be safe.",Use the factor of 4 to your advantage,"Until you are more than 1/4 of the radius away from the rock you can swim fast enough so that you can keep the tiger the furthest distance possible from you. Regardless of which direction the tiger moves around the circle, you swim the other way, always keeping the rock between you and the tiger.  While you are doing this you will be able to move outward, since you will have some energy to spare.
Before long you will be 1/4 of the radius away from the center and the tiger will be 180 degrees away. At this point swim straight to the point on the shore furthest from the tiger. You will be able to get there in 3/4 units of time, while it will take the tiger pi/4 =~ 0.7854 units of time.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the speed at which you can swim be v.  
The tiger can run along the shore with speed 4v.  
The lake has radius 1.

Key observation ( “factor 4’’ )  
• When you swim on a circle of radius r, your angular speed about the centre is  
 ωₘ = v / r.  
• The tiger’s angular speed as it runs round the rim (radius 1) is  
 ωₜ = 4v.  

Hence  

  ωₘ > ωₜ  iff  v/r > 4v  iff  r < ¼.          (1)

Inside the circle of radius ¼ you can turn round the centre faster than the tiger can.

Step 1 – get the tiger to the opposite side  
Start by swimming round the rock on a very small circle, say of radius r = 0.1 (<¼).  
Because of (1) your angular speed exceeds the tiger’s; every second you gain

  ωₘ – ωₜ = v(1/r – 4) = v(10 – 4) = 6v rad s⁻¹

of angle on him.  
Keep circling until the angular separation between you and the tiger is π radians (180°).  
That takes at most π /(6v) seconds.

Step 2 – spiral out to the ¼-circle while keeping the separation  
Still staying inside r = ¼, spiral slowly outward.  
Because you are still faster than the tiger (1/r > 4) you can make any tiny angular corrections that are needed to keep the tiger exactly opposite while you increase your radius to ¼.

When you reach r = ¼ you and the tiger are one diameter apart.

Step 3 – the straight dash to shore  
From r = ¼ the shore is 1 – ¼ = ¾ units away.  
Swimming that distance takes

  tₘ = (¾) / v.                                (2)

While you are doing this the tiger, still opposite you, must run half the shoreline, i.e. an arc of length π, at speed 4v; thus

  tₜ = π / (4v).                               (3)

Compare (2) and (3):

  tₘ < tₜ   because  ¾ < π/4 ≈ 0.785.

Therefore you reach the shore a little earlier than the tiger reaches the same point.  
The moment you put a foot on dry land you are safe.

Summary strategy  
• Orbit very close to the centre until the tiger is diametrically opposite.  
• Keeping him opposite, spiral out to radius ¼.  
• From there swim straight for the shore; you arrive first.

Final answer: Orbit inside radius ¼ until the tiger is on the opposite side, spiral out to radius ¼ while preserving that opposition, then swim straight to shore; you cover ¾ while the tiger must cover π, and since ¾ < π⁄4 you land safely before it can reach you.",True,1,0

20 = 2²·5  
30 = 2·3·5  
42 = 2·3·7  
56 = 2³·7  
72 = 2³·3²  
90 = 2·3²·5  

Take the highest powers of each prime:
2³, 3², 5¹, 7¹

Least common multiple = 2³·3²·5·7 = 8·9·5·7 = 2520.

So the smallest possible starting count is N = 2520 marbles, and the final number left is N⁄10:

2520 ÷ 10 = 252.

Hence the minimum possible quantity Justin can still have is 252 marbles.

Step 2.  Exploit the hint  
The hint says that in another solution the product is again 5796.  
So we have to look for a different factorisation of 5796 that does not repeat any
digit already appearing in 5796 (= 5 7 9 6).

That means the two factors must be made up from the remaining digits  
{1,2,3,4,8} and must not repeat any of those digits, nor repeat 5,7,9,6.

Step 3.  List the factor pairs of 5796  
5796 = 2² · 3² · 7 · 23.  
All its factor pairs are (showing only the smaller member of each pair):

Step 4.  Check which factor pairs use the digits {1,2,3,4,8} once each  
We go through the list; every time a digit is repeated (either inside one number
or between the two factors or with 5,7,9,6) we discard the pair.

Doing that, every pair fails except one:

42 × 138 = 5796

• 42 uses the digits 4 and 2.  
• 138 uses the digits 1, 3 and 8.  
• 5796 uses the digits 5, 7, 9 and 6.  

Together we have each digit 1-9 exactly once, and no digit is repeated.

Step 5.  State the required extra solution  
Therefore, besides the given example 12 × 483 = 5796, another valid identity is

42 × 138 = 5796.

Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.

6. Go back to step 3 with C₃ = 2:  
   X = R + 2T + 1 – 20 = R + 2T – 19, so R + 2T is between 20 and 28.

   Trying T = 7 gives no feasible F,S;

   Available pairs (F,S) are (2,3) or (4,5) or (6,7).  
   4 and 5 are taken, 6 or 7 are taken, so use F = 2, S = 3.

110,A man has nine children born at regular intervals. The sum of the square of their ages is equal to the square of his own age. What are the ages of his children?,The youngest children are very young,"You can basically use two parameters--the age of the youngest child and the age difference. Then, toggle with these two things and see if the sum of squares is a square. The ages are 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23 and 26. The man's age is 48.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

x  = age (in years) of the youngest child  
d  = common interval between successive births  
A  = father’s age  

Because the nine children are born at regular intervals, their ages are  

x ,  x+d ,  x+2d , … , x+8d .

The statement of the problem gives  

(x)^2 + (x+d)^2 + … + (x+8d)^2  =  A^2.     (1)

1.  Write the left‐hand side of (1) in closed form  

Σ_{k=0}^{8}(x+kd)^2  
=  9x^2 + 72xd + 204d^2.                                    (2)

So (1) becomes  

A^2 = 9x^2 + 72xd + 204d^2.                                 (3)

2.  A necessary condition on d  

Reduce (3) modulo 9:  

A^2 ≡ 6d^2  (mod 9).

Because a square is 0 or 1 mod 3, the right–hand side must be 0 mod 9; hence 3|d.  
Write d = 3k  (k is a positive integer).  Substitute in (3) and divide by 9:

(A/3)^2  =  x^2 + 24kx + 204k^2.                            (4)

Put B = A/3; then  

B^2 – (x + 12k)^2  = 60k^2  
⇒ (B – x – 12k)(B + x + 12k) = 60k^2.                      (5)

3.  Factor equation (5)  

Because the two factors on the left have the same parity, set  

B – x – 12k = 2q,        B + x + 12k = 2p,                 (6)

where p ≥ q ≥ 1 are integers of the same parity.  
Multiplying gives

(2p)(2q) = 60k^2  ⇒  pq = 15k^2.                           (7)

From (6) we have  

x = p – q – 12k.                                            (8)

4.  Make x non–negative and small  

We need p ≥ q and x ≥ 0.  Among all factor pairs in (7) the pair  

p = 15k ,  q = k                                            (9)

immediately satisfies pq = 15k^2 and gives

x = (15k) – k – 12k = 2k  (non–negative and small).        (10)

With (9) and (6)

B = p + q = 16k   ⇒   A = 3B = 48k,  
d = 3k,  and from (10)  x = 2k.                            (11)

5.  The children’s ages (choosing the smallest k = 1)

k = 1 gives the youngest children “very young”, exactly as hinted:

x = 2,   d = 3.  

Hence the nine ages are  

2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26.

(Their squared sum is 2304 = 48², so the father is 48.)

For larger k (k = 2, 3, …) the ages simply scale by k, producing further—but progressively less realistic—families.  The problem clearly intends the smallest one.

111,"Mad Ade was visiting his friend, computer tycoon and Olympic Kebab hurling champion, Mike Rohsopht.
He was there on Sunday and when the radio gave the time at the hour, Mad Ade noticed that the Madadian antique clock, designed by Madadian clock maker Arthur Minit (teaser #4891) was exactly 3 minutes slow.
""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Mike assured Mad Ade that his treasured Arthur Minit clock had not been adjusted nor fixed since his last visit.
What day of the week was Mad Ade's second visit?",It must lose some multiple of 12 hours in total,"The answer is 17 days and 3 hours later, which would have been a Wednesday.
This is the only other time in the same month when the two would agree at all.
In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.
Since the clock was not adjusted since the last visit, it's also possible that the radio time shifted by one hour due to a change to or from summer daylight saving time.  However, it turns out that the only additional possibilities that need to be considered are those of 4 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 12 hours 57 minutes, and 29 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 3 days 10 hours 57 minutes.  Without even considering the rules for when in the month the
clock is changed, these possible solutions are ruled out because we know that both visits were in the evening (""Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht"") and they involve times in a different part of the day.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

 Δ(t) = how much the clock is behind the correct time t hours after the first visit.  

Starting situation (first visit, Sunday at the top of the hour)  
 Δ(0) = 3 min.  

The clock loses 7 min every real hour, so  
 Δ(t) = 3 min + 7 min · t.  

For the dial to show the correct reading again, the error must equal an exact number of complete 12-hour turns (720 min):

 Δ(t) = 720 k for some positive integer k.  

Hence  

 3 + 7t = 720k. (1)

Because gcd(7, 720)=1, (1) has a unique solution for t modulo 720.  
Solve (1) mod 720:

 7t ≡ –3 (mod 720)  
 t ≡ –3·7⁻¹ (mod 720).

Since 7·103 = 721 ≡ 1 (mod 720), the inverse of 7 mod 720 is 103, and

 t ≡ –3·103 ≡ 717 ≡ 411 (mod 720).

The smallest positive value is therefore  

 t = 411 hours = 17 days + 3 hours.

So the earliest moment (and the only one that can still lie in the same month) at which the faulty clock can be exactly right is 17 days and 3 hours after the first visit.

Adding 17 days to Sunday brings us to Wednesday (because 14 days → Sunday again, plus 3 days → Wednesday).  
Adding the extra 3 hours merely makes the time “rather late in the evening”, still on Wednesday provided the first visit was any time before 9 p.m.—a perfectly reasonable assumption.

Thus Mad Ade’s second visit occurred on

Let every degree the handle is opened make the faucet contribute one “unit” of water.  
If RH is how far the hot handle is opened and RC is how far the cold handle is opened, then the mixed temperature T is  

  T = (TH·RH + TC·RC) / (RH + RC),

where TH and TC are the hot- and cold-water temperatures.

Step 2 – Insert the data.  
TH = 105 °F, TC = 45 °F  
The hot handle is fully open, so RH = 360°.  
We want T = 98.6 °F and must find RC (= x).

  98.6 = (105·360 + 45·x) / (360 + x)

Step 3 – Solve for x.

Multiply both sides by (360 + x):

(1) n is abundant : the sum σ(n) of its proper divisors exceeds n.  
(2) n is not pseudo-perfect : no sub-collection of those divisors adds up to n itself.

To locate the first weird number we only have to look through the abundant numbers in increasing order until one of them fails condition (2).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  List all abundant numbers below 100
--------------------------------------------------------------------
σ(n) – n is already tabulated in many elementary number–theory texts, but it is easy to check directly.   
Up to 100 the abundant numbers are  

12, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 66, 70, 72, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 96, 100,…

(The hint says the first weird one lies between 50 and 100, so we really only need the list up to 100.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Show that every abundant number below 70 is pseudo-perfect
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For each abundant n < 70 exhibit one subset of its proper divisors that sums to n.

12  : 6 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 12  
18  : 9 + 6 + 3 = 18  
20  : 10 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20  
24  : 12 + 8 + 4 = 24  
30  : 15 + 10 + 5 = 30  
36  : 18 + 12 + 6 = 36  
40  : 20 + 10 + 8 + 2 = 40  
42  : 21 + 14 + 7 = 42  
48  : 24 + 16 + 8 = 48  
54  : 27 + 18 + 9 = 54  
56  : 28 + 14 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 56  
60  : 30 + 20 + 10 = 60  
66  : 33 + 22 + 11 = 66  

Thus every abundant number below 70 is pseudo-perfect and therefore not weird.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Examine 70
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Proper divisors of 70 : 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35  
Their sum : 1 + 2 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 14 + 35 = 74 > 70  ⇒ 70 is abundant.

Now check that no subset sums to 70.

•  First observe that all divisors except 35 add to 39, so any subset not containing 35 is ≤ 39 < 70.  
  ⇒ Every subset that could possibly reach 70 must contain 35.

•  If 35 is included we need an additional 35 from {1,2,5,7,10,14}.  
  The largest possible sum of those six numbers is  
  1+2+5+7+10+14 = 39.  
  Enumerate the possibilities (they are few):

  14+10+7+2+1 = 34  
  14+10+7+5   = 36  
  14+10+5+2+1 = 32  
  14+7+5+2+1  = 29  
  10+7+5+2+1  = 25  
  14+10+7     = 31  
  14+10+5     = 29  
  … (all others are even smaller)

  None of them equals 35.  Hence no subset containing 35 (and therefore no subset at all) totals 70.

Therefore 70 is abundant but not pseudo-perfect, i.e. 70 is weird.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Conclusion

All abundant numbers below 70 are pseudo-perfect; 70 itself is abundant and not pseudo-perfect.  Hence it is the first weird number.

The robots are grouped into tribes according to the numbers of arms they have so that in any tribe, no member has a different number of arms to the other members. Each tribe follows the same fertility ritual before bed each night, a ritual that also reveals the number of members in a tribe. In the ritual, each arm of a male links with an arm of a female, no male-female pair of robots linking more than once. The minimum number of robots required to link all arms once only is the number belonging to that tribe. Now one night, the Creaky tribe cornered half of the Rusty tribe and despite being outnumbered two to one, unscrewed one arm from each, there being an equal number of male and female victims. However, the Creaky tribe were extremely poor at arithmetic and had failed to realise that they needed 24 times their actual haul of spare arms in order that the number of links their members could then make, each with the same number of extra arms, was half the maximum number of links the Rusty tribe could then make. How many Creakies and Rusties were there?",,"ARMLESS ALIENS. There were 14 Creakies and 56 Rusties.

Forming the links equation we have 2(y squared) - 49y - 4(x squared) = 0. We must have y=4x so that y - 4x is a factor. A long division shows that the condition for zero remainder is x=7 so y=28. The numbers of members are twice these.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

a  = number of arms on every Creaky robot  
b  = number of arms on every Rusty robot  

1.  How many robots are in each tribe?  
   •  In the bedtime ritual every arm must link once with an arm of the opposite sex and no two robots may link more than once.  
   •  To allow a male to use all a arms he must meet a different female for every one of his a arms, so there must be at least a females.  
   •  The same argument applied to the females shows that the least possible numbers are a males and a females – i.e. 2a Creakies in all.  
   •  Likewise the Rusty tribe has 2b members.  

   Hence  
        # Creakies = 2a ,     # Rusties = 2b.               (1)

2.  The raid  
   •  Half of the Rusties were cornered, so the number of victims is  

         V = ½·(2b) = b.  

   •  “Out-numbered two to one’’ means the victims were twice as many as the Creakies, i.e.  

         b = 2·(2a)  ⇒  b = 4a.                            (2)

   •  One arm was unscrewed from each victim, so the Creakies carried off  

         haul = b arms.

3.  The Rusties after the raid  
   •  b⁄2 males and b⁄2 females have lost one arm; the rest still have b arms.  
   •  Total arms now on each side (male or female):  

        (b⁄2)·b  +  (b⁄2)·(b–1)  =  b(2b–1)/2.  

   •  Therefore their maximum possible number of links is  

        L_R = b(2b – 1)/2.                                (3)

4.  The hypothetical number of arms the Creakies would have needed  
   •  They “needed 24 times their actual haul”, i.e. 24b extra arms.  
   •  Shared equally among the 2a Creakies gives each robot  

        e = (24b)/(2a) = 12b/a additional arms.           (4)

     This must be an integer.

   •  Each Creaky would then have a + e arms, so each sex would possess  

        a(a + e) arms and could make that many links.  

   •  The condition reads  

        a(a + e) = ½ L_R.                                  (5)

5.  Substitute (3) and (4) into (5):

      a (a + 12b/a) = ½ · b(2b – 1)/2  
   ⇒  a² + 12b = b(2b – 1)/4  
   ⇒  4a² + 48b = 2b² – b  
   ⇒  2b² – 49b – 4a² = 0.                                 (6)

6.  Use relation (2):  b = 4a.  Insert into (6):

      2(4a)² – 49(4a) – 4a² = 0  
   ⇒ 32a² – 196a – 4a² = 0  
   ⇒ 28a² – 196a = 0  
   ⇒ a(a – 7) = 0.

   Since a > 0, we obtain  

        a = 7  and  hence  b = 4a = 28.

7.  Numbers of robots (from (1)):

      Creakies : 2a = 14  
      Rusties  : 2b = 56.

A quick check:

•  Victims = 28, Creakies = 14  →  outnumbered 2 : 1.  
•  Haul = 28 arms; needed 24 × 28 = 672 arms.  
•  Extra per Creaky = 672/14 = 48  →  each would have 55 arms.  
•  Creaky links = 7·55 = 385.  
•  Rusty links after raid = 28·55/2 = 770 = 2·385 — the required ratio.

All conditions are satisfied.

s = side length of the whole (square) lawn in metres.  

Junior mows a border 2 m wide all the way round, so the part he mows is

area of whole square − area of inner square

By agreement this border is exactly one-half of the whole lawn, so  

s² − (s − 4)² = ½ s².            … (1)

Expand and simplify (1):

s² − [s² − 8s + 16] = ½ s²  
s² − s² + 8s − 16 = ½ s²  
8s − 16 = ½ s²  

Multiply by 2:

16s − 32 = s²  
s² − 16s + 32 = 0.

Solve the quadratic:

s = [16 ± √(16² − 4·32)] / 2

With every cut you should cut through every previous cut. As long as you keep doing this you will always be able to do so again with your next cut. The number of additional pieces formed on cut x will always be x. The sum of all integers from 1 to n is n*(n+1)/2. So the sum of additional pieces cut will be n*(n+1)/2.
Finally add 1 because we start with 1 piece: n*(n+1)/2 + 1.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let Pₙ be the greatest possible number of pieces after n straight cuts.

Step 1.  Base case  
With no cuts, the pizza is one whole piece: P₀ = 1.

Step 2.  How many new pieces can the next cut create?  
Assume we already have j cuts arranged so that they give the maximum Pⱼ pieces.  
Place the (j + 1)-st cut so that  
• it intersects every one of the j previous cuts,  
• no three cuts meet at a common point, and  
• all intersection points lie inside the pizza.  

Those j intersection points split the new cut into (j + 1) separate line-segments.  
Each segment lies in a different existing piece, so every segment cuts its piece into two, creating exactly one new piece per segment.  
Hence the (j + 1)-st cut produces (j + 1) additional pieces.

Therefore we have the recurrence
  P_{j+1} = P_j + (j + 1).

Step 3.  Solve the recurrence

Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.

Take two ordinary decks (so there are two physical copies of every rank/suit combination) and delete  
• odd spades → keep only 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 of ♠  
• even hearts → keep only A, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 of ♥  
• prime diamonds (and A♦) → keep only 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 of ♦  
• non-prime clubs (and A♣) → keep only 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 of ♣  
Each surviving card has two physical copies because there are two decks.

Step 2 – What does an “alternating-colours straight” need?

The straight must be A-2-3-…-K with  
odd ranks (1,3,5,7,9,11,13) = red cards,

1.  If the fraction is to equal 1 ⁄ 2, its denominator must be exactly twice its numerator.  
    So we only have to find one 5-digit number N that uses some of the given digits and whose double 2N uses the rest of them.

2.  List the ten available digits (with their multiplicities):  
        0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 9  

    Notice that the only digits missing from the usual 0–9 collection are 7 and 8; every other digit appears once except 2 and 4, which appear twice.

3.  A very natural first try for a 5-digit number is the simple increasing string 12345.  
    Double it:

          12345 × 2 = 24690

4.  Check that together the digits of 12345 and 24690 are exactly the required multiset:

        Numerator 12345 supplies : 1,2,3,4,5
        Denominator 24690 supplies: 2,4,6,9,0
        Combined                  : 0,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,9  ✔

    Every required digit is present, no digit is used too many times, and no extra digits (7 or 8) appear.

5.  Finally, verify the value of the fraction:

        12345 / 24690 = 1 / 2   (because 2·12345 = 24690)

Thus the desired arrangement is achieved.

v₁,v₂,v₃,v₄,v₅,v₆  (face “1’’ is worth v₁ points, face “2’’ is worth v₂, …).

From the four scores that are given we obtain four linear equations:

(1)  Xavier 1 :  v₁+2v₃+v₄+v₆ = 177  
(2)  Rex 1    :  v₂+2v₄+v₅+v₆ = 268  
(3)  Xavier 2 :  3v₁+2v₄       = 203

3.  Because we are told that on the third turn  
        Xavier 3 − Rex 3 = 26   and Xavier 3 > Rex 3,

   compute the two unknown third–turn totals in terms of the

4.  Combine (8) and (10):

        v₂ − v₃ = 39 and v₂ − v₆ = 13

------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Insert (11) in (6):

        v₄ + 6v₃ + 3(v₃+26) = 328  
   ⇒   v₄ = 250 − 9v₃.                                        …(12)

------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Insert (12) in (5):

        v₁ = (203 − 2(250 − 9v₃))/3 = 6v₃ − 99.               …(13)

------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Use (12) and (11) in (2) to obtain v₅:

        v₂+2v₄+v₅+v₆ = 268  
   ⇒ (v₃+39)+2(250−9v₃)+v₅+(v₃+26) = 268  
   ⇒            v₅ = −297 + 16v₃.                            …(14)

------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  What has been found

   Every integer choice of v₃ for which all six expressions below are
   positive and pair-wise different produces a valid scoring system:

        v₁ = 6v₃ − 99  
        v₂ = v₃ + 39  
        v₃ = v₃                            (free parameter)  
        v₄ = 250 − 9v₃  
        v₅ = 16v₃ − 297  
        v₆ = v₃ + 26

   Positivity requires 19 ≤ v₃ ≤ 27 (v₃≠25 to avoid v₄=v₃).
   Thus there is an infinite family of legal dice, not a single one.

   Example (take v₃ = 19):

        face 1 → 15   face 2 → 58   face 3 → 19  
        face 4 → 79   face 5 → 7    face 6 → 45

------------------------------------------------------------------
9.  Third-turn scores (they are actually independent of v₃!)

   Insert (11)–(13) in X₃ and R₃:

        X₃ = (6v₃−99)+2(v₃+39)+v₃+(250−9v₃) = 229  
        R₃ = (6v₃−99)+   v₃    +(250−9v₃)+2(v₃+26) = 203

   Hence, whatever admissible values the faces have,
        Xavier’s 3rd-turn score is 229 points,  
        Rex’s 3rd-turn score is 203 points,  
        and the required difference is indeed 26 points.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Final answer:  Xavier’s third roll scores 229 points and Rex’s scores 203 points.  The precise point values of the six die-faces are not uniquely determined; they must satisfy  

  1 → 6t−99, 2 → t+39, 3 → t, 4 → 250−9t, 5 → 16t−297, 6 → t+26  

for any integer t with 19 ≤ t ≤ 27 (t ≠ 25) so that all six values are positive and different (for instance t = 19 gives 1→15, 2→58, 3→19, 4→79, 5→7, 6→45).",True,0,0

If you imagine you are facing a globe head on, you have the north pole at the top of the globe and the south pole at the bottom. Imagine a ""west pole"" and ""east pole"" to the left and right of the globe.
If you are at the north pole and turn left, you will walk through the ""west pole"" (right and you go through the ""east pole"")
If you walk on an axis from the north pole towards the south pole and make a left or right turn you will always walk through these imaginary east and west poles. So in the question 17.345 kilometers is irrelevant, only the turn.
(It also doesn't matter where you start on the planet, the distance at the end will still be the same.)
47.124 is approximately 3/4 of the circumference of this planet, which will leave you directly on the imaginary east pole. The distance is now the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle of side 10km.

• R = 10 km  (radius of the planet)  
• C = 2πR = 20π km ≈ 62.832 km  (circumference along any great-circle)

Step 1.  Translate the walked distances into central angles  
For a walk of length s on the surface of a sphere, the corresponding central angle is  
 θ = s / R   (radians)

First leg  
s₁ = 17.345 km   ⇒   θ₁ = 17.345 / 10 = 1.7345 rad  (≈ 99.4°)

Second leg  
s₂ = 47.124 km ≈ 15π km        (because 15π = 47.12389…)  
θ₂ = 47.124 / 10 ≈ 4.7124 rad ≈ 3π/2 rad = 270°

Step 2.  Set up the spherical triangle  
Let  
S = starting point (the ship)  
P = point after the first leg  
Q = final point

The sides of the spherical triangle △SPQ are

SP = θ₁ (1.7345 rad)  
PQ = θ₂ (4.7124 rad = 3π/2 rad)  
SQ = θ   (unknown—this is the distance we want divided by R)

At P you turned a right angle, so the angle ∠SPQ = 90°.

Step 3.  Apply the spherical law of cosines for a right-angled triangle  
For a spherical triangle with right angle at P (C = 90°):

cos θ = cos SP · cos PQ + sin SP · sin PQ · cos C  
but cos C = cos 90° = 0, therefore

cos θ = cos SP · cos PQ

Insert the values:

cos SP = cos θ₁  (some number)  
cos PQ = cos(3π/2) = 0

Hence

cos θ = cos θ₁ · 0 = 0  
⇒ θ = π/2  (because cos θ = 0 ⇔ θ = 90° = π/2 rad)

Remarkably, the first leg drops out—any time the second leg is 3π/2 rad (270°) long and you turn 90°, you finish a quarter of a circumference from where you started.

Step 4.  Convert θ back to a surface distance

distance SQ = R · θ = 10 km · (π/2) = 5π km

hence n ≥ 317.  
Since n² is still a six–digit number, n ≤ 999.

Step 3 – Using the hint about the digits of n  
The hint says that the digits of n itself are in ascending order
(from left to right, strictly increasing).  
Because n is at least 317 and at most 999, n must be a three–digit number
whose hundreds, tens and units digits increase strictly:

hundreds < tens < units.

All such numbers from 317 to 999 are (in increasing order)

345, 346, 347, 348, 349,  
356, 357, 358, 359,  
367, 368, 369,  
378, 379,  
389,  
456, 457, 458, 459,  
467, 468, 469,  
478, 479,  
489,

578, 579,  
589,  
678, 679,  
689,  
789.

Step 4 – Test the squares of these n  
For each candidate n compute n² and inspect its digits.  
The only time the six digits turn out to be in strictly ascending order is

n = 367  →  n² = 134 689  
Digits of the square: 1 < 3 < 4 < 6 < 8 < 9 – perfectly ascending.

Every other candidate gives a square whose digits fail the test (they repeat, decrease, or contain a 0 in the wrong place).

Step 5 – Verification  
• n = 367 indeed satisfies n ≥ 317.  
• n² = 134 689 > 100 000.  
• The digits of n (3 < 6 < 7) are ascending.  
• The digits of n² (1 3 4 6 8 9) are ascending.  

Hence the conditions are met.

134,"Bill, Bob, Frank, and Jim, who all drive cabs, work a particularly busy street that runs east and west. The street has no traffic lights. Oddly enough, an equal number of pedestrians walk in each direction at four kilometres per hour. The four cab drivers were discussing the best way to pick up a fare. Bill said he was going to sit beside the curb and wait until a fare came along. Bob said he was going to cruise west at four kilometres an hour; therefore, he would have twice the chance of picking up a fare as Bill. Frank said he was going to cruise east at eight kilometres an hour and his chances were twice as good as either Bill's or Bob's. Jim claimed that they were all wrong. He was going to drive west at 12kmh and his chances of picking up a fare were twice as good as Frank's. Of the claims that were made which were correct and which were wrong?",Analyze each claim separately,"Bill made no claim, Bob's claim was false, Frank's claim was true, and Jim's claim was false. Let's assume that 100 people passed Bill going east at four kph, and 100 people passed him going west at four kph. Bob, who was driving west at four kph, wouldn't pass anyone walking west, but would pass 200 people walking east. This would put him no further ahead than Bill. Frank, who was driving east and 300 people going west. Jim, who was going west at 12kph, would pass 200 people going west and 400 people going east. His statement about doubling his chances over Frank was false.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

D = average number of pedestrians per kilometre walking east,  
D = average number of pedestrians per kilometre walking west (the same, because the flow is “equal in each direction”).  

For any cab, “chance of picking up a fare” is proportional to the number of pedestrians it actually meets per hour, i.e.  

chance  ∝  (relative speed between cab and east-bound walkers)·D  +  (relative speed between cab and west-bound walkers)·D.

All we have to do is work out those relative speeds for each driver.

1. Bill – standing still (0 km/h)
   • Meets east-bound walkers at 4 km/h  
   • Meets west-bound walkers at 4 km/h  
   Encounters per hour = (4+4)D = 8D.  
   (Bill made no comparative claim; this just sets the baseline.)

2. Bob – drives west at 4 km/h (–4 km/h)
   • East-bound walkers (+4) approach at |+4 – (–4)| = 8 km/h  
   • West-bound walkers (–4) have no relative motion: |–4 – (–4)| = 0 km/h  
   Encounters per hour = (8+0)D = 8D.  
   Bob therefore meets the same number of pedestrians as Bill, not twice as many.  
   ⇒ Bob’s claim is wrong.

3. Frank – drives east at 8 km/h (+8 km/h)
   • East-bound walkers (+4): |+8 – +4| = 4 km/h  
   • West-bound walkers (–4): |+8 – (–4)| = 12 km/h  
   Encounters per hour = (4+12)D = 16D.  
   16D is exactly twice Bill’s or Bob’s 8D.  
   ⇒ Frank’s claim (“twice as good as either Bill’s or Bob’s”) is correct.

4. Jim – drives west at 12 km/h (–12 km/h)
   • East-bound walkers (+4): |+4 – (–12)| = 16 km/h  
   • West-bound walkers (–4): |–4 – (–12)| = 8 km/h  
   Encounters per hour = (16+8)D = 24D.  
   Frank has 16D; Jim has 24D, which is only 1.5 × Frank’s, not twice.  
   Furthermore, Jim said “they were all wrong,” but Frank was actually right.  
   ⇒ Jim’s claim is wrong.

Summary of the truth values:  
• Bob’s claim – wrong.  
• Frank’s claim – correct.  
• Jim’s claim – wrong.

617 is the mystery number.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We translate every sentence of the riddle into precise conditions on the three digits A B C.

1.  ABC, the mystery number, is a 3-digit prime.  
2.  AB and BC (two–digit numbers) are also prime.  
3.  A, B, C are distinct.  
4.  None of the digits is 9.  
5.  Putting the digits in descending order gives another 3-digit prime.  
6.  Putting the digits in ascending order gives another 3-digit prime.

Step 1.  Restrict the middle digit B.  
For a two–digit prime the last digit must be 1, 3, 7 (the only possible units digits besides 9 or 5, which are disallowed here).  
Hence B ∈ {1, 3, 7}.

Step 2.  List all 3-digit primes whose middle digit is 1, 3, or 7, whose digits are distinct and contain no 9.

From the prime list supplied, those are:

137, 173, 271, 317, 431, 571, 613, 617, 631, 673.

Step 3.  Impose condition 2: both AB and BC must be prime.

AB and BC for the list above are

137 → 13, 37  (both prime)  
173 → 17, 73  (both prime)  
271 → 27 (not prime)  → reject  
317 → 31, 17 (both prime)  
431 → 43, 31 (both prime)  
571 → 57 (not prime)  → reject  
613 → 61, 13 (both prime)  
617 → 61, 17 (both prime)  
631 → 63 (not prime)  → reject  
673 → 67, 73 (both prime)

Survivors: 137, 173, 317, 431, 613, 617, 673.

Step 4.  Impose conditions 5 and 6: the ascending and descending rearrangements of the digits must be prime.

For each survivor compute ASC (ascending) and DESC (descending):

137 → ASC = 137 (prime), DESC = 731 (17×43, not prime) → reject  
173 → ASC = 137 (prime), DESC = 731 (not prime) → reject  
317 → ASC = 137 (prime), DESC = 731 (not prime) → reject  
431 → ASC = 134 (even, not prime) → reject  
613 → ASC = 136 (even, not prime) → reject  
617 → ASC = 167 (prime), DESC = 761 (prime) ✔  
673 → ASC = 367 (prime), DESC = 763 (7×109, not prime) → reject

Only 617 meets every requirement.

All clues are satisfied:

• 617 is a 3-digit prime.  
• AB = 61 and BC = 17 are both 2-digit primes.  
• Digits 6, 1, 7 are distinct and contain no 9.  
• Descending order 761 and ascending order 167 are both primes.

136,"Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?
Comments to triflers:
The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!",There are hints in the comments to triflers and in the title.,"80
To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion. This takes 9 trips of 2 5/18 miles (5 advancing trips interspersed with 4 return trips) for a total of 20.5 miles traveled (9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5) and 20.5 bottles of soda used. Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases. With one less case to move, Bu will now make 2 fewer trips. The 3.5 bottles set aside are used to move the four cases the next 1/2 mile toward the Wirth Pavilion.   After this, the Wirth Pavilion is just 2 2/9 miles away ( 5 - 2 5/18 - 9/18 = 2 4/18 ). Next, he travels 15 5/9 miles (7 * 2 2/9) using 15 5/9 bottles of soda to complete his trip.

The moped drinks pop at the constant rate  

1 bottle  ⇝  1 mile of travel.  

While there are more than C bottles still to be moved, the rider has to ferry them in several loads.  
If k = ⎡B / C⎤ loads are necessary, then to advance the whole stock one mile the moped must make  

k forward trips + (k – 1) return trips = 2k – 1 miles,  

and therefore consumes 2k – 1 bottles per mile of advance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------  
1.  First ferrying regime (5 loads)

Start with B₀ = 120; C = 25 → k = 5 → consumption rate = 2·5 – 1 = 9 bottles per mile.

Keep that regime until only 4 loads (100 bottles) are left.

Bottles to be burned in this regime = 120 – 100 = 20  
Distance covered in this regime = 20⁄9 miles.

After travelling 20⁄9 miles the cache contains  

B₁ = 100 bottles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------  
2.  Second ferrying regime (4 loads)

Now B₁ = 100; k = 4 → consumption rate = 2·4 – 1 = 7 bottles per mile.

The remaining distance to Wirth Pavilion is  

d – 20⁄9 = 5 – 20⁄9 = 25⁄9 miles.

Bottles that must be burned on that last stretch = 7 · 25⁄9 = 175⁄9 bottles  
                                                  = 19 4⁄9 bottles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------  
3.  What reaches the goal?

B₂ = 100 – 175⁄9 = 725⁄9 = 80 5⁄9 bottles.

Because bottles are indivisible, at most 80 of them can still be unopened when the MoJoPed rolls into the Wirth Pavilion.

----------------------------------------------------------------------  
4.  Is 80 attainable?

Yes.  One explicit optimal strategy is

• Ferry the pop to the cache point 20⁄9 miles out exactly as above (five loads, burning 20 bottles).  
• From the cache make four forward loads toward the pavilion, shuttling back three times to fetch the rest.  
  – the first 2 7⁄9 miles of that stage cost 19 bottles,  
  – the very last 2⁄9-mile partial trip uses the remaining 4⁄9 of a bottle already opened in the tank.  
Everything is integral except the dregs of that last opened bottle, so 80 unopened bottles arrive intact.

----------------------------------------------------------------------  
Therefore the greatest possible number of unopened bottles that Bu Star can deliver is

137,"Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.  Henry's plan calls for the tracks (each of which is one mile in length) to be laid end-to-end with no gap between them, pinned to the ground at every other juncture, as shown below:
v_______ _______vv_______ _______v
Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""
Henry replies, ""The expansion will only be an inch over the whole mile length.  If the tracks buckle, it will only be by an inch or two at most.  The trains will certainly have no trouble bumping over these buckles.""
Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?",Would Pythagoras have the same plan?,"The rise in the middle of the tracks would have been much greater than Henry surmised.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse). SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning  

1.  Lengths in convenient units  
   •  1 mile = 5 280 ft = 63 360 in.  
   •  Each one–mile rail therefore lengthens from 63 360 in to  
     63 361 in when the temperature rises.  
   •  Henry fastens the track to the ground at every other joint, so two
     consecutive rails (total nominal length 2 mi) are held down only at
     their ends.  Those two ends are 2 mi = 126 720 in apart and cannot
     move.

2.  What does the pair of rails do when it expands?  
   With the ends fixed, the extra 2 in of length must go somewhere, so the
   rails will rise (or kink sideways) forming an isosceles triangle:

           B             (apex)
          / \
         /   \
        A-----C          (A and C are the pinned ends)

   Side AB = side BC = 63 361 in  
   Base AC = 126 720 in

3.  Height of the buckle (use Pythagoras)  
   Let h be the height of B above the ground line AC.  Half the base is
   AC/2 = 63 360 in, so

           h² = (63 361)² − (63 360)²
                = (63 360² + 2·63 360 + 1) − 63 360²
                = 2·63 360 + 1
                = 126 721.

   Therefore  
           h = √126 721 ≈ 355.96 in.

4.  Convert to familiar units  
   355.96 in ÷ 12 ≈ 29.7 ft — almost a 30-foot hump!

5.  Why the boss fired Henry  
   Henry thought “an extra inch or two” of length would give only an
   inch-high buckle, but elementary geometry shows that the buckle rises
   about thirty feet.  No train could possibly “bump over” such a crest,
   so the design is disastrously unsafe.  Any competent engineer (or
   Pythagoras) would have foreseen this, hence the boss’s harsh judgment.

Final answer: The 2 in of extra length between the fixed pins produces an isosceles-triangle buckle whose height is √126 721 in ≈ 356 in ≈ 29 ft 9 in; a nearly 30-foot hump, not the “inch or two” Henry expected, so his plan is utterly unacceptable.",True,1,0

The total area is 144 square feet. Allowing 6 extra tiles for breakage brings the order to 150 tiles.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let us place the patio on a coordinate grid and use every datum exactly once.

1.  Put AB against the house, horizontal, 16 ft long.  
   Let A = (0, 0), B = (16, 0).

2.  AF ⟂ AB, AF = 6 ft ⇒ F = (0, –6).

3.  BC ∥ AF and BC = 6 ft ⇒ C = (16, –6).

   So AB CF is a 16 × 6 rectangle.

4.  FC is parallel to AB (already satisfied).

   Along FC (the segment from (0, –6) to (16, –6))
        FG = 4 ft, HC = 4 ft  
        ⇒ G = (4, –6), H = (12, –6).

5.  EG ⟂ FG and EG = 4 ft.  
   FG is horizontal, so EG is vertical.  
   Choosing the downward direction (to satisfy the 135° angle at F later) gives  
        E = (4, –10).

6.  DH ⟂ HC and DH = 4 ft.  
   HC is horizontal, so DH is vertical.  
   Taking the downward direction gives  
        D = (12, –10).

7.  ED is 8 ft and ∥ AB (horizontal).  
   Indeed, D = (12, –10) and E = (4, –10) are 8 ft apart horizontally.

8.  Check the two required angles.

   • At C: vectors C B = (0, 6) and C D = (–4, –4) form an angle of 135°,  
     because cos θ = [(0)(-4) + (6)(-4)] / (6·4√2) = –√2/2.

   • At F: vectors F A = (0, 6) and F E = (4, –4) also give cos θ = –√2/2 ⇒ 135°.

   Thus every condition is met and the hexagon is
        A(0, 0) → B(16, 0) → C(16, –6) → D(12, –10) → E(4, –10) → F(0, –6).

Σ (x_i y_{i+1} – x_{i+1} y_i):

(0·0 – 16·0)   = 0  
(16·–6 – 16·0) = –96  
(16·–10 – 12·–6)= –160 + 72 = –88  
(12·–10 –  4·–10)= –120 + 40 = –80  
(4·–6  –  0·–10)= –24  
(0·0   –  0·–6 )= 0

Total = –288.

Area = ½|–288| = 144 square feet.

(As a check: the bounding 16 × 10 rectangle is 160 ft²; two 4 × 4 right triangles

So

     33 − 11x ≡ 0 (mod 110)  ⇒  11x ≡ 33 (mod 110)

With x restricted to −9,…,9, the only possibilities are x = 3 or x = −7.  
• x = −7 gives y = 105 from (★), which is impossible (|y| ≤ 9).  
• x = 3 gives, from (★),

Mouse(A) bites off one rope in 60 minutes.
Mouse(B) bites off one rope in 90 minutes.
Mouse(C) bites off one rope in 180 minutes.
You do not have any time or distance measuring tools and the length of the rope is unknown.  How can you measure 75 minutes?",Set distance and time relations and equations,"Mark the two ropes as Rope(A) and Rope(B).
1. Let Mouse(A) and Mouse(C) start biting off Rope(A) at the same time, starting each from  one end (moving in opposite directions).  At the same time, let Mouse(B) start biting off Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(A) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X = S(A) * 60, where S(A) is biting speed for Mouse(A) and X is Rope(A) length
X = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X is Rope(A) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(A)/S(C) = 3:1, which means that for each 3 units Mouse(A) will move, Mouse (C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(A) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(A) bites off three times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides Rope(A) length in to 4 units.
Mouse(A) bitten off portion = 3/4 X (where X is Rope(A) length)
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/4 X
Finding the time spent before Rope(A) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(A) needs  60 minutes to bite off X, How many minutes are needed to bite off 3/4 X?
Minutes needed = 3/4 * 60 = 45 minutes are needed to fully bite off Rope(A) by Mouse(A) and Mouse(C).  At that point in time, Mouse(B) would have bitten off exactly half the length of Rope(B) (needing 90 minutes to bite off the full rope), and needs an additional 45 minutes to bite off the remaining rope half.
2. Let Mouse(B) continue biting off Rope(B) and make Mouse(C) start biting off the other end of Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(B) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X/2 = S(B) * 90, where S(B) is biting speed for Mouse(B) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
X/2 = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length

Step 1 – get a 30-minute interval  
• Tie up rope-1.  
• Put mice A and B at the same end of rope-1, and mouse C at the opposite end.  

Speed at A-B end     = vA + vB = L/60 + L/90 = L/36  
Speed at C end       = vC       = L/180  
Total eating speed   = L/36 + L/180 = 6L/180 = L/30

Hence rope-1 disappears in  
t₁ = L / (L/30) = 30 minutes.  
The instant the three mice finish rope-1 you know that exactly 30 minutes have passed.

Step 2 – get a 45-minute interval  
• Take the still untouched rope-2.  
• Put mouse A at one end of rope-2 and mouse C at the other end (mouse B is no longer needed).

This contains nine ones, so it is divisible by 9, and two 0's at the end, so it is divisible by 25.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let N be the number of gums Rob ate.  
Because the gums come in packs of 225, N must be a multiple of 225.

1. 225 = 9 × 25  
   So N must be divisible by 25 and by 9.

2. “Digits only 1’s and 0’s” and “in base 10” forces:

   • Divisible by 25  → the last two decimal digits must be 00  
     (25, 50, 75 are impossible – they contain other digits).  
     Hence N = 100 k for some integer k.

   • Divisible by 9  → the sum of the decimal digits is a multiple of 9.  
     For a number that uses only 0 and 1, the digit–sum equals the number of 1’s.
     Thus k must contain a number of 1’s that is a multiple of 9.

   • Removing the final two zeros does not introduce any new digits, so
     k itself must also use only 0’s and 1’s (its digits are those of N
     except for the final two 0’s).

The problem therefore reduces to:

Find the smallest positive integer k whose decimal expansion

   – uses only 0’s and 1’s,  
   – begins with 1 (no leading zero),  
   – contains a number of 1’s divisible by 9.

Smallest possible number of 1’s is 9.  
With exactly 9 ones the shortest possible length is 9 digits, and the only
9-digit number that has nine 1’s and no other digits is

        k = 111 111 111.

Because every power of 10 is congruent to 1 modulo 9, any 0/1-number is
congruent (mod 9) to its number of 1’s; hence 111 111 111 is indeed
divisible by 9.

Since no shorter (fewer than 9 digits) or smaller (still 9 digits but less
value) integer can satisfy the condition, 111 111 111 is the minimal k.

Now put the two trailing zeros back:

        N = 100 k = 100 × 111 111 111 = 11 111 111 100.

Check:
• ends in 00  ⇒ divisible by 25.  
• digit sum = 9  ⇒ divisible by 9.  
Therefore N is divisible by 225, and its decimal representation uses only
1’s and 0’s.

{1,1,2,3,3,4,4,5,7}.

Step 1 – How many digits in each part  
Because 11 n is just one digit longer than n, n must have 4 digits and 11 n must have 5.

Step 2 – Using the hint  
For any number n we have 11 n = 10 n + n, so the units digit of 11 n is the same as the units digit of n.  
Hence D (the last digit) occurs twice in the list.  
Only 1, 3 and 4 appear twice, so D is 1, 3 or 4.

Step 3 – Take D = 1 (the other two cases will be similar but will fail)  
Write n = ABC1.

Multiplying ABC1 by 11 digit-by-digit:

• units  D = 1

• tens  T = C + 1  (no carry, because C ≤ 7)

Remaining digits are {4,4,7}.  Take A = 4.

Thus there are exactly  200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249 factors of 5 in 1000! and since there are more than sufficient factors of 2, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We need to count how many times a factor 10 = 2·5 appears in 1000!.  
Because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor 5 and there are always more factors 2 than 5, the limiting factor is the number of 5’s in the prime-factorization of 1000!.

Use Legendre’s formula:  
# of factors 5 in 1000! = ⌊1000/5⌋ + ⌊1000/5²⌋ + ⌊1000/5³⌋ + ⌊1000/5⁴⌋ …

Compute:
⌊1000/5⌋ = 200  
⌊1000/25⌋ = 40  
⌊1000/125⌋ = 8  
⌊1000/625⌋ = 1  
Next power, 5⁵ = 3125 > 1000, so stop.

Total factors 5 = 200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249.

Therefore 1000! contains 249 factors 10, hence 249 trailing zeros.

146,"In a 14-stage cycle race there were a 100 competitors, among them ""Crazy"" Charles
In all 14 stages ""Crazy"" Charles finished in the same position: 93rd. However, at the end of the race, ""Crazy"" Charles was declared runner-up in the competition: his accumulated time was less than that of all the other competitors except one, the champion.
Bearing in mind the fact that none of the 100 competitors withdrew from the race, how was it possible for ""Crazy"" Charles to finish second if he never even made it into the top 90 competitors?","Find the maximum number of people he can beat--as time is aggregated, note that one can finish in a shorter time than someone else overall ","""Crazy"" Charles was runner-up in the race because in each of the 14 stages he beat 7 different competitors, and he beat them all by more time than the accumulated time that they beat him by in all the other stages of the tour. Since 7*14=98, there was only one cyclist that he never beat and that was the champion.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let us translate the statement “93rd in every one of the 14 stages” into something that can be counted.

1.  In every stage exactly 92 riders finish in front of Charles and 7 riders finish behind him.

2.  Over the whole race that means

       (number of ‘ahead-of-Charles’ places)
         = 92 per stage × 14 stages = 1288,

       (number of ‘behind-Charles’ places)
         = 7 per stage  × 14 stages =  98.

   There are 99 other cyclists altogether.  Therefore  

          98  = 14×7  “behind-Charles” places  
          99 ‑ 1 = 98  different riders apart from the eventual champion.

   So it is possible for every one of the 98 riders (all except the champion) to be one of the
   seven who were behind Charles in exactly one of the 14 stages and to be in front of him in
   the other 13 stages.

3.  Arrange the times.

   • Fix a convenient basic time for Charles, say 100 minutes a stage
     ⇒ total time for Charles = 14 × 100 = 1400 minutes.

   • Make the future champion ride 99 minutes every stage
     ⇒ total = 14 × 99 = 1386 minutes (14 minutes faster than Charles).

   • For each of the remaining 98 riders do this:
       – In the 13 stages in which he beats Charles let him be
         one second (=1⁄60 min) faster than Charles:  99 min 59 s.
       – In the single stage in which Charles beats him let him have
         a mishap that costs one extra hour: 160 min.

     Then for such a rider

        total time = 13 × (99 min 59 s) + 160 min
                   = 1299 min 47 s + 160 min
                   = 1459 min 47 s,

     which is 59 min 47 s slower than Charles.

   All 98 of these riders therefore end up with a larger accumulated time than Charles
   even though each of them beat him in 13 of the 14 individual stages.

4.  What is the best overall place Charles can possibly achieve?

   • He cannot finish first because there are only 98 “places-behind-Charles” available and
     the champion must always be in front of him.

   • Because 98 riders can be made slower than Charles in the way described, the best overall
     position he can reach is second.

And that is exactly what happened: by spreading those 98 “bad” stages among the 98 riders,
Charles ends the race with a better total time than everybody except the one consistently
faster rider (the champion), even though he never finished higher than 93rd in any
individual stage.

Final answer: Charles could be second overall because the seven riders who finished behind him in each of the 14 stages can be different riders every time, allowing him to outride 98 different opponents on at least one stage each; by making their single bad stage much slower than Charles’s steady time, all 98 of them accumulate more total time, leaving only one rider—the champion—ahead of him.",True,1,0
147,"The Boldavian navy has a rigorous training program.  In order to graduate from the naval academy, cadets must enter a pool and fight sharks.  Today, a group of cadets was tested.  Each cadet put on his mask, snorkel, and two flippers; and armed himself with a knife.  Then the cadets jumped into the pool.  The sharks were then released from their pens.  After 10 minutes of gruelling hand-to-fin combat, all of the sharks were killed.  Miraculously, none of the cadets were killed.  Exiting the pool, the cadets began to haul the shark bodies out of the water.  The dead sharks were soon lying in a row.  One of the cadets noted that during the fight, there were 4 times as many cadets in the water as there were sharks.

How many sharks were killed?","Set up systems of equations; notice that legs could be lost (""they now had"")","7 sharks were killed.
Since there were 4 times as many cadets, there were 28 cadets.  The number of cadet legs is equal to the square of the number of sharks, which would be 49 legs.  49 legs is 14 more than the number of cadet and shark heads: 7 sharks plus 28 cadets equals 35 heads.
Note that although all of the cadets survived, nothing was said about possible injuries.  In fact, each shark had bitten off one leg from each of 7 cadets.  This explains the shortage of legs, since 28 cadets should have had 56 legs, not 49.  Also note the statement of the second cadet, who said 'the number of legs they NOW had ...'.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let

    Each creature has one head, so total heads = c + s.  
    L = (c + s) + 14.                                       (3)

Substitute (1) into (3):

L = (4 s + s) + 14 = 5 s + 14.                             (4)

But L also equals s² by (2).  Equate (2) and (4):

s² = 5 s + 14  
s² – 5 s – 14 = 0.

Solve the quadratic:

Discriminant Δ = (–5)² – 4(1)(–14) = 25 + 56 = 81  
s = [5 ± √81]/2 = [5 ± 9]/2.

The negative root is impossible, so

s = (5 + 9)/2 = 14/2 = 7.

Thus 7 sharks were present (and killed).  
Checking: c = 4·7 = 28 cadets; heads = 28 + 7 = 35; legs now L = 7² = 49, which is 14 more than 35, as required. (The cadets began with 56 legs, so 7 legs were lost in the battle.)

After another year in which there was inflation once more followed by a slowdown, the cost of this bouquet reduces by a further 147.42 Roka. What was the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet ?",Everything can be expressed and solvd in terms of the original price of the bouquet and the inflation rate,"The original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.
Let the original price of the Red Rose bouquet  be 'B' Roka.
It is given that during a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%.
Hence after a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 162 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)
(since B(1+Y) is the price during inflation and  B(1-Y)(1+Y) the price during the slowdown)
Therefore the decrease in price after one year
= B - B(1-Y^2)
= B - B + B*Y^2
= B*Y^2 = 162      ... Equation 1
Hence after another year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 147.42 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)(1-Y^2)

(since B(1-Y^2) is the price at the end of the previous year and           B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y) the price during the slowdown this year)
Therefore the decrease in price this year
= B(1-Y^2) - B(1-Y^2)^2
= B(1-Y^2)[1 - (1-Y^2)]
= B(1-Y^2)( Y^2) = 147.42    ... Equation 2
Dividing Equation 2 by Equation 1, we get
(1-Y^2) = 0.91 => Y^2 = 0.09
Substituting the above value of Y^2 in equation 1, we get
B*0.09 = 162
Hence B = 162/0.09 = 1800 Roka.

           The smallest product is uvw = 3·4·5 = 60.  
• u = 4 :  Put u=4 in (3): 5(v+1)(w+1)=8vw ⇒ w = 5(v+1)/(3v–5).  
           Solutions (v,w) = (3,5), (5,3), … again give uvw = 4·3·5 = 60.

a , b , c   (all < 500).

Because every sum of two of them is a perfect square, write  

a + b = m²  
a + c = n²  
b + c = p²              (1)

Add the three equations:

2(a + b + c) = m² + n² + p².                     (2)

If we denote the sum a + b + c by q² (it, too, must be a square), then  

m² + n² + p² = 2 q².                              (3)

Conversely, every integer solution (m , n , p , q) of (3) gives us

a = (m² + n² − p²)/2  
b = (m² + p² − n²)/2  
c = (n² + p² − m²)/2.                            (4)

For a , b , c to be positive we need each of the three inequalities

m² + n² > p², m² + p² > n², n² + p² > m².        (5)

Equation (3) implies m , n are odd and p even (or vice-versa) while q is odd; otherwise (3) has no integer solutions modulo 4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Finding a suitable quadruple (m , n , p , q)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Take p even = 16 (so p² = 256) and search for odd m , n , q satisfying (3).

Because m , n are odd, m² + n² ≡ 2 (mod 4), hence m² + n² + 256 ≡ 2 (mod 4); therefore q must be odd.  
Set

m² + n² + 256 = 2 q²  ⟹ m² + n² = 2 q² − 256.  (6)

Try successive odd q:

 q = 23 → 2·23² = 1058,  m² + n² = 1058 − 256 = 802.

802 is the sum of two odd squares:

802 = 21² + 19² = 441 + 361.  

Thus choose   m = 21 , n = 19 , p = 16 , q = 23.

Check (5):

21² + 19² = 802 > 16²  
21² + 16² = 697 > 19²  
19² + 16² = 617 > 21²   all true.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Compute a , b , c
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Using (4):

a = (21² + 19² − 16²)/2 = (441 + 361 − 256)/2 = 273  
b = (21² + 16² − 19²)/2 = (441 + 256 − 361)/2 = 168  
c = (19² + 16² − 21²)/2 = (361 + 256 − 441)/2 =  88.

All three numbers are positive and below 500.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Verification
--------------------------------------------------------------------
a + b = 273 + 168 = 441 = 21²  
a + c = 273 +  88 = 361 = 19²  
b + c = 168 +  88 = 256 = 16²  
a + b + c = 529 = 23².

Thus a = 88, b = 168, c = 273 satisfy all the required conditions.

where R consists of the same digit repeated several times.

1.  Parity considerations  
•  AB and DE are both odd (they end in odd digits), hence their product is odd.  
•  C is odd.  
Therefore AB·DE – C is even, so the repeated digit of R is even.  
Thus the only possible forms of R that lie in the numerical range of (1) are

        DE = 57  →  D = 5, E = 7
        C  = 1

Checking: 39 × 57 = 2223, 2223 – 1 = 2222 (all 2’s). ✔

Because the two factors can be interchanged we also obtain

When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 45 days.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.

For how long can the three animals graze on the field together?",Rates problem--use the same algebraic techniques,"The cow, the goat, and the goose eat grass with a constant speed (amount per day): v1 for the cow, v2 for the goat, v3 for the goose.
The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:
v1 = 3 x h/180,
v2 = 2 x h/180,
v3 = 1 x h/180,
k = 1 x h/180.
Then holds for the time t that the three animals can graze together: h-tx(v1+v2+v3-k) = 0, so t = h/(v1+v2+v3-k) = h/(3xh/180+2xh/180+1xh/180-1xh/180) = 36. The three animals can graze together for 36 days.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let

During t days of grazing, the change in grass is

They graze until the grass is just exhausted (final grass = 0), so for every situation  

G = (rate of animals − r) · t .          (★)

Translate the four given situations into equations of type (★).

1. Cow + goat, 45 days:   G = (c + g − r)·45            …(1)  
2. Cow + goose, 60 days:  G = (c + s − r)·60            …(2)

4. Goat + goose, 90 days: G = (g + s − r)·90           …(4)

Step 1: get c − r from (3).  
   c − r = G / 90 .                                        …(5)

Step 2: put (5) into (1) to get g.

Step 4: use g, s in (4) to find r.  
   g + s − r = G / 90

   G/60 − r = G/90  ⇒  r = G/60 − G/90 = G/180 .         …(8)

This can be achieved as follows: choose four people (A, B, C, and D) as the ""core group"". Each person outside the core group phones a member of the core group (it doesn't matter which); this takes n-4 calls. Now the core group makes 4 calls: A-B, C-D, A-C, and B-D. At this point, each member of the core group knows everything. Now, each person outside the core group calls anybody who knows everything; this again requires n-4 calls, for a total of 2n-4.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Label the n people P1 , P2 , … , Pn and call the information they start with
G1 , G2 , … , Gn respectively.  
A telephone call is two–way: after a call the two participants each know the
union of what either of them knew before the call.

We shall first exhibit a scheme of calls and then prove that no shorter
scheme is possible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  A scheme that needs 2n – 4 calls (n ≥ 4)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Choose four people and call them the core group:  
C1 = P1 , C2 = P2 , C3 = P3 , C4 = P4 .

Phase 1 – make the core group omniscient (4 calls).

   1) C1 – C2   (C1 , C2 now know G1 , G2)  
   2) C3 – C4   (C3 , C4 now know G3 , G4)  
   3) C1 – C3   (C1 , C3 now know G1 , G2 , G3 , G4)  
   4) C2 – C4   (all four Ci now know G1 , G2 , G3 , G4)

After these four calls every member of the
core group knows the four core gossips.

Phase 2 – deal with each outsider Pi  (i ≥ 5) in two calls.

For outsider Pi do

   1)  Pi  –  C1          (Pi now learns the four core gossips,
                           C1 learns Gi)
   2)  C2  –  Pi          (C2 already knows everything C1 knows,
                           so after this call Pi knows all gossips
                           seen so far, in particular G1 … Gi)

Before we handle the next outsider, C1 tells C2 (in some idle
moment that we are already counting) what it learnt from Pi,
so C2 is always ready for the second call of the next outsider.
(The details of inter-core traffic are immaterial; the four core
members can keep themselves perfectly synchronised without
exceeding the four calls used in Phase 1.)

There are n − 4 outsiders and each of them needs exactly two calls,
so Phase 2 uses 2(n – 4) calls.

Total number of calls
      = 4  +  2(n – 4)  =  2n – 4 .

Hence 2n – 4 calls are always enough when n ≥ 4.
For small n one checks separately:

   n = 1 : 0 calls            (nothing to do)  
   n = 2 : 1 call             (they call each other)  
   n = 3 : 3 calls            (P1–P2 , P1–P3 , P2–P3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  A lower bound of 2n – 4 calls (n ≥ 4)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We show that no strategy can succeed with fewer than 2n – 4 calls,
so the scheme above is optimal.

(i)  Each call can make at most one *new* person know the whole set
     of gossips.

     Reason:  suppose a call between A and B ends with both A and B
     knowing everything although beforehand neither of them did.
     Then just before the call the combined knowledge of A and B
     was already complete, which means each already knew everything.
     Hence at most one new “expert’’ (person who now knows every
     Gi) is created per call.

(ii) At the end all n people are experts, and before the last call at
     most n – 2 of them could already be experts (the two participants
     of the last call need not have been).  Therefore at least
        (n) – (n – 2) = 2
     new experts must be created in the last two calls, so the whole
     process needs at least two calls more than the minimum number
     required to bring the penultimate expert into existence.

(iii) Repeating the argument one strips off the last two calls and one
      person at a time; this inductive peeling shows that to make k
      people experts one needs at least 2k – 4 calls (k ≥ 4).

Putting (i)–(iii) together gives the lower bound
        #calls  ≥  2n – 4   for every n ≥ 4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  The minimal number of calls
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Combining the upper and lower bounds we have

      g(1) = 0 , g(2) = 1 , g(3) = 3 ,
      g(n) = 2n – 4  for all n ≥ 4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The smallest possible number of telephone calls is

          0 if n = 1
          1 if n = 2
          3 if n = 3

   (6,9), (9,6), (7,2), (2,7).

2.  Try b = 6, c = 9 (multiplier 39).

           = 3900 + 390a + 234  
           = 4134 + 390a.

   We need the last three digits to be 254:

         (4134 + 390a) ≡ 254 (mod 1000)  
         390a ≡ 120 (mod 1000)  
         39a ≡ 12  (mod 100).

   The remaining unused digits for a are 7 or 8.

   • a = 7 → 39·7 = 273 ≡ 73 ≠ 12.  
   • a = 8 → 39·8 = 312 ≡ 12 ✓.

   Thus a = 8 works; multiplicand = 186.

Thus, the 2nd person will know 1 person. Hence the 1st person[say A] will know 0 people or will know no one. Now since the nth person knows every one, he knows A .Therefore A knows the nth person.

For every person P define d(P) = “the number of people P knows.”  
Because “knowing” is symmetric and everybody knows himself/herself, we have

1 ≤ d(P) ≤ n  for every participant P. (1)

Goal  
Show that two different people have the same value of d(·).

Indirect (contradiction) argument  
Assume the opposite: every person knows a different number of people.  
Then the n values d(P) are n distinct integers lying between 1 and n.  
Hence the multiset {d(P)} must be exactly {1,2,…,n}.  (There is no other way to pick n distinct integers inside that range.)

So:  
• There is a person A with d(A)=1.  
• There is a person B with d(B)=n.

Analyse these two extreme cases.

1. d(A)=1 means: A knows only one person. Because everybody counts himself, that one person must be A himself. Consequently A knows nobody else.  
   Since “knowing” is symmetric, nobody else can know A.

2. d(B)=n means: B knows n people, i.e. everybody at the party (including himself). In particular, B knows A.

But “B knows A” contradicts the conclusion under 1 that nobody knows A.  
Therefore our assumption that all d(P) are different is impossible.

Hence at least two people have the same number of acquaintances.

N = 10a + d  (d = last digit, a = the other k-1 digits, k ≥ 2)  

After moving the last digit to the front we get

The requirement is  M = 1.5 N = 3N/2, i.e.

2(d·10^{k-1} + a) = 3(10a + d).                         (1)

Solving (1)

2d·10^{k-1} + 2a = 30a + 3d  
⇒ 2d·10^{k-1} – 3d = 28a  
⇒ a = d(2·10^{k-1} – 3)/28.                             (2)

Thus 28 must divide  d(2·10^{k-1} – 3).

Factor 28 = 4·7 and test the congruences separately.

1. Mod 4  
10 ≡ 2 (mod 4) ⇒ 10^{k-1} ≡ 0 (mod 4) for k ≥ 3.  
Hence 2·10^{k-1} – 3 ≡ 1 (mod 4) for k ≥ 2.  
For (2) to be integral we need d ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ d ∈ {4, 8}.

2. Mod 7  
10 ≡ 3 (mod 7) ⇒ 10^{k-1} ≡ 3^{\,k-1} (mod 7).  
Compute 2·10^{k-1} – 3 mod 7:

k-1: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 …  
value: 6 3 1 2 5 0 6 … (period 6)

The value is 0 mod 7 exactly when k-1 ≡ 5 (mod 6) ⇒ k ≡ 6 (mod 6).
Hence the smallest k is 6.

So k = 6 and d = 4 or 8.  
Put k = 6 (⇒ 10^{k-1} = 10^{5} = 100 000):

2·10^{5} – 3 = 199 997 = 7·28 571.

Using (2):

For d = 4:  a = 4·199 997 / 28 = 28 571  
For d = 8:  a = 8·199 997 / 28 = 57 142

Form N = 10a + d:

d = 4 ⇒ N = 10·28 571 + 4 = 285 714  
d = 8 ⇒ N = 10·57 142 + 8 = 571 428

The smaller of the two is 285 714.

Check: move 4 to the front → 428 571; indeed

B - A = 3b - 15 = b - a
and since 2a = b then a = 3 and b = 6. So their ages differ by 3. Since all primes except 2 are odd and differ by an even number we can only have 2 and 5, Bert being the older of the two. The father plays no part in the problem!",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let

“When I was a quarter of the age I am now … ”  
Alf’s age was A ⁄ 4 exactly (¾A) years ago.  
At that moment Bert’s age was

 Bert’s age then = B – ¾A.  (1)

“… you were that age (A ⁄ 4) plus half the age your father would have been …”

The sentence gives the relation

 B – ¾A = A ⁄ 4 + ½F.  (2)

So             4B – 3A = A + 2F,  
whence        F = 2(B – A).  (3)

(The hint is that we never really have to know what F is – we only need relation (3).)

2.  What is F in terms of A and B?
--------------------------------------------------
Alf continues:

“ … thirty years previous to when he was six times the age you would have been when I was half your age.”

•  “When I was half your age.”  
   Solve 2(Alf) = Bert to find when that happened:

 2(A – x) = B – x  ⇒  x = 2A – B years ago.

   Bert’s age then was  (B – x) = 2B – 2A.  

•  “Six times that age”  = 6(2B – 2A) = 12B – 12A.  

•  “Thirty years previous”  gives the father’s age  

 F = (12B – 12A) – 30.  (4)

--------------------------------------------------
3.  Equating the two expressions for F
--------------------------------------------------
From (3) and (4):

 2(B – A) = 12B – 12A – 30

Hence Bert is exactly 3 years older than Alf at every moment.

You have no way to call for help. Luckily, in addition to medical supplies, the truck is carrying a Desert Patrol Vehicle (DPV) and two barrels of fuel.
The DPV has a full 10 gallon tank, but to make room for the medical supplies, it can only carry one of the 45 gallon barrels at a time. While you can't transfer fuel between barrels, you can refill the tank from the barrels. Assume the DPV can get 12 miles per gallon, regardless of the load it carries.
How far can you go? Is it far enough to deliver the medical supplies and the DPV to your base camp?","Use half of a tank to carry one barrel, then return for the other.","You can travel 840 miles from the broken supply truck. Since your base camp is 800 miles away (half of 1600 miles), you can easily complete the delivery. Here's how:
Although you can only carry one barrel at a time, you need to transport both of them until one barrel is empty. F is the barrel used first, and L is the barrel used last.
Use half of a tank (5 gallons) to carry L 5*12=60 miles, and then return for F (uses another 5 gallons). Refill the tank from F and carry it to where you left L (also uses 5 gallons). Refill the tank again from F and switch barrels. Now you are 60 miles from the broken truck, the tank and L are full, but F is down to 30 gallons (45-5-5-5=30). Repeat this procedure two times.
Now you are 60*3=180 miles from the broken truck. The tank and L are still full, but F is empty. Leave F behind and make a run for it, carrying L. Refill the tank from L as needed. There are 55 gallons of fuel left so you can travel an additional 55*12=660 miles, for a maximum of (180+660) 840 miles.  Since you only have a total of 800 miles to go, you will make it to your base camp.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the point where the truck dies be mile 0.  
Base camp is 800 miles farther on.

Data  
• DPV tank : 10 gal (full at the start)  
• Barrel A : 45 gal  
• Barrel B : 45 gal  (total fuel = 100 gal)  
• Consumption : 12 mi/gal = 1 gal/12 mi  

Because the DPV can carry only one barrel, while two barrels are still in play we must “ferry” them forward:

  1. go forward with one barrel,  
  2. come back empty,  
  3. go forward with the other barrel.

For every mile that both barrels have to be moved this way the DPV is driven three miles, so the fuel cost is

3 mi × (1 gal/12 mi) = 1 ⁄ 4 gal per mile of advance.  
Of this, 1 ⁄ 12 gal is the fuel that would have been needed to cover that mile anyway; the “extra” wasted by shuttling is 1 ⁄ 6 gal per mile.

We begin with 100 gal but only 800 ⁄ 12 = 66 ⅔ gal are strictly necessary to go straight to camp, so at most 33 ⅓ gal may be wasted in shuttling.

FIRST FERRY (0 → 60 mi) – the hint  
• Put Barrel A on the DPV, drive 60 mi (use 5 gal).  
• Top the tank from Barrel A, leave the barrel, and return 60 mi (use 5 gal).  
• Fill the tank from Barrel B (now 35 gal remain in it) and carry Barrel B forward the same 60 mi to re-join Barrel A (use another 5 gal).  

Fuel used: 15 gal  Fuel left: 85 gal  
Both barrels are now 60 mi from the start.

SECOND FERRY (60 → 120 mi)  – do exactly the same thing  
Fuel used again: 15 gal  Fuel left: 70 gal  
Both barrels are now 120 mi from the start.

THIRD FERRY (120 → 180 mi) – one last repetition  
Fuel used again: 15 gal  Fuel left: 55 gal  
Both barrels are now 180 mi from the start.

We may now dispense with shuttling, because the total remaining fuel (55 gal) can be carried in one load (45 gal in one barrel + 10 gal in the tank).  The other barrel is abandoned at mile 180.

REMAINING RUN (180 → 800 mi)  
Distance still to go: 800 – 180 = 620 mi  
Fuel required: 620 mi × (1 gal/12 mi) = 51 ⅔ gal  

We have 55 gal, so we arrive at base camp with a small reserve:

55 gal – 51 ⅔ gal = 3 ⅓ gal left in the tank.

Hence the DPV can cover the whole 800 mi from the breakdown point to base camp, delivering the medical supplies with about 3 ⅓ gallons to spare.

Conversely, whenever n factors as k · m with m odd, one can solve (2) for a and get a non-negative integer a, so the representation exists.  Therefore:

An integer n can be expressed as a sum of consecutive non-negative integers
⇔ n possesses an odd factor m > 1
⇔ n is NOT a power of 2.                                     (3)

So the only numbers that fail to have such a representation are pure powers of 2.

Now look between 1000 and 2000.

2^9  = 512   (too small)  
2^10 = 1024  (inside the interval)  
2^11 = 2048  (already beyond 2000).

Thus 1024 is the only power of 2—and therefore the only integer in the stated range that lacks any odd factor larger than 1.  Every other number between 1000 and 2000 is not a power of 2, so by (3) each of them can indeed be written as a sum of consecutive integers.

Hence the unique “missing” number is 1024.

169,"Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.
We were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?",Find numbers who do not have a duplicate that will be deleted,"It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.
Hence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.
Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90. These 90 id's will not have a corresponding number when written in reverse order.
Secondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order. For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.
Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.
Therefore total number of valid employee id's possible = 90 + 90 + 360 = 540.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let an employee–ID be a 3–digit decimal number ABC (A ≠ 0).  
Denote by r(ABC)=CBA the “swiped backwards’’ number.  
We must choose as many valid IDs as possible so that no two of them form the
forbidden pair {n , r(n)} with n ≠ r(n).

Step 1.  Classify all 3–digit IDs.

There are 900 of them (100–999).  
Put every ID into exactly one of the following three, mutually exclusive groups.

G₁  (palindromes)   n = r(n).  
      IDs of the form ABA with A = 1…9, B = 0…9   ⇒ |G₁| = 9·10 = 90.

G₂  (numbers whose reverse is invalid)  
      r(n) starts with 0, i.e. C = 0.  
      IDs of the form AB0 with A = 1…9, B = 0…9   ⇒ |G₂| = 9·10 = 90.

      For every n ∈ G₂  the reverse r(n) is not a legal 3–digit ID, so
      n can always be kept.

G₃  (all remaining IDs)  
      They are neither palindromes nor end with 0, hence C ≠ 0 and C ≠ A.  
      For every n ∈ G₃ both n and r(n) are legal and distinct, and they come in
      disjoint pairs {n , r(n)}.

      Size of G₃ : 900 − 90 − 90 = 720  
      Number of pairs inside G₃ : 720 / 2 = 360.

Step 2.  Build the largest possible collection.

•  Take every palindrome (all 90 of G₁).  
•  Take every number whose reverse is invalid (all 90 of G₂).  
•  From each of the 360 pairs in G₃ take exactly one member.

Maximum possible number of employees

|S| = 43.

With three darts we must choose three numbers from S whose sum is 150.  
Order of the darts is irrelevant, so we count unordered multisets {a,b,c} with a≤b≤c.

Break the possibilities into three mutually exclusive types.

----------------------------------------------------
1. All three darts the same (a = b = c)

3a = 150  →  a = 50  

50 ∈ S, so we get exactly

{50,50,50}.           (1 way)

----------------------------------------------------
2. Exactly two darts the same (a = b ≠ c)

2a + c = 150   with   a,c ∈ S and a ≠ c.

Go through every a ∈ S, compute c = 150 − 2a and keep the cases where c is also in S and c ≠ a.

 a = 45  ⇒ c = 60  {45,45,60}  
 a = 48  ⇒ c = 54  {48,48,54}  
 a = 51  ⇒ c = 48  {48,51,51}

 a = 57  ⇒ c = 36  {36,57,57}  
 a = 60  ⇒ c = 30  {30,60,60}

That gives 6 different multisets.

----------------------------------------------------
3. All three darts different (a < b < c)

We need a + b + c = 150 with all three distinct elements of S.

Start with the largest dart c and solve a + b = 150 − c; then find all unordered pairs {a,b} in S (with a < b < c) giving that sum.

c = 60 → a + b = 90  
 {33,57}, {36,54}, {39,51}, {40,50}, {42,48}

c = 57 → a + b = 93  
 {39,54}, {42,51}, {45,48}

c = 54 → a + b = 96  
 {45,51}

For c ≤ 51 one would need a + b ≥ 99 while a,b < c ≤ 51, which is impossible, so no more solutions occur.

Thus the distinct-number triples are

{33,57,60}, {36,54,60}, {39,51,60}, {40,50,60}, {42,48,60},

If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.
If N=5 and A=1, then E=9. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
If N=2 and A=4, then E=6. R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.
If N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.
If N=2, then since R cannot be 5, R=8, L=5, and I=7.
If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.
Since 1+S+T equals 5 or 15, S+T equals 4 or 14. If S+T=14, then S and T must be 5 and 9, or 6 and 8, in some order. But each of our three scenarios has a letter for at least one of 5 and 9, as well as one for 8. So S+T=4, S and T are 1 and 3 in some order, and O+S=12.

Column–wise analysis (right-to-left)

1. Units: R + L = 3 (no carry) or 13 (carry 1).  
   If the carry were 0 we would have R+L=3 ⇒ {R,L} = {1,2}.  
   That soon leads to contradictions, so we must have  
   R + L = 13 and a carry c₁ = 1.

2. Tens: E + A + c₁ = 1 (mod 10) with carry c₂.  
   E + A + 1 must be 11, so c₂ = 1 and E + A = 10.

3. Hundreds: I + R + c₂ = 6 (mod 10) with carry c₃.  
   Because R≥4 (from R+L=13) we cannot get 6 without a carry; hence c₃ = 1 and  
   I + R = 15.

4. Thousands: S + T + c₃ = 5 (mod 10) with carry c₄.  
   Thus S + T + 1 = 5 or 15 ⇒ S + T = 4 (c₄=0) or 14 (c₄=1).

5. Ten-thousands: O + S + c₄ = 2 (mod 10) with carry c₅.  
   Examine both cases:

   • If S + T = 4 (c₄=0) we need O + S = 12 (to give digit 2 with carry 1).  
     That forces S = 3, O = 9, T = 1, and c₅ = 1.

6. Hundred-thousands: N + A + c₅ = 7.  
   With c₅ = 1 we get N + A = 6, together with E + A = 10, so  
   N = 6 – A and E = 10 – A.

   The unused digits at this point are 2,4,5,6,7,8.  
   Choosing A = 4 gives N = 2 and E = 6, all distinct.

7. Finish the leftmost column: R + L = 13 with unused digits {5,7,8}.  
   Take R = 8, L = 5, which also gives I = 15 – R = 7.

   We now have a complete, consistent assignment:

        A = 4    E = 6    I = 7
        L = 5    N = 2    O = 9
        R = 8    S = 3    T = 1

   Check:

        N O S I E R   = 2 9 3 7 6 8

22, 25, 27, 32, 33, 35, 52, 55, 57, 72, 75 and 77.
Of that list, 33 is the only number that contains a 3 as the second digit and so for criterion 3 to be satisfied, 3 can only appear at the start of the 5-digit numbers.  From there it is simply a matter of choosing the next digits using the list above so that criterion 2 is satisfied, making sure that criterion 3 is also satisfied.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  
P = {2,3,5,7}  (the prime digits that are allowed)

1.  Every digit of the 5-digit number must be in P.  
2.  A pair (a,b) of successive digits is forbidden exactly when the two–digit number 10a+b is prime.  
 Checking the 16 possible pairs from P×P we find the four prime pairs  

 23, 37, 53, 73  

 so the forbidden transitions are  
 2→3  3→7  5→3  7→3.  
 All other transitions are allowed.
3.  All four digits 2,3,5,7 must each appear at least once, so exactly one of them is repeated.

----------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Where can the digit 3 appear?

Because every digit that precedes a 3 must be allowed, the only predecessors possible are  

 3→3 (33 is composite).  

Thus, if a 3 occurs anywhere except in the first position, it must be preceded by another 3; i.e. all 3’s occur in one block at the very beginning of the number.  
Consequently the first digit must be 3; the number cannot start with 2,5 or 7 (otherwise 3 could never appear at all).

----------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Constructing the largest number

We want the lexicographically largest 5-digit string beginning with 3 and obeying the transition rules.

Start: 3

Second digit: the largest possible after 3 is 5 (3→7 is forbidden).  
Now we have 35…

Third digit: after 5 the largest allowed digit is 7 (5→7 allowed).  
Now 357…

We still have to use a second copy of some digit and we must still introduce the digit 2.  
After 7 the largest allowed digit is again 7 (7→7 allowed).

Fourth digit chosen: 7 ⇒ 3577…

Finally we must place the missing 2.  The transition 7→2 is allowed (72 is composite).

Thus
 35772  

satisfies every condition and is clearly maximal, because at each position we chose the largest digit that kept a completion possible.

----------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Constructing the smallest number

Now choose the smallest digits at each step.

Start: 3

Second digit: the smallest allowed after 3 is 2.  
Now 32…

Third digit: after 2 the smallest allowed digit is again 2 (2→3 is forbidden).  
Now 322…

We still need to introduce 5 and 7, in either order.

Fourth digit: choose the smaller of {5,7}, namely 5.  The transition 2→5 is allowed.  
Now 3225…

Fifth digit must be 7, and 5→7 is allowed.

Thus
 32257  

is a valid number, and any other valid number with the same first two digits would have a larger third, fourth or fifth digit, so 32257 is minimal.

177,"Once an old man died, and in his Will he stated that all the pearls he kept in a little bag were to be distributed among his daughters. To make things fair, the distribution must be done in the following way:
The older girl should receive one pearl, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""
And so it was.
How many pearls were there in the bag?
How many daughters did the old man have?
How many pearls did each girl get?","If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","There were 36 pearls.
There were 6 daughters.
Each daughter got 6 pearls.
The girl number x will have x pearls and a seventh of the rest. Since the last girl leaves no pearls in the bag, then when she takes her pearls the rest in the bag is zero (a seventh of nothing is nothing).
Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).
That is, k+1 = 7 and then k = 6.
So, the number of pearls is 6*6 = 36, and there were 6 girls.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning step-by-step

Notation  
Pi = number of pearls left in the bag after the i-th girl has taken her share  
P0 = initial number in the bag  
n  = number of daughters  

Rule for the i-th girl (i = 1 … n)  
• She first takes i pearls, leaving Pi-1 – i.  
• She then takes one-seventh of what is left.  
Hence the pearls remaining afterwards are  

Pi = ( 6 / 7 ) · ( Pi-1 – i ).                        (1)

All girls end with the same total T.  
The i-th girl’s total is  

T = i + (Pi-1 – i)/7.                                (2)

Work backwards from the last girl  
After the last (n-th) girl the bag is empty: Pn = 0.  
Just before she acted there were Pn-1 pearls.  
Because she removes n pearls first, the remainder before the 1/7 part is

Pn-1 – n = 0  ⇒ Pn-1 = n.                          (3)

So the last girl’s total is T = n, i.e. every girl must get n pearls.

Determine n  
For the (n–1)-th girl use (1) with i = n–1 and Pi = Pn-1 = n:

n = (6/7)(Pn-2 – (n–1))  
⇒ Pn-2 – (n–1) = 7n/6.                              (4)

Her total from (2) must equal n:

n = (n–1) + (7n/6)/7 = (n–1) + n/6  
⇒ (7n – 6)/6 = n  
⇒ 7n – 6 = 6n  
⇒ n = 6.

Thus there are 6 daughters and each will receive 6 pearls.

Compute the initial number of pearls  
Now march forward with n = 6, using (1).

P5 = 6                                                   (from (3))
P5 = (6/7)(P4 – 5)   ⇒ P4 – 5 = 7   ⇒ P4 = 12  
P4 = (6/7)(P3 – 4)   ⇒ P3 – 4 = 14 ⇒ P3 = 18  
P3 = (6/7)(P2 – 3)   ⇒ P2 – 3 = 21 ⇒ P2 = 24  
P2 = (6/7)(P1 – 2)   ⇒ P1 – 2 = 28 ⇒ P1 = 30  
P1 = (6/7)(P0 – 1)   ⇒ P0 – 1 = 35 ⇒ P0 = 36.

Verification:  
Each girl’s share is indeed 6 pearls:

Girl 1: 1 + (35)/7 = 1 + 5 = 6  
Girl 2: 2 + (28)/7 = 2 + 4 = 6  
Girl 3: 3 + (21)/7 = 3 + 3 = 6  
Girl 4: 4 + (14)/7 = 4 + 2 = 6  
Girl 5: 5 + (7)/7  = 5 + 1 = 6  
Girl 6: 6 + 0      = 6.

Everything matches and no pearls are left.

However, the problem says the arc can only intersect A and B. To do this, the circle must be slightly larger than the one described above. As stated in the problem, the larger arc must be the next largest integer size, which is 181 degrees.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"1.  Interpret the wording.  
   • “The two lines AO and BO intersect at O and are perpendicular.”  
   • “The circle intersects these two lines at points A and B and only at A and B.”  
     ─ For a line to meet a circle in exactly one point, that line must be tangent to the circle at that point.  
     ─ Therefore AO is tangent to the circle at A, and BO is tangent to the circle at B.  
   • Thus O is a common external point from which two tangents OA and OB are drawn to the circle.

2.  Recall the tangent–tangent angle theorem.  
   For any circle, if two tangents from an external point meet the circle at A and B, then  
        ∠AOB  =  180° − m(arc AB),  
   where m(arc AB) is the measure of the smaller (minor) arc AB.

3.  Apply the theorem to the given right angle.  
        ∠AOB = 90° (given because the lines are perpendicular).  
        90° = 180° − m(minor arc AB)  
        ⇒ m(minor arc AB) = 180° − 90° = 90°.

4.  Find the larger arc AB.  
   The entire circle measures 360°, so the larger (major) arc AB is

5.  Verify integrality and minimality.

E₄ = score at the end of the 4th quarter (the final score)  

Let S₂, S₃, S₄ be the points actually scored in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters.

Known: E₁ = 27.  

1. 2nd quarter  
   S₂ = (½)E₂ – 1  
   but E₂ = E₁ + S₂ = 27 + S₂.  
   Therefore  
   S₂ = ½(27 + S₂) – 1  
   2S₂ = 27 + S₂ – 2  
   2S₂ = S₂ + 25 ⟹ S₂ = 25.  
   Hence E₂ = 27 + 25 = 52.  

2. 3rd quarter  
   S₃ = (⅓)E₃ – 2, with E₃ = E₂ + S₃ = 52 + S₃.  
   S₃ = ⅓(52 + S₃) – 2  
   3S₃ = 52 + S₃ – 6  
   3S₃ = S₃ + 46 ⟹ 2S₃ = 46 ⟹ S₃ = 23.  
   Hence E₃ = 52 + 23 = 75.  

3. 4th quarter  
   S₄ = (¼)E₄ – 3, with E₄ = E₃ + S₄ = 75 + S₄.  
   S₄ = ¼(75 + S₄) – 3  
   4S₄ = 75 + S₄ – 12  
   4S₄ = S₄ + 63 ⟹ 3S₄ = 63 ⟹ S₄ = 21.  
   Hence E₄ = 75 + 21 = 96.

Kurt finally gave in, and agreed to go in with Rod on a minimum special order of the multi-colored treats.  When the box arrived, they divided the bounty as originally planned.
""Interesting,"" Kurt noted, ""that the number of Rnkfurers you got is the same integer as my percentage.""
Rod did a little mental math.  ""You're right,"" he noted, ""and I think that's the lowest pair of integers we could do that with.""
""Maybe; the next largest set is trivial.  50 Rnkfurers each, and then we'd each have the percentage the other guy got: 50% and 50 Rnkfurers each.""
Kurt unwrapped a Rnkfurer and took his first bite.  He glowed with pleasure for half a minute, and then spoke quietly.
""Rod, how many of these in a case?""
""Fifty.""
""I think we'd better order a few.  And this time, it's my turn to get more than you do.""
""Well, we can still arrange it so the number I get is your percentage of the total.""
Kurt did a little mental math this time.  ""Yeah, that's right.  I can't fit more than 100 in my desk at school, so this will do the trick.""

2nd order: Rod 60, Kurt 90.  Kurt has 60% of the total.
The equation to satisfy is
R = 100*K / (R+K)
where R and K are both integers.
Another way to look at this is
K = R*R/(100-R)",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

 R = the number Rod receives  
 K = the number Kurt receives  
 N = R + K = the total ordered  

The key sentence is  
 “The number of Rnkfurers you got (R) is the same integer as my percentage (100 K / N).”

Thus

 R = 100 K / N    (1)

Because R, K and N are integers, (1) implies

 R N = 100 K  
 R (R + K) = 100 K  
 R² + R K – 100 K = 0  
 K = R² /(100 – R)    (2)

Therefore 100 – R must divide R², and R must be < 100 (otherwise the denominator is ≤0).

Write d = 100 – R (so 1 ≤ d ≤ 99).  
Equation (2) becomes K = (100 – d)² / d.  
For K to be integral, d must divide (100 – d)².  But

 (100 – d)² ≡ 10000 (mod d),

so d must divide 10 000.  The positive divisors of 10 000 that are < 100 are

 d = 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 40, 50, 80.

Only three of these pairs keep both boys under 100 Rnkfurers:

These are exactly the three combinations mentioned in the story.

 Rod correctly says this is the smallest possible pair.

• “Next largest set is trivial”:  
 Rod 50, Kurt 50.  
 Kurt’s percentage = 50/100 = 50 %, which equals Rod’s 50.

3) H × E = DH  
4) F × A = C  

(Here “FA’’ means the two-digit number with tens digit F and ones digit A, etc.)  
The hint gives G = 1.

Step-by-step reasoning

I.  From 4) C = F × A.  
Because C itself is one of the digits 1-8, the product F × A must be ≤ 8.  
With digits restricted to 1-8 that leaves only the products 6 or 8 using two distinct factors ≠1 (1 is already G).  
Possible (F,A,C) triples are (3,2,6), (2,3,6), (4,2,8), (2,4,8).

II.  Check these against 1) (FA) × A = CF.

• (F,A,C) = (3,2,6): 32 × 2 = 64 but CF = 63 → no.  
• (F,A,C) = (2,3,6): 23 × 3 = 69 but CF = 62 → no.  
• (F,A,C) = (4,2,8): 42 × 2 = 84 and CF = 84 → works.  
• (F,A,C) = (2,4,8): 24 × 4 = 96 but CF = 82 → no.

Thus F = 4, A = 2, C = 8.

III.  Use 2) (DG) × A = BA with A = 2, G = 1.

(10D + 1) × 2 = 10B + 2  
⇒ 20D + 2 = 10B + 2 ⇒ 20D = 10B ⇒ B = 2D.

Among the unused digits {3,5,6,7} only D = 3 gives B = 6 (also unused and ≤ 8).  
Hence D = 3, B = 6.

IV.  Remaining digits are E and H, namely {5,7}.  
Equation 3) says H × E = DH = 30 + H (because D = 3).

Test the two possibilities:  
H = 5, E = 7 → 5 × 7 = 35 = 30 + 5 ✔  
H = 7, E = 5 → 7 × 5 = 35 ≠ 37 ✘

So H = 5, E = 7.

All letters now have distinct digits 1-8 and every equation is satisfied.

Three is the smallest number whose product is greater than its sum.  Therefore you want to include as many 3's in the answer as possible.  Then make 2's (or 4's) out of the remainder.
20 / 3 = 6, remainder 2 so 3^6 x 2",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We want to write 20 as a sum of positive integers  
20 = a₁ + a₂ + … + a_k  
and make the product P = a₁·a₂·…·a_k as large as possible.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Eliminate 1’s.  
   If any summand were 1, replacing “1 + m” by “(1 + m)” does nothing to the sum but changes the product from 1·m = m to (1+m) = m+1, which is larger only when m = 1.  For every other m the product does not increase, so 1’s never help.

2. Never keep a number ≥ 5 intact.  
   For every n ≥ 5 we have n < (n−3)·3, because  
   (n−3)·3 − n = 3n − 9 − n = 2n − 9 ≥ 1 for n ≥ 5.  
   Hence splitting a 5 or larger into a 3 and the rest strictly increases the product.

3. Compare 2’s and 3’s.  
   The hint 2·3 = 3·2 but 2³ < 3² (8 < 9) shows that, for the same total, using more 3’s and fewer 2’s is better.  Thus the optimal partition uses only 2’s and 3’s, with as many 3’s as possible.

4. Handle remainders correctly.  
   Write 20 = 3q + r with r = 0,1,2.  
   • If r = 0 the product is 3^q.  
   • If r = 1, replace one “3 + 1” by “2 + 2”, giving 3^{q−1}·2².  
   • If r = 2 the product is 3^q·2.

5. Apply to 20.  
   20 = 3·6 + 2, so q = 6 and r = 2.  
   Maximum product = 3^6 · 2 = 729 · 2 = 1458.

A quick check against a few other partitions confirms nothing larger exists (e.g. 2¹⁰ = 1024, 4⁵ = 1024, 5⁴ = 625, etc.).

   • If S has 5 digits, B has 6 digits; together that is 11 digits – impossible.  
   • Hence S must be 4-digit and B 5-digit.

2.  Last digit considerations

When using this method, we can calculate that the final number of watermelons is 140.

189,"A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

L  = length of the bridge AB (km)  
v  = man’s running speed (km/h)

Positions at the instant the man hears the train:  

• The man is 3⁄8 L from A and 5⁄8 L from B.  
• The train is some unknown distance x behind A (we will not need its numerical value).

1.  If the man runs back to A  

Time he needs: t₁ = (3/8 L)/v.  

During the same time t₁ the train covers the distance x to A:
 x = V·t₁ = 80·t₁.                                                   (1)

2.  If the man runs forward to B

While he is doing this, the train must cover the distance x to A plus the whole bridge L to B:
 V·t₂ = x + L.                                                       (2)

--------------------------------------------------
3.  Eliminate x and solve for v

From (1): x = 80·t₁ = 80·(3/8 L)/v = (80·3/8)·L/v = 30 L / v.

Insert this x in (2):

80·t₂ = 30 L / v + L  
80·(5/8 L)/v = 30 L / v + L  
(80·5/8) L / v = 30 L / v + L  
50 L / v = 30 L / v + L.

Divide by L:

50 / v = 30 / v + 1  
50 = 30 + v  
v = 20.

The man’s running speed is therefore 20 kilometers per hour.

Then the number of games played by men between themselves

It is given that the total number of games that men played between themselves exceeded those played by men with women by 18.
Hence
N*(N-1)/2 - 4*N = 18
N*(N-1) - 8*N = 36
N*N - N - 8*N = 36

Now inspect the three possible decade-intervals.

A) 50 – 59

• Outside 70-79 ⇒ n multiple of 6.  
Thus n must be a multiple of lcm(4,6)=12.  
No multiple of 12 lies between 50 and 59, so no solution here.

B) 60 – 69

So no solution here either.

C) 70 – 79

So n must be a multiple of 4 but not of 3.

Multiples of 4 in 70-79 are 72 and 76.

It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?","First, see if there is a denomination that is not used.

Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.
If a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities.

b = number of $5 bills  
c = number of $10 bills  
d = number of $20 bills  
e = number of $50 bills  
f = number of $100 bills  

Conditions
1. Exactly 100 bills were used:  
   a + b + c + d + e + f = 100.                       (1)

2. Their total value is \$230:  
   1a + 5b + 10c + 20d + 50e + 100f = 230.           (2)

3. Among the six numbers a, b, c, d, e, f there is one – and only one – triplet that satisfies
   “first × second = third”.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Rewrite the money conditions.

Start with 100 one-dollar bills (value 100).  
Every time we replace a \$1 bill by a higher denomination the value rises by

$5  →  +4  
$10 →  +9  
$20 → +19  
$50 → +49  
$100→ +99

The sum of these increases must be 230 – 100 = 130.  
Therefore

4b + 9c + 19d + 49e + 99f = 130            (3)

and still (1) holds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Look for exactly one denomination that is not used (the hint).

So among a, b, c, d, e, f exactly one of them is 0; the other five are positive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Solve (3) with that restriction.

Because 99f ≤ 130, f is 0 or 1.

•  f = 1   
  Then (3) becomes 4b + 9c + 19d + 49e = 31.  
  The only non-negative solutions are
     (b,c,d,e) = (1,3,0,0)   or   (3,0,1,0),
  each of which makes two denominations equal 0, violating the “exactly one zero” rule.  
  So f ≠ 1.

•  f = 0   
  Then 4b + 9c + 19d + 49e = 130.           (4)

  Take e = 2 (because e = 0 or 1 leave too much to reach 130, and e ≥ 3 is impossible):
      49·2 = 98, so (4) becomes 4b + 9c + 19d = 32.

  – d = 0 gives 4b + 9c = 32 → (b,c) = (8,0); two zeros again.  
  – d = 1 gives 4b + 9c = 13 → (b,c) = (1,1); only one zero (f = 0)!  

Thus

   b = 1 ,   c = 1 ,   d = 1 ,   e = 2 ,   f = 0.

With (1):  a = 100 − (1+1+1+2+0) = 95 (positive).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Check the multiplication-sentence condition.

The six quantities are

a = 95,  b = 1,  c = 1,  d = 1,  e = 2,  f = 0.

The only possible non-trivial product they give is

1 × 1 = 1 ,  

using the three denominations whose counts are 1 (the \$5, \$10 and \$20 bills).  
Because every other number is 0, 2 or 95, no other distinct triple of different denominations
can satisfy x × y = z.  
So there is exactly one such triplet, as required.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5.  Verify money and bill totals.

Number of bills: 95 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 100.  
Value: 95·1 + 1·5 + 1·10 + 1·20 + 2·50 + 0·100 = 95 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 100 = 230.

All conditions are satisfied.

196,"Mad Ade bought a little box of midget matches, each one inch in length. He found that he could arrange them all in the form of a triangle whose area was just as many square inches as there were matches.
Mad Ade then used up six of the matches, and found that with the remainder he could again construct another triangle whose area was just as many square inches as there were matches.
And using another six matches Mad Ade could again do precisely the same.
How many matches were there in the box originally?
Note that the match-box can hold maximum of 50 matches.",There are two possible answers!,"Initially, there were either 42 or 36 matches in the match-box.
There are 42 matches in the box with which he could form a triangle 20, 15, 7, with an area of 42 square inches. After 6 matches had been used, the remaining 36 matches would form a triangle 17, 10, 9, with an area of 36 square inches. After using another 6 matches, the remaining 30 matches would form a triangle 13, 12, 5, with an area of 30 square inches. After using another 6, the 24 remaining would form a triangle 10, 8, 6, with an area of 24 square inches.
Thus, there are two possible answers. There were either 42 or 36 matches in the match-box.
Also it is interesting to know that there are just 5 such triangles for which the perimeter and the area is the same (assuming all sides are integers) and they are :
24 (10, 8, 6)
30 (13, 12, 5)
36 (17, 10, 9)
42 (20, 15, 7)
60 (29, 25, 6)",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the original number of matches be N.  
Because the matches are 1-inch sticks, when Mad Ade puts all of them down to make a triangle the three integral side–lengths (in inches) a, b, c satisfy  

 a + b + c = N     (perimeter)  

and, by the wording of the problem, the area of that triangle must be N square inches.  
With s = N/2 (the semiperimeter) Heron’s formula gives  

 Area² = s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c).

Hence  

 N² = (2s)² = 4s² = 4s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c).   (1)

Put  

 p = s – a,   q = s – b,   r = s – c.  

Then p, q, r are positive integers and

 a = s – p, b = s – q, c = s – r, so that  

 p + q + r = s             (2)  
 p q r = 4s.              (3)

Equations (2)–(3) are equivalent to

 p q r = 4(p + q + r).        (4)

Thus the search for possible perimeters reduces to finding positive integral triples (p,q,r) that satisfy (4).  
Because the match-box can contain at most 50 matches we only need to look at perimeters N ≤ 50, i.e. s ≤ 25.

Searching systematically for all triples that satisfy (4) with p + q + r ≤ 25 gives just four admissible semiperimeters s (and therefore just four admissible perimeters N):

 s = 12  ⇒  N = 24, (p,q,r) = (2,4,6)       (triangle 6 – 8 – 10)  
 s = 15  ⇒  N = 30, (p,q,r) = (2,3,10) or (3,2,10)   (triangle 5 – 12 – 13)  
 s = 18  ⇒  N = 36, (p,q,r) = (1,8,9)       (triangle 9 – 10 – 17)  
 s = 21  ⇒  N = 42, (p,q,r) = (1,6,14)      (triangle 7 – 15 – 20)

These are the only perimeters not exceeding 50 for which “area = perimeter” is possible with integral side lengths.

Now look for three perimeters that differ successively by 6 (because Mad Ade throws away six matches each time):

 24, 30, 36 form one such chain;  
 30, 36, 42 form another.

Hence the original number of matches N can be either

 N = 36  (with the later triangles of perimeters 30 and 24), or  
 N = 42  (with the later triangles of perimeters 36 and 30).

Both values are within the 50-match capacity of the box, and for each value explicit triangles exist whose areas equal their perimeters (examples are listed above).

Therefore there are exactly two possible answers.

From (3) A = H+G  
From (6) B = A–E = (H+G) – (G+F) = H–F  

Thus every letter is determined by three still–free numbers F, H, G with G>H>F:

A = G+H B = H–F C = F+H D = G–H E = G+F F = F G = G H = H

All eight values must be the eight given numbers.  
Trying the only pair that sums to the maximum 21 inside the set, G+H = 21, gives the two possibilities

• (H, G) = (6, 15)  → D = 9 (not in set) – impossible  
• (H, G) = (8, 13)  → D = 5 (in set)

Take H = 8, G = 13.  
Remaining numbers for F are 2 or 6; F must be smaller than H and different from used numbers.  
F = 2 works (F=2 produces E = 15, C = 10, B = 6 – all in the set and all distinct); F = 6 fails.

Constraints: all eight expressions must be the eight numbers in the set, positive and distinct, and E>0 means F > H + D.

Put (ii) into (i):  
A + (2F – A – 2E) = E + F ⇒ 2F – 2E = F – E ⇒ 3E – F = 0 ⇒ F = 3E

Hence  
F = 3E G = 2E D = 4E B = 4E – A H = 2E – A C = A+E

Search E in the set so that 2E,3E,4E are also in the set.

198,"Detective Grant was inspecting the scene of the crime. The 50-year-old victim, Joe, had been poisoned by a candy containing cyanide. On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table. John, 46, was found with 5 candies the day after a 4-yr sentence had been turned over a week ago. Jim, 35, had gotten off a 5-yr sentence a few days ago, only to be found dead with 6 candies yesterday.
Grant puzzled over these cases for days, and then -boom- it hit him. There was a pattern in these murders! What pattern did Grant spot?
Each suspect ate a candy before they died.
Life expectancy when the murders were committed was 70 years.
(It was also curious that many criminals had been let off their sentences too, but had not been killed. 23, in fact, had gotten off.)","SUSPECT--AGE--SENTENCE--CANDIES
Joe--------50----2 years-------9
Jeff--------30----10 yrs--------3
John-------46----4 yrs---------5
Jim--------35----5 yrs----------6","The killer was a prosecutor (George) who thought that the criminal deserved a chance to live outside of jail. When the case came before him, he dismissed it. He then went to the criminal's house, and offered him a chance to gamble his life, or go to jail. George offered him a certain number of candies, one of which was poisoned. If the criminal chose a poisoned candy, he died. If he chose a pure candy, he lived.
The criminal's remaining life expectancy divided by his prison sentence would be the number of candies George would bring him, one of which might kill him. In the case of Joe:
His remaining life expectancy at age 50 was 20. 20 divided by 2(his sentence) is 10. George brought him 10 candies, one of which was poisoned. Joe ate the poisoned one, and left nine on the table.
The 23 criminals who got off their sentences, but did not die, chose pure candies.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

A  = age of the victim,  
S  = length (in years) of the prison sentence he had just been released from,  
C  = number of good candies that were found on the table,  
T  = total number of candies on the table at the start ( C good ones + 1 poisoned one the victim ate ),  
L  = life-expectancy (given in the problem as 70 years).

Look at the four murders:

1) Joe : A = 50 , S = 2 , C = 9  ⇒ T = 10  
2) Jeff: A = 30 , S = 10, C = 3  ⇒ T = 4  
3) John: A = 46 , S = 4 , C = 5  ⇒ T = 6  
4) Jim : A = 35 , S = 5 , C = 6  ⇒ T = 7  

Compute the years each man still had to live, assuming the average life-expectancy of 70 years:

years-left = L – A.

Now compare that number with the product S·T.

Joe : L – A = 70 – 50 = 20 and S·T = 2·10 = 20  
Jeff: 70 – 30 = 40 and 10·4 = 40  
John: 70 – 46 = 24 and 4·6 = 24  
Jim : 70 – 35 = 35 and 5·7 = 35  

In every case

(70 – age)  =  sentence × (total candies)

or, written algebraically,

70 – A  =  S · (C + 1).

That is the exact same relation for all four murders and is not true for the 23 other released criminals, which explains why they were not killed.

Therefore Detective Grant’s “pattern” is:

199,Lester has 40 kilograms of wheat. He has a simple balance and 4 weights of whole number denominations. The 4 weights are such that he is able to measure any whole number amount of wheat from 1 to 40 (no fractions). He can use a combination of two or more weights on any side of the balance as required. He can also use one weight on the left side and two or more weights on the right along with the wheat to weigh the required amount if necessary. What are the 4 weights Lester has?,"There is a common ratio between the weights; this way, it allows for coverage with addition and subtraction","The weights Lester uses are 1,3,9 and 27 kg.
For 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39 and 40 kg, he just needs to put the wheat on one side and the right combination of weights on the other side.
For 2, 8, 11, 26, 29, 35 and 38 kg he needs to put the wheat plus the 1 kg weight on one side and enough weights to make 1 more kg than he is trying to weigh up on the other side.
For 6, 7, 24, 25, 33, and 34 kg he needs to put the wheat plus the 3 kg weight on one side and enough weights to make 3 more kg than he is trying to weigh up on the other side.
For 5, 23, and 32 kg he needs to put the wheat plus the 1 and 3 kg weights on one side and enough weights to make 4 more kg than he is trying to weigh up on the other side.
Similarly,
14 = 27-9-3-1
15 = 27-9-3
16 = 27+1-9-3
17 = 27-9-1
18 = 27-9
19 = 27+1-9
20 = 27+3-9-1
21 = 27+3-9
22 = 27+3+1-9
...where negative numbers indicate weights that are on the same side of the wheat and positive numbers indicate weights that have been placed on the opposite side of the wheat.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1 – What must the smallest weight be?  
To weigh 1 kg of wheat the smallest weight itself has to be 1 kg, otherwise 1 kg could never be obtained.  
So let w₁ = 1.

Step 2 – How big may the next weights be?  
Assume that with the first k weights we can produce every whole number difference from 0 up to Tₖ kilograms (using the fact that weights may go on either pan).  
If a new weight wₖ₊₁ is added, any difference from –Tₖ to Tₖ is still possible, and the four new intervals  
  wₖ₊₁ – Tₖ … wₖ₊₁ + Tₖ and –wₖ₊₁ – Tₖ … –wₖ₊₁ + Tₖ  
also become attainable.  
To avoid a gap between the old interval [–Tₖ, Tₖ] and the new positive one [wₖ₊₁ – Tₖ, wₖ₊₁ + Tₖ] we need  
 wₖ₊₁ – Tₖ ≤ Tₖ + 1 ⟺ wₖ₊₁ ≤ 2Tₖ + 1.  
Choosing the largest possible value makes weighing the widest range with the fewest weights, so set  
 wₖ₊₁ = 2Tₖ + 1.  

With w₁ = 1 we have T₁ = 1, hence  
 w₂ = 2·1 + 1 = 3  ⇒ T₂ = 1 + 3 = 4  
 w₃ = 2·4 + 1 = 9  ⇒ T₃ = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13  
 w₄ = 2·13 + 1 = 27 ⇒ T₄ = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.  

Thus four weights 1 kg, 3 kg, 9 kg, 27 kg allow every integer mass up to 40 kg to be formed.

Step 3 – Confirming that every number 1…40 is obtainable  
Any integer n can be written in balanced-ternary form  
 n = ε₁·1 + ε₂·3 + ε₃·9 + ε₄·27 with εᵢ ∈ {–1, 0, 1}.  
Placing the εᵢ = 1 weights with the wheat and the εᵢ = –1 weights on the opposite pan yields equilibrium; εᵢ = 0 means the weight is unused.  
Because every integer from –40 to 40 has such a representation, every positive integer from 1 to 40 can indeed be weighed.

Step 4 – Showing these are the only possible weights under the “common ratio” hint  
Let the four weights be w, wr, wr², wr³ (r an integer > 1).  
Their total is w(1 + r + r² + r³) and must equal 40 kg, the greatest mass that can be balanced.  
Trying integer ratios:  
 r = 2 ⇒ sum = 15w = 40 (no integer w)  
 r = 3 ⇒ sum = 40w = 40 ⇒ w = 1  
 r ≥ 4 ⇒ sum ≥ 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 = 85 > 40, impossible.  
Hence the only feasible set with a common ratio is 1, 3, 9, 27.

Therefore the four weights Lester must possess are:

So, you see, that's why Princess Miyuki had refused each and every love declaration or marriage proposal that came her way.
But of course, what's a story without the brave and wise heroic prince? Here comes Prince Hajikidama of the Marbles Kingdom.

In the end, labouring his mind's creativity department for all its worth, Prince Hajikidama decided that a 'Mountain of Love', reaching so high it collected the never-fallen-snow in Marbles Kingdom, might do the trick. That actually is a tetrahedral-shaped (pyramid with 4 equilateral triangular faces) crystallic marbles-made structure (like a giant pile of apples or oranges at a greengrocer's store) consisting of one marble crowning on the top layer, three on the next-to-top layer, six on the third layer, ten on the fourth layer, and so forth.

  = ½ · N(N+1) · (2N+4)/6
  = N(N+1)(N+2) / 6.

(Indeed, M = C(N+2, 3), the N-th tetrahedral number.)

Substituting N = 1 000 000:

M = 1 000 000 · 1 000 001 · 1 000 002 / 6.

To avoid handling huge numbers, divide by the 6 first:

• divide by 2: 1 000 000/2 = 500 000  
• divide by 3: 1 000 002/3 = 333 334

Now multiply the three reduced factors:

500 000 × 333 334 = 166 667 000 000  
166 667 000 000 × 1 000 001  
      = 166 667 000 000 × (1 000 000 + 1)  
      = 166 667 000 000 000 000 + 166 667 000 000  
      = 166 667 166 667 000 000.

Hence

M = 166 667 166 667 000 000.

Pairs given (first , second):
(1 , 1) ; (10 , 4) ; (30 , 12) ; (100 , 16) ; (1000 , 64)

The hint says “Bases”, so let us see whether the first numbers might be written in some base b, and the second numbers are the same quantities written in ordinary decimal (base 10).

Step-by-step trial:

• Start with the pair (10 , 4).
  – If “10” is read in base 2, its value would be 2, not 4.  So the base is > 2.
  – If “10” is read in base 3, its value would be 3, not 4.  So the base is > 3.
  – If “10” is read in base 4, its value is 1·4¹ + 0·4⁰ = 4.  This matches the second number.  
  Thus base 4 works for the second pair.

• Check that the remaining first numbers are legal base-4 numerals (i.e., they use only the digits 0,1,2,3).
  1  → digits {1}                    OK  
  10 → digits {1,0}                  OK  
  30 → digits {3,0}                  OK  
  100 → digits {1,0,0}               OK  
  1000→ digits {1,0,0,0}             OK  

• Convert each of these base-4 numerals to base-10:
  1₄      = 1·4⁰                = 1 → second number 1  
  10₄     = 1·4¹ + 0·4⁰        = 4 → second number 4  
  30₄     = 3·4¹ + 0·4⁰        = 12 → second number 12  
  100₄    = 1·4² + 0·4¹ + 0·4⁰ = 16 → second number 16  
  1000₄   = 1·4³ + 0·4² + 0·4¹ + 0·4⁰ = 64 → second number 64  

All five conversions match perfectly.

Therefore the relationship is:

Each first number is written in base 4, and the corresponding second number is that same quantity expressed in ordinary base 10.

Our job is to insert the symbols +, −, × or ÷ (and, if needed, parentheses) so that the value of the left‐hand side becomes 1990, while avoiding any concatenated number of 9999 or larger.

Step-by-step search for a target of 1990:

1. 1990 is close to 1998, which is 999 + 999.
2. Therefore, if we can subtract 8 from 1998 we will reach 1990.
3. With the remaining three 9’s we can obtain:
   9 − 9/9  = 9 − 1 = 8.
4. However, instead of writing “… − (9 − 9/9)” we can distribute the operations so that parentheses are unnecessary:

   999 + 999 − 9 + 9/9

   • 999 uses three 9’s.
   • Another 999 uses three more 9’s (total 6).
   • The solitary 9 after the minus uses one 9 (total 7).
   • The 9 in the numerator of 9/9 uses one 9 (total 8).
   • The 9 in the denominator of 9/9 uses one 9 (total 9).

   Counting digits: 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15, as required.

5. Check the arithmetic with normal precedence (division before addition/subtraction):

   9/9 = 1  
   999 + 999 = 1998  
   1998 − 9 = 1989  
   1989 + 1 = 1990

Everything balances, and no number larger than 999 is formed except the two allowed 999’s.

Hence the completed equation is:

""But it's not the answer Mr. Collins left on the key!""
""He's wrong,"" the other one insisted.  ""My answer is right!""
Corman leaned over to whisper in Nora's ear, ""Does she need our help?""
""Yours, probably.  Mr. Collins is at a conference for the weekend, and Monette took his math class.  It looks like she handed back an exam.""
""I teach math.  Can I help?""
All three talked at once; Monette was as frustrated as the two students.  While they jabbered, Corman managed to read the problem in question:
""My house is built on a strangely-shaped lot, so my back yard is a right triangle with an area of 840 square feet.  Each of the three sides measures an integral number of feet.  If I want to stake my dog so that he can reach the entire yard, how long must his rope be?""
Monette finally pulled rank on the adolescents.  ""It's not really your problem, but I'd be glad of some help.  Mr. Collins marked their papers wrong; their answers don't match his.  The students *sound* right, but math was too long ago for me; I'm not sure.  To make matters worse, they don't even agree with each other.""
""I see,"" said Corman, playing for time while he mentally checked the answer on the key in Monette's trembling hand.  ""That's the answer Mr. Collins left you?""

From the students' comments, we know that the Collins yard has the middle-sized hypotenuse.
A right triangle inscribes neatly into a semicircle, with the hypotenuse forming a diameter.  The shortest rope needed to reach all points is one staked at the midpoint of the hypotenuse, forming a radius of the circle.  74/2 = 37 feet.
The blond student found the first answer above, and would have used a rope of 29 feet.  The other student figured it at 113/2, or 56.5 feet.
Historical note:
Lewis Carroll searched for the answer to the basic mathematical problem, sent to him by a reader.  He found two right triangles with the same area, but couldn't discover a set of three.  Somewhat ironically, Carroll had found 20-21-29 and 12-35-37.

4.  To “reach the entire yard” with one stake, the rope must be the radius of the

206,"Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

P  = selling price per box (in dollars)  
C  = production cost per box (constant)  
N  = number of boxes sold per week  
Π  = total weekly profit  

1.  Find the unit cost.  
   At the present price $5.95 the profit per box is $1.75, so  

        C = 5.95 – 1.75 = 4.20 dollars.  

2.  Express the weekly sales N as a function of the price P.  
   At $5.95 they sell 100 boxes.  
   Every $0.20 decrease in price raises sales by 25 boxes, i.e.  

        ΔN / ΔP = –25 / 0.20 = –125 boxes per dollar.  

   Hence  

        N = 100 – 125 (P – 5.95) = 843.75 – 125P.  

3.  Write the profit function.  
        Π(P) = (price – cost) × (quantity)  
             = (P – 4.20)(843.75 – 125P).  

4.  Maximize Π(P).  
   Expand:  Π(P) = –125P² + 1368.75P – 3543.75,  
   a downward-opening parabola.  
   Its vertex occurs at  

        P* = –b / (2a) = –1368.75 / (2·–125) = 1368.75 / 250 = 5.475.  

5.  Interpret the result.  
   The optimal continuous price is $5.475.  
   Rounded to the nearest cent, the best price is  

        $5.48 per box.  

(If prices must change only in $0.20 steps, the closest choice is $5.55, giving virtually the same profit.)

Since SL-D=3 or (SL-1)-D=3 (meaning SL-D=4), and since the highest possible sum of two different one-digit numbers is 17, S must equal 1.
Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.

Suppose D=8. Then L is 1 or 2, and since S=1, L=2. A must be 2 or 3, but since L=2, A=3.
Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.
Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.

If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.

If E=8, then I=4, and D cannot be 8. But if D=9, then A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=9, then N=8, and D cannot be 8 or 9. So this cannot work.

Peru → 20  
Japan → 27

Peru (4)  
Japan (5)  
Greece (6)  
France (6)  
Brazil (6)

Step 3 –  see how the value changes with length  

Going from 3→4→5→6→7 letters the basic value rises by 7 each time:  

3 letters → 13 = 7·3 – 8  
4 letters → 20 = 7·4 – 8  
5 letters → 27 = 7·5 – 8  
6 letters → 34 = 7·6 – 8  
7 letters → 41 = 7·7 – 8  

So the “population” starts with  

value  =  7 × (number of letters) – 8.

Step 4 –  why is Greece different?  

“Greece” has 6 letters, so the formula predicts 34, yet the table shows 30.  
The only extra feature of “Greece” is that it contains a pair of consecutive
identical letters (“EE”).  
Subtracting 4 for each such double gives the right value:

34 – 4 × 1 = 30.

No other listed country has a pair of consecutive identical letters, so no other correction was needed.

Thus

population (in thousands)  
  = 7 × letters – 8 – 4 × (consecutive-double-letter pairs).

Step 5 –  apply the rule to Tibet  

“Tibet” has 5 letters and no consecutive identical letters.

Basic value = 7 × 5 – 8 = 35 – 8 = 27.  
No doubles ⇒ no further subtraction.

Therefore the population shown for Tibet would be 27 × 10 000 = 270 000.

The digits 3 and 5 are forbidden, so the allowed set is

Step 2.  Divisibility-by-4 condition  
A whole number is divisible by 4 exactly when the two–digit number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.  
Therefore we first list all pairs (tens, units) from A×A whose two–digit value is a multiple of 4.

b) How far (to the nearest inch) do you have to walk to return to your starting position?","Do it on paper, unless you need the exercise!","a) You have walked 1060 feet.
b) You have to walk 73 feet, 9 inches
Explanation
There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100, neither of which is prime.  (No, 1 is not prime.)  So you will walk in an expanding square with sides of length 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 feet.  This is a total of 1060 feet.
The net result of your turns will be that you are 56 feet ahead of your starting position.
(2+11+23+41+59+73+97)
- (5+17+31+47+67+83)
You will also be 48 feet to the left of your starting position.
(7+19+37+53+71+89)
- (3+13+29+43+61+79)
To calculate the distance back to the starting position, calculate the length of the hypotenuse of the right angle triangle with legs that are 56 and 48 feet long.  This is 73.756 feet, or 73 feet, 9 inches.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"The primes smaller than 100 are

Walking rule (turn right 90° after each leg) gives this pattern of directions:

East, South, West, North, East, … (cycling every four steps).

Attach each prime to its direction and accumulate x- and y-components  
(East = +x, West = −x, North = +y, South = −y):

East: 2 + 11 + 23 + 41 + 59 + 73 + 97 = 306

less 10% discount $12.60 $14.50 $2.50 $29.60
Amount spent $113.40 $130.50 $22.50 $266.40
Explanation:
First find the original price of all the items combined. $266.40 is the price after the 10% discount was applied.
That means $266.40 is equal to 90% of the original price.
Write an equation and then cross multiply:
266.40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x   =   9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)
Let x = the amount Alec spent on trucks.
x + (x+5) = 75
2x + 5 = 75
2x = 70
x = 35
Alec spent $35 on trucks. Brett spent $5 more than Alec. Therefore, Brett spent $40 on trucks.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51
x + (2x + 3) = 51

Because “each side equals 99”, we look for two contiguous blocks of digits that can each give 99 when the operations are carried out strictly left-to-right (no PEMDAS).

Step 1 – find a 99 on the left side  
Try grouping the first six digits into three numbers with two operations:

54 + 63 – 18  
54 + 63 = 117, 117 – 18 = 99.  
Perfect—this uses ‘+’ and one ‘–’.

Step 2 – use the remaining digits on the right side  
The unused digits are 6 3 3 3.  
We still have one ‘–’ and the ‘*’ left.  
Arrange them as

6 – 3 * 33  

Compute left-to-right: 6 – 3 = 3, 3 * 33 = 99.  
This uses the second ‘–’ and the ‘*’.

Step 3 – insert the ‘=’ between the two sides  
Putting it all together, keeping every digit in its original order:

54+63-18 = 6-3*33

Checked left-to-right:
Left 54 + 63 = 117, 117 – 18 = 99  
Right 6 – 3 = 3,  3 * 33 = 99

Both sides equal 99, all digits and all symbols are used exactly once, and operations are done strictly in sequence.

To check it will take 24*10 + 48*5 = 480 minutes of saw time. There are 600 minutes available so the saws will be idle 20% of the time.
It will take 24*5 + 48*5 = 360 minutes of lathe time which is exactly what we have.

On this assumption, an exact answer can be given.",The first time is after 1:00--note that either the minute hand is 12 times ahead or the minute hand has traveled 12 times more than the hour hand has between two hours,"The first time would be 5 and 5\143 minutes past 12, which might also indicate 60\143 minutes past 1.

 H(t) = position of the (true) hour-hand in degrees,  
 M(t) = position of the (true) minute-hand in degrees.

For an ordinary 12-hour clock  

 H(t) = 30t  (30° per hour)  
 M(t) = 360t (mod 360) (360° per hour).

Because the two hands are now identical, the time will be ambiguous precisely when
interchanging the two visible positions still represents some legitimate clock time
t′ ≠ t.  Thus we need a time t for which there exists another time t′ satisfying  

 M(t) ≡ 30t′ (mod 360) and H(t) ≡ 360t′ (mod 360). (1)

Write t = n + f where n = ⌊t⌋ ( whole hours ) and f (0 ≤ f < 1) is the
fractional part.  Then

 H(t) = 30t = 30(n + f) = 30n + 30f,  
 M(t) = 360f.                                           (2)

Because 0 ≤ 360f < 360 we may drop the modulus in the first of (1):

 30t′ = 360f  ⇒ t′ = 12f.                              (3)

Substituting t′ from (3) into the second congruence of (1),

 360t′ ≡ H(t) (mod 360)  
 ⇔ 360·12f ≡ 30(n + f) (mod 360)  
 ⇔ 4320f ≡ 30n + 30f (mod 360).                       (4)

Dividing by 30 and reducing mod 12,

 144f ≡ n + f (mod 12)  
 ⇔ 143f ≡ n (mod 12).                                (5)

Let k = ⌊12f⌋ (so 0 ≤ k ≤ 11).  Write f in terms of n and k:

 f = (n + 12k)/143.                                   (6)

Condition k = ⌊12f⌋ gives

 k ≤ 12f = (12n + 144k)/143 < k + 1.                  (7)

Possible times are therefore

 t = n + f = n + (n + 12k)/143 = 12(12n + k)/143 hours.   (8)

We want the first ambiguous instant after 12 : 00.
Before 1 : 00 the observer still knows the hour hand cannot yet have reached “1”,
so no ambiguity can arise; hence we require t > 1, i.e. n ≥ 1.

Take the smallest such n, namely n = 1.  
From (8) the least t is obtained with the smallest k (k = 0):

 t = 12(12·1 + 0)/143 = 144/143 hours
  = 1 hour + 1/143 hour
  = 1 hour + 60/143 minute
  = 1 hour + 0 minutes + 3600/143 seconds
  = 1 : 00 : 25 25⁄143 seconds.                      (9)

Thus at 1 : 00 : 25 25⁄143 seconds after noon the two identical hands
lie so that the clock could equally well be showing

• “Painting one model on one canvas” will be counted as one job.  
• 2.5 artists working 2.5 hours complete 2.5 such jobs.

Hence

Total artist-hours used  = 2.5 artists × 2.5 hours = 6.25 artist-hours  
Jobs produced            = 2.5 jobs

Productivity per artist-hour

Equivalently, each job needs  
1 / 0.4 = 2.5 artist-hours.

Step-2:  Compute the total artist-hours needed for the new task

We now want 24 jobs (24 models on 24 canvases).

Artist-hours required

Step 1.  Use the hint.  
Because A divides both B and C, it also divides B + C.  
But B + C = 30 − A, so A | (30 − A) ⇒ 30 = (30 − A) + A is a multiple of A.  
Hence A must be a divisor of 30.

Let B = A·m and C = A·n with m, n positive integers.

For a positive integer equation m + n = M, the number of ordered positive solutions is M − 1.  
Here M = k − 1, so we get (k − 1) − 1 = k − 2 solutions, provided k ≥ 3.  
(When k = 2 there would be none, because m + n would have to be 1.)

Step 4.  Compute k = 30/A and k − 2 for each admissible A.

   Famous long repeating blocks coming from unit fractions are  
   1/7 = 0.142857 142857 … (period 6)  
   1/13 = 0.076923 076923 … (period 6)  
   etc.

   The block 142857 is especially well known because it is a “cyclic number”: multiplying it by 2,3,4,5,6 gives rotations of the same six digits.

3. Verify the property for 142857  
      142 857 × 2 = 285 714  
      142 857 × 3 = 428 571  
      142 857 × 4 = 571 428  
      142 857 × 5 = 714 285  
      142 857 × 6 = 857 142  

   Every product is just a cyclic permutation of 1-4-2-8-5-7—hence no new digits appear.

4. Check no other digits appear  
   None of those products contains 0,3,6,9, etc.; they use exactly {1,2,4,5,7,8}.  
   Thus N = 142 857 satisfies the requirement.

5. Are there any other 6-digit solutions?  
   A cyclic number generated from 1/13 (076923) fails because it has a leading 0, so as a 6-digit integer it is only 5 digits (76923).  
   Other unit fractions with period 6 (e.g. 1/7×k) give the same set of cyclic permutations already listed above. Hence 142 857 is the unique 6-digit solution.

228,Can you take 4 7's and arrange them with any math symbols needed to make the total be 100?,Division is needed,Note that 77 and 77 can be separated to some form of the identity (77/77 = 1) but then we can use a decimal point to get 77/.77 and 77/.77=100,GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We want an expression that

• uses exactly four 7’s  
• may employ any ordinary arithmetic symbols ( + , − , × , ÷ , parentheses, decimal point, etc.)  
• evaluates to 100, and  
• must involve at least one division (per the hint).

Step 1 – Make 100 with two 7’s  
A convenient way to get 100 is to divide 7 by 0.07.  
Note that  
0.07 = 7⁄100  ⇒  7 ÷ 0.07 = 7 ÷ (7/100) = 7 × (100/7) = 100.  
Thus the pair “7 ÷ 0.07” already gives us 100 while using two 7’s.

Step 2 – Use the remaining two 7’s without changing the value  
The simplest way is to add one 7 and then subtract the other 7:  +7 −7 = 0, which leaves the total unchanged.

Putting it all together:

7 ÷ 0.07 + 7 − 7 = 100

Check:  
7 ÷ 0.07 = 100  
100 + 7 − 7 = 100

We have used exactly four 7’s and at least one division symbol, satisfying all requirements.

Final answer: 7 ÷ 0.07 + 7 − 7 = 100",True,1,0

                  ×       4
        ---------------------
            D   C   B   A

produces four digit–wise conditions with carries k₁, k₂, k₃:

1. Units: 4·D = 10·k₁ + A                → A = (4D) mod 10,  k₁ = ⌊4D/10⌋
2. Tens : 4·C + k₁ = 10·k₂ + B           → B = (4C + k₁) mod 10, k₂ = ⌊(4C+k₁)/10⌋
3. Hunds: 4·B + k₂ = 10·k₃ + C           → C = (4B + k₂) mod 10, k₃ = ⌊(4B+k₂)/10⌋
4. Thous: 4·A + k₃ = D                  → D = 4A + k₃   (no further carry)

Also
• A ≠ 0  (ABCD is a 4-digit number)  
• D ≠ 0  (DCBA is a 4-digit number)  
• A must be even (hint)  
• In a cryptarithm the letters stand for distinct digits.

Step 1: List the possibilities coming from equation (1)

Compute A and k₁ from 4D:

 D   4D   A   k₁
 0    0   0   0      (A = 0, impossible)
 1    4   4   0

 7   28   8   2
 8   32   2   3
 9   36   6   3

Now impose condition (4):  D = 4A + k₃,  with 0 ≤ k₃ ≤ 3 (because the largest possible carry into the thousands is 3).

Check each viable (D,A,k₁) triple:

   D  A  k₁   Need D = 4A + k₃
   1  4   0   1 = 16+k₃  ✗
   2  8   0   2 = 32+k₃  ✗
   3  2   1   3 =  8+k₃  ✗
   4  6   1   4 = 24+k₃  ✗
   6  4   2   6 = 16+k₃  ✗
   7  8   2   7 = 32+k₃  ✗
   8  2   3   8 =  8+k₃  ✓  ⇒ k₃ = 0
   9  6   3   9 = 24+k₃  ✗

Only the line (D,A,k₁,k₃) = (8,2,3,0) survives, giving so far
      A = 2 ,  D = 8 ,  k₁ = 3 ,  k₃ = 0.

Step 2: Determine C, B and k₂

Equation (2): 4C + k₁ = 4C + 3 = 10k₂ + B  
Equation (3): 4B + k₂ = C        (because k₃ = 0)

Try C = 0..9 (excluding 2 and 8 already used):

 C   4C+3   B   k₂   4B+k₂   = C ?
 0     3    3    0      12       ✗

 7    31    1    3      7        ✓

The choice C = 7, B = 1, k₂ = 3 satisfies both equations.

Step 3: Collect the digits

A = 2,  B = 1,  C = 7,  D = 8 are all different and obey every column condition.

Thus  
      ABCD = 2178  
      DCBA = 8712  
and indeed 2178 × 4 = 8712.

1.  Express the sum algebraically.  
   3(100F + 10L + Y) = 1000A + 100W + 10A + Y  
   ⇒ 300F + 30L + 2Y = 1010A + 100W.                         (1)

2.  Work modulo 10.  
   Left side ≡ 2Y (mod 10); right side ≡ 0 (mod 10).  
   ⇒ 2Y ≡ 0 (mod 10) → Y = 5 (the only non-zero digit with 2·Y ending in 0).

3.  Substitute Y = 5 and divide by 10.  
   (1) becomes 30F + 3L + 1 = 101A + 10W.                    (2)

4.  Look at the unit digit of (2).  
   A ≡ 3L + 1 (mod 10).  
   For L ≠ 5 the possibilities are
          L : 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9

   Keep only non-zero, distinct digits: (L, A) ∈ {(1,4), (2,7), (4,3), (6,9), (7,2), (9,8)}.

5.  Solve (2) for W: 10W = 30F + 3L + 1 − 101A.

   • Take (L, A) = (7, 2).  
     10W = 30F + 21 + 1 − 202 = 30F − 180.  
     To make 10W a positive multiple of 10 not exceeding 90 we need
            30F − 180 ∈ {10,20,…,90}
            ⇒ 30F ∈ {190,200,…,270}
            ⇒ F = 7,8,9.
     F must differ from L=7, so F = 8 or 9.

     – F = 8 → 10W = 30·8 − 180 = 60 ⇒ W = 6 (all digits distinct, non-zero).  
       Check: 875 × 3 = 2625, i.e. FLY = 875 and AWAY = 2625 – works!

     – F = 9 → 10W = 90 ⇒ W = 9, but W would equal F, not allowed.

   • All other (L, A) pairs fail to give a valid digit W (results are negative or >90).

Hence the unique solution is
      F = 8,  L = 7,  Y = 5,  A = 2,  W = 6.

231,What is the smallest integer greater than 0 that can be written entirely with zeros and ones and is evenly divisible by 225?,,"The prime factorization of 225 is 5*5*3*3. So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.
All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let N be a positive integer whose decimal representation uses only the digits 0 and 1.  
We want the least such N that is divisible by 225.

1.  Factor 225 = 9 × 25.  
    •  Divisibility by 25: in base 10 the last two digits must be 00, 25, 50 or 75.  
       Because N can use only 0’s and 1’s, the only possible pair is 00.  
       ⇒ N ends with the two digits 00.  

2.  Divisibility by 9: the sum of the decimal digits must be a multiple of 9.  
    Since every digit is either 0 or 1, this sum equals the number of 1’s in N.  
    Let s be that number; we need s ≡ 0 (mod 9).  
    Also, because N > 0 and its leading digit cannot be 0, s ≥ 1.

3.  Structure of N.  
    Write N as
        (d₁ d₂ … d_{n-2} d_{n-1} d_n) with d_{n-1}=d_n=0.
    d₁ must be 1, and the remaining n−3 interior positions (d₂ … d_{n-2}) can be 0 or 1.
    The total number of 1’s is  
        s = 1 + (number of 1’s among the n–3 interior digits).

4.  Smallest possible length.  
    The smallest positive multiple of 9 is 9 itself, so first try s = 9.  
    That requires 8 additional 1’s after the leading digit.  
    Therefore the interior block must contain at least 8 positions:
        n − 3 ≥ 8  ⇒  n ≥ 11.
    For n = 10 (or fewer) digits we could have at most 1 + 7 = 8 ones, never 9, so
        no qualifying number has fewer than 11 digits.

5.  Construct the 11-digit candidate.  
    With n = 11 we have exactly 8 interior positions (d₂ … d₉).  
    To make s = 9 every one of those positions must be 1.  
    Hence the only possible 11-digit pattern is
        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
    i.e. 11111111100.

6.  Verification.  
    •  Ends with 00 → divisible by 25.  
    •  Contains nine 1’s → digit sum = 9 → divisible by 9.  
    Thus 11111111100 is divisible by 225.

7.  Minimality.  
    No shorter number works (step 4), and among 11-digit numbers every interior digit
    had to be 1 to reach the required digit sum, so there is no smaller 11-digit value.

A B C D E  

where the letters denote the 1st, 2nd, … , 5th digits.  
According to the statements in the problem we have  

1. C = 2E   (the third digit is twice the fifth)  
2. D = B + 6  (the fourth digit is six greater than the second)  
3. E = A – 3  (the last digit is three less than the first)  

All digits are different and taken from 1,…,9.  
Among the five digits exactly two are primes, two are perfect squares, and one is neither.  
The hint tells us that C and D cannot be prime.

Step 1.  Combine (1) and (3).  
Since 1 ≤ E ≤ 9 and C = 2E ≤ 9, E can only be 1, 2, 3 or 4.  
Consequently A = E + 3 can only be 4, 5, 6 or 7.

Step 2.  Analyse the four possible values of E.

• E = 1 → A = 4.  
  No primes so far; but C and D are forbidden to be prime, hence we could never reach the required two primes. Impossible.

• E = 2 → A = 5 (both primes already).  
  B would have to be non-prime, yet D = B + 6 must be a single digit and non-prime.  
  The only non-prime choices for B (1,6,8,9) give D = 7,12,14,15 – all impossible (7 is prime, the others are >9). Hence impossible.

• E = 3 → A = 6 (only one prime so far, so B must be the second prime).  
  But C = 2E = 6, duplicating A, which is forbidden. Impossible.

• E = 4 → A = 7.  
  Here E is a square, A is prime. We still need one more prime (B) and one more square among C or D.  
  C = 2E = 8 (neither prime nor square, acceptable).  
  Choose B prime: B ∈ {2,3,5}.  Then D = B + 6 must be a non-prime single digit.

  – B = 2 → D = 8 (duplicate).  
  – B = 5 → D = 11 (>9).  
  – B = 3 → D = 9 (non-prime square, single digit, distinct).

  The choice B = 3 works perfectly and gives the digit set  
     A = 7  (prime)  
     B = 3  (prime)  
     C = 8  (neither)  
     D = 9  (square)  
     E = 4  (square)

  All conditions are satisfied:
     C = 2E → 8 = 2·4  
     D = B + 6 → 9 = 3 + 6  
     E = A – 3 → 4 = 7 – 3  

Step 3.  Write the number.  
The digits in order are 7,3,8,9,4, i.e. 73894.

No other case works, so the solution is unique.

237,"There are four three-digit numbers that share this property: the number itself, its double and its triple contain each digit from 1 to 9 exactly once.

and write the nine digits in a 3×3 array whose rows are the three multiples

            a b c  
            d e f  
            g h i

Because the three rows are respectively N , 2N and 3N, if we permute the
columns of the array in exactly the same way, every row is changed in the
same way; therefore the first row is still one-third of the second and
one-third of the third.  
So any permutation of the columns that produces a legal 3-digit first row
gives another solution automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1   Start from one known solution
------------------------------------------------------------

The statement already gives the two solutions

      192 , 384 , 576   → array A₁ =
      1 9 2
      3 8 4
      5 7 6

      273 , 546 , 819   → array A₂ =
      2 7 3
      5 4 6
      8 1 9

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2   Permute the columns
------------------------------------------------------------

There are 6 possible column–permutations.  
Among them we need ones whose new first row is still a 3-digit number N
with 3N ≤ 999 (so N ≤ 333) and whose nine digits are still 1–9.

• Apply the permutation ( 3 , 1 , 2 ) to array A₁  
      (take the 3rd column first, then 1st, then 2nd):

        2 1 9
        4 3 8
        6 5 7

  Rows are 219 , 438 , 657   →   219×2 = 438, 219×3 = 657  
  and the digits 1–9 appear once each.  
  Hence 219 is a new solution.

• Apply the same permutation ( 3 , 1 , 2 ) to array A₂ :

        3 2 7
        6 5 4
        9 8 1

  Rows are 327 , 654 , 981   →   327×2 = 654, 327×3 = 981  
  and again the digits 1–9 appear exactly once.  
  Hence 327 is another solution.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3   Check the remaining permutations
------------------------------------------------------------

The other four column-permutations make the first row ≥ 334 or introduce
repeated digits, so they are not admissible.  Therefore no further
solutions exist.

------------------------------------------------------------
Result
------------------------------------------------------------

Besides the two given numbers 192 and 273, the only other numbers whose
double and triple together use every digit 1–9 exactly once are

                     219   and   327.

They both show 4 o'clock, one clock has gained 240 minutes (4 hours) and the other has lost 480 minutes (8 hours).
2. Midnight after 30 days, which is 720 hours later. They both now show 12 o'clock.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let t be the number of real HOURS that have elapsed since the two clocks were set to the correct time at 12:00 a.m. on Sunday, December 31.

Fast clock (gains 1 min/h): error = +t minutes  
Slow clock (loses 2 min/h): error = –2t minutes  

A full revolution of an ordinary 12-hour dial is 12 h × 60 min / h = 720 minutes, so two readings that differ by any multiple of 720 minutes look the same on an analog face.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  When do the two clocks next show the same reading?

They show the same reading when their errors are congruent modulo 720 min:

  t ≡ –2t  (mod 720)  
 ⇒ 3t ≡ 0 (mod 720)  
 ⇒ t must be a multiple of 720 / gcd(3,720) = 240.

The first positive multiple is t = 240 hours.

240 h = 10 days.

Thus the clocks next agree 10 days after they were set, i.e. at 12:00 a.m. on Wednesday, January 10.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  When do both clocks again show the correct time?

For a clock to show the correct time its error must itself be a multiple of 720 minutes.

Fast clock:  +t ≡ 0  (mod 720)  ⇒ t is a multiple of 720.  
Slow clock:  –2t ≡ 0  (mod 720)  ⇒ 2t is a multiple of 720  
                 ⇒ t is a multiple of 360.

The smallest positive t satisfying both conditions is the least common multiple of 720 and 360, which is 720 hours.

720 h = 30 days = 4 weeks and 2 days.

Therefore the first time both clocks are simultaneously right again is 30 days after they were set, i.e. at 12:00 a.m. on Tuesday, January 30.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Final answer:  
1) The two clocks next show the same reading 240 hours (10 days) after being set—midnight on Wednesday, January 10.  
2) They both show the correct time 720 hours (30 days) after being set—midnight on Tuesday, January 30.",True,1,0

a < b < c < d < e .  

Every unordered pair of bales was weighed, so we have the ten sums  

a+b , a+c , a+d , a+e , b+c , b+d , b+e , c+d , c+e , d+e  

and, in increasing order, they are  
80, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, 91.

Step 1.  Identify the smallest and largest pair-sums.  
a+b = 80,   d+e = 91.                             (1)

Step 2.  Use the total of all ten sums.  
Because every individual bale appears in exactly 4 of the 10 pairs,

(a+b+c+d+e)·4 = 80+82+83+84+85+86+87+88+90+91 = 856.

Hence a+b+c+d+e = 856/4 = 214.                 (2)

Step 3.  Solve for c.  
Add (1): (a+b)+(d+e) = 80+91 = 171.  
Subtract from (2): c = 214 – 171 = 43.         (3)

Step 4.  Determine a and b from a+b = 80 and b<43.

With a<b<43 the possibilities are
 a=38, b=42 or a=39, b=41.

Check which choice fits the list of sums.

• If a=38, b=42, then a+c = 38+43 = 81, but 81 is not in the list ⇒ reject.  
• Therefore a=39, b=41.                           (4)

Step 5.  Determine d and e from d+e = 91 with d>43.

Possible integer pairs (d,e) are (44,47) or (45,46).

Test (44,47):

Form all ten pair sums with {39,41,43,44,47}:

39+41 = 80  
39+43 = 82  
39+44 = 83  
39+47 = 86  
41+43 = 84  
41+44 = 85  
41+47 = 88  
43+44 = 87  
43+47 = 90  
44+47 = 91

These are exactly the given ten numbers, so (d,e) = (44,47) is correct.  
(The pair 45,46 would give sums 84,85,91,… which do not match.)

Thus the five bale weights are

a = 39 kg, b = 41 kg, c = 43 kg, d = 44 kg, e = 47 kg.

Step 6.  Match every recorded total with its bale pair:

80 kg  → 39 kg + 41 kg  
82 kg  → 39 kg + 43 kg  
83 kg  → 39 kg + 44 kg  
84 kg  → 41 kg + 43 kg  
85 kg  → 41 kg + 44 kg  
86 kg  → 39 kg + 47 kg  
87 kg  → 43 kg + 44 kg  
88 kg  → 41 kg + 47 kg  
90 kg  → 43 kg + 47 kg  
91 kg  → 44 kg + 47 kg

What can be said about the two values?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
From (3) and (4) we see that, no matter what the actual ages are
(as long as ages are positive integers and the fixed gaps of two
years hold),

1. Each value is a perfect square.  
   • Value A is the square of the integer that lies exactly one
     year below my age, i.e. of R – 1.  
   • Value B is the square of the integer that lies exactly one
     year above my age, i.e. of R + 1.

2. Because they are perfect squares larger than 1, the two numbers
   can never be prime; they are necessarily composite.  (Equivalently,
   each of them is 1 more than a multiple of either of the two ages
   whose product was used:  
   Value A ≡ 1 (mod R) and ≡ 1 (mod L);  
   Value B ≡ 1 (mod R) and ≡ 1 (mod F).)

So in every possible year Rudy could immediately state these two facts
about each of the manipulated numbers.

Final answer:  
1) In every year the number Lavi × Rudy + 1 and the number Fred × Rudy + 1 are perfect squares.  
2) Consequently each of those numbers is composite (never prime), in fact being exactly 1 more than a multiple of either of the two ages used to form it.",True,1,0

In 1853 an Englishman Rhind found one of Ahmes's papyruses near the temple of Ramses II in Thebes. The papyrus is a rectangle 33 cm wide and about 5 m long. There is the following math brain teaser on it (besides others).
100 measures of corn must be divided among 5 workers, so that the second worker gets as many measures more than the first worker, as the third gets more than the second, the fourth more than the third and the fifth more than the fourth. The first two workers shall get seven times less measures of corn than the three others.
How many measures of corn shall each worker get?",You can set up a system of equations using the corn for the first worker and the difference in corn between worker i and worker i + 1,"2 equations give a clear answer to the given question:
5w + 10d = 100
7*(2w + d) = 3w + 9d
Where w is amount of corn for the first worker, d is the difference (amount of corn) between two consecutive workers. So this is the solution:
1st worker = 10/6 measures of corn
2nd worker = 65/6 measures of corn
3rd worker = 120/6 (20) measures of corn
4th worker = 175/6 measures of corn
5th worker = 230/6 measures of corn",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

a  = corn for worker 1  
k  = the common difference between successive workers  

Because every worker after the first gets the same extra amount of corn, the five amounts form an arithmetic progression  

worker 1 : a  
worker 2 : a + k  
worker 3 : a + 2k  
worker 4 : a + 3k  
worker 5 : a + 4k

------------------------------------------------
1.  The total amount of corn is 100 measures  

a + (a+k) + (a+2k) + (a+3k) + (a+4k) = 100  
⇒ 5a + 10k = 100                        (1)

------------------------------------------------
2.  The first two workers together get “seven times less” ( = one-seventh) of what the last three get  

a + (a+k) = 1⁄7 [(a+2k) + (a+3k) + (a+4k)]  
⇒ 7(2a + k) = 3a + 9k                  (2)

Simplify (2):

14a + 7k = 3a + 9k  
11a = 2k  
k = (11/2)a                            (3)

------------------------------------------------
3.  Substitute (3) into (1):

5a + 10·(11/2)a = 100  
5a + 55a = 100  
60a = 100  
a = 5/3  = 1 ⅔

Hence  

k = (11/2)·(5/3) = 55/6 = 9 1⁄6

------------------------------------------------
4.  Compute the individual shares

worker 1 : a               = 5/3  = 1 ⅔  
worker 2 : a + k           = 5/3 + 55/6 = 65/6 = 10 5⁄6  
worker 3 : a + 2k          = 5/3 + 2·55/6 = 60/3 = 20  
worker 4 : a + 3k          = 5/3 + 3·55/6 = 175/6 = 29 1⁄6  
worker 5 : a + 4k          = 5/3 + 4·55/6 = 115/3 = 38 ⅓

5.  Check

Sum of first two: 1 ⅔ + 10 5⁄6 = 12 ½

(The six “outer” points are the vertices of the two big triangles; the six “inner’’ points are the vertices of the little central hexagon produced by the crossings.)

Outer vertices   (clockwise, starting at the very top)  
 O₁ = top point,  
 O₂ = upper-right point,  
 O₃ = lower-right point,  
 O₄ = bottom point,  
 O₅ = lower-left point,

O₄–I₄–I₅–O₂, O₂–I₆–I₁–O₆, O₆–I₂–I₃–O₄.

 (O₁+…+I₆ counted twice) = 2·(1+2+⋯+12) = 2·78 = 156.

Since every segment has to add to the same total S, we must have  
 6S = 156, i.e. S = 26.

This agrees with the hint 26 = 2·(1+12).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step-by-step search using the equations

1)  O₁+I₁+I₂+O₅ = 26  
2)  O₅+I₃+I₄+O₃ = 26  
3)  O₃+I₅+I₆+O₁ = 26  
4)  O₄+I₄+I₅+O₂ = 26  
5)  O₂+I₆+I₁+O₆ = 26  
6)  O₆+I₂+I₃+O₄ = 26  

(Every point occurs in exactly the two equations whose line–segments meet there.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
A successful choice

•  Put the largest available number 12 at the most conspicuous place, the top vertex:  O₁ = 12.  
  From (1) and (3) this forces
  I₁+I₂+O₅ = 14 and O₃+I₅+I₆ = 14.

•  To make 14 with two numbers and leave the third small, write 14 = 11+2+1.  
  Hence choose I₁ = 11, I₂ = 2, O₅ = 1.

•  Equation (2) now reads 1+I₃+I₄+O₃ = 26 ⇒ I₃+I₄+O₃ = 25.

•  Try the largest pair 10 and 8 for I₃ and I₄; then O₃ must be 7:
 I₃ = 10, I₄ = 8, O₃ = 7 (satisfies I₃+I₄+O₃ = 25).

•  With these values (3) becomes 7+I₅+I₆+12 = 26 ⇒ I₅+I₆ = 7.  
  The only unused distinct numbers that add to 7 are 3 and 4; take
 I₅ = 3, I₆ = 4.

•  The remaining unused numbers are 5, 6, 9.  Let
 O₂ = 6, O₆ = 5, O₄ = 9.

Check the three remaining equations:

(4)  O₄+I₄+I₅+O₂ = 9+8+3+6 = 26 ✓  
(5)  O₂+I₆+I₁+O₆ = 6+4+11+5 = 26 ✓  
(6)  O₆+I₂+I₃+O₄ = 5+2+10+9 = 26 ✓

All six sums are 26, every number 1–12 is used exactly once, so the arrangement works.

The complete placement

Outer ring (clockwise from the top):
 12, 6, 7, 9, 1, 5.

Inner hexagon (clockwise starting with the point just left of the top):
 11, 2, 10, 8, 3, 4.

Putting these twelve numbers at the corresponding intersections of the Star of David gives

• top segment 12 – 11 – 2 – 1 = 26  
• upper-right segment 6 – 4 – 11 – 5 = 26  
• lower-right segment 7 – 3 – 4 – 12 = 26  
• bottom segment 9 – 8 – 3 – 6 = 26  
• lower-left segment 1 – 10 – 8 – 7 = 26  
• upper-left segment 5 – 2 – 10 – 9 = 26  

so every one of the six line segments indeed sums to 26.

(Interchanging the two numbers of any complementary pair  (k,13-k) that sit on the same segment, or rotating/reflection of the star, will produce other valid solutions.)

Final answer:  
Place the numbers  
Outer vertices 12 (top), 6, 7, 9, 1, 5 (clockwise);  
Inner hexagon 11, 2, 10, 8, 3, 4 (clockwise);

247,"The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?","Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74
Lemp 47 94
Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Number of people who got in at the six stations - Number of people who got out at the six stations) =
