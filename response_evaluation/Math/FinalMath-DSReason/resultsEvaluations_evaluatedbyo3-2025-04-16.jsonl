{"ID": 0, "Question": "There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.\nThe island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.\nOn April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.\nIf the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?\nBonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?", "Hint": "To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.", "Human Solution": "The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.\nBonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.\nAll villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:\n1) First set the starting point to one.\n2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.\n3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)\n4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.\nWhich points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.\nNote that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.\nThe routes:\nThis is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.\nRoutes to an adjacent village (A to B):\nTo determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.\nThe farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.\nThe next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.\nThe next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.\nThe next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.\nThere are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.\nRoutes to the second village along the coast (A to C):\nA = 1\nAFi = A = 1\nFi = AFi = 1\nAi = A + AFi = 2\nABi = Ai + A = 3\nM and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nM = Ai + Fi = 3\nB = A + ABi = 4\nBi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBi = B + ABi + M = 10\nDi = M = 3\nBCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBCi = B + Bi = 14\nCDi = Di = 3\nCi = BCi + CDi + M = 20\nC = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41\nThere are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.\nRoutes to the opposite village (A to D):\nSince the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.\nA = 1\nF, B = A = 1\nFAi, ABi = A + B = 2\nAi = A + ABi + FAi = 5\nFi, Bi = ABi + B = 3\nEFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4\nM, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:\nM = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11\nE, C = B + BCi = 5\nEi, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20\nDEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25\nDi = M + CDi + DEi = 61\nD = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121\nThere are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.\nBonus Question:\nThe longest route is a route to the opposite village.

Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.\nThe path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.\nThe paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits.

There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?", "Hint": "A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "DSReason", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Final answer: 2000 square feet. \n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Sides (n):**\n   - The pipe bisects the house (a regular polygon) and equals the property's side length (S).

{"ID": 8, "Question": "Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.\n\"The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.\"\n\"OK,\" says Ralph after a moment.  \"That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?\"\n\"No, no, no,\" replies Rex.  \"I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.

The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.\"\n\"What number am I thinking of?\" asks Rex.\nRalph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, \"OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.\"\nRex frowns and says, \"One of those numbers is divisible by 13.\"\nRalph smiles and tells Rex the number.\nWhat were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?\nNote: The \"digital sum\" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.", "Hint": "You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.\nThe problem is as much about logic as it is about math.", "Human Solution": "The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "DSReason", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Final answer: The two numbers were 887314 and 986754.

{"ID": 10, "Question": "After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.\nWhat is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?", "Hint": "The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.\nOf course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.", "Human Solution": "First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.\nFour of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.\n\"That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?\"\nBill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?", "Hint": "1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Human Solution": "Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.

No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.\n(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.\n(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.\n(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.\nWith these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.

First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N.

{"ID": 92, "Question": "You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?\n(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.

For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.\nCan s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.\nNow we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.\nSubstituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7\nWe know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).\nIf x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.\nIf x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number.

Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.\nThis proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.\nSubstituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.\nNow we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.\nThe solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10.

As mentioned in the hint, there are many methods in which to solve this. One less complex method is to imagine the axis of the cone form a right triangle. This triangle shares the dimensions of the cone, so it is 12 by 5. We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.\nNext we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x.

{"ID": 151, "Question": "In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.\nOn one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.\nFirst, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.\nSecond, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.\nThird, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.\nFourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)\nFor discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.\nAbout this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, \"Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.\"\nKnowing Junior, we asked, \"How big a headache is your math gonna give us?\"\nShe answered, \"I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.\"\nName the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.", "Hint": "Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.", "Human Solution": "Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.\nAfter labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, \"Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof.

These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.\"\nThe partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's.

He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.\nHow fast can the man run?", "Hint": "You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.", "Human Solution": "Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.\nFeel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.

Danny wanted an xCube365 (it lasts 365 days before programmatically disabling itself, so that a new one must be purchased), the highly coveted gaming system that had just been released. It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule.

Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.\nIf a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities.

So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.\nAll multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.\nIf you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.\nTo prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.\na*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =\n9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .\n9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.\nThe smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111.

The first two workers shall get seven times less measures of corn than the three others.\nHow many measures of corn shall each worker get?", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "2 equations give a clear answer to the given question:\n5w + 10d = 100\n7*(2w + d) = 3w + 9d\nWhere w is amount of corn for the first worker, d is the difference (amount of corn) between two consecutive workers. So this is the solution:\n1st worker = 10/6 measures of corn\n2nd worker = 65/6 measures of corn\n3rd worker = 120/6 (20) measures of corn\n4th worker = 175/6 measures of corn\n5th worker = 230/6 measures of corn", "Model": "DSReason", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Final answer: The workers receive \\(\\boxed{\\frac{5}{3}}\\), \\(\\boxed{\\frac{65}{6}}\\), \\(\\boxed{20}\\), \\(\\boxed{\\frac{175}{6}}\\), and \\(\\boxed{\\frac{115}{3}}\\) measures respectively.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 247, "Question": "The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.\nHe said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "The observations given are :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nFrom observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.\nLet us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.\nFrom observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.\nHence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.\nIf it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.\nThis means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.\nNow the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number.
