{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.\nThe island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.\nOn April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.\nIf the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?\nBonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?\n Solution: The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.\nBonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.\nAll villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:\n1) First set the starting point to one.\n2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.\n3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)\n4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.\nWhich points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.\nNote that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.\nThe routes:\nThis is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.\nRoutes to an adjacent village (A to B):\nTo determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.\nThe farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.\nThe next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.\nThe next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.\nThe next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.\nThere are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.\nRoutes to the second village along the coast (A to C):\nA = 1\nAFi = A = 1\nFi = AFi = 1\nAi = A + AFi = 2\nABi = Ai + A = 3\nM and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nM = Ai + Fi = 3\nB = A + ABi = 4\nBi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBi = B + ABi + M = 10\nDi = M = 3\nBCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBCi = B + Bi = 14\nCDi = Di = 3\nCi = BCi + CDi + M = 20\nC = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41\nThere are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.\nRoutes to the opposite village (A to D):\nSince the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.\nA = 1\nF, B = A = 1\nFAi, ABi = A + B = 2\nAi = A + ABi + FAi = 5\nFi, Bi = ABi + B = 3\nEFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4\nM, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:\nM = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11\nE, C = B + BCi = 5\nEi, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20\nDEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25\nDi = M + CDi + DEi = 61\nD = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121\nThere are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.\nBonus Question:\nThe longest route is a route to the opposite village.

Ralph makes Rex add six 6-digit numbers produced by various rotations/swaps of the original digits.  \n    \u2022  In every column of that addition each of the six digits A\u2013F appears once, so each column-sum equals S.  \n    \u2022  Writing S as XY (tens digit X, ones digit Y), the grand total is  \n         111 111 \u00d7 S = 111 111 \u00d7 (10X+Y).  \n\n4.  The puzzle states that the first and last digits of this total are X and Y (the same two digits that end Ralph\u2019s number, though possibly swapped).  \n    \u2022  A carry into the leftmost column would change the first digit, so we must have X+Y < 10. \u2026 (3)\n\n5.

Possible pairs that are primes are 53, 35, 26, 62; all reuse digits 5,3,2,6 that would then leave no workable third prime pair.  \n    \u2022  A direct check shows no way to keep all digits different and make three prime pairs.  \n      \u21d2 17 impossible.\n\n8.  Therefore S = 23 (X=2,Y=3).  \n    \u2022  Last two digits are 2 and 3, so EF = 23 or 32.  Only 23 is prime, so EF = 23.  \n    \u2022  From (2) A+B must be 5.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?\n Solution: 2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.

{"ID": 8, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.\n\"The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.\"\n\"OK,\" says Ralph after a moment.  \"That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?\"\n\"No, no, no,\" replies Rex.  \"I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.\"\n\"The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.\"\nRalph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.\n\"The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.\"\n\"What number am I thinking of?\" asks Rex.\nRalph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, \"OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.\"\nRex frowns and says, \"One of those numbers is divisible by 13.\"\nRalph smiles and tells Rex the number.\nWhat were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?\nNote: The \"digital sum\" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.\n Solution: The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Hint": "You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.\nThe problem is as much about logic as it is about math.", "Human Solution": "The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": "SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT  \n\n1.  Parity of the unknown number  \n   \u2022 If Rex\u2019s number N were odd then both N\u20131 and N+1 would be even and would have to share the prime 2, contradicting the statement that all thirteen prime factors are different.  \n   \u2022 Hence N is even; therefore 2 is one of its own prime factors.\n\n2.

{"ID": 10, "Question": "Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.\nWhat is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?\n Solution: First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.\nFour of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:\nF = (N5)/5\nN5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1\nN4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1\nN3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1\nN2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1\nN1 = 4(N)/5 - 1\nF is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts.

{"ID": 15, "Question": "Question: I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.\n\"How old are you Tammy?\"\n\"I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.\"\n\"How old is your Mum now?\"\n\"There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.\"\nAssuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?\n Solution: Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.\nSolution:\nx = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born\nFrom Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.

The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "Question: The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.\n\"That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?\"\nBill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?\n Solution: Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.", "Hint": "1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.

We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": "SIMPLE, LOGICAL STEPS\n\n1.

Recall the 11-test.  \n   For a number whose digits are a\u2081a\u2082 \u2026 a\u2089 (a\u2081 the left-most), define  \n        D = (a\u2081 + a\u2083 + a\u2085 + a\u2087 + a\u2089) \u2013 (a\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2086 + a\u2088).  \n   The number is divisible by 11 \u21d4 D \u2261 0 (mod 11).\n\n2. Decide which digit is omitted.  \n   The sum of all ten digits 0-9 is 45.  \n   If digit x is left out, the sum of the nine remaining digits is S = 45 \u2013 x.  \n\n3. Observe that there are five odd positions and four even positions.  \n   So D = S \u2013 2\u00b7(sum of the digits in the even positions).  \n   Consequently D \u2261 0 (mod 11) \u21d4 2\u00b7(sum_even) \u2261 S (mod 11).\n\n4. Aim for the largest possible number.  \n   Put the biggest available digit in the most significant (left-most) position, the next-biggest in the next position, and so on, but keep the divisibility condition in mind.\n\n5. Start with the nine largest digits 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 (we tentatively drop 0, because dropping any larger digit would obviously make the final number smaller).  \n   Place them in descending order:\n        9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  \n   Odd-place sum = 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25  \n   Even-place sum = 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 20  \n   D = 25 \u2013 20 = 5  \u2192 not a multiple of 11.\n\n6. Adjust with the smallest possible change that keeps the number as large as possible.  \n   Swapping two digits that lie in positions of opposite parity changes D by \u00b1(difference of the swapped digits)\u00d72.  \n   We need to move D from 5 to either \u22126 or +6 (the nearest multiples of 11).  \n   A change of \u00b111 is therefore needed.\n\n7. The quickest way to get a \u0394D = +11 is to increase the odd-sum or decrease the even-sum by 11/2 = 5.5, impossible with integers.  \n   So use \u0394D = \u221211: reduce the odd-sum or increase the even-sum by 11/2 = 5.5 \u2192 still impossible directly.  \n   Therefore find a pair whose digit difference is 11/2 = 5.5 \u00d7 2 = 11.  \n\n   Searching the current list:  \n     Odd positions contain 9 7 5 3 1, even positions contain 8 6 4 2.  \n     The difference 8 \u2212 3 = 5, 7 \u2212 2 = 5, \u2026 none give 11.  \n\n8. Instead try moving one digit from an odd position to an even position (or vice-versa) by swapping adjacent digits.  \n   Swap the pair 4 (even pos 6) with 3 (odd pos 7):  \n        9 8 7 6 5 3 4 2 1  \n   Odd-sum = 9 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 26  \n   Even-sum = 8 + 6 + 3 + 2 = 19  \n   D = 26 \u2212 19 = 7 \u2192 still not 0 (mod 11).\n\n   Swap 2 (even pos 8) with 1 (odd pos 9):  \n        9 8 7 6 5 3 4 1 2  \n   Odd-sum = 9 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 27  \n   Even-sum = 8 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 18  \n   D = 9 \u2192 no.\n\n   Swap 5 (odd pos 5) with 2 (even pos 8):  \n        9 8 7 6 2 3 4 5 1  \n   Odd-sum = 9 + 7 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 23  \n   Even-sum = 8 + 6 + 3 + 5 = 22  \n   D = 1 \u2192 no.\n\n9. Systematically continue, always keeping swaps as far to the right as possible so the resulting number stays maximal.  \n   The first time the 11-condition is met while descending lexicographically is with  \n\n        987 652 413  \n\n   Calculation:  \n     Odd positions (1,3,5,7,9) \u2192 9 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 28  \n     Even positions (2,4,6,8) \u2192 8 + 6 + 2 + 1 = 17  \n     D = 28 \u2212 17 = 11 \u2261 0 (mod 11).  \n\n10.

Consequence for a tour.  \n   \u2022 In any (open or closed) sequence of knight moves, each time the knight visits an a-square it must have come from a b-square and must next move to a (different) b-square.  \n   \u2022 Thus every appearance of an a needs two distinct b-squares, one \u00abbefore\u00bb and one \u00abafter\u00bb.\n\n4.

Consequences for an age n  \n\u2022  Gauss: n\u00b3 + n\u2074 = n\u00b3(1 + n) must be divisible by 9.  \n   So either n is a multiple of 3, or (1 + n) is a multiple of 9, i.e. n \u2261 8 (mod 9).  \n\u2022  Professor: n\u00b2 + n\u00b3 = n\u00b2(1 + n) must be divisible by 9, giving the same condition:  \n   n \u2261 0 or 8 (mod 9).\n\nC.  Final-digit restrictions  \nPowers ending in 0, 1, 5, 6 always keep that final digit, which would duplicate a digit, so ages cannot end in 0, 1, 5, 6.\n\nD.  Narrowing Gauss\u2019s age  \n1. Gauss is \u201cyoung,\u201d so look at two-digit numbers < 30 satisfying B and C.  \n   Candidates: 18, 21, 24, 27 (multiples of 3) and 17, 26 (\u2261 8 mod 9), but 21, 24, 27 end in 1,4,7 (allowed) \u2013 we still test them.  \n2. Check whose cube has 4 digits and fourth power has 6 digits so the pair supplies exactly 10 digits in total.  \n   \u2022 17: 17\u00b3 = 4913 (4 d), 17\u2074 = 83521 (5 d) \u2192 only 9 digits.  \n   \u2022 18: 18\u00b3 = 5832 (4 d), 18\u2074 = 104 976 (6 d) \u2192 10 digits.  They are 0\u20139 once each. \u2713  \n   \u2022 Any larger n produces too many digits or repeats.  \n   \u21d2 Gauss = 18.\n\nE.  Narrowing the professor\u2019s age  \n1. Reasonably, the professor is between 45 and 99.  Apply B and C.  \n   Two-digit numbers in that range with n \u2261 0 or 8 (mod 9) and not ending in 0,1,5,6 are:  \n   48, 53, 54, 57, 62, 63, 69, 72, 78, 84, 87, 89, 93, 98, 99.  \n2.

Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.\nEileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.\nNow, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of \"off\".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.\n\"I know that voice!  C'mon down.\"\n\"Who is it?\" Eileen prodded.\n\"Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?\"\nEileen shrugged.  \"C'mon down, Jay,\" Patty called into the leaves.\n\"Why should I?\"\n\"I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.\"\n\"Is that the new Sinatra CD?\"\n\"No, it's the world's greatest snack.\"\n\"I'm hungry, too!\" the other voice whined.\n\"Who's up there with you?\"  Patty asked.\n\"I'll bet I know!\" Eileen called.  \"It's obvious!\"\nPatty's face lit up in realization.  \"Robin!\" they laughed together.\nA pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.\n\"But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,\" Eileen added.\n\"That's okay,\" Robin said.  \"Does it have to be percentages?\"\n\"There's no law; just tradition.

{"ID": 65, "Question": "Question: The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nAssume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.

Prove that no two disjoint 13-card hands can both reach 142 or more  \n   (a) Any 13-card hand that scores \u2265142 must include a joker.  \n       \u2013 Without a joker the very best 13 cards are the four 13s, four 12s, four 11s and one 10 \u2192 154 points.  \n       \u2013 Replacing the 10 by a 15-point joker raises the score to 159, so every \u2265142 hand naturally soaks up at least one joker.  \n   (b) There are only two jokers in the entire deck.  \n   (c) To let TWO different players reach the SAME total \u2265142, both jokers must be used, one per player.  \n   (d) After allocating the two jokers, we look at the remaining high cards.  \n       \u2013 Each value 13, 12 and 11 is represented only four times in the whole deck (step 3).  \n       \u2013 If both players tried to collect enough high cards to match totals of 142 or more, at least one of the values 11-13 would have to appear three times in each hand.  \n       \u2013 That would require six copies of the same value, which is impossible because only four exist.  \n   (e) Therefore two different 13-card hands cannot both attain 142 or more. A tie at 142+ is impossible.\n\n6. Combine steps 4 and 5  \n   \u2022 141 is the highest total at which a tie can still occur.  \n   \u2022 Hence 142 is the smallest total that guarantees you are alone at the top and do not need the milk-through-the-nose tie-breaker.\n\nAnswer: 142", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "0"}

Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?\"\n\"No, you could not.\"\n\"Aha!

First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C.

The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?\n Solution: The minimum number of weights is 5.\nweight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0\nweight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1\nweight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2\nweight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3\nweight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4\nAll five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.\nThe progression from one stone to one mass would be:\n1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....", "Hint": "The title has a slight hint.\nThe number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.", "Human Solution": "The minimum number of weights is 5.\nweight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0\nweight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1\nweight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2\nweight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3\nweight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4\nAll five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.\nThe progression from one stone to one mass would be:\n1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": "SOLUTION IN SIMPLE, LOGICAL STEPS\n\n1.  What \u201cweighing on a balance\u201d really means  \n    \u2022  If the load is x stone you are allowed to put some weights with the load and the rest on the opposite pan.  \n    \u2022  Algebraically this says:  \u2003x = \u03a3 a\u1d62 w\u1d62 \u2003with every coefficient a\u1d62 chosen from {\u20131, 0, 1}.  \n       ( a\u1d62 = 1\u2003 weight is on the weight pan,  \n        a\u1d62 = \u20131  weight is on the load pan,  \n        a\u1d62 = 0\u2003 weight not used ).  \n\n2.

Find how many weights are NECESSARY  \n    \u2022  A mass is 11 lumps = 11 \u00d7 11 = 121 stone, so we must reach every number 1\u2026121.  \n    \u2022  Smallest n with (3\u207f\u20131)/2 \u2265 121:  \n        n = 4 \u2192 (81\u20131)/2 = 40\u2003too small  \n        n = 5 \u2192 (243\u20131)/2 = 121\u2003just right.  \n      Therefore at least 5 weights are required.\n\n4.  Choose the actual weights (SUFFICIENT part)  \n    \u2022  Take the first five powers of 3 expressed in stone:  \n         w\u2081 = 3\u2070 =   1 stone  \n         w\u2082 = 3\u00b9 =   3 stone  \n         w\u2083 = 3\u00b2 =   9 stone  \n         w\u2084 = 3\u00b3 =  27 stone  = 2 lump 5 stone  \n         w\u2085 = 3\u2074 =  81 stone  = 7 lump 4 stone  \n    \u2022  Their total is 1+3+9+27+81 = 121 stone = 1 mass, and balanced ternary guarantees every weight from 1 to 121 can be formed.\n\n5.

Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.\nConsidering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?\nHe further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.\n Solution: Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.\nFirst let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.\nHere H can take values from 1 to 12.\nFor M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.\nFor M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.\nFor M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.\nFor M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.\nFor M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.\nFor M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.\nAny further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.\nHence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24\nThis is for 12 hours.\nIn a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =\n24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.\nNow let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.\nHere H can take values from 0 to 23.\nFor M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.\nFor M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.\nFor M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.\nFor M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 0 to 7 i.e., 8 values, for H = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21.\nFor M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 0 to 5 i.e., 6 values, for H = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.\nFor M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 0 to 4 i.e., 5 values, for H = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20.\nAny further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.\nHence the total = 10+10+8+6+5 = 39\nThis is for 24 hours.\nIn a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =\n39 instances in a 24-hour format.", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.\nFirst let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.\nHere H can take values from 1 to 12.\nFor M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.\nFor M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.\nFor M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.\nFor M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.\nFor M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.\nFor M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.\nAny further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.\nHence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24\nThis is for 12 hours.\nIn a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =\n24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.\nNow let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.\nHere H can take values from 0 to 23.\nFor M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.\nFor M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.\nFor M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.\nFor M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 0 to 7 i.e., 8 values, for H = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21.\nFor M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 0 to 5 i.e., 6 values, for H = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.\nFor M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 0 to 4 i.e., 5 values, for H = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20.\nAny further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.\nHence the total = 10+10+8+6+5 = 39\nThis is for 24 hours.\nIn a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =\n39 instances in a 24-hour format.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": "Clock-face equation\n   H \u00f7 M1 = M2       with remainder 0\n\u21d4 H = M1 \u00b7 M2\n\nDigits and limits\n\u2022 Minutes = M1M2 must be < 60 \u2192 1 \u2264 M1 \u2264 5 and 0 \u2264 M2 \u2264 9  \n\u2022 Divisor M1 \u2260 0 (otherwise undefined).  \n\u2022 Hour range:\u20031\u202612 in a 12-hour half-day,\u20030\u202623 in 24-hour time.\n\nStep-by-step count for one 12-hour half-day\n1.

The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.

In the ritual, each arm of a male links with an arm of a female, no male-female pair of robots linking more than once. The minimum number of robots required to link all arms once only is the number belonging to that tribe. Now one night, the Creaky tribe cornered half of the Rusty tribe and despite being outnumbered two to one, unscrewed one arm from each, there being an equal number of male and female victims. However, the Creaky tribe were extremely poor at arithmetic and had failed to realise that they needed 24 times their actual haul of spare arms in order that the number of links their members could then make, each with the same number of extra arms, was half the maximum number of links the Rusty tribe could then make.

{"ID": 126, "Question": "Question: The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nIn a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).

If a fraction equals \u00bd, the denominator must be exactly twice the numerator.  \n    So we need one 5-digit number N such that 2 \u00d7 N is also a 5-digit number and the ten digits appearing in N and 2N are exactly the multiset {0,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,9}.\n\n2.  The digit 0 has to appear somewhere; it cannot be the initial digit of a 5-digit number, so it must occur in the denominator.  \n    The only way a product 2 \u00d7 N can end in 0 is for N to end in 5 (because 2 \u00d7 5 = 10).  \n    Therefore  \n        \u2022 The numerator\u2019s last digit is 5.  \n        \u2022 The denominator\u2019s last digit is 0, and a carry-1 is produced for the tens column.\n\n3.  Remove the already-used digits 5 and 0 from the pool; eight digits remain: {1,2,2,3,4,4,6,9}.  \n    Write the numerator as abcd5 and compute the denominator digit-by-digit from right to left, always remembering the possible carry (0 or 1).\n\n4.  Work systematically (or let a short computer search run).  One convenient hand check goes as follows.  \n    \u2022 Because of the carry-1, the tens digit of the denominator is 2d + 1 (possibly with a new carry).  \n    \u2022 d cannot be 4, 6 or 9 because 2d + 1 would then repeat 0 or give a two-digit number larger than 9.  \n    \u2022 Trying d = 4 actually works: 2\u00b74 + 1 = 9, no new carry.  Now the tens digit of the denominator is 9; remove the 9 from the unused-digit pool.  \n    \u2022 Continue the process for the hundreds, thousands and ten-thousands columns.  The only choice that never violates the digit pool is  \n          numerator 12345 \u2192 denominator 24690.\n\n5.  Check:  \n       2 \u00d7 12345 = 24690,  \n       and the ten digits appearing are exactly 0,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,9, no repeats beyond the specified multiplicities.\n\n6.

At P you are facing south.  \n   A 90\u00b0 \u201cleft turn\u201d rotates your tangent direction to due east.  \n   The unique great-circle whose tangent at P points due east is the circle that contains P and the two \u201cimaginary poles\u201d  \n   E = (0, R, 0) (east pole) and W = (0, \u2013R, 0) (west pole).  \n   Hence from P the great-circle you now follow passes through E and W.\n\n5.  Distance from P to E along that great-circle is always \u00bc of the full circle, i.e. a central angle of \u03c0/2 (because P, E and W form a right angle at the centre).  \n   Arc length P \u2192 E = (\u03c0/2) R = (\u03c0/2)(10 km) \u2248 15.708 km.\n\n6.

It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?\nComments to triflers:\nThe bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!\n Solution: 80\nTo achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion.

Stage 2 \u2013 spend the loose fuel and discard the empty case  \n   Only 4 cases need to be moved now, so each half-mile segment costs 2\u00b74\u20131 = 7 \u00d7 \u00bd = 3\u00bd\n   bottles.  Exactly the 3\u00bd loose bottles are on hand, so we let d\u2082 = \u00bd mile.

Stage 3 \u2013 take the 4 full cases the remaining 2 2\u20449 miles  \n   With 4 cases there are still 7 trips per mile, so the fuel cost of the final leg is  \n          7 \u00b7 2 2\u20449 = 15 5\u20449 bottles.  \n   Those bottles must now come out of the sealed stock:  \n          96 \u2013 15 5\u20449 = 80 4\u20449 bottles.  \n\n5.

Expanded length of a rail.  \n   Original length = 63 360 in.  \n   Added expansion = 1 in.  \n   New length (track itself) = 63 361 in.\n\n3. Simplify the shape.  \n   With both ends fixed to the ground the rail will rise in the middle, forming an isosceles triangle:  \n   \u2022 base (distance between the two pins) = 63 360 in,  \n   \u2022 each equal side (the rail halves) = 63 361 in.  \n\n4.

A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.

A useful observation about any single call  \nWhen two people talk, at most one of them can end the call already knowing every piece of gossip.  \n\u2003\u2022 If neither knew everything beforehand, at most one of them can gain the last missing item(s).  \n\u2003\u2022 If one already knew everything, the other can now catch up, raising the total number of all-knowers by exactly one.  \n\nHence the number of \u201cexperts\u2019\u2019 (people who know all gossip) can rise by at most one per call.\n\nStep 3.  Identify the last call   \nCall L is the final call in a successful scheme.  \nLet P be the person who still lacked some gossip just before L; let Q be the other participant in L.  \nAfter L finishes, both P and Q are experts, and no other calls follow.\n\nStep 4.

Calls that must occur after the moment Q first became an expert  \nQ must have become an expert in some call K (possibly earlier than L).  \nFrom that moment until the end, each of the remaining n \u2212 3 non-experts has to speak to an expert to learn everything.  \nCounting L itself as covering P, there are still n \u2212 3 others to inform, so at least n \u2212 3 additional calls are needed after K.  \n\nStep 6.

{"ID": 169, "Question": "Question: Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.\nWe were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.\nAfter a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?\n Solution: It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.\nHence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.\nOut of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90. These 90 id's will not have a corresponding number when written in reverse order.\nSecondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order. For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.\nRest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order.

{"ID": 189, "Question": "Question: A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.\nHow fast can the man run?\n Solution: Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.\nFeel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.

How a balance scale works  \n    \u2022 A weight can be placed on either pan.  \n    \u2022 Putting a weight on the same pan as the wheat \u201csubtracts\u201d that weight; putting it on the opposite pan \u201cadds\u201d that weight.  \n    \u2022 Therefore each weight contributes \u20131, 0, or +1 times its value when we try to match a desired mass.\n\n2.  Matching every integer mass from 1 kg to 40 kg  \n    \u2022 We want four integer weights w\u2081<w\u2082<w\u2083<w\u2084 such that every N in {1,\u2026,40} can be written as  \n      N = a\u2081w\u2081 + a\u2082w\u2082 + a\u2083w\u2083 + a\u2084w\u2084,\u2003with each coefficient a\u1d62 \u2208 {\u20131, 0, 1}.  \n    \u2022 The largest positive total we can reach is w\u2081+w\u2082+w\u2083+w\u2084 (all a\u1d62 = +1).  \n    \u2022 The most negative total is \u2013(w\u2081+w\u2082+w\u2083+w\u2084).  \n    \u2022 Hence with four weights the reachable span is from \u2013(w\u2081+\u2026+w\u2084) to +(w\u2081+\u2026+w\u2084).  \n      To cover 1\u201340, the sum must be at least 40.\n\n3.  Choosing the best pattern: balanced ternary  \n    \u2022 Balanced ternary (base-3 with digits \u20131,0,1) naturally embodies the \u20131/0/+1 idea.  \n    \u2022 Using the first four powers of 3 gives the values 1, 3, 9, 27.  \n    \u2022 Any integer whose absolute value \u2264 (3\u2074\u20131)/2 = 40 can be expressed uniquely in balanced ternary with at most four digits.\n\n4.  Verifying coverage  \n    \u2022 Sum of the four chosen weights = 1+3+9+27 = 40 \u21d2 the maximum positive weight attainable is 40 kg, exactly what we need.  \n    \u2022 Because balanced ternary is exhaustive up to that limit, every N from 1 to 40 has a representation using coefficients \u20131,0,1, and therefore can be balanced with the chosen weights.\n\n5.  Example demonstrations  \n    \u2022 8 kg:\u20038 = 9 \u2013 1\u2003\u2192 place 9 kg opposite the wheat, 1 kg with the wheat.  \n    \u2022 23 kg:\u200323 = 27 \u2013 3 \u2013 1\u2003\u2192 put 27 kg opposite, 3 kg and 1 kg with the wheat.  \n    \u2022 37 kg:\u200337 = 27 + 9 + 1\u2003\u2192 put 27, 9, 1 kg opposite the wheat.\n\nConclusion  \nThe four weights must be 1 kg, 3 kg, 9 kg, and 27 kg.

Look for whole-number pairs (a, b) whose product is 1680.  \n   List the factor pairs of 1680: (1,1680), (2,840), (3,560), \u2026, (40,42) \u2026, (70,24), (84,20) etc.\n\n3.  Impose the right-triangle (Pythagorean) condition.  \n   For any candidate pair (a, b) compute  \n        c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.  \n   Keep the pair only if c\u00b2 is a perfect square.\n\n4.  Work through the list; only three pairs survive:  \n        (a, b, c) = (40, 42, 58)       because 40\u00b2 + 42\u00b2 = 1600 + 1764 = 3364 = 58\u00b2  \n        (a, b, c) = (24, 70, 74)       because 24\u00b2 + 70\u00b2 = 576 + 4900 = 5476 = 74\u00b2  \n        (a, b, c) = (15,112,113)       because 15\u00b2 +112\u00b2 = 225 +12544 = 12769 =113\u00b2  \n   Hence there are exactly three integral right-triangles with area 840 ft\u00b2.\n\n5.  Convert each hypotenuse into the required rope length.  \n   The minimum rope that reaches the whole yard is the radius of the semicircle that contains the triangle, i.e. c \u2044 2.  \n        58 \u2044 2 = 29 ft  \n        74 \u2044 2 = 37 ft  \n        113 \u2044 2 = 56.5 ft\n\n6.

There are six such segments.\n\nObservations  \n1. The total of the numbers 1-12 is 78.  \n2. Every number lies on exactly two of the six segments, so the sum of the six segment\u2013totals is counted twice:  \n   2 \u00d7 78 = 156 = 6 \u00d7 (segment-sum).  \n   Therefore the common segment-sum must be 156 / 6 = 26. (So 26 is forced; we do not choose it.)\n\n3. If the two extreme points of a segment are chosen so that they add to 13, the two inner points must also add to 13, because 13+13 = 26.  \n   Hence it is natural to pair the numbers into complementary 13-pairs:  \n   (1,12) (2,11) (3,10) (4,9) (5,8) (6,7).\n\nConstruction in six steps  \n1. Draw one long segment of the star.  Put the pair (2,11) at its ends: \u2026-2-\u25a1-\u25a1-11-\u2026  \n2. The inner two places of that same segment must add to 13; choose (6,7): \u2026-2-6-7-11-\u2026  \n3. Move to the next segment that shares the end \u201c2\u201d.  The far end of that segment must be the partner of 6 or 7 so we still get 13 opposite 2: place 12 at that far end.  Now that segment reads 2-\u25a1-\u25a1-12 with 2+12=14, so the two middle spots must add to 12.  Choose (5,7) but 7 is already used; take (4,8).  That makes the segment 2-4-8-12 (4+8=12), total 26.\n\n4. Continue around the star, each time respecting the 13-pair idea at the ends and filling the middles so the running total is 26.  One systematic way is always to pick the unused member of the needed 13-pair for every new end.\n\n5. With only two numbers left unused (3 and 9) there will be exactly one open 4-point segment, and the partial sum of its first three entries will force the last number.  Check that the forced value is indeed the unused one; if not, backtrack one choice and swap the last two middles you entered.\n\n6.

{"ID": 247, "Question": "Question: The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.\nHe said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?\n Solution: The observations given are :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nFrom observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.\nLet us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.\nFrom observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.\nHence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.\nIf it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.\nThis means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.\nNow the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3.
