{"ID": 0, "Question": "There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.\nThe island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.\nOn April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.\nIf the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?\nBonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?", "Hint": "To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.", "Human Solution": "The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.\nBonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.\nAll villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:\n1) First set the starting point to one.\n2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.\n3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)\n4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.\nWhich points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.\nNote that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.\nThe routes:\nThis is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.\nRoutes to an adjacent village (A to B):\nTo determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.\nThe farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.\nThe next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.\nThe next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.\nThe next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.\nThere are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.\nRoutes to the second village along the coast (A to C):\nA = 1\nAFi = A = 1\nFi = AFi = 1\nAi = A + AFi = 2\nABi = Ai + A = 3\nM and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nM = Ai + Fi = 3\nB = A + ABi = 4\nBi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBi = B + ABi + M = 10\nDi = M = 3\nBCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBCi = B + Bi = 14\nCDi = Di = 3\nCi = BCi + CDi + M = 20\nC = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41\nThere are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.\nRoutes to the opposite village (A to D):\nSince the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.\nA = 1\nF, B = A = 1\nFAi, ABi = A + B = 2\nAi = A + ABi + FAi = 5\nFi, Bi = ABi + B = 3\nEFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4\nM, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:\nM = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11\nE, C = B + BCi = 5\nEi, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20\nDEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25\nDi = M + CDi + DEi = 61\nD = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121\nThere are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.\nBonus Question:\nThe longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:\nA-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D\nand the mirror route\nA-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D\n(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)\nIf the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.\nThe path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.\nThe paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is\n5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)\nSo the total distance traveled is\n10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Label the six coast villages\u00a0V\u2080,V\u2081,\u2026,V\u2085 clockwise round the island.  \nThe three brothers live in V\u2080.  \nTheir brides live, in clockwise order from V\u2080, in  \n\n\u2003\u2022\u00a0V\u2081  (nearest clockwise neighbour)  \n\u2003\u2022\u00a0V\u2082  (two steps clockwise)  \n\u2003\u2022\u00a0V\u2083  (diametrically opposite)\n\nBecause every pair of villages is joined by a straight jungle path, the graph of routes is the complete graph\u00a0K\u2086 drawn on the vertices of a regular hexagon.  \nFor any destination T a \u201clegal\u201d day\u2019s route is a path whose successive vertices get strictly closer (in the Euclidean sense) to T.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n1.

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.\nSince the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?", "Hint": "A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "How Rex could get the answer so fast  \n\n1.

{"ID": 10, "Question": "After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.\nWhat is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?", "Hint": "The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.\nOf course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.", "Human Solution": "First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.\nFour of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:\nF = (N5)/5\nN5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1\nN4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1\nN3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1\nN2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1\nN1 = 4(N)/5 - 1\nF is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.\nSubstitution results in the following equation:\n(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6\nor\n1024N = 15625F + 8404\nGiven that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Let  \n\nN\u2080  = number of coconuts in the original pile (before anybody gets up at night)  \nN\u2081 = pile left after the 1st person has stolen his share  \nN\u2082 = pile left after the 2nd person has stolen his share  \n\u22ef  \nN\u2085 = pile left in the morning before the final fair division.\n\nWhat happens each night is always the same:\n\n(1) One coconut is thrown to the monkey,  \n(2) the remainder is exactly divisible by 5,  \n(3) the thief takes away one of the five equal parts,  \n(4) the other four parts are heaped back together.\n\nIf the pile entering the night is X, the pile that remains after the thief is\n\n      4 (X \u2013 1) / 5.\n\nTherefore\n\n      N\u2081 = 4(N\u2080 \u2013 1)/5\n      N\u2082 = 4(N\u2081 \u2013 1)/5\n      N\u2083 = 4(N\u2082 \u2013 1)/5\n      N\u2084 = 4(N\u2083 \u2013 1)/5\n      N\u2085 = 4(N\u2084 \u2013 1)/5 .\n\nFinally, in the morning N\u2085 is divided fairly by 5 with no remainder, so\n\n      N\u2085 \u2261 0  (mod 5).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nWorking backwards\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt is easier to start with N\u2085 and climb back to N\u2080.  \nThe inverse operation of\n\n      N_k = 4(N_{k\u20131} \u2013 1)/5\n\nis\n\n      N_{k\u20131} = 5N_k/4 + 1.\n\nStep 1 :  Let N\u2085 = 5m  (because it must be a multiple of 5).\n\nStep 2 :  N\u2084 = 5(5m)/4 + 1 = 25m/4 + 1\n          \u21d2  25m must be divisible by 4 \u21d2 m = 4n.\n\nStep 3 :  N\u2084 = 25n + 1\n          N\u2083 = 5(25n + 1)/4 + 1 = (125n + 9)/4\n          For this to be integral: 125n + 9 \u2261 0 (mod 4)\n                                  \u21d2 n + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 4)\n                                  \u21d2 n = 4p + 3.\n\nStep 4 :  N\u2083 = 125p + 96\n          N\u2082 = 5(125p + 96)/4 + 1 = (625p + 484)/4 + 1\n                                  = (625p)/4 + 121\n          \u21d2 625p divisible by 4 \u21d2 p = 4q.\n\nStep 5 :  N\u2082 = 625q + 121\n          N\u2081 = 5(625q + 121)/4 + 1 = (3125q + 609)/4\n          For integrality: 3125q + 609 \u2261 0 (mod 4)\n                           \u21d2 q + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 4)\n                           \u21d2 q = 4r + 3.\n\nStep 6 :  N\u2081 = 3125r + 2496\n          N\u2080 = 5(3125r + 2496)/4 + 1 = (15625r + 12480)/4 + 1\n                                     = (15625r)/4 + 3121\n          \u21d2 15625r divisible by 4 \u21d2 r = 4s.\n\nFinal result\n\n      N\u2080 = 15625s + 3121   ,\u2003s = 0,1,2,\u2026\n\nThe smallest positive choice is s = 0, giving\n\n      N\u2080 = 3121.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nVerification for 3121\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nStart with 3121.\n\nNight\u00a01: 3121 \u2013 1 = 3120 = 5\u00b7624 \u2192 take 624, leave 4\u00b7624 = 2496  \nNight\u00a02: 2496 \u2013 1 = 2495 = 5\u00b7499 \u2192 take 499, leave 4\u00b7499 = 1996  \nNight\u00a03: 1996 \u2013 1 = 1995 = 5\u00b7399 \u2192 take 399, leave 4\u00b7399 = 1596  \nNight\u00a04: 1596 \u2013 1 = 1595 = 5\u00b7319 \u2192 take 319, leave 4\u00b7319 = 1276  \nNight\u00a05: 1276 \u2013 1 = 1275 = 5\u00b7255 \u2192 take 255, leave 4\u00b7255 = 1020  \n\nMorning: 1020 \u00f7 5 = 204 each, with no remainder.\n\nEverything fits, and any smaller starting number would violate one of the integrality conditions above.\n\nFinal answer: 3121", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1"}

{"ID": 15, "Question": "I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.\n\"How old are you Tammy?\"\n\"I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.\"\n\"How old is your Mum now?\"\n\"There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.\"\nAssuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.\nSolution:\nx = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born\nFrom Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.\nGoing back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.\n\"That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?\"\nBill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?", "Hint": "1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Human Solution": "Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.

{"ID": 63, "Question": "Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.\nEileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.\nNow, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of \"off\".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.\n\"I know that voice!  C'mon down.\"\n\"Who is it?\" Eileen prodded.\n\"Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?\"\nEileen shrugged.  \"C'mon down, Jay,\" Patty called into the leaves.\n\"Why should I?\"\n\"I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.\"\n\"Is that the new Sinatra CD?\"\n\"No, it's the world's greatest snack.\"\n\"I'm hungry, too!\" the other voice whined.\n\"Who's up there with you?\"  Patty asked.\n\"I'll bet I know!\" Eileen called.  \"It's obvious!\"\nPatty's face lit up in realization.  \"Robin!\" they laughed together.\nA pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.\n\"But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,\" Eileen added.\n\"That's okay,\" Robin said.  \"Does it have to be percentages?\"\n\"There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?\"\n\"We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.\"\n\"What are those?\"\n\"You know what a perfect number is?\"\n\"Sure,\" Patty interjected, \"a number equal to the sum of its divisors.\"\n\"Great,\" Jay continued.  \"Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.\"\nPatty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.\n\"So, what do you have for four people?\" Patty encouraged.\n\"I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?\"\n\"I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?\"\n\"1184 and 1210.\"\n\"That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.\"\n\"Well, how about an aliquot sequence?\"\n\"Okay.  How does it taste?\" Patty asked.\n\"Can you hum a few bars?\" Eileen offered at the same time.\nRobin laughed.  \"No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.\"\nEileen and Patty understood.  \"So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?\"\n\"Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.\"\n\"Well, do you have any of those handy?\"\n\"It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?\"\n\"Sure.\"  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  \"At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.\"\nJay and Robin shared a glance.  \"Robin, is your homework still in your pack?\"\n\"It sure is.

{"ID": 64, "Question": "The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with \"rock\", 2 points with \"scissors\", and 1 point with \"paper\".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one \"throw\", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.\nThe players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.\nKnowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?", "Hint": "(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.\n(2) This is a \"zero-sum\" game: what one player wins, the other loses.\n(3) The game is \"symmetric\": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.\n(4) The game is \"open\": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.", "Human Solution": "Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.\nMethod:\nTo avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.\n(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.\n(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.\n(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.\n(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.\nWith these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.\nSo, we're looking to mix our \"throws\" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.

Now use the decorative diagonal that runs from the lower\u2011left corner to the\n   upper\u2011right corner of the cake.  Make a single straight cut along that line.\n\nThat third cut meets the first two inside the cake, so the three cuts intersect pair\u2011wise in\nthree different interior points; consequently the square is split into the maximal seven\nregions.  Because the two distances (16\u20447\u00a0cm and 24\u20447\u00a0cm) were chosen in the proportions\n2\u00a0:\u00a03, every one of the seven regions turns out to have the same area,\n64\u20447\u00a0cm\u00b2 \u2013 either as a single right triangle or as a quadrilateral made of two such\ntriangles glued together.\n\nThus with nothing but three ordinary perpendicular cuts we can obtain\nexactly seven, and only seven, equal\u2011sized pieces.\n\nFinal answer:  \n\u2022  For three partners: cut off the leftmost third of the cake (width 8\u20443\u00a0cm); then cut the\n  remaining block diagonally from the lower\u2011left corner of that block to the far\n  upper\u2011right corner of the cake.

You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?\n(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)", "Hint": "ere is the profit made on each size (found using the information in the first few sentences):\nSmall: $0.75\nMedium: $1.00\nLarge: $1.75\nX-large: $2.00", "Human Solution": "(1): m=4s\n(2): m > l > x > s\n(3): 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650, divided by 25 gives...\n(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186\n(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186\nCan s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.\nCan s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.\nNow we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.\nSubstituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7\nWe know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).\nIf x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.\nIf x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.\nIf x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.\nThis proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.\nSubstituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.\nNow we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.\nThe solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10.

{"ID": 115, "Question": "On planet ?*!@, the inhabitants are robots with various numbers of arms. The robots are grouped into tribes according to the numbers of arms they have so that in any tribe, no member has a different number of arms to the other members. Each tribe follows the same fertility ritual before bed each night, a ritual that also reveals the number of members in a tribe. In the ritual, each arm of a male links with an arm of a female, no male-female pair of robots linking more than once. The minimum number of robots required to link all arms once only is the number belonging to that tribe. Now one night, the Creaky tribe cornered half of the Rusty tribe and despite being outnumbered two to one, unscrewed one arm from each, there being an equal number of male and female victims. However, the Creaky tribe were extremely poor at arithmetic and had failed to realise that they needed 24 times their actual haul of spare arms in order that the number of links their members could then make, each with the same number of extra arms, was half the maximum number of links the Rusty tribe could then make.

{"ID": 126, "Question": "The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nIn a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).

{"ID": 151, "Question": "In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.\nOn one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.\nFirst, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.\nSecond, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.\nThird, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.\nFourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)\nFor discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.\nAbout this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, \"Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.\"\nKnowing Junior, we asked, \"How big a headache is your math gonna give us?\"\nShe answered, \"I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.\"\nName the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.", "Hint": "Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.", "Human Solution": "Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.\nAfter labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, \"Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof. First, I mark a line from A to D.  This creates a trapezoid (trapezium in Britain) ABCD.  Next, I mark the lines EH, BG, and CF.  These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.\"\nThe partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's.

Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.\nIf R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.\nSince R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.\nIf N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5.

{"ID": 189, "Question": "A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.\nHow fast can the man run?", "Hint": "You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.", "Human Solution": "Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.

{"ID": 247, "Question": "The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.\nHe said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer.

However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.\nThis means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.\nNow the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3.

The young man may visit other villages along the way.\nOn April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.\nIf the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?\nBonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?", "Hint": "To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.", "Human Solution": "The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.\nBonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.\nAll villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:\n1) First set the starting point to one.\n2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.\n3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)\n4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.\nWhich points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.\nNote that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.\nThe routes:\nThis is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.\nRoutes to an adjacent village (A to B):\nTo determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.\nThe farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.\nThe next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.\nThe next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.\nThe next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.\nThere are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.\nRoutes to the second village along the coast (A to C):\nA = 1\nAFi = A = 1\nFi = AFi = 1\nAi = A + AFi = 2\nABi = Ai + A = 3\nM and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nM = Ai + Fi = 3\nB = A + ABi = 4\nBi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBi = B + ABi + M = 10\nDi = M = 3\nBCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBCi = B + Bi = 14\nCDi = Di = 3\nCi = BCi + CDi + M = 20\nC = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41\nThere are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.\nRoutes to the opposite village (A to D):\nSince the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.\nA = 1\nF, B = A = 1\nFAi, ABi = A + B = 2\nAi = A + ABi + FAi = 5\nFi, Bi = ABi + B = 3\nEFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4\nM, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:\nM = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11\nE, C = B + BCi = 5\nEi, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20\nDEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25\nDi = M + CDi + DEi = 61\nD = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121\nThere are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.\nBonus Question:\nThe longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:\nA-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D\nand the mirror route\nA-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D\n(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)\nIf the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.\nThe path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.\nThe paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is\n5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)\nSo the total distance traveled is\n10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Label the six coastal villages, in clockwise order,  \n\n\u2003V0 ,\u00a0V1 ,\u00a0V2 ,\u00a0V3 ,\u00a0V4 ,\u00a0V5 .  \n\nThe father of the three suitors lives in V0 .  \nThe brides live in the next three villages encountered clockwise, i.e. in V1 ,\u00a0V2 ,\u00a0V3 .  \nThus the three journeys to be studied are\n\n\u2003Son\u00a0A :\u2003V0  \u2192  V1  \n\u2003Son\u00a0B :\u2003V0  \u2192  V2  \n\u2003Son\u00a0C :\u2003V0  \u2192  V3.\n\nBecause a straight path joins every pair of villages, any sequence of villages whose\nsuccessive distances to the destination strictly decrease is an admissible \u201croute.\u201d\nDistances in a regular hexagon depend only on how many sides apart the two\nvillages are:\n\n\u2003adjacent (1 side apart) \u2026\u2026\u2026 length = 1 unit  \n\u2003two\u2011apart (2 sides) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 length = \u221a3 units  \n\u2003opposite (3 sides) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 length = 2 units.\n\n(Exact lengths are fixed later in the bonus question; for counting routes we need\nonly the order 2\u00a0>\u00a0\u221a3\u00a0>\u00a01\u00a0>\u00a00.)\n\n1.

{"ID": 5, "Question": "Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.\nSince the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?", "Hint": "A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Let  \n\n\u2022\u2003n  be the number of sides of the regular polygon that is Ralph\u2019s lot,  \n\u2022\u2003s  the length of one side of the lot,  \n\u2022\u2003r  the radius of the circular foundation (half of its diameter),  \n\u2022\u2003\u03b8 = \u03c0/n  the half\u2011central angle of both polygons.  \n\n1.

{"ID": 8, "Question": "Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.\n\"The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.\"\n\"OK,\" says Ralph after a moment.  \"That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?\"\n\"No, no, no,\" replies Rex.  \"I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.\"\n\"The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.\"\nRalph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.\n\"The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.\"\n\"What number am I thinking of?\" asks Rex.\nRalph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, \"OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.\"\nRex frowns and says, \"One of those numbers is divisible by 13.\"\nRalph smiles and tells Rex the number.\nWhat were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?\nNote: The \"digital sum\" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.", "Hint": "You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.\nThe problem is as much about logic as it is about math.", "Human Solution": "The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Two numbers satisfy every clue that Ralph could check without doing any\nfactorisation:\n\n\u2003443\u00a0749\u2003and\u2003443\u00a0794.\n\nA single further check distinguishes them.  \n443\u00a0794 is a multiple of 13 ( 443\u00a0794 = 13\u00b734\u00a0138 ), while 443\u00a0749 is not.\nBecause Rex told Ralph that \u201cOne of those numbers is divisible by\u00a013\u201d, Ralph\ncould at once discard 443\u00a0794 and give the other one as Rex\u2019s number.\n\nFinal answer: 443\u00a0749 and 443\u00a0794; Rex\u2019s number is 443\u00a0749.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0"}

After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.).

Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:\nF = (N5)/5\nN5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1\nN4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1\nN3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1\nN2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1\nN1 = 4(N)/5 - 1\nF is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.\nSubstitution results in the following equation:\n(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6\nor\n1024N = 15625F + 8404\nGiven that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Let  \n\nN\u2080 = number of coconuts in the pile before anyone steals.  \nFor i = 1,2,3,4,5 let  \n\nq\u1d62 = the share (one\u2011fifth of what he finds after removing the monkey\u2019s coconut) taken by the i\u2011th survivor,  \nN\u1d62 = number left after the i\u2011th survivor finishes.\n\nThe night\u2019s events translate exactly into the equalities  \n\n1)  N\u2080 = 5q\u2081 + 1 ,\u2003\u2003N\u2081 = 4q\u2081  \n2)  N\u2081 = 5q\u2082 + 1 ,\u2003\u2003N\u2082 = 4q\u2082  \n3)  N\u2082 = 5q\u2083 + 1 ,\u2003\u2003N\u2083 = 4q\u2083  \n4)  N\u2083 = 5q\u2084 + 1 ,\u2003\u2003N\u2084 = 4q\u2084  \n5)  N\u2084 = 5q\u2085 + 1 ,\u2003\u2003N\u2085 = 4q\u2085  \n\nand on the following morning  \n\n6)  N\u2085 is a multiple of 5.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWork backwards from the morning pile\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWrite N\u2085 = 5k for some integer k.\n\nFrom (5):\u20034q\u2085 = N\u2085 = 5k \u2003\u21d2\u2003q\u2085 = 5k/4.  \nThus 5k must be divisible by 4, so k = 4B for some integer B, whence q\u2085 = 5B.\n\nInsert this in (5):\u2003N\u2084 = 5q\u2085 + 1 = 25B + 1.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFourth survivor\u2019s condition\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nBut N\u2084 also equals 4q\u2084 (see (4)), so  \n\n4q\u2084 = 25B + 1 \u2003\u21d2\u2003q\u2084 = (25B + 1)/4.\n\nFor q\u2084 to be an integer we need 25B + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 4).  \nBecause 25 \u2261 1 (mod 4), this means B + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 4), i.e.  \n\nB = 4C + 3\u2003for some integer C.\n\nThen\u2003q\u2084 = (25(4C + 3) + 1)/4 = 25C + 19.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThird survivor\u2019s condition\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nN\u2083 = 5q\u2084 + 1 = 5(25C + 19) + 1 = 125C + 96,\n\nbut simultaneously N\u2083 = 4q\u2083, so  \n\nq\u2083 = (125C + 96)/4.\n\nSince 125 \u2261 1 (mod 4), integrality forces C \u2261 0 (mod 4).  \nWrite C = 4D.

{"ID": 15, "Question": "I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.\n\"How old are you Tammy?\"\n\"I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.\"\n\"How old is your Mum now?\"\n\"There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.\"\nAssuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.

By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.\nGoing back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.

How old are they?", "Hint": "1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Human Solution": "Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "I was unable to find a self\u2013consistent set of four whole\u2011number ages that satisfies all four of the \u201cdigit\u2013sum\u201d conditions simultaneously.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0"}

Which digit should be omitted?  \nIf any digit other than 0 is omitted, the figure 0 must appear somewhere in the number.  \nBecause 0 is smaller than every other remaining symbol, a number that contains 0 can never exceed (in the ordinary, lexicographic sense) one that contains the same eight other symbols but not 0.  \nHence, to get the largest possible integer the digit that is discarded has to be 0; the nine digits that will actually be used are therefore 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nStep 2.  The 11\u2013test.  \nWrite the required 9\u2013digit number as  \n\nd\u2081 d\u2082 d\u2083 d\u2084 d\u2085 d\u2086 d\u2087 d\u2088 d\u2089 ,  \n\nwith d\u2081 the most significant digit.  \nFor divisibility by 11 we must have  \n\n( d\u2081+d\u2083+d\u2085+d\u2087+d\u2089 ) \u2212 ( d\u2082+d\u2084+d\u2086+d\u2088 ) \u2261 0 (mod 11).     (\u2020)\n\nBecause 0 has been omitted, the total of the nine digits is  \n1+2+\u22ef+9 = 45.  \nIn (\u2020) there are five \u201codd\u2013position\u2019\u2019 digits and four \u201ceven\u2013position\u2019\u2019 digits, so the left\u2013hand side can only be one of  \n\u2026 , \u221222, \u221211, 0, 11, 22, \u2026 .  \nIts parity must match the parity of 45 (which is odd), hence the only admissible values are \u00b111.  \n\nMoreover the biggest possible numerical difference between the two partial sums is obtained by putting 9,8,7,6,5 in the odd places and 1,2,3,4 in the even places; that difference is 35\u221210 = 25, which is less than 33, so only 11 or \u221211 are attainable.  \nIn the search for the largest integer we aim for +11, because we wish the sum of the (earlier) odd\u2013place digits to be larger.\n\nStep 3.  Fixing the first two places.  \nPlainly d\u2081 must be 9.  \nIf any 9\u2013digit multiple of 11 that starts with 98 can be produced, every multiple that starts with 97 or less will be smaller, so we try d\u2082 = 8.  \n\nWith d\u2081 = 9 (odd place) and d\u2082 = 8 (even place) we already have\n\ncurrent difference = 9 \u2212 8 = +1.  \n\nWe still need a further +10 from the seven unused digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 that remain to be distributed into 4 odd and 3 even positions.\n\nStep 4.  Splitting the seven remaining digits.  \nLet O be the set of the four still\u2011vacant odd\u2011place digits and E the set of the three still\u2011vacant even\u2011place digits.  \nWe need  \n\nsum(O) \u2212 sum(E) = 10,                                 (1)  \nsum(O) + sum(E) = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28.                 (2)\n\nAdding (1) and (2) gives 2\u00b7sum(O) = 38, so sum(O) = 19 and sum(E) = 9.\n\nThere are only three different ways to choose three distinct digits from {1,\u2026,7} whose sum is 9:\n\nE = {1,2,6},               E = {1,3,5},               E = {2,3,4}.\n\nThese in turn force\n\nO = {3,4,5,7},             O = {2,4,6,7},             O = {1,5,6,7}.\n\nStep 5.  Arranging each pair (O,E) as large as possible.  \nIn every case we place the largest available digit each time we move one place to the right, provided the divisibility condition can still be satisfied.\n\n(i)  O = {3,4,5,7},  E = {1,2,6}.  \n     3rd digit (odd)  : 7  \n     4th digit (even) : 6  \n     5th digit (odd)  : 5  \n     6th digit (even) : 2  \n     7th digit (odd)  : 4  \n     8th digit (even) : 1  \n     9th digit (odd)  : 3\n\n     This yields  9 8 7 6 5 2 4 1 3  = 987\u00a0652\u00a0413.\n\n(ii) O = {2,4,6,7},  E = {1,3,5}.  \n     Following the same rule produces 987\u00a0563\u00a0412,\n     which is already smaller because its 4th digit 5 < 6.\n\n(iii)O = {1,5,6,7},  E = {2,3,4}.  \n     The best arrangement starts 9874\u2026, so it is smaller still.\n\nTherefore the greatest multiple of 11 that begins with 98 is the one found in (i):\n\n987\u00a0652\u00a0413.\n\nStep 6.  No larger first two digits are possible.  \nA 9\u2013digit number cannot begin with 99, and we have seen that a beginning 98, followed by the largest admissible continuation, is 987\u00a0652\u00a0413.  \nAny 9\u2013digit multiple of 11 that begins with 97 or less is automatically smaller, and, as argued in Step\u00a01, every multiple that contains the digit 0 is also smaller than the best number formed from the digits 1\u20139.\n\nHence 987\u00a0652\u00a0413 is larger than every other 9\u2013digit integer with distinct digits that is divisible by 11.\n\nStep 7.  Verification.  \nOdd\u2013place sum  = 9+7+5+4+3 = 28  \nEven\u2013place sum = 8+6+2+1 = 17  \n28 \u2212 17 = 11, so the number is indeed divisible by 11.\n\nFinal answer: 987652413", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1"}

{"ID": 63, "Question": "Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.\nEileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.\nNow, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of \"off\".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.\n\"I know that voice!  C'mon down.\"\n\"Who is it?\" Eileen prodded.\n\"Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?\"\nEileen shrugged.  \"C'mon down, Jay,\" Patty called into the leaves.\n\"Why should I?\"\n\"I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.\"\n\"Is that the new Sinatra CD?\"\n\"No, it's the world's greatest snack.\"\n\"I'm hungry, too!\" the other voice whined.\n\"Who's up there with you?\"  Patty asked.\n\"I'll bet I know!\" Eileen called.  \"It's obvious!\"\nPatty's face lit up in realization.  \"Robin!\" they laughed together.\nA pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.\n\"But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,\" Eileen added.\n\"That's okay,\" Robin said.  \"Does it have to be percentages?\"\n\"There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?\"\n\"We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.\"\n\"What are those?\"\n\"You know what a perfect number is?\"\n\"Sure,\" Patty interjected, \"a number equal to the sum of its divisors.\"\n\"Great,\" Jay continued.  \"Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.\"\nPatty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.\n\"So, what do you have for four people?\" Patty encouraged.\n\"I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?\"\n\"I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?\"\n\"1184 and 1210.\"\n\"That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.\"\n\"Well, how about an aliquot sequence?\"\n\"Okay.  How does it taste?\" Patty asked.\n\"Can you hum a few bars?\" Eileen offered at the same time.\nRobin laughed.  \"No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.\"\nEileen and Patty understood.  \"So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?\"\n\"Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.\"\n\"Well, do you have any of those handy?\"\n\"It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?\"\n\"Sure.\"  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  \"At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.\"\nJay and Robin shared a glance.  \"Robin, is your homework still in your pack?\"\n\"It sure is.

No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.\n(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.\n(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.\n(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.\nWith these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.

At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem \u2014 the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't \u2014 he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10.

(EXTRA - How could we get 7 (and only 7) equal-size pieces from the same size cake?)", "Hint": "Think smaller.", "Human Solution": "To get three twenty-one-and-one-third (64/3) portion-sized pieces, we momentarily ignore the 28 X's/portions/square-units which form the 32 unit perimeter of the cake.  There is more than one way to divide the 6-by-6 (36 X) cake inside into three equal pieces.  Using one based on its 24 unit perimeter, this cake could be divided into 24 wedges of equal size. Each triangular piece would have as its base one unit of the perimeter; the other two sides would be formed by cuts to the center of the cake. Every triangle would have the same altitude (3 units) giving the same area (A = \u00bd * b * h = \u00bd * 1 * 3 = 3/2 square units). 8 adjacent triangles, even though they include a corner or two, will be 12 square units or 1/3 of the \"inner\" cake.\nBefore we make any actual cuts, we return the ignored 28 portions to the picture and then make those three cuts extended to the true perimeter. The 24 triangles pictured previously increase in altitude to 4 units. By rules of similar triangles, the base increases by the same 1/3 (33 1/3%) to 1 1/3 units. The area of 8 extended triangles is 8 * \u00bd * 4/3 * 4 = 64/3 portions, which is exactly one-third of the cake.\n(The perimeter of a 7-by-7 square can be formed by connecting the centers of the X's in the \"ignored\" 28 portions.

In particular it enables us to mark any rational point of an edge whose denominator does not exceed 8.  For instance, if we want the point situated 2/3 of the way across a unit square we simply prolong the diagonal of the block of three little squares that begins in the lower\u2011left corner of the cake; that diagonal meets the first inner grid line exactly 2/3 of the way up the side of the middle square (intercept theorem).\n\n1.

EXTRA \u2013 seven and only seven equal pieces with the same cake  \n\n   Three straight cuts can produce at most seven pieces, so to obtain seven equal parts we must employ the full power of three lines in general position (no two of them parallel, no three concurrent).\n\n   \u2022  On the lower edge mark, with the aid of the \u201cX\u2019\u2019 decoration, the points situated 1/7, 3/7 and 5/7 of the side length.  \n   \u2022  Join  \n        \u2013 the point at 1/7 to the upper\u2011left corner,  \n        \u2013 the point at 3/7 to the upper\u2011right corner,  \n        \u2013 the point at 5/7 to the lower\u2011right corner.  \n\n   These three segments are our three straight cuts.  \n   Each pair of them meet inside the square, so altogether they form 7 regions, which is the maximum possible with three cuts.\n\n   Because the distances we marked on the base are successively two\u2011sevenths of the side (2/7\u00b78 = 16/7) every region is a trapezium of height 8 and mean base 16/7; hence every region has the same area  \n\n        8 \u00b7 16/7 = 128/7 = 64/7 ,\n\n   exactly one seventh of the whole cake.

List the primes from 7841 upward until the count reaches 1000.\n\nContinue the same sieve, but now only in the short range 7841\u20137920 (because, as we shall see, we reach the 1000th prime before 7920 and therefore need not go farther).  The primes \u2264\u221a7920 = 89 that can divide any candidate are\n\n     2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31,\n     37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89.\n\nStrike out every multiple of those small primes in the interval 7841\u20137920; the numbers that survive are\n\n     7841, 7853, 7867, 7873, 7877, 7879, 7883,\n     7901, 7907, 7919.                                           (4)\n\nVerifying primality one by one is quick: for each number it suffices to check divisibility only by the primes up to 89, and none divides any integer in the list (4).  Hence all ten numbers in (4) are prime.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nStep 4.  Pinpoint the 1000th prime.\n\nAdding the ten primes of (4) to the previous total of 990 primes below 7800 gives:\n\n     after 7907 we have 990 + 9 = 999 primes,\n     after 7919 we have 990 + 10 = 1000 primes.\n\nConsequently 7919 is the first integer for which the running count of primes reaches 1000; that is,\n\n          p1000 = 7919.                                           (5)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nStep 5.  Double\u2011check that 7919 itself is prime.\n\nA final confirmation:  \u221a7919 \u2248 88.99, so we need only test divisibility by primes \u2264 89 (the list above).  Routine division shows 7919 is divisible by none of them; therefore 7919 is indeed prime.\n\nHaving established that exactly 999 primes precede it and that it is itself prime, statement (5) is proved.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFinal answer: 7919", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1"}

{"ID": 92, "Question": "You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?\n(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.

For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.\nCan s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.\nNow we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.\nSubstituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7\nWe know x is at least 4, because s is 3.

As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.\nIf x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.\nThis proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.\nSubstituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.\nNow we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10.

Showing that 16 moves are sufficient  \n\n   We now exhibit 16 concrete moves that succeed.\n\n   First make 14 moves whose seven untouched coins are\n\n       {1,\u2026,7}, {8,\u2026,14}, {15,\u2026,21}, \u2026 , {92,\u2026,98}\n\n   (that is, the 14 disjoint blocks of seven consecutive numbers; each block is the set of untouched coins of one move).  \n   After these 14 moves every coin 1\u201398 has been untouched once, coins 99 and 100 have never been untouched.\n\n   Choose A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}.  \n   Take as the sets of untouched coins in moves 15 and 16  \n\n       {99} \u222a A \u2003and\u2003 {100} \u222a A.\n\n   So the 16 untouched\u2013coin sets are\n\n       M\u2081  = {  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 }  \n       M\u2082  = {  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 }  \n       \u22ee  \n       M\u2081\u2084 = { 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 }  \n       M\u2081\u2085 = { 99  1  2  3  4  5  6 }  \n       M\u2081\u2086 = {100  1  2  3  4  5  6 }.\n\n   Counting, we have\n\n       \u2022 coins 1\u20136 are untouched 3 times (odd),  \n       \u2022 coins 7 and 8\u201398 are untouched exactly once (odd),  \n       \u2022 coins 99 and 100 are untouched once (odd).\n\n   Thus every coin is untouched an odd number of times, i.e. each coin is flipped an odd number of times, so after these 16 moves every coin shows tails.  Hence 16 moves indeed suffice.\n\n5.  Conclusion  \n\n   From (3) no sequence with fewer than 16 moves can work, and the explicit construction above shows that 16 moves do work.\n\nFinal answer: 16", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1"}

Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside.

Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nIn a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).

{"ID": 151, "Question": "In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.\nOn one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.\nFirst, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.\nSecond, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.\nThird, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.\nFourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)\nFor discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.\nAbout this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, \"Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.\"\nKnowing Junior, we asked, \"How big a headache is your math gonna give us?\"\nShe answered, \"I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.\"\nName the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.", "Hint": "Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.", "Human Solution": "Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.\nAfter labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, \"Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof.

These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.\"\nThe partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's.

{"ID": 166, "Question": "Your assignment is to make a delivery from the depot to your base camp, 1600 miles away. The trip begins normally, but unfortunately, halfway to base camp, your supply truck breaks down. You have no way to call for help. Luckily, in addition to medical supplies, the truck is carrying a Desert Patrol Vehicle (DPV) and two barrels of fuel.\nThe DPV has a full 10 gallon tank, but to make room for the medical supplies, it can only carry one of the 45 gallon barrels at a time.

F is the barrel used first, and L is the barrel used last.\nUse half of a tank (5 gallons) to carry L 5*12=60 miles, and then return for F (uses another 5 gallons). Refill the tank from F and carry it to where you left L (also uses 5 gallons). Refill the tank again from F and switch barrels.

But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.\nIf R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.\nSince R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.\nIf N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5.

R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.\nIf N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.\nSince 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:\nIf N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9.

{"ID": 189, "Question": "A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.\nHow fast can the man run?", "Hint": "You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.", "Human Solution": "Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.\nFeel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.

{"ID": 194, "Question": "Difficult Danny has acquired his nickname (and some other, less polite nicknames) due to the fact that, whenever he buys anything, he insists upon paying the exact amount, with precisely 100 pieces of currency. Danny wanted an xCube365 (it lasts 365 days before programmatically disabling itself, so that a new one must be purchased), the highly coveted gaming system that had just been released. It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "Can at least one of each denomination be used? That totals $186 with only 6 bills, plus at least $94 with the rest of the bills. This is too high. Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.\nIf a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities. So $100 bill is the denomination that is not used. We now know that at least one of each of the other bills is used. That totals $86 with 5 bills, leaving 95 bills to make the other $144.\nThere are only 4 ways to make $144 with these denominations, which are listed in order from $1 bills to $50 bills in each of these sets: {84,10,1,0,0}, {89,1,5,0,0}, {89,3,2,1,0}, {94,0,0,0,1}. Adding in one of each bill, which we have already determined, gives {85,11,2,1,1}, {90,2,6,1,1}, {90,4,3,2,1}, {95,1,1,1,2}. {1,1,1} is the only triplet here that can make a true multiplication sentence: 1 x 1 = 1.

Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.\nHe said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer.

However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.\nThis means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13.

Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.\nNow the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3.

The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?\n Hint: A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Hint": "A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "Let  \n\nn        = number of sides of the lot (and of the house),  \nL        = length of one side of the lot,  \nP        = perimeter of the lot = nL,  \nD        = diameter of the circular foundation of the house,  \nr        = radius of that foundation = D/2,  \nA lot    = apothem of the lot,  \na house  = apothem of the house (= r\u00a0cos(\u03c0/n)).  \n\nStep 1 \u2013  The \u201cring of yard\u201d condition  \nThe nearest distance from the foundation to the boundary of the lot equals the foundation\u2019s diameter, so  \n\nA lot  \u2013  r  =  D  \u21d2  A lot  =  r + D = D/2 + D = 3D/2.

{"ID": 10, "Question": "Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.\nWhat is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?\n Hint: The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.\nOf course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.", "Hint": "The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly.

This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.\nFour of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "Question: The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.\n\"That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?\"\nBill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?\n Hint: 1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Hint": "1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Human Solution": "Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.

{"ID": 63, "Question": "Question: Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.\nEileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.\nNow, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of \"off\".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.\n\"I know that voice!  C'mon down.\"\n\"Who is it?\" Eileen prodded.\n\"Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?\"\nEileen shrugged.  \"C'mon down, Jay,\" Patty called into the leaves.\n\"Why should I?\"\n\"I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.\"\n\"Is that the new Sinatra CD?\"\n\"No, it's the world's greatest snack.\"\n\"I'm hungry, too!\" the other voice whined.\n\"Who's up there with you?\"  Patty asked.\n\"I'll bet I know!\" Eileen called.  \"It's obvious!\"\nPatty's face lit up in realization.  \"Robin!\" they laughed together.\nA pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.\n\"But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,\" Eileen added.\n\"That's okay,\" Robin said.  \"Does it have to be percentages?\"\n\"There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?\"\n\"We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.\"\n\"What are those?\"\n\"You know what a perfect number is?\"\n\"Sure,\" Patty interjected, \"a number equal to the sum of its divisors.\"\n\"Great,\" Jay continued.  \"Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.\"\nPatty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.\n\"So, what do you have for four people?\" Patty encouraged.\n\"I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?\"\n\"I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?\"\n\"1184 and 1210.\"\n\"That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.\"\n\"Well, how about an aliquot sequence?\"\n\"Okay.  How does it taste?\" Patty asked.\n\"Can you hum a few bars?\" Eileen offered at the same time.\nRobin laughed.  \"No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.\"\nEileen and Patty understood.  \"So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?\"\n\"Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.\"\n\"Well, do you have any of those handy?\"\n\"It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?\"\n\"Sure.\"  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  \"At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.\"\nJay and Robin shared a glance.  \"Robin, is your homework still in your pack?\"\n\"It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.\"\nTen minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.

First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation\nE = 0*R -3*S +1*P\nwhere\nE = expected payoff\nR = proportion of rocks\nS = proportion of scissors\nP = proportion of paper\nAgainst an all-paper opponent:\nE = -1*R + 2*S -0*P\nAgainst someone running with scissors all the time:\nE = 3*R + 0*S -1*P\nWe know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get\nS = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.\nQ.E.D.\nI realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.

A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.

In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.

{"ID": 92, "Question": "Question: You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?\n(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.

For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.\nCan s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.\nNow we know that s must be either 3 or 4.

As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.\nIf x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.\nThis proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.\nSubstituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.\nNow we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10.

[a is not 0.  c is not 0.]\nRule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5.

This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.\nRule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]\nRule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3.

As mentioned in the hint, there are many methods in which to solve this. One less complex method is to imagine the axis of the cone form a right triangle.

We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.\nNext we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x.

{"ID": 126, "Question": "Question: The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nIn a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).

Geometrical picture when the rails expand  \n   \u2022 The two pins are fixed in the ground exactly two miles (= 2 \u00d7 5280 ft = 10 560 ft = 126 720 in) apart.  \n   \u2022 Between those pins lie two one\u2013mile rails.  \n   \u2022 When the temperature rises each mile-long rail grows 1 inch, so the total length between the pins grows 2 inches; the steel can only take up that extra length by buckling upward or sideways.  \n   \u2022 The least-energy buckle is a single smooth hump that is perfectly symmetrical; to see how high that hump must be we may simplify it to two straight pieces that meet in the middle (an isosceles triangle).  Each straight piece is a half-rail.\n\n2.  Put numbers on the triangle  \n   Half-distance between pins (the base of the half-triangle):  \n        c = 1 mile = 5280 ft = 63 360 in.  \n\n   Length of one half-rail after expansion (the equal side of the triangle):  \n        s = (1 mile + 1 inch)/2 = (63 360 in + 1 in)/2 = 63 361 / 2 = 63 361 in / 2  \n        but we really only need the full value: s = 63 361 in.  \n\n   Height of the buckle h is found from Pythagoras:  \n        s\u00b2 = c\u00b2 + h\u00b2  \n        h\u00b2 = s\u00b2 \u2013 c\u00b2  \n            = (63 361)\u00b2 \u2212 (63 360)\u00b2  \n            = (63 360 + 1)\u00b2 \u2212 (63 360)\u00b2  \n            = 2\u00b763 360 + 1 = 126 721.  \n\n        h = \u221a126 721 \u2248 356 in \u2248 29.7 ft.  \n\n   So the hump that accommodates only 2 inches of extra rail is almost 30 feet high!\n\n3.  What if each mile were individually pinned?  \n   Even if Henry had placed a pin at every joint (one-mile span) the same calculation with \u03b4 = 1 in and L = 1 mile gives  \n        h \u2248 \u221a(L \u03b4 / 2) = \u221a(63 360 in \u00d7 1 in /2) \u2248 178 in \u2248 15 ft.  \n   Still catastrophically large.\n\n4.

His design would make the track utterly impassable, so the boss quite rightly fired him.\n\nFinal answer: The 1-inch-per-mile expansion, when the rails are pinned, forces each two-mile section to bulge nearly 30 feet high (\u2248 15 feet even for a one-mile span); far from a \u201csmall bump,\u201d the buckle would be a gigantic, disastrous hump, so Henry\u2019s plan is hopelessly unsafe and his firing was justified.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1"}

{"ID": 151, "Question": "Question: In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.\nOn one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.\nFirst, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.\nSecond, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.\nThird, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.\nFourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)\nFor discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.\nAbout this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, \"Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.\"\nKnowing Junior, we asked, \"How big a headache is your math gonna give us?\"\nShe answered, \"I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.\"\nName the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.\n Hint: Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.", "Hint": "Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.", "Human Solution": "Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.\nAfter labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, \"Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof.

These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.\"\nThe partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's.

He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.\nHow fast can the man run?\n Hint: You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.", "Hint": "You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.", "Human Solution": "Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.

It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence.

How large can the next weight be?  \n\u2003With the single weight 1 kg we can already obtain every integer from \u22121 to +1.  \n\u2003If the next weight were larger than 3 kg, say at least 4 kg, then the integers 2 kg and 3 kg could not be produced, so we must have w\u2082 \u2264 3.  \n\u2003If w\u2082 = 2 kg, the range attainable with {1, 2} would be \u22123 \u2026 +3.  \n\u2003If w\u2082 = 3 kg, the attainable range becomes \u22124 \u2026 +4, which is strictly larger.  \n\u2003Hence the best choice is w\u2082 = 3.\n\n3. Continuing the same reasoning  \n\u2003With weights {1, 3} we can reach every integer from \u22124 to +4.  \n\u2003To keep all numbers consecutive we must have w\u2083 \u2264 3\u00b74 + 1 = 13.  \n\u2003Choosing the largest admissible power of 3 within that bound, w\u2083 = 9 gives the wider span \u221213 \u2026 +13, whereas any smaller choice gives a shorter span. Therefore w\u2083 = 9 is optimal.\n\n4. The fourth weight  \n\u2003With {1, 3, 9} we now reach \u221213 \u2026 +13.  \n\u2003The next weight must satisfy w\u2084 \u2264 3\u00b713 + 1 = 40.  The largest power of 3 not exceeding 40 is 27, so choose w\u2084 = 27.  \n\u2003This yields the range \u221240 \u2026 +40, exactly what is required.\n\n5. Sufficiency  \n\u2003Because 1, 3, 9, 27 are consecutive powers of 3, every integer from \u221240 to +40 (and therefore every integer from 1 to 40) has a unique balanced-ternary representation using these four place-values, so all required amounts of wheat can indeed be weighed.\n\n6. Necessity (briefly)  \n\u2003The maximum positive integer that four weights can measure is w\u2081 + w\u2082 + w\u2083 + w\u2084 when they are all placed opposite the wheat.  To reach 40 kg this sum must be at least 40.  The minimal way to achieve that sum while keeping all intermediate integers attainable forces the successive upper bounds w\u2082 \u2264 3, w\u2083 \u2264 9, w\u2084 \u2264 27 found above, leading uniquely to the set {1, 3, 9, 27}.\n\nTherefore the four weights must be\n\n\u20031 kg,\u20033 kg,\u20039 kg,\u200327 kg.\n\nFinal answer: 1 kg, 3 kg, 9 kg, 27 kg", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1"}

So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.\nAll multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.\nIf you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.\nTo prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.\na*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =\n9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .\n9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.\nThe smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111.

As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.\nHe said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer.
