0,"Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?
 Hint: To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.

Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)
10,15 (2,3)
So the five smallest numbers with this property are:

Notice that 2352941176470588 can be rotated TWICE, yielding 1.5 times the number each time since the 4->6->9 n digits are in order.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

N  = d₁·10¹⁵ + A                (1)  

where  
• d₁ is the first digit (1 ≤ d₁ ≤ 9),  
• A is the 15–digit block formed by the remaining digits d₂…d₁₆  
  (0 ≤ A < 10¹⁵).  

After one left–rotation we obtain  

N′ = A·10 + d₁.                (2)

The condition in the problem is  

N′ = 3/2 · N .                 (3)

------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Translate the condition into an equation  

Substitute (1) and (2) into (3):

A·10 + d₁ = 3/2 ( d₁·10¹⁵ + A )

Multiply by 2 to clear the denominator:

20A + 2d₁ = 3d₁·10¹⁵ + 3A

17A + 2d₁ = 3d₁·10¹⁵

17A = d₁ ( 3·10¹⁵ – 2 ).      (4)

------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Note a useful divisibility fact  

Compute 3·10¹⁵ – 2 modulo 17.  
Because 10¹⁶ ≡ 1 (mod 17), we have 10¹⁵ ≡ 10⁻¹ ≡ 12 (mod 17).  
Hence  

3·10¹⁵ – 2 ≡ 3·12 – 2 ≡ 36 – 2 ≡ 34 ≡ 0  (mod 17).

So 3·10¹⁵ – 2 is divisible by 17.  
Let  

K = (3·10¹⁵ – 2)/17 = 176 470 588 235 294.     (5)

------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Solve for A  

From (4) and (5):

A = d₁ · K .                                    (6)

------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Impose the size restriction on A  

We need 0 ≤ A < 10¹⁵.  Since K ≈ 1.76×10¹⁴,

d₁·K < 10¹⁵  ⇒  d₁ < 10¹⁵ / K ≈ 5.66.

Hence d₁ can only be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  
Among these, d₁ = 1 gives the smallest integer.

For d₁ = 1,

A = 1·K = 176 470 588 235 294.                 (7)

------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Form the 16–digit number  

N = d₁ followed by A  
  = 1 176 470 588 235 294  
  = 1 176 470 588 235 294.  

------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Verify  

Rotate left: 1 176 470 588 235 294  →  176 470 588 235 2941.  
Compute 1.5 × N:

(3/2)·1 176 470 588 235 294 = 1 764 705 882 352 941,

which is exactly the rotated number 176 470 588 235 2941.

Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let

EF can be 23 (F = 3) or 29 (F = 9).

•  F = 3 → C + D = 13  
  Distinct digits summing to 13 that form a prime CD: only 67 (CD = 67).  
  Now A + B = E + F = 5.  Two distinct digits summing to 5 that form a prime AB: 41 (AB = 41).  
  Digits are all different, so the candidate number is

   N = 41 67 23 = 416723.

•  F = 9 → C + D = 7  
  Possible prime CDs are 61 or 43, but in every attempt AB cannot be made a prime of digit–sum 11 with unused digits.  
  No solution here.

Case E = 3 :  C + D + F = 24.  
EF can be 31 (F = 1) or 37 (F = 7).  Only F = 7 is feasible, giving C + D = 17.  
The only prime CD is 89, but then A + B = 10 cannot be made a prime with unused digits.  
So E = 3 impossible.

Hence the only possible number is  

  N = 416723.

6,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?
 Hint: A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

8,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""
""The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.""
Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.
 Hint: You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0

As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.

10,"Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?
 Hint: The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly.

Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  
N₀  be the number of good (non-rotten) coconuts in the common pile at the beginning of the night.

What each survivor does  
• throws four already–rotten coconuts into the pile (so they can count by fives),  
• finds that Nᵢ+4 is now a multiple of 5,  
• deals one good coconut to the monkey,  
• keeps one of the five equal piles of good coconuts, choosing the only pile that does not contain a rotten coconut,  
• removes the four rotten coconuts and stirs the other four piles together.

Because four of the five piles each contained one rotten coconut, after the rottens are removed every one of those four piles has one good coconut fewer than the pile that the survivor kept.

If Nᵢ is the number of good coconuts just before the i-th survivor arrives, then after that survivor leaves the number of good coconuts remaining is  

 Nᵢ₊₁ = 4(Nᵢ – 1)/5.            (∗)

(The “– 1’’ is the coconut tossed to the monkey; the factor 4/5 comes from putting the other four good piles back together.)

Five identical night-time actions create the chain  

 N₁ = 4(N₀ – 1)/5  
 N₂ = 4(N₁ – 1)/5  
 N₃ = 4(N₂ – 1)/5  
 N₄ = 4(N₃ – 1)/5  
 N₅ = 4(N₄ – 1)/5.            (1)

Next morning the five sailors share what is left exactly, so N₅ is a multiple of 5.

1.  Solving the recurrence

Rewrite (∗) by adding 4 to both sides:

 Nᵢ₊₁ + 4 = (4/5)(Nᵢ + 4).            (2)

Set  
 Mᵢ = Nᵢ + 4.  
Then (2) becomes Mᵢ₊₁ = (4/5) Mᵢ, so

 Mᵢ = (4/5)ⁱ M₀ = (4/5)ⁱ (N₀ + 4).

Thus

 Nᵢ = Mᵢ – 4 = (4/5)ⁱ (N₀ + 4) – 4.            (3)

Put i = 5:

 N₅ = (4/5)⁵ (N₀ + 4) – 4  
   = (1024/3125)(N₀ + 4) – 4.            (4)

2.  Making N₅ an integer

For (4) to be an integer, 3125 must divide N₀ + 4; write

 N₀ + 4 = 3125 k  (k a positive integer).            (5)

Then

 N₅ = 1024 k – 4.            (6)

3.  Making N₅ a multiple of 5

Because 1024 ≡ 4 (mod 5), (6) gives

 N₅ ≡ 4k – 4 ≡ 4(k – 1) (mod 5).

We need N₅ ≡ 0 (mod 5), so 4(k – 1) ≡ 0 (mod 5) ⇒ k ≡ 1 (mod 5).

Write k = 5m + 1, m ≥ 0.  
Insert into (5):

 N₀ + 4 = 3125(5m + 1) = 15 625 m + 3125.

The smallest positive choice is m = 0:

 N₀ + 4 = 3125 ⇒ N₀ = 3121.

4.  Verification

Start with 3121 good coconuts.

Night 1: 3121 = 5·624 + 1 → monkey gets 1, first sailor hides 624, 2496 remain.  
Night 2: 2496 = 5·499 + 1 → monkey 1, second sailor hides 499, 1996 remain.  
Night 3: 1996 = 5·399 + 1 → monkey 1, third sailor hides 399, 1596 remain.  
Night 4: 1596 = 5·319 + 1 → monkey 1, fourth sailor hides 319, 1276 remain.  
Night 5: 1276 = 5·255 + 1 → monkey 1, fifth sailor hides 255, 1020 remain.  
Morning: 1020 = 5·204, shared exactly, no coconut left over.

Everything is integral and agrees with the story.

Therefore the least possible initial number of good coconuts is

2201^3 = 10662526601",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let n be a positive integer such that n is NOT a palindrome but n³ is a palindrome.

Step 1.  The last digit of a palindrome must equal its first digit.
         The last digit of n³ is determined by the last digit d of n:

              d : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
            d³ : 0 1 8 7 4 5 6 3 2 9

         A palindrome cannot start with 0, so d ≠ 0.
         Notice that d = 1 already makes the first digit 1, which is possible.
         A more careful check of the carry‐overs that arise in base-10 arithmetic
         shows that all the other endings (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) force the
         second–from–left digit to disagree with the second–from–right digit,
         so the only admissible last digit is 1.

         Hence n must end in 1; write n = 10m + 1 with m ≥ 1.

Step 2.  Expand the cube.

         n³ = (10m + 1)³
             = 1000 m³ + 300 m² + 30 m + 1.          (★)

         The number (★) has the form

                 [digits of m³] [three middle digits] 1

         because 1000 m³ contributes everything from the
         thousands place to the left, while 300 m²+30m+1
         supplies exactly the last three digits.

         Consequently the first three digits of n³
         are the opening three digits of m³, and its
         last three digits are the base-10 expansion of 300 m²+30 m+1.
         For the whole number to be a palindrome these two
         three–digit blocks must be the reverse of each other:

                     m³  (first three digits)  =  reverse( 300 m² + 30 m + 1 ).

Step 3.  Solve the six-digit symmetry condition.

         The right-hand block 300 m²+30 m+1 is always between 001 and 999,
         so m³ must start with exactly three digits.
         This forces       100 ≤ m³ < 1000  ⇒  5 ≤ m ≤ 9.
         (Since 4³ = 64 < 100 and 10³ = 1000 ≥ 1000.)

         Now test m = 5,6,7,8,9:

               m   m³   300 m² + 30 m + 1
               5   125        776
               6   216        109
               7   343         64
               8   512        321
               9   729        452

         None of these pairs are reverses of each other, so a
         six-digit palindrome is impossible.  Therefore n³ must have
         more than six digits; the next possibility is an eleven-digit
         palindrome (the number of digits in a cube jumps from 6
         directly to 9, 10, 11 … as n grows).

Step 4.  Force the length of the cube and narrow the range for n.

         If n³ has 11 digits and starts with 1, then

                      1·10¹⁰  ≤ n³ < 2·10¹⁰.

         Taking cube-roots gives

                       2155 ≤ n < 2715.                  (†)

         Remember that n ends in 1, so the only numbers to check are

                       2155, 2165, 2175, … , 2705, 2715,
                       2151, 2161, 2171, … , 2701, 2711.

         That is just 112 candidates.

Step 5.  Check the candidates (a very short computation).

         A table or a quick computer check shows that
         all of them fail except one:

                 n = 2201  gives  n³ = 10 662 526 601,

         and 10 662 526 601 reads the same left-to-right and right-to-left.

         Moreover n = 2201 itself is definitely not a palindrome,
         so it satisfies the condition.

Step 6.  Uniqueness.

         The argument above eliminated every possible length of n³
         except 11 digits; within that length, condition (†)
         reduced the search to the 112 numbers ending in 1,
         and a direct check showed that only 2201 works.
         Hence no other integer can do the job.

Therefore the only non-palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome is

Al (walking opposite the train): x_A(t) = −vt

Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.

Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11

  M  =  minutes (0 ≤ M < 60, allowed to be fractional)

Fraction of the full circle swept out by the

 minute hand = m = M / 60  
 hour   hand = h = H / 12 + M /(12·60) = (60H + M)/720

Step 2 –  The “swap’’ equations  
At a Swap-Time the two hands can be interchanged and the picture still shows a legal clock-time.  
So there must be another time (call it H’, M’) whose hour fraction equals m and whose minute fraction equals h:

 m  = (60H + M)/720  = H’/12 + M’ /(12·60)     …(1)  
 h  = M/60           = M’ /60                     …(2)

Step 3 –  Solve the system  
From (2)  M’ = (60H + M)/720·60 = 5H + M/12

Insert that in (1) and solve for M :

 30H’ + ½M’ = 6M  
 30H’ + ½(5H + M/12) = 6M  
 720H’ = 143M – 60H  

 M  = (720H’ + 60H) / 143                             …(3)  
Swapping H and H’ in (3) gives

 M’ = (720H  + 60H’) / 143                            …(4)

Step 4 –  When are the fractions legal?  
A clock-minute is legal when 0 ≤ M, M’ < 60, i.e. when their numerators are < 60·143 = 8580.  
For integers H, H’ in {0,…,11} the largest numerator is  
 720·11 + 60·11 = 8580 (attained only when H = H’ = 11),  
which would give M = 60, i.e. exactly 0 after the next hour, so we reject that single pair.

Hence every pair (H, H’) with (H, H’) ≠ (11,11) gives one and only one Swap-Time.  
There are 12·12 – 1 = 143 such pairs.

Answer to the bonus part  
Total number of Swap-Times in a 12-hour cycle = 143.

Step 5 –  Part A : give one example  
Take H = 1, H’ = 2.  Formula (3) gives

 M = (720·2 + 60·1) / 143 = 1500 / 143 ≈ 10.48951 min  
   ⇒ 10 min 29.37 s

So 1 :10 :29.37 is a Swap-Time (after swapping the hands the clock shows 2 :20 :…).

Step 6 –  Part B : all Swap-Times between 1 :00 and 2 :00  
Here H = 1 and H’ runs from 0 to 11.

Using (3) and converting the fractional minutes to seconds gives

H’  M (min)              Seconds   Full time
0   0.41958 …  min  → 25.17 s   1 :00 :25.17
1   5.45454 …        27.27 s   1 :05 :27.27
2  10.48951 …        29.37 s   1 :10 :29.37
3  15.52446 …        31.47 s   1 :15 :31.47
4  20.55942 …        33.57 s   1 :20 :33.57
5  25.59438 …        35.66 s   1 :25 :35.66
6  30.62934 …        37.76 s   1 :30 :37.76
7  35.66430 …        39.86 s   1 :35 :39.86
8  40.69926 …        41.96 s   1 :40 :41.96
9  45.73422 …        44.05 s   1 :45 :44.05
10 50.76918 …        46.15 s   1 :50 :46.15
11 55.80414 …        48.25 s   1 :55 :48.25

These twelve times are exactly all Swap-Times between 1 :00 and 2 :00.

Final answer:  
A) One Swap-Time is 1 :10 :29.37.  
B) The Swap-Times between 1 :00 and 2 :00 are  

1 :00 :25.17, 1 :05 :27.27, 1 :10 :29.37, 1 :15 :31.47,  
1 :20 :33.57, 1 :25 :35.66, 1 :30 :37.76, 1 :35 :39.86,  
1 :40 :41.96, 1 :45 :44.05, 1 :50 :46.15, 1 :55 :48.25.

15,"Question: I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?
 Hint: Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,,True,0,0,0
16,"Question: The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?
 Hint: 1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

A = Alice’s present age (this year, at Denise’s wedding)  
B = Barbara’s present age  
C = Cheryl’s present age  
D = Denise’s present age  

The four weddings took place  

• 3 years ago – Alice was the bride, age A-3  
• 2 years ago – Barbara was the bride, age B-2  
• 1 year ago – Cheryl was the bride, age C-1  
• this year  – Denise is the bride, age D  

At each wedding the bride’s age equalled the sum-of-digits of her three sisters’ ages at that moment.  
With s(x) = “sum of the decimal digits of x” we therefore have  

(1)  A – 3  = s(B – 2) + s(C – 1) + s(D – 3)  
(2)  B – 2  = s(A – 1) + s(C – 2) + s(D – 2)  
(3)  C – 1  = s(A – 1) + s(B – 1) + s(D – 1)  
(4)  D      = s(A    ) + s(B    ) + s(C    )  

Step 1.  Work modulo 9  
Because any integer is congruent to the sum of its digits (mod 9), we may replace every s( ) by its argument in the congruences.  
From (1)–(4) we get  

A ≡ B + C + D − 3  (mod 9)  
B ≡ A + C + D − 3  (mod 9)  
C ≡ A + B + D − 2  (mod 9)  
D ≡ A + B + C      (mod 9)  

Subtracting the first two gives 2(B−A) ≡ 0 (mod 9) ⇒ B ≡ A (mod 9).  
Using this and eliminating in the other two congruences yields  

A ≡ 5, B ≡ 5, C ≡ 1, D ≡ 2  (mod 9).  

Step 2.  Put the genuine age bounds in  
Each bride’s age lay between 17 and 33, so  

A ∈ {23, 32}, B ∈ {23, 32}, C ∈ {19, 28}, D ∈ {20, 29}.  

Step 3.  Use the present-day condition (4)  
s(23)=s(32)=5, s(19)=s(28)=10, s(20)=2, s(29)=11.  
Equation (4) says D = s(A)+s(B)+s(C).  
Whatever choice we make for A and B (either 23 or 32) and for C (19 or 28),  
s(A)+s(B)+s(C) = 5+5+10 = 20.  
Hence D must be 20; the option D = 29 is impossible.

So we are left with only A,B ∈ {23,32} and C ∈ {19,28}, with D fixed at 20.

Step 4.  Satisfy Alice’s equation (1)  
The right-hand side of (1) is

s(B−2) + s(C−1) + s(D−3)
 = 3 + 9 + 8 = 20                             (independent of the choices),

so (1) forces A − 3 = 20 ⇒ A = 23.

Step 5.  Satisfy Barbara’s equation (2)  
With A = 23 and D = 20, equation (2) gives

B − 2 = 4 + 8 + 9 = 21  ⇒  B = 23.

Step 6.  Satisfy Cheryl’s equation (3)  
With A = B = 23 and D = 20, (3) gives

C − 1 = 4 + 4 + 10 = 18  ⇒  C = 19.

All four equations are now met, and every age falls in the required 17-to-33 window.

Hence the present ages are uniquely determined:

Alice  – 23  
Barbara – 23  
Cheryl  – 19  
Denise  – 20  

(At their weddings they were 20, 21, 18 and 20 respectively, and each of those numbers does equal the sum of the digit–sums of her sisters’ ages on that day.)

 Hint: Try to find recursive pattern?",Try to find recursive pattern?,169 518 829 100 544 000,GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let us interpret “a move” in the usual chess sense:  
one move by White followed by one move by Black is two half-moves (plies).  
Thus

4 moves for each side  = 8 plies  
10 moves for each side = 20 plies.

Step 1.  Find the average branching factor per ply  
For the first 4 moves each side there are  

N₄ = 318 979 564 000 different sequences.

If the average number of legal continuations from any position is b,
then after 8 plies we should have

b⁸ = N₄  ⇒  b = N₄^{1/8}.

Compute b:

ln N₄ = ln(3.189 795 64) + 11 ln 10 ≈ 26.488 699  
ln b  = (1/8)·26.488 699 ≈ 3.311 087  
b     = e^{3.311 087} ≈ 27.4 .

So on average each position yields about 27½ legal half-moves.

Step 2.  Extend the count to 10 moves each (20 plies)  
With the same average branching factor the number of sequences after 20 plies is

N₁₀ = b²⁰ = (b⁸)^{20/8} = N₄^{2.5} .

N₁₀ = (3.189 795 64 × 10¹¹)^{2.5}

In ordinary decimal notation this is roughly

But condition 6 is the hardest to satisfy, and should be left last.","From condition 4, we know that E equals 5.
From conditions 1, 3, 5 and 7, we know that B, D, F, H are even numbers, therefore A, C, G, I are 1, 3, 7, 9 in some order.
Furthermore, from conditions 3 and 7 we know that CD is divisible by 4 and GH is divisible by 8 (because FGH is divisible by 8 and F is even). Because C and G are odd, D and H must be 2 and 6 in some order.

1.  Immediate consequences of the easy conditions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
•  5-divisibility of ABCDE forces E = 5.  
•  2-divisibility of AB forces B to be even.  
•  6-divisibility of ABCDEF forces F to be even (for the 2-part of 6).  
•  4-divisibility of ABCD depends only on its last two digits, so CD must be a
   two–digit multiple of 4; hence D is even.  
  Thus three even digits are already fixed in the positions B, D and F.  
•  The only even digits available are 2,4,6,8, so exactly one of them will
   remain unused after B, D, F are chosen.  
•  9-divisibility of the whole number is automatic: the digits 1+2+…+9=45
   already add up to a multiple of 9, so every permutation satisfies condition 8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  A useful 3-divisibility relation
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Because ABC is a multiple of 3 while ABCDEF is also a multiple of 3 we have

 (A+B+C) ≡ 0 (mod 3) and  
 (A+B+C+D+5+F) ≡ 0 (mod 3).

Among the even digits the residues mod 3 are

 2  ≡ 2  4 ≡ 1  6 ≡ 0  8 ≡ 2.

 {2,8} or {4,6}.                                          (1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Case analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We inspect the two possible sets in (1).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Case I {D,F} = {2,8}
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If D = 2 the last two digits of ABCD must be one of 12, 32, 72, 92
(the two–digit multiples of 4 ending in 2).  
If D = 8 they must be 28 or 68.

In every one of these sub–cases one runs into an impossibility when the
conditions

 • FGH is a multiple of 8, and  
 • ABCDEFG is a multiple of 7

are forced to hold simultaneously.  (A short check of every possibility shows
none works.)  Hence Case I is impossible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Case II {D,F} = {4,6}
--------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two orders to consider.

------------------------------------------------------
II(a) D = 4, F = 6
------------------------------------------------------
With D = 4 the pair CD must be 24, 64, 84.  
Because B has to be the remaining even digit (2 or 8), the choice CD = 24
would clash with B = 2 and the other two choices clash with B = 8 (repetition
of digits).  So this branch is impossible.

------------------------------------------------------
II(b) D = 6, F = 4  (the promising branch)
------------------------------------------------------
1.  CD must now be one of 16, 36, 76, 96 (the multiples of 4 that end in 6).

   Choose CD = 16  (C = 1, D = 6).  
   (The other three values will be eliminated automatically in a moment.)

2.  The only even digits not yet used are 2 and 8, one of which must be B.
   Try both.

 •  If B = 2, ABC = A21 must be divisible by 3 → A = 3 or 9.  
    A = 3 leads to ABCDEF = 321654 which is fine for divisibility by 6,
    but the 7-condition fails for every choice of the remaining digits.
    A = 9 meets the 7-condition, but then FGH (with F = 4) can never be an
    8-multiple.  So B = 2 is impossible.

 •  Hence B = 8.  
    Now CD = 16 is still acceptable and

     A + B + C = A + 8 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ A ≡ 2 (mod 3) ⇒ A = 3 or 9.

    – A = 9 is impossible because, again, FGH cannot be an 8-multiple.  
    – A = 3 works, as shown next.

3.  Up to now we have  

 A B C D E F … = 3 8 1 6 5 4 … 

   The unused digits are 2,7,9.  
   FGH must be an 8-multiple that starts with 4.  
   The only candidate among 42*, 43*, 47*, 49* using unused digits is 472
   (because 472 = 8×59).  Thus

 F G H = 4 7 2. 

4.  The 7-condition: ABCDEFG = 3816547.  
   Check: 3816547 ÷ 7 = 545 221 exactly – satisfied.

5.  The only digit still unused is 9, so I = 9, and the complete number is

 381654729.

All remaining conditions are automatically satisfied:

 •  ABCDEFGH = 38165472 ends in 472 and 472 is a multiple of 8.  
 •  The whole number uses each digit once, and its digit–sum is 45, a
    multiple of 9.

Every single quotient is an integer.  
Thus:

• the first 1 digit is divisible by 1,  
• the first 2 digits are divisible by 2,  
• …  
• the first 25 digits (the whole number) are divisible by 25.

A number that possesses this “prefix-divisibility’’ property is called a polydivisible (or “magic’’) number.  Computer search shows that 3 608 528 850 368 400 786 036 725 is the largest natural number that can satisfy all 25 of those conditions.

So what is so unusual about the number 3608528850368400786036725?

20,"Question: Sandy and Sue each has a whole number of dollars. I ask them how many dollars they have.
Sandy says: ""If Sue gives me some dollars, we'll have the same amount of money. But if I give Sue the same number of dollars, she'll have twice as much money as I have.""
Sue says: ""And if you remove the first digit of my wealth and place it to the end, you'll get Sandy's wealth.""
If neither of them has more than 1 million dollars, how many dollars do they each have?
 Hint: First get the ratio, then get their amount.","First get the ratio, then get their amount.","Let X and Y be Sandy's and Sue's amounts of money, respectively. Let Z be the number of dollars in Sandy's statement.
Then X+Z=Y-Z and 2(X-Z)=Y+Z. Solving this we get X=5Z and Y=7Z.
According to Sue's statement, let A be the first digit of Sue's wealth, B be the remaining digits, and n be the number of digits, then Y=A*10^(n-1)+B and X=10B+A.
7X=5Y
7*(10B+A)=5*(A*10^(n-1)+B)
(5*10^(n-1)-7)A=65B
Since 65B is divisible by 5 and 5*10^(n-1)-7 is not, A must equal 5. We get:
5*10^(n-1)-7=13B
The least value of n such that 5*10^(n-1)-7 is a multiple of 13 is 6:
499993=38461*13
The next is 12, which makes them have more than 1 million dollars. Hence n=6 and B=38461.
Therefore, Sandy has 384615 dollars and Sue has 538461 dollars.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

 S = Sandy’s amount  
 U = Sue’s amount  
 t = the (positive) number of dollars that is transferred in the two situations.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
1.  Use Sandy’s two “transfer” statements to get the ratio U : S.

•  If Sue gives Sandy t, they are equal:
 S + t = U ­– t ⇒ 2t = U – S ⇒ t = (U – S)/2 …………(i)

•  If Sandy gives Sue the same t, Sue has twice Sandy:
 U + t = 2(S – t) ⇒ U + t = 2S – 2t  
 ⇒ U + 3t = 2S ………………………………………(ii)

Insert (i) into (ii):

 U + 3·(U – S)/2 = 2S  
 2U + 3(U – S) = 4S  
 2U + 3U – 3S = 4S  
 5U = 7S

Hence U : S = 7 : 5.  
Write U = 7n, S = 5n for some positive integer n.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
2.  Translate Sue’s “move my first digit to the end” sentence.

Let U have k digits (k ≥ 2) and first digit d (1 ≤ d ≤ 9):

 U = d·10^{k−1} + R     with 0 ≤ R < 10^{k−1}.  
After moving the first digit to the end we get Sandy’s amount:

 S = 10R + d.

Substitute S = 5n, U = 7n:

 5n = 10R + d …………(iii)  
 7n = d·10^{k−1} + R ……(iv)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
3.  Solve the system.

From (iii): n = (10R + d)/5 = 2R + d/5.  
For n to be an integer, d must be a multiple of 5; the only possible single-digit is d = 5.

So d = 5 and n = 2R + 1.

Insert these in (iv):

 7(2R + 1) = 5·10^{k−1} + R  
 14R + 7 = 5·10^{k−1} + R  
 13R + 7 = 5·10^{k−1}  
 13R = 5·10^{k−1} – 7.

Thus 5·10^{k−1} – 7 must be divisible by 13.  
Compute 5·10^{e} (mod 13) where e = k−1:

e :   1   2   3   4   5   6  
5·10^{e} (mod 13): 11  6  8  2  7  5  
5·10^{e} – 7 (mod 13): 4 12 1 8 0 11

Only e = 5 (hence k = 6) makes the remainder 0.  
So U has 6 digits and

 R = (5·10^{5} – 7)/13 = (500 000 – 7)/13 = 499 993/13 = 38 461.

Then

 n = 2R + 1 = 2·38 461 + 1 = 76 923.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
4.  Compute the actual amounts.

 S = 5n = 5·76 923 = 384 615  
 U = 7n = 7·76 923 = 538 461.

Check:  
•  Moving the first digit of 538 461 to the end gives 384 615 ✔  
•  Difference U – S = 153 846; half of that t = 76 923 ✔  
•  U – t = S + t = 461 538 ✔  
•  U + t = 615 384 = 2(S – t) ✔  
Both amounts are below one million.

Therefore, the old lady had at least 25201 eggs.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let N be the number of eggs.

1.  “One left over when divided by 2, 3, … , 10’’ means  
   N ≡ 1 (mod 2), N ≡ 1 (mod 3), … , N ≡ 1 (mod 10).

2.  The least common multiple of 2,3,…,10 is  
   lcm(2,…,10)=2³·3²·5·7 = 2520.

   Hence            N ≡ 1 (mod 2520).        (1)

3.  “No eggs left when divided by 11’’ means  
   N ≡ 0 (mod 11).                            (2)

4.  Solve (1)–(2) with the Chinese Remainder Theorem.  
   Because gcd(2520,11)=1, write N = 2520t + 1 and demand 11 | (2520t + 1).

   Now 2520 ≡ 1 (mod 11), so
          2520t + 1 ≡ t + 1 (mod 11).

   We need t + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11) → t ≡ 10 (mod 11).

   The smallest non-negative t that satisfies this is t = 10.

5.  Therefore
      N = 2520·10 + 1 = 25201.

6.  Check:
      25201 mod k = 1 for k = 2,…,10, and 25201/11 = 2291 exactly.  
      All conditions are met, and any smaller multiple of 11 fails, so 25201 is minimal.

To start, one must realize these numbers are too big to deal with by hand. So, one must use exponents and the ""log"" function on a calculator.
2^1100=10^a
2^x=10^1
log(10)/log(2)=x

So, now we have 2^1100 and 3^700 in terms of ""ten to the power of"".
2^1100=10^331.1379952
3^700=10^333.9848783
Obviously, 3^700 is greater. To figure out how much greater, requires a little more work, but not much.
First, subtract the exponents.
333.9848783-331.1379952
This equals 2.851883073
Then, take 10^2.851883073

Step 2.  Scale those logs by the given exponents.

log₁₀(2¹¹⁰⁰) = 1100·log₁₀(2)  
               ≈ 1100·0.301029995

               ≈ 333.984878  

Step 3.  Decide which is larger.

Because 333.98… > 331.13…, the number with the larger logarithm—3⁷⁰⁰—is larger.  

Step 4.  Find how many times larger it is.

Difference of the logarithms:  
Δ = 333.984878 − 331.132995 ≈ 2.851883.

Therefore  

3⁷⁰⁰ / 2¹¹⁰⁰ = 10^Δ ≈ 10^2.851883

A classical 4 × 4 magic square with the numbers 1-16 is  

16   2   3  13  
 5  11  10   8  
 9   7   6  12  
 4  14  15   1  

Every row, column and (main) diagonal adds to 34.

Step 2 –  Find a linear transformation that makes all entries two–digit numbers and gives the required magic sum 264  
Replace every entry x by a new number  

x′ = a·x + b.  

After this transformation a row–sum becomes  
a·34 + 4b.  
We need a·34 + 4b = 264  ⟹ 17a + 2b = 132.

Choose a to be even (so that b is an integer).  
Taking a = 4 gives  
17·4 = 68 ⇒ 2b = 132 − 68 = 64 ⇒ b = 32.

Therefore use x′ = 4x + 32.

Step 3 –  Compute the new square  

16 → 96   2 → 40   3 → 44  13 → 84  
 5 → 52  11 → 76 10 → 72   8 → 64  
 9 → 68   7 → 60  6 → 56  12 → 80  
 4 → 48 14 → 88 15 → 92   1 → 36  

So the required square of two–digit numbers is  

96  40  44  84  
52  76  72  64  
68  60  56  80  
48  88  92  36  

Step 4 –  Verify the conditions  
• Each row: 96+40+44+84 = 264, etc.  
• Each column: 96+52+68+48 = 264, etc.  
• Both diagonals: 96+76+56+36 = 264 and 84+72+60+48 = 264.

The total of all 16 numbers is 4·264 = 1056, as required.

Step 5 –  Upside-down check  
Rotating the square 180° merely permutes the rows and columns:

36 92 88 48  
80 56 60 68  
64 72 76 52  
84 44 40 96  

Every row, column and diagonal of this rotated square is still the same set of four numbers from the corresponding original row/column/diagonal, so each still sums to 264.

Thus the square meets all the stated requirements.

Because the four digits that appear in the product must be exactly A, B, C, D (possibly in a different order), every decimal digit created by the multiplication has to be one of those four symbols.

1.  Look first at the units digit of the product.  
 That units digit is BD (mod 10).  
 So BD (mod 10) must be one of A, B, C, D.

2.  Thus possible endings are very restricted.  
 • If BD≡0 (mod 10) then at least one of B or D is 0, and the digit 0 must occur in the fangs.  
 • If BD≡5 (mod 10) then one of B,D is 5 and the other is odd, so the digit 5 is present.

Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras: R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.

Notation
 r = radius of the original sphere  
 R = radius of the drill (radius of the hole)  
 H = length of the cylindrical hole = 6 cm  

Two facts supplied in the statement (and also proved in the usual “hard’’ derivation) are

(1) The ends of the hole are exactly H centimetres apart, so the height of the remaining band is H.  
(2) Because the hole passes through the centre, the right-triangle relation holds:  
  R² + (H/2)² = r².                                                     (†)

The ‘‘napkin-ring theorem’’
A famous result says that the volume of the solid left after drilling the hole depends only on H, not on R or r.  We can exploit that in an “easy’’ way:

Easy solution
Because the volume is independent of R, choose the most convenient value, namely  
 R = 0.  
That corresponds to the limiting case in which no material is actually removed.  From (†) with R = 0 we get r = H/2 = 6/2 = 3 cm.  The remaining solid is just the whole sphere of radius 3 cm, whose volume is

 V = (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π(3)³  
   = (4/3)π·27 = 36π cm³.

Since the real napkin ring must have exactly the same volume (the volume is independent of R), that is the required answer.

Hard (classical) confirmation
If one insists on keeping R general:

• Remove a right circular cylinder of radius R and height H.  
• Remove two spherical caps, each of height h = r – H/2, whose volumes are  
 (1/6)πh(3R² + h²) each.  
Using r² = R² + (H/2)² and a few lines of algebra, the total removed volume simplifies and the remainder comes out to

[Order as a quadratic equation]
x^2 - 48x + 320 = 0

Let a equal 1, b equal 48, and c equal 320 as temporary variables in the factoring equation:
x = -b{+/-}[b^2 - 4ac]^1/2 / 2a

x = -40    and     x = -8
[Input those numbers into the now factored equation]
(x - 40)(x - 8) = 0
If the radius were 8, then that would mean the corner office would end up extending into the circular area (because the corner office is 16 x 8).

Let the cube have side‐length s metres.  
Put one lower corner of the cube at the origin O(0,0) and the opposite upper corner at (s , s).  
The vertical cylinder that is “hollowed out’’ of the cube is centred at C(s/2 , s/2) and has radius  

 r = s/2       (1)

Step 2.  Locate the “corner office’’  
The 16 m × 8 m office sits in the south–west corner of the floor‐plan; therefore its opposite corner is the point P(16 , 8).  
Because that corner “extends to the edge of the open area”, point P lies on the circumference of the circle that bounds the cylindrical hole.

Step 3.  Apply the distance (Pythagoras) condition  
Distance CP must equal the radius r:

 (16 – s/2)² + (8 – s/2)²  =  r²  =  (s/2)².       (2)

Step 4.  Solve for s  
Put h = s/2 to shorten the algebra.  
Equation (2) becomes

 (16 – h)² + (8 – h)²  =  h²  
 (h² – 32h + 256) + (h² – 16h + 64)  =  h²  
 2h² – 48h + 320  =  h²  
 h² – 48h + 320  = 0.

Quadratic formula:

 h = [48 ± √(48² – 4·320)] / 2  
 h = [48 ± √(2304 – 1280)] / 2  
 h = [48 ± 32] / 2  =>  h = 8  or  h = 40.

If h = 8 (s = 16) the rectangle would include the cylinder’s centre, so the office would invade the hollow space; therefore reject h = 8.  
Thus

 h = 40  ⇒  s = 2h = 80 m, r = 40 m.

So the cube is 80 m on a side and the cylindrical atrium has radius 40 m.

Step 5.  (Optional) How much wood?  
Volume of solid cube: V_cube = s³ = 80³ = 512 000 m³.  
Volume removed (cylinder): V_cyl = πr²h = π·40²·80 = 128 000π m³.  
Volume of wood required:

 V_wood = V_cube – V_cyl = 512 000 – 128 000π ≈ 109 876.14 m³.

At $10 per cubic metre, the cost is

 Cost = 10 × V_wood ≈ 10 × 109 876.14 ≈ \$1 098 761.4.

Since the newspaper is purchased every day, and the coffee and cream are purchased more often then the pack of cigarettes, then the pack is purchased either every 5 days or every 7 days.

dN = 20 / N   dC = (½-pint quantity)/(daily-cream-use)   dF = (1-lb quantity)/(daily-coffee-use).

Relations among the intervals  

 Daily newspaper ⇒ interval 1 day  
 Pack bought less often than the newspaper ⇒ dN > 1  
 Pack bought more often than cream ⇒ dN < dC  
 Cream bought more often than coffee ⇒ dC < dF  

So: 1 < dN < dC < dF. (1)

The four items were bought together on Flag Day, 14 June of some year Y, and—according to the statement—the very next time they were bought together was on 4 July of the following year Y + 1.  

How many calendar days is that?  

From 14 June to 4 July of the following year = 365 + 20 = 385 days  
(because the interval does NOT cross a leap day; if it did, the span would be 386 days and would not satisfy the conditions below).

Therefore the first common purchase day after Flag Day occurs exactly every  

LCM(dN , dC , dF) = 385 days. (2)

Hence each interval must be a divisor of 385.

Prime factorisation 385 = 5 × 7 × 11.  
Its positive divisors are 1, 5, 7, 11, 35, 55, 77, 385.

dN = 20 / N is an integer divisor of 20, i.e. 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 or 20.

Because dN must also divide 385 (from (2)), the only possibilities are 1 or 5.  
But dN = 1 would mean he buys a pack every day, contradicting (1).  
Therefore dN = 5.

So 20 / N = 5 ⇒ N = 4.

Thus he smokes 4 cigarettes each day.

(Values satisfying the remaining conditions can be chosen, e.g. dC = 7 days, dF = 55 days; then 1 < 5 < 7 < 55 and LCM(5,7,55)=385, so every requirement in the puzzle is met.)

         P⁶ / P = P⁵.

4.  Subtract P:

         P⁵ – P.

5.  Now divide this value by 10 and ask for the remainder.  
    We must therefore find

         (P⁵ – P)  mod 10.

    A well-known number-theory fact is that for every integer n,

         n⁵ – n  is divisible by 10 (indeed by 30).

    Proof sketch: n⁵ – n = n(n⁴–1)=n(n–1)(n+1)(n²+1).  
    Among the three consecutive numbers n–1, n, n+1 one is even (⇒ factor 2)  
    and one is a multiple of 5 or, more generally, Fermat’s little theorem
    shows n⁵ ≡ n (mod 5). Thus 2 and 5 both divide n⁵ – n, so 10 divides
    it, i.e. n⁵ – n ≡ 0 (mod 10).

    Taking n = P gives

         P⁵ – P ≡ 0 (mod 10).

    Therefore the remainder upon division by 10 is 0.

We are told that  
 P = k³, where k is a two-digit integer (10 ≤ k ≤ 99).  
We want the smallest possible N.

Step 1.  N cannot have fewer than 4 digits.  
The smallest possible cube is 10³ = 1000, so P ≥ 1000.  
With three digits the greatest possible product is 9·9·9 = 729 < 1000, hence at least four digits are needed.

Step 2.  If N has 4 digits, the largest possible product is 9⁴ = 6561.  
Therefore the only two-digit k for which k³ ≤ 6561 are  
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.  
(19³ = 6859 already exceeds 6561.)

Step 3.  For each of these k check whether k³ can be written as a product of exactly four one-digit numbers (1–9).  
Write k³ in prime factors and split the factors into four groups, each corresponding to a digit ≤ 9.

• k = 11 : 11³ = 11³ (contains the prime 11) – impossible with one-digit factors.

• k = 12 : 12³ = 2⁶·3³ = 1728  
 One convenient splitting is  
  (3) · (8) · (8) · (9) = 1728.  
 Digits: 3,8,8,9 → smallest arrangement 3889.

• k = 13 : 13³ contains the prime 13 – impossible.

• k = 14 : 14³ = 2³·7³ = 2744

Find the only positive integer number less than 20,000 that is also a sum of three positive integers, all containing exactly 7 factors.
There was a steady silence. Can you break the silence by figuring it out?
 Hint: For the prime factorization of positive integer x, we get
x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:
[K(sub 1) + 1][K(sub 2) + 1]...
For example, the prime factorization of 228 is (2^2)(3^1)(19^1). 228 has 12 factors, since (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12.","For the prime factorization of positive integer x, we get

First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage. The only way to get 7 as the number of factors is 1 x 7. So the prime factorization of any number with 7 factors is n^6 times x^0, where n and x are both primes. But if you look, x^0, for all nonzero values of x, is 1! So, any number with exactly 7 factors must be a prime raised to the sixth power. This yields 2^6 +3^6+5^6 = 16418. Any prime 7 or greater to the sixth power is greater than 20,000.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 1 –  What does “exactly 7 factors’’ mean?  
If a positive integer n has prime-factorisation  
n = p1^e1 · p2^e2 · … · pk^ek ,  
then the number of divisors of n is (e1+1)(e2+1)…(ek+1).

To obtain 7 divisors we have to make the product of the (ei+1)’s equal 7.  
Since 7 is prime, the only possibility is

 e1 + 1 = 7  and  all other ei + 1 = 1,

i.e. only one exponent is 6 and the rest are 0.  
Therefore every integer with exactly 7 divisors is a sixth power of a prime:

 n = p^6 with p prime.

Step 2 –  Which sixth powers of primes are < 20 000?  

2^6 = 64  
3^6 = 729  
5^6 = 15 625  
7^6 = 117 649  (> 20 000, so it and all higher primes are too big)

Hence, under 20 000 there are precisely three numbers that possess exactly 7 divisors:

 64 , 729 , 15 625.

Step 3 –  Forming the required sum.  
The problem asks for “the only positive integer less than 20 000 that is also a sum of three positive integers, all containing exactly 7 factors.”  
Since there are exactly three such integers below 20 000, the sum in question must be the sum of these three numbers themselves:

 64 + 729 + 15 625 = 16 418.

Step 4 –  Verification.  
16 418 < 20 000, and it is indeed the sum of three positive integers (64, 729, 15 625), each of which has exactly seven divisors.

No other choice is possible, because there are no further integers with seven divisors to use, and every different selection of three numbers with that property would have to come from this same (three-element) set; the only way to take three numbers from a three-element set is to take each of them once.

But the site may recalculate p every time from the previous (rounded) ranking, which could cause errors that could accumulate or cancel, depending on how unlucky/lucky you were about what order people voted in.  This could account for the errors in the above data.  If this is the problem, the best fix would be to keep a separate count of p for each ranking.  A temporary fix would be to at least round p off to the nearest integer when deriving it from the previous ranking, which works up to around 200 votes or so.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"The easiest way to turn a displayed Braingle rating (which is always between 1.00 and 3.00) back into “how many people pressed the ‘+’ button and how many pressed the ‘–’ button?” is to treat the figure on the screen as nothing more than a straight-line average

      rating  =  1  +  2·( # “+” votes ) / ( total # votes ).          (★)

(★) is exactly the formula that was derived in “Reverse Engineering I”.  
Solving it for the unknown number of “+” votes gives

      # “+”  =  (rating – 1)/2 · (total votes).

Because the site shows the rating rounded to the nearest .01, the value given by (★) can be a few hundredths off the published figure, so we merely pick the nearest integer that makes (★) come out to within the rounding tolerance.  

Doing this for each of the four teasers (16, 18, 25 and 44 voters respectively) gives the following counts before your vote was cast.

Teaser M   (1.38, 1.20)  with 16 voters  
 fun:        3 “fun” (+)  13 “not-fun” (–)  
 difficulty: 2 “hard” (+) 14 “easy” (–)

Teaser N   (2.00, 2.22)  with 18 voters  
 fun:        9 “fun” (+)  9 “not-fun” (–)  
 difficulty: 11 “hard” (+) 7 “easy” (–)

Teaser O   (1.04, 2.82)  with 25 voters  
 fun:        1 “fun” (+)  24 “not-fun” (–)  (0 +, 25 – would also fit inside the rounding window)  
 difficulty: 23 “hard” (+) 2 “easy” (–)

Teaser P   (2.13, 1.72)  with 44 voters  
 fun:        25 “fun” (+) 19 “not-fun” (–)  
 difficulty: 16 “hard” (+) 28 “easy” (–)

After your vote (+ for fun, – for difficulty) the counts change in the obvious way (add one to the appropriate column) and the ratings recompute to the new values shown.

Why don’t the new readings fall exactly where equation (★) predicts?

1.  Rounding – The site stores the internal average to several more decimal places but only shows it to two; depending on where the hidden value lies inside the 0.005-wide rounding interval, the displayed figure can be as much as ±0.005 away from the raw average.  With small numbers of votes a single extra hundredth represents a sizeable change in the reconstructed count.

2.  Smoothing/neutral “starter” votes – Braingle appears to seed every teaser with a very small number of fictitious neutral votes (worth 2.00).  These have almost no visible effect when the vote count is tiny, but once there are 20–50 real votes the little bias shows up as a systematic drift of a few hundredths away from the naïve value given by (★).  Because we cannot tell exactly how many of those seed votes exist, our reverse calculation is forced to settle for the nearest whole number that still fits the rounded display.

3.  Concurrency – Occasionally another user may happen to rate the teaser in the same short interval between the “before” and “after” snapshots, introducing an extra +/– pair that we have no way of recognising.

All three sources are small (a few hundredths at most) but together they account for the “experimental error” you noticed once the vote totals became larger.

Patti        45, 7.5% ... 7.5 * 2 = 15

TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let

 (iii) Eileen gets twice as many as Patty’s percentage.  
   E = 2·p = 2·(P⁄6) = P⁄3 = (R⁄9)⁄3 = R⁄27.     (4)

Substituting (2), (3) and (4) in the total-sum equation (1):

47,"Question: The knight left Breadland, and went to a neighboring kingdom named Cakeland. Cakeland is much similar to Breadland, but unlike Breadland, Cakeland is 12x4. Cakelanders like cake, as well as Breadlanders like bread.
The knight was on a square of Cakeland, he wanted to visit each square of Cakeland exactly once, and return to the square he was originally on. Each step, the knight moved to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but the queen can't reach.
The knight thought that since Cakeland has an even number of squares, he could achieve his goal this time.
However, the knight still failed.
Do you know why?
 Hint: If you can't figure it out, try coloring Cakeland in another way:
a d a d...
b c b c...
c b c b...
d a d a...

Additionally, we notice that each a-square must be preceded and followed by a b-square. This will require more b-squares than a-squares, but there are 12 squares of each color.
Therefore, the knight couldn't achieve his goal.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the 12×4 board be numbered by rows 0,1,2,3 (from top to bottom) and columns 0,… ,11 (from left to right).
Colour the board periodically with the four letters  

a d a d a d …  
b c b c b c …  
c b c b c b …  
d a d a d a …  

(that is, for an even column we read a-b-c-d downward, and for an odd column we read d-c-b-a).

There are 12 squares of every colour.

1.  What colours can a knight reach?

   • A square of colour a is situated in row 0 even column or in row 3 odd column.  
     From any such square every legal knight–move leads to a square of colour b, and to no other colour.  
     Hence a → b only.

   • Dually, every square of colour d moves only to colour c:  d → c.

   • A square of colour b can reach either a or c (never d).  
     So b → a or c.

   • A square of colour c can reach either b or d (never a).  
     So c → b or d.

   Summarising, the possible colour pairs of a single knight jump are

       a-b-c-d,  
   with arrows only between consecutive colours of this chain.

2.  Assume, for contradiction, that the knight makes a closed tour, i.e. a Hamiltonian cycle
    through all 48 squares.

    In such a cycle every square has degree 2 (one edge “coming in”, one “going out”).

    •  Each of the 12 a-squares is incident with two edges and both of them must join it to a
       b-square (because a can meet only b).  
       Therefore the tour contains exactly 2·12 = 24 edges of the kind a–b.

    •  These 24 edges exhaust the whole degree of every b-square:
       there are 12 b-squares and each of them can carry at most two a–b edges, so all of its two
       edges are already used.  Consequently no edge of the tour can join b to c; hence
       there are 0 edges of type b–c.

    •  Because c-squares are not connected with b-squares, the two edges that every c-square needs in
       the cycle must both go to d-squares.  Thus we get 2·12 = 24 edges of type c–d, and,
       symmetrically, all d-squares are saturated by those edges.

3.  The cycle is therefore split into two disjoint parts

        a-b-a-b-…-a-b      and      c-d-c-d-…-c-d,

    containing, respectively, all the a- and b-squares and all the c- and d-squares,
    but with no edge between the two parts.  That contradicts the assumption that
    we had one single Hamiltonian cycle through all 48 squares.

Hence a closed knight’s tour on a 12×4 board is impossible, and that is why the knight failed in Cakeland.

Final answer: A 12 × 4 board admits no closed knight’s tour; the four-colouring above forces all moves to stay inside the two disjoint pairs {a,b} and {c,d}, so a single cycle through every square cannot exist.",True,1,0,0

The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.

Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:

 Hint: You might want to start at the top.",You might want to start at the top.,"It is 7 feet tall.
The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3. Because a second tier will not change any of the angles involved, new triangles will be similar to old and all changes in measurement of length will be proportional. A pyramid 2 tiers tall would have v2 = ( 2*b * 2*b * 2 ) / 3 = 8*v1. For 3 tiers, v3 = ( 3*b * 3*b * 3 ) / 3 = 27*v1. It becomes clear that a cube number must be a factor of the number of blocks.
1029 = 3 * 7^3, so there are 7 tiers. (The peak being formed by 3 separate blocks, every tier has 3 times as many blocks as in the supposition. Because 7 is a prime number, there is no smaller number of tiers which would satisfy the question.)",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the pyramid stand on the horizontal plane z = 0 and let its apex be at height H feet.  
Because the pyramid has a square base and its four lateral faces are congruent isosceles triangles, the length of a horizontal square cross-section changes linearly as we move up or down.

1.  Cut the pyramid by the horizontal planes z = 0,1,2,… .  
    This gives H tiers, each exactly 1 ft thick (the problem tells us every tier is 1 ft thick).

2.  Denote by s(k) the side length (in feet) of the square section at height z = k.  
    Since the change is linear, s(k) = s(0) – k·d, where d is the amount the side length shrinks per foot of height.

    At the apex (z = H) we must have s(H) = 0, so

4.  Total volume.  
    The sum of the Vk over k = 0,…,H – 1 must equal the total number of blocks, 1029.  
    Using the arithmetic-progression form s(k) = (H – k)d, a little algebra (or summing the seven separate frustums as done below) shows that the total volume is

        Vtotal = (1/3)·H(H + 1)(2H + 1)·d^2 /6 = (1/3)·(H·d)^2·H

5.  Put in the numbers.  
    Each block occupies 1 ft³, so Vtotal = 1029 ft³.  
    Therefore

           (1/3)·s(0)²·H = 1029

    From (1) we also have s(0) = H·d, so (3) becomes

           (H·d)²·H = 3087  →  H³·d² = 3087.     (4)

6.  Factor 3087.  
    3087 = 3²·7³.

    Because d and H are positive integers (side lengths and heights are integer feet), write

        H = 3^α·7^β,  d² = 3^(2–2α)·7^(3–2β)      (from (4)).

    For d to be an integer, each exponent in d² must be even and non-negative, so
        0 ≤ 2 – 2α and 0 ≤ 3 – 2β.
    The only possibilities are α = 0 or 1 and β = 0 or 1.

    Trying them:

        α = 1, β = 1  →  actually gives d² = 3⁰·7¹ = 7, impossible.

        α = 1, β = 1 mis-copied; the exponents must be even in d².

The average of  11 and  47  is 29,
the average of  11 and 71 is  41,
the average of  47 and 71 is  59,
and the average of all three numbers is  43 .",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the three different two–digit primes be  
P, Q, R   (all ≠2, hence all odd).

1.  “The average of ANY TWO of the numbers is a prime.”  
    For every pair we need  
        (P+Q)/2 , (P+R)/2 , (Q+R)/2  
    to be prime.  
    Because P,Q,R are odd, each sum (say P+Q) is even, so the averages are integers.  
    Since the only even prime is 2 and P+Q ≥ 22, every average is an odd prime.

2.  “The average of all three of the numbers is a prime.”  
    (P + Q + R)/3 must be an integer and a prime.  
    Hence P + Q + R ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
    A two–digit prime is never divisible by 3, so each of P,Q,R is ≡1 or ≡2 (mod 3).  
    The only way three such residues add to 0 mod 3 is  
        (1,1,1)  or  (2,2,2).  
    Therefore P≡Q≡R (mod 3).

3.  Use the hint: “The average of two of the numbers is 59.”  
    Without loss of generality let (P+Q)/2 = 59 ⇒ P + Q = 118  
    so that P = 59 – d,   Q = 59 + d for some even d, with both P and Q prime.

    Checking even d’s gives exactly two admissible pairs:
        d = 12  →  (P,Q) = (47, 71)  
        d = 30  →  (P,Q) = (29, 89)

4.  Find R for each pair.

   (a)  Pair (47, 71).  
        Because 118 ≡ 1 (mod 3), we need R ≡ 2 (mod 3).  
        List the two–digit primes that are 2 (mod 3):  
        11, 17, 23, 29, 41, 47, 53, 59, 71, 83, 89.

        Test each R (≠47, 71) requiring both (47+R)/2 and (71+R)/2 to be prime:

            R = 11  →  (47+11)/2 = 29  prime,   (71+11)/2 = 41  prime ✔  
            R = 17  →  (47+17)/2 = 32  not prime ✖  
            (all other candidates fail similarly)

        With R = 11 the three–number average is  
            (47+71+11)/3 = 43,   also prime.  
        Thus {11, 47, 71} works.

   (b)  Pair (29, 89).  
        Again R must be ≡2 (mod 3).  
        No such R makes both (29+R)/2 and (89+R)/2 prime **and** gives a prime triple average.  
        Hence no solution arises from (29, 89).

5.  Conclusion  
    The only triple that satisfies every requirement (in any order) is

        11, 47, 71.

    Check:
        (11+47)/2 = 29   prime  
        (11+71)/2 = 41   prime  
        (47+71)/2 = 59   prime  
        (11+47+71)/3 = 43   prime

All conditions are met.

53,"Question: It is easy to express 2004 as the sum of distinct positive numbers comprising the same digits:
2004 = 725 + 752 + 527 or
2004 = 617 + 671 + 716 or
2004 = 509 + 590 + 905.
It is harder to write 2003 as the sum of distinct positive numbers with the same digits.
What are they?
 Hint: You will need five numbers of three digits each.",You will need five numbers of three digits each.,127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721 = 2003,GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the three digits we are going to use be a, b, c (leading zeros are not allowed).  
There are at most six different three–digit numbers that can be formed with these digits, namely the six permutations of abc:

abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba.

Useful observation – the sum of all six permutations.  
In every permutation each digit appears twice in the hundreds place, twice in the tens place and twice in the units place, so

sum of all six = 2·(100+10+1)(a+b+c)=222(a+b+c).     (★)

We need only five of the six permutations and want them to add to 2003.  
If P denotes the permutation we leave out, then

222(a+b+c) − P = 2003, so P = 222(a+b+c) − 2003.     (1)

Because P itself is a three–digit permutation of the digits a, b, c, it must lie between 100 and 999 inclusive.  From (1)

100 ≤ 222(a+b+c) − 2003 ≤ 999.

This forces the digit-sum s = a+b+c to satisfy

100+2003 ≤ 222s ≤ 999+2003 ⇒ 2103 ≤ 222s ≤ 3002  
  ⇒   9.48… ≤ s ≤ 13.53…,  so s ∈ {10,11,12,13}.

Compute P for each possible s:

s = 10 → P = 222·10 − 2003 = 217  
s = 11 → P = 222·11 − 2003 = 439  
s = 12 → P = 222·12 − 2003 = 661  
s = 13 → P = 222·13 − 2003 = 883.

Which of these P can really be a permutation of digits whose sum is s?

• 217 has digits 2+1+7 = 10   ✓ (matches s)  
• 439 has digits 4+3+9 = 16   ✗  
• 661 has digits 6+6+1 = 13   ✗ (and would not give 5 distinct permutations)  
• 883 has digits 8+8+3 = 19   ✗ (and would not give 5 distinct permutations)

The only viable case is s = 10 with digits {1,2,7}.  
All six permutations of 1,2,7 are

127, 172, 217, 271, 712, 721.

Leaving out P = 217, the remaining five indeed sum to

127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721 = 2003.

Thus the required decomposition of 2003 is

2003 = 127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721.

All five addends are distinct three-digit numbers and each consists of the same three digits 1, 2, 7.

123 456 789 ÷ 9 = 13 717 421.

Hence  

1 234 567 890 = 2 · 3 · 3 · 5 · 3607 · 3803.          (1)

We must split these six prime factors into two groups whose products are as close as possible (i.e. as near as possible to √1 234 567 890 ≈ 35 136.5).

The small primes give 2·3·3·5 = 90.  
Pairing one of the large primes (3607 or 3803) with 90 is far from √N (≈ 324 630 or 342 270), so each large prime must go into a different factor.

55,"Question: There was a famous mathematician named Karl Friedrich Gauss. When he was young, he entered Gotinga University. One day he met an old professor, and spoke to him. They chatted, and the professor asked Gauss about his age.
Gauss said: ""The cube and the fourth power of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
The professor said: ""Very good. It's good coincidence because the square and the cube of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
How old was Gauss, and how old was the professor?
 Hint: Eliminate the impossibilities, such as their ages can't end with 0.","Eliminate the impossibilities, such as their ages can't end with 0.","Their ages can't end with 0, 1, 5 or 6, and must be either a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 9 minus 1 because the sum of its square and its cube or its cube and its fourth power is divisible by 9.
Gauss's age is easy. Since 17^3=4913, 17^4=83521, 22^3=10648, 22^4=234256, Gauss's age is between 18 and 21. The only possibility is 18. 18^3=5832, 18^4=104976.
The professor's age is a little harder. It can be 47 to 99, and the possibilities are: 48, 53, 54, 57, 62, 63, 69, 72, 78, 84, 87, 89, 93, 98, 99. By trial and error, 69 satisfies this condition: 69^2=4761, 69^3=328509.
Therefore, Gauss was 18 and the professor was 69.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Reasoning in full detail  

1.  What the two statements mean  
   •  Gauss:  n³ together with n⁴ must contain every decimal digit 0-9 exactly once.  
   •  Professor:  p² together with p³ must contain every decimal digit 0-9 exactly once.  

   In each case the two powers taken together must have 10 digits, all different.

------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  How many digits can the powers have?

   Number of digits of k is ⌊log₁₀k⌋+1.

   Gauss (n³+n⁴):  
   •  If n is 1-digit, n³ has ≤3 digits and n⁴ ≤4 ⇒ total ≤7 (too few).  
   •  So n is 2-digit (10–99).  Then  
        10³ = 1000  (4 digits)   and   99³ = 970 299 (6 digits).  
        Hence n³ has 4, 5 or 6 digits.  
        Likewise n⁴ has 5–8 digits.  
   •  Only two sums can give 10:  (4+6) or (5+5).  

     –  Digits (5+5) would need n³ and n⁴ both to be 5-digit numbers, impossible
       because once n³ reaches 100 000 (6 digits) n⁴ already has 7-8 digits.  

     –  So we must have 4 digits for n³ and 6 digits for n⁴.

     n³ has 4 digits while n⁴ has 6 digits exactly when  
        18 ≤ n ≤ 21               (because 18³ = 5832 is the first 4-digit cube whose 4th power 18⁴ = 104 976 already has 6 digits, and 22³ already has 5 digits).

------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Testing the four candidates for Gauss  

   18 : 18³ =  5832 , 18⁴ = 104 976 → digits {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.  Perfect.  
   19 : 19³ =  6859 , 19⁴ = 130 321 → 1 and 3 each repeat.  
   20 : 20³ =  8000 , 20⁴ = 160 000 → 0 repeats many times.  
   21 : 21³ =  9261 , 21⁴ = 194 481 → 1,4 repeat.

   Only n = 18 works.

   Therefore Gauss was 18 years old.

------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Doing the same for the professor  

   We need p² + p³ = 10 digits, all different.

   •  If p is 1-digit, p² has ≤2 digits → impossible.  
   •  If p is 2-digit, p² has 3 or 4 digits, p³ has 5–6–7 digits.  
     –  (3+7) or (5+5) can’t occur for a 2-digit number, so again only (4+6) works.

     p² has 4 digits when p ≥ 32.  
     p³ has 6 digits when p ≥ 47 (because 46³ = 97 336 is still 5-digit).  
     p³ becomes 7-digit at p = 100, so the only range to check is

           47 ≤ p ≤ 99

   Extra quick eliminations
     •  If p ends in 0,1,5,6 then the last digit of p² equals that of p³, giving a repeated digit; so those endings are impossible.

     Remaining endings: 2,3,4,7,8,9.  That still leaves only 53 numbers to test.

   A systematic inspection (or a short computer script) of 47–99 with those endings gives just one pandigital pair:

       69² =  4 7 6 1
       69³ = 3 2 8 5 0 9

       Digits used: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 once each – no repetition, none missing.

   All other candidates fail because some digit is repeated or missing.

   Therefore the professor was 69 years old.

together with  
R = 7, H = 4, and I ≠ 1.

1.  Interpretation  
    Because of the sign “×”, it is a multiplication of two-digit numbers producing a four-digit product:
        (10H + I) · (10T + O) = 1000J + 110R + O.

2.  Last-digit condition  
    The last digit of the product equals O.  In a product of two-digit numbers this last digit is
        (I · O) mod 10.
    Hence
        I · O ≡ O  (mod 10)  ⟹  O · (I – 1) ≡ 0  (mod 10).

    So we need 10 | O(I–1).  Because I ≠ 1, this forces one of the following:
        • O = 0; or
        • O = 5 and I odd; or
        • I = 6 and O even.

3.  O = 0 is impossible  
    If O = 0 then the product ends in 70 (since the tens digit is R = 7).  
    Writing (10H+I) = 40+I and (10T+O) = 10T, we get
        (40+I)T ≡ 77  (mod 100),
    but no choice of I (0–9 with I ≠ 1) and T (1–9) gives a number ending in 77.  
    Hence O ≠ 0.

4.  O = 5 is impossible  
    Here I must be 3, 5, 7, or 9.  Trying every I in {3,5,7,9} and every two-digit number ending in 5 shows none give a product whose two centre digits are both 7.  Hence O ≠ 5.

5.  Therefore I = 6 and O is even  
    O may be 2, 4, 6, 8, but digits must be distinct and H = 4 is already used; O also cannot equal I.  
    So the only possibilities are O = 2 or O = 8.

6.  Narrowing the product  
    The product has the form J 7 7 O, i.e.
        1000J + 770 + O,
    which can only be 1772–1779, 2772–2779, 3772–3779, or 4772–4779.

7.  Testing O = 2 (thus product ends in 2)  
    Possible products: 1772, 2772, 3772, 4772.  
    The multiplicand HI is 46, so we divide each candidate by 46:

        1772 ÷ 46 = 38.52…   (not integer)
        2772 ÷ 46 = 60.26…   (not integer)
        3772 ÷ 46 = 82        ← integer!
        4772 ÷ 46 = 103.74…  (three-digit)

    Only 3772 works, giving TO = 82 (digits T = 8, O = 2).

8.  Digit check  
        H = 4, I = 6, T = 8, O = 2, R = 7, J = 3  
    are all distinct, satisfying the cryptarithm.

9.  Verification  
        46 × 82 = 3772

    which indeed matches
        HI × TO = JRRO
        46 × 82 = 3 7 7 2.

Hence the unique solution is  

    H = 4, I = 6, J = 3, R = 7, T = 8, O = 2
    i.e. 46 × 82 = 3772.

 Hint: One can represent the time taken by each car in terms of distance and rate (with some unknown variables); then, set these expressions equal","One can represent the time taken by each car in terms of distance and rate (with some unknown variables); then, set these expressions equal","54 miles/hr.
Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).
Thus we get b = 11664/216 = 54.
Thus speed of Car 2 = 54 miles/hr",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

 v₁ = 36 mph  (speed of Car 1, given)  
 v₂ = ?    (speed of Car 2, to be found)

1. Distances covered up to the meeting point  
 Car 1: AC = v₁·t = 36 t  
 Car 2: BC = v₂·t

2. Distances after the meeting  
 Car 1 needs 9 more hours to reach B, so CB = v₁·9 = 36·9  
 Car 2 needs 4 more hours to reach A, so CA = v₂·4

3. Use equality of geometric distances  
 AC = CA ⇒ 36 t = v₂·4    (1)  
 BC = CB ⇒ v₂ t = 36·9    (2)

4. Solve the two equations.  
From (1): t = 4v₂ / 36 = v₂ / 9.  
Substitute this t into (2):

 v₂ · (v₂ / 9) = 36 · 9  
 v₂² / 9 = 324  
 v₂² = 2916  
 v₂ = √2916 = 54.

Therefore the constant speed of Car 2 is 54 miles per hour.

62,"Question: What number comes next in the sequence:
61, 691, 163, 487, 4201, ?
 Hint: Reverse the digits of the numbers.",Reverse the digits of the numbers.,"9631. The sequence consists of the prime numbers which, when their digits are reversed, are perfect squares.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"1.  Use the hint – reverse each term already given  

   61  → 16  
   691 → 196  
   163 → 361  
   487 → 784  
   4201→ 1024  

   So we get the auxiliary sequence  
   16, 196, 361, 784, 1024.

2.  Notice that every one of these numbers is a perfect square  

   16   = 4²  
   196  = 14²  
   361  = 19²  
   784  = 28²  
   1024 = 32².

   Let the successive square roots be  
   4, 14, 19, 28, 32.

3.  Look for the pattern in these roots.  
   Consecutive differences are  

   14 − 4  = 10  
   19 − 14 = 5  
   28 − 19 = 9  
   32 − 28 = 4.

   The second-order differences form the repeating cycle −5, +4, −5, +4, …  

      5  − 10 = −5  
      9  −  5 =  +4  
      4  −  9 = −5  
   so the next second-order difference should be +4.  
   Therefore the next first-order difference is  

      4 + 4 = 8.

   Hence the next square root is  

      32 + 8 = 40.

4.  Square it: 40² = 1600.  

5.  Reverse the digits again (discarding any leading zeros):  
   1600 → 0061 → 61.

So the sequence closes the cycle and the required next term is 61.

63,"Question: Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.
""I know that voice!  C'mon down.""
""Who is it?"" Eileen prodded.
""Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?""
Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.
""Why should I?""
""I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.""
""Is that the new Sinatra CD?""
""No, it's the world's greatest snack.""
""I'm hungry, too!"" the other voice whined.
""Who's up there with you?""  Patty asked.
""I'll bet I know!"" Eileen called.  ""It's obvious!""
Patty's face lit up in realization.  ""Robin!"" they laughed together.
A pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.
""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""
""We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.""
""What are those?""
""You know what a perfect number is?""
""Sure,"" Patty interjected, ""a number equal to the sum of its divisors.""
""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.  What are the four quantities in the sequence?

This one really requires a brute-force approach.  The sigma function (sum of a number's divisors) does not lend itself to 3rd-order analysis (3 numbers past the first one).

• each between 100 and 200, and  
• a₁+a₂+a₃+a₄ is a multiple of 25.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Eliminate hopeless starting numbers
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If n is prime, s(n)=1 (<100).  
If n = p q (product of two different primes) then  

s(n)=1+p+q < 1+97+89 = 187 < 100   (in fact <100 for all p,q≤97).  

Hence primes and semiprimes cannot appear among the required four
terms, so we restrict attention to the remaining integers 100–200.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  List the admissible “successor” pairs
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Compute s(n) for every remaining n and keep the pair (n, s(n)) only

 110→106  112→136  114→126  118→? (62) …  

Doing this for the whole range leaves only a few chains that can stay
inside 100–200 for three further steps.  Chasing them we get

(i) 102 → 114 → 126 → 186 → 198 …  
(ii) 108 → 172 → 136 → 134 → 70  …  
(iii)114 → 126 → 186 → 198 → 270 …

All other candidates leave the 100–200 interval after at most two
steps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Check the sums
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Sum of the first four terms in each chain:

(i) 102+114+126+186 = 528  (not divisible by 25)  
(ii)108+172+136+134 = 550  ( divisible by 25)  
(iii)114+126+186+198 = 624 (not divisible by 25)

Only chain (ii) satisfies the divisibility requirement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  The required sequence
--------------------------------------------------------------------
a₁ = 108  
a₂ = s(108) = 172  
a₃ = s(172) = 136  
a₄ = s(136) = 134  

108 + 172 + 136 + 134 = 550 = 25 × 22, as required, and each term is
between 100 and 200.

64,"Question: The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with ""rock"", 2 points with ""scissors"", and 1 point with ""paper"".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one ""throw"", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.
The players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.

Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the probabilities with which you throw

 • If you throw Rock:  0 against R,  +3 against S,  –1 against P  
  ER = 3s – p

 • If you throw Scissors:  –3 against R,  0 against S,  +2 against P  
  ES = –3r + 2p

 • If you throw Paper:  +1 against R,  –2 against S,  0 against P  
  EP = r – 2s

In a zero-sum game the equilibrium mixture makes every pure choice give the same expected payoff (otherwise the opponent could exploit the difference).  Thus set

 ER = ES = EP.

1) ER = ES  ⇒ 3s – p = –3r + 2p ⇒ 3s + 3r = 3p ⇒ p = r + s.

2) ES = EP  ⇒ –3r + 2p = r – 2s ⇒ -4r + 2p + 2s = 0 ⇒ p + s = 2r.

Together with r+s+p = 1 we solve:

 p = r + s  
 p + s = 2r  ⇒ (r+s) + s = 2r  ⇒ r = 2s  
 Hence p = 3s.  
 Sum: r + s + p = 2s + s + 3s = 6s = 1 ⇒ s = 1/6.

Therefore  
 s = 1/6, r = 2/6 = 1/3, p = 3/6 = 1/2.

Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
Assume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.  What is the lowest card total at which you can be assured you will not be required to drink a glass of milk through your nose in order to break a tie for the maximum 4 points?
 Hint: Create the largest tie",Create the largest tie,"If all four players hold the same number of cards, the lowest card total that would never require a tie-break is 142.
If all four players hold the same number of cards, the highest single hand card total at which a tie-breaker might be needed is 141.  In this case, the two players who would be required to drink milk through their noses would each have had a hand consisting of a joker and two 8s, 9s, 10s, jacks, queens and kings.  Any score above 141 can not be duplicated in a single hand of Snapoker, thus making 142 the lowest total to which a tie-breaker will not need to be applied.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 1 –  What cards are actually in the game  
For one ordinary deck of 52 cards we keep only  

• Spades : 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , Q (12)  ( 6 cards)  
• Hearts : A (1) , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , J (11) , K (13) ( 7 cards)  
• Diamonds : 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , Q (12) ( 6 cards)  
• Clubs : 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , J (11) , K (13) ( 6 cards)  

That is 25 cards.  
Two identical decks are used → 2·25 = 50 cards.  
Two jokers (value 15) are then added → 52 cards altogether, so each of the four
players finally holds 13 cards.

Step 2 –  How much are all the cards worth?  

                cards   value-sum
 value  1 :       2  →       2  
 value  2 :       4  →       8

 value  7 :       4  →      28  
 value  8 :       4  →      32  
 value  9 :       4  →      36  
 value 10 :       4  →      40  
 value 11 :       4  →      44  
 value 12 :       4  →      48  
 value 13 :       4  →      52  
 value 15 :       2  →      30  
--------------------------------  
 total                     392  

Hence the four 13-card hands must add to 392 and the
average hand is worth 392 / 4 = 98 points.

Step 3 –  How large can a tie be?   (Use the hint: “create the largest tie”)

To let two players tie as high as possible give them the 26 highest cards in the
whole pack.

The 26 highest cards are  

• 2 Jokers (2 × 15)  
• 4 Kings  (4 × 13)  
• 4 Queens (4 × 12)  
• 4 Jacks  (4 × 11)  
• 4 Tens   (4 × 10)  
• 4 Nines  (4 ×  9)  
• 4 Eights (4 ×  8)

Their total value is  
2·15 + 4·13 + 4·12 + 4·11 + 4·10 + 4·9 + 4·8
= 30 + 52 + 48 + 44 + 40 + 36 + 32 = 282.

Because those 26 cards must be split evenly (13 and 13)
the largest total that two different players can share is

282 / 2 = 141.

And the split can actually be done, e.g.

  1 Joker,  2 K, 2 Q, 2 J, 2 10, 2 9, 2 8   → 13 cards worth 141

so a tie on 141 is possible.

Step 4 –  Why a tie can never be higher than 141  

For two players to tie on some value T we would need
2T ≤ value of the 26 highest cards = 282,
so T ≤ 141.  Therefore 141 is the biggest total on which two
players can finish level.

Step 5 –  The lowest total that guarantees “no-tie”  

If you end up with at least 142 points, every other player
must have at most 141 points (because a second hand of
142 or more would force 2T ≥ 284 > 282, impossible).
Consequently no one can equal your score and you will not
have to resort to the milk-through-the-nose tiebreaker.

Moreover 142 is attainable (for example
2 Jokers, 2 K, 2 Q, 2 J, 2 10, 2 9, 1 “2” = 13 cards worth 142),
so it is the first total that gives an absolute guarantee.

66,"Question: There are ten natural numbers, two of which are equal. Adding any nine of them, we can get the following sums:
82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92.
Find the largest number of the ten.
 Hint: Each digit is present 9 times, so the overall sum must be divisible by 9","Each digit is present 9 times, so the overall sum must be divisible by 9","There are ten possible sums, arrived at by alternately excluding each one of the ten numbers.  Two of the sums are equal. If we add the ten sums, it should equal nine times the sum of the ten numbers, as each number will be present within all of the sums nine times.
82+83+84+85+87+89+90+91+92=87*9=783, which is divisible by 9, therefore the repeated sum must be divisible by 9.  The only sum which meets this criteria is 90.
The sum of the ten numbers is (783+90)/9=97.  The largest number is found by subtracting the lowest sum of nine numbers (which excluded the largest of the ten numbers) from the sum of all ten numbers.  Thus: 97-82=15.  15 is the largest number of the ten.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the ten natural numbers be  
a₁,a₂,…,a₁₀ with a₉ = a₁₀ (one pair of equal numbers).  
Put  

 S = a₁+a₂+⋯+a₁₀  (the sum of all ten numbers).

If we omit aᵢ, the sum of the remaining nine numbers is S–aᵢ.  
Because the equal numbers give the same 9-sum, the ten values S–aᵢ collapse to only nine distinct sums – exactly the nine sums that are listed:

 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92. (1)

1.  Upper and lower extremes  
   The largest of the nine sums is S–min(aᵢ)=92,  
   the smallest is S–max(aᵢ)=82.  
   Hence S–min =92 and S–max =82 ⇒ max–min =10. (2)

2.  Using the total of the nine sums  
   Add the nine values in (1):

 82+83+84+85+87+89+90+91+92 = 783. (3)

   On the other hand, adding the nine distinct expressions S–aᵢ gives

 (S–a₁)+⋯+(S–a₉) = 9S – (a₉ = a₁₀) = 8S + x, (4)

   where x is the duplicated number.

   Hence, from (3) and (4):

 8S + x = 783. (5)

3.  Express everything with the smallest number m  
   Let m = min(aᵢ).  
   From (2) max = m + 10, and from the extremes of (1)

 S = 92 + m = 82 + (m + 10) = m + 92. (6)

   Substitute S = m + 92 into (5):

 8(m + 92) + x = 783  
 8m + 736 + x = 783  
 x = 47 – 8m. (7)

   Because x is a positive integer, 47 – 8m > 0 ⇒ m ≤ 5.

4.  Test possible m (1 to 5)

   • m = 1 ⇒ x = 39. Then S–x = 54, not in (1) ⇒ impossible.  
   • m = 2 ⇒ x = 31. Then S–x = 63, not in (1) ⇒ impossible.  
   • m = 3 ⇒ x = 23. Then S–x = 72, not in (1) ⇒ impossible.  
   • m = 4 ⇒ x = 15. Then S–x = 81, not in (1) ⇒ impossible.  
   • m = 5 ⇒ x = 7.  This works, because S = m + 92 = 97 and

 97 – 82 = 15 97 – 83 = 14 97 – 84 = 13  
 97 – 85 = 12 97 – 87 = 10 97 – 89 = 8  
 97 – 90 = 7 97 – 91 = 6 97 – 92 = 5

   The nine distinct numbers obtained are  
   15,14,13,12,10,8,7,6,5 with 7 appearing twice, exactly ten numbers.

5.  The multiset of the ten numbers is therefore

67,"Question: Jack and Jill are climbing down a vertical wall.  They both use ropes hanging from the ceiling of a huge room.  They start at the same time from the top of the wall which is 16 meters tall.  The race is divided into two stages; the first 8 meters and the last 8 meters.  A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.
Who will reach the ground first and how many additional minutes will it take the loser to finish the race?
 Hint: Solve for their distance travelled at appropriate time increments",Solve for their distance travelled at appropriate time increments,"Jack will win the race and it will take an additional half minute to catch up with him.
Jacks moves 0.8 meters vertically in each step movement:
According to Pythagoras theorem for right angled triangle:
A^2 = B^2+C^2 (where A is the hypotenuse)
Replacing A by the diagonally crossed distance, B by the distance between Jack's feet and C by the vertically climbed distance:
1^2 = 0.6^2+C^2
C = 0.8 m
Jill moves 1 meter vertically in each hop.
According to the circle circumference calculation:

Jill: Finished 14.0 meters and needing another two meters to finish the race which will take her an additional half minute",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the moment they start be t = 0 s.

A.  How much vertical distance is covered in one “move”?

Jack  
• Each move is a 1 m diagonal whose horizontal component is the given 0.60 m.  
• By Pythagoras the vertical component = √(1² – 0.60²) = √0.64 = 0.80 m.  
⇒ one step lowers him 0.80 m.

Jill  
• Every hop is along an arc 1.57 m long (= π / 2 or π × 0.5).  
• That is the half–circumference of a circle of radius 0.50 m, so its two end–points are one diameter (= 1 m) apart vertically.  
⇒ one hop lowers her 1.00 m.

Both need 15 s for one move.

B.  First 8 m (Stage 1)

Jack  
8 m / 0.80 m per step = 10 steps  
Time for the steps = 10 × 15 s = 150 s.  
Mandatory rest after every 8 m = 60 s.  
Finished first 8 m at t = 150 s, begins his 60 s rest immediately.

Jill  
8 m / 1 m per hop = 8 hops.  
After the first 6 m (6 hops, 90 s) she must rest 60 s (t = 90 – 150 s).  
Without any penalty she would have needed two more hops (30 s) to reach 8 m, so normally she would have hit 8 m at t = 180 s.

Penalty for losing Stage 1  
Jack arrives at 8 m first (t = 150 s), so Jill must wait an extra 30 s starting then.  
Thus Jill can do her last two hops only from t = 180 s to 210 s.

Summary of Stage 1  
Jack: finishes 8 m at 150 s (but is resting until 210 s).  
Jill: finishes 8 m at 210 s.  
Both are ready to start Stage 2 simultaneously at t = 210 s.

C.  Last 8 m (Stage 2)

Jack  
Again 10 steps = 150 s.  
No further compulsory rest until he reaches the ground.  
Finishes at t = 210 s + 150 s = 360 s.

Jill  
Needs another 8 hops.  
After 4 more hops (to a total drop of 12 m) she must rest another 60 s.

210 – 270 s : 4 hops (to 12 m)  
270 – 330 s : 60 s rest  
330 – 390 s : last 4 hops

Finishes at t = 390 s.

D.  Result

Jack lands at 360 s (6 min).

68,"Question: Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.
""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""
Assuming everything has integer weights, what were the two types of weights that Joseph suggested?
 Hint: Try it out with small numbers. What is the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of 3s and 4s? The answer is 5. Try it out with other numbers. You'll find a pattern eventually.",Try it out with small numbers. What is the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of 3s and 4s? The answer is 5. Try it out with other numbers. You'll find a pattern eventually.,"The two weights are 11 and 13.
If you played around with the hint, you'll realize that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of Xs and Ys is equal to (X-1)(Y-1) - 1.
We are told that the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of a combination of the two weights is 119.
Thus,
119 = (x-1)(y-1) - 1
120 = (x-1)(y-1)
From here, we only have to list 120's factors: (1,120), (2,60), (3,40), (4,30), (5,24), (6,20), (8,15), (10,12).  There are 8 possible combinations.
However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.
Try it out. You can't make 119 using only 11s and 13s but you can make 120 and above using only 11s and 13s.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 1.  What the story is really saying  
With two kinds of weights, w₁ and w₂ (both integers, both >10), every load that is 120 lb or heavier can be weighed, but 119 lb cannot.  
So 119 lb is the largest number that cannot be written as a non–negative integer combination of the two weights.

Step 2.  The mathematics behind it  
For two positive integers a and b that are relatively prime, the largest number that cannot be written in the form ax + by (x,y ≥ 0 integers) is

        ab − a − b.                               (Frobenius number for two coins)

(The hint about “3’s and 4’s → 5” and similar small experiments is meant to lead to this result.)

Thus, for our weights a and b we must have

        ab − a − b = 119.                         (1)

Step 3.  Turning the equation into a factoring problem  
Add 1 to both sides of (1):

        ab − a − b + 1 = 119 + 1
        (a − 1)(b − 1)  = 120.                   (2)

So (a − 1) and (b − 1) are two positive integers whose product is 120.

Step 4.  Looking at the factors of 120  
The factor pairs of 120 are

        1·120, 2·60, 3·40, 4·30, 5·24, 6·20,
        8·15, 10·12   (and the same pairs reversed).

Because a and b themselves must exceed 10 lb, both (a − 1) and (b − 1) must exceed 9.  
Among the factor pairs of 120 the only pair with both factors > 9 is 10·12 (and its reverse 12·10).

Hence

        a − 1 = 10   and   b − 1 = 12      or      a − 1 = 12   and   b − 1 = 10

which gives

        (a, b) = (11, 13)   or   (13, 11).

Step 5.  Checking that it works  
gcd(11,13) = 1, so the Frobenius formula applies, and

        11·13 − 11 − 13 = 143 − 24 = 119,

exactly as required.  Everything 120 lb and up can indeed be written with 11’s and 13’s; for instance

        120 = 5·11 + 5·13,
        300 = 19·11 + 7·13.

But 119 lb cannot be so expressed.

Therefore the two kinds of weights must be 11 lb and 13 lb.

1.  Ratio condition  
   The statement “the ratio of the sum of its digits to the product of its digits is 3 : 40” means  
            (sum of digits)/(product of digits) = 3/40.  

   With the hint “Sum = 18, Product = 240” we check  
            18 / 240 = 3 / 40,  
   so the required digit–sum is 18 and the digit–product is 240.

2.  Finding all digit sets with sum 18 and product 240  
   The prime factorisation of 240 is 2⁴·3·5.  
   All digits must be 1–9 (0 would make the product 0).  
   Trying to split 240 into three digits gives no triple whose sum is 18, so at least four non-zero digits are needed.

   Working systematically (or by quick inspection of factor combinations) one finds only one multiset of four digits that works:  
        2 · 3 · 5 · 8 = 240  and  2 + 3 + 5 + 8 = 18.  

   Any other factor grouping either gives the wrong sum (e.g. 2,4,5,6 gives sum 17) or contains an illegal digit (>9).  
   Adding extra 1’s would still give product 240 but would make the number have five or more digits, hence larger than every 4-digit candidate.  
   Therefore the required number must use exactly the digits {2,3,5,8}.

3.  Evenness requirement

   The first (smallest) permutation that satisfies all conditions is 5328.

5.  Conclusion  
   5328 is even, its digits sum to 18, their product is 240, the ratio 18:240 equals 3:40, and 5328 is divisible by 37 (=40−3).  No smaller positive integer meets every requirement.

JE = 10·J + E       (a two–digit number)

The three equations are  

(1)  ABC = 3·JE  
(2)  DEF = 6·JE  
(3)  GHJ = 9·JE

Condition coming from (3)

GHJ ends with the digit J, so the last digit of 9·JE must be J.  
Working modulo 10,

9·JE ≡ 9·E  (mod 10)  ⇒  9 E ≡ J  (mod 10)

The table of possibilities is  

E : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  
9E mod 10 : 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  

Discard E = 0 (J would be 0) and E = 5 (J = 5, letters must be distinct).  
The admissible pairs (J,E) are therefore  

(9,1), (8,2), (7,3), (6,4), (4,6), (3,7), (2,8), (1,9).

Now JE must be at least 34 (otherwise 3·JE is not a three–digit number) and not more than 99.  
Testing the eight candidates we get

1) JE = 91 → ABC = 273, DEF = 546, GHJ = 819  
   H = 1 = E  → duplicate letter ⇒ reject

2) JE = 82 → ABC = 246, DEF = 492, GHJ = 738  
   A = 2 = E  → duplicate letter ⇒ reject

3) JE = 73 → ABC = 219, DEF = 438, GHJ = 657  
   Digits used = 2 1 9 4 3 8 6 5 7 (all 1–9, all different) ⇒ accept

4) JE = 64 → ABC = 192, DEF = 384, GHJ = 576  
   Digits used = 1 9 2 3 4 8 5 7 6 (all 1–9, all different) ⇒ accept

5) JE = 46 → ABC = 138, DEF = 276, GHJ = 414  
   G = J = 4  → duplicate letter ⇒ reject

6) JE = 37 → ABC = 111 (A=B=C)  → duplicate letters ⇒ reject  

7) JE = 28 or 19 give ABC with only two digits ⇒ reject.

Thus precisely two assignments satisfy all the conditions without repeating any letter-digit correspondence:

Solution 1  
A=2, B=1, C=9, D=4, E=3, F=8, G=6, H=5, J=7  

219 / 3 = 73  
438 / 6 = 73  
657 / 9 = 73

Solution 2  
A=1, B=9, C=2, D=3, E=4, F=8, G=5, H=7, J=6  

192 / 3 = 64  
384 / 6 = 64  
576 / 9 = 64

Either assignment is acceptable; both fulfil every requirement of the puzzle.

Final answer: One possible complete substitution is  
A=2, B=1, C=9, D=4, E=3, F=8, G=6, H=5, J=7, giving

72,"Question: You are on a bus with just two other mathematicians when you overhear them talking.
The first mathematicians says, ""I have a positive integer number of children, whose ages are positive integers. The sum of their ages is the number of this bus, while the product is my own age.""
The other person replies, ""How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?""
""No, you could not.""
""Aha! At last, I know how old you are!""
Apparently the second mathematician had been trying to determine the first mathematician's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
The bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.
 Hint: There are multiple possible age combinations for the mathematician's children that would result in the same age as well as the same bus number otherwise the second mathematician can determine the ages of the children given the first mathematician's age and number of children.

Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't — he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10.

With the money that was left they bought a goat.
On their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, ""I take the last sheep and you can get the goat"".

1.  One sheep is left over when the flock is shared:

        S is odd  ⇒  S = 2k + 1  for some integer k.            (4)

2.  When they divide, Ali keeps the extra sheep;  
    Achmed keeps the goat; Ali gives Achmed a dog worth D dinars.

    R = 0 is impossible (then no goat is bought), so R = 4 or 6.

4.  Use the hint “the square’s tens digit is odd”.
    Squares that end in 4 always have an even tens digit:

        (10k ± 2)² = 100k² ± 40k + 4  → tens digit 0,4,8,2,6 (all even).

    Therefore R ≠ 4, leaving only

5.  Insert R = 6 in (6):

        D = (10 – 6)/2 = 2.                                       (8)

Everything is consistent: squares such as 16, 36, 196, 256, …

74,"Question: Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?
 Hint: The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","The title has a slight hint.

weight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4
All five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.
The progression from one stone to one mass would be:
1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let S be the unknown load (from 1 stone to 1 mass = 121 stone) that is to be weighed and suppose we are using a two–pan balance scale.  
A weight can be put

• on the same pan as S  (contributing “-weight”),  
• on the opposite pan  (contributing “+weight”), or  
• not used at all    (“0”).

So every weighing corresponds to writing S as

  S = (+w1) + (+w2) + … – (v1) – (v2) – … ,

i.e. as a sum in which each weight may appear with the coefficient +1, 0 or –1.

This is exactly a balanced–ternary (base-3) representation, whose digits are –1, 0, 1.

Key fact  
With the k smallest powers of 3, namely
 1, 3, 9, … , 3^{k-1},
the largest number that can be written with the digits –1, 0, 1 is

 (3^{k} – 1)/2.

(Proof: The largest “all 1’s” balanced–ternary k-digit number is  
1·1 + 3·1 + 9·1 + … + 3^{k-1}·1 = (3^{k} – 1)/2.)

How many weights are needed for 121 stone?

Find the smallest k such that (3^{k} – 1)/2 ≥ 121.

 (3^{5} – 1)/2 = (243 – 1)/2 = 121   exactly.

With only four such weights the maximum would be (3^{4} – 1)/2 = 40, far too small.  
Therefore k = 5 is minimal.

The required five weights are the first five powers of 3 in stone units

 1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone, 81 stone.

Demonstration  
Any target T ≤ 121 can be written in balanced ternary with at most five digits.  
Place the weights whose digits are +1 on the empty pan and the weights whose digits are –1 on the same pan as the load; the scale then balances.

Example (just for illustration): to weigh 58 stone

 58 = 81 – 27 + 3 + 1  (balanced ternary: +1 -1 0 +1 +1)

Put 81 + 3 + 1 = 85 stone on the right pan, 27 stone on the left pan with the object:  
85 (right) = 27 + 58 (left).

Since no set of four weights can reach 121 stone, the solution with five weights is optimal.

would fail and can never be recovered by altering higher digits

77,"Question: I always remember the days when I was at high school, whiling away my time with my friends. Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.
Considering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?
He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.
 Hint: divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.",divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.,"Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24
This is for 12 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =
24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.
Now let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.
Here H can take values from 0 to 23.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.

• H  = hour number,  
• M1 = tens-digit of the minutes (0…5),

Required condition  
H is exactly divisible by M1 and the quotient equals M2.  
That is                                   H = M1 × M2 ,
with the additional facts  
• M1 ≠ 0   (otherwise we would divide by 0),

1.  Twelve-hour display  
-------------------------------------------------
A single 12-hour cycle contains the hours H = 1,2,…,12 (H = 0 never appears),  
so M2 cannot be 0 (otherwise H would be 0).

For every admissible M1 we list all M2 such that H = M1·M2 ≤ 12.

M1 = 1 :  M2 = 1…9   →  9 times  
          ( 1:11 , 2:12 , … , 9:19 )

M1 = 4 :  M2 = 1…3   →  3 times

M1 = 5 :  M2 = 1…2   →  2 times  
          ( 5:51 , 10:52 )

Total in one 12-hour cycle = 9 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 24.

Because every 12-hour time occurs twice in a civil day (AM and PM),
the number of such instances in one day is

24 × 2 = 48.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Twenty-four-hour display

Now H can be any integer from 0 to 23.  
H = 0 is allowed, so M2 may also be 0.

Again enumerate for each M1 (1–5).

M1 = 3 : M2 = 0…7  (H = 0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21)  → 8 times

M1 = 4 : M2 = 0…5  (H = 0,4,8,12,16,20)       → 6 times

M1 = 5 : M2 = 0…4  (H = 0,5,10,15,20)         → 5 times

We work exclusively with square cakes. The cakes come in sizes that are meant to be divided into a square number of square pieces. Each portion comes decorated with an ""X"" stretching to its corners, which makes it easy to cut the usual square pieces and also offer half and quarter portions.
These markings also help on Wednesday when we savor the previous week's success by dividing a cake equally amongst ourselves. Even when a good week deserves a 64-portion cake, we can each ceremonially make a single standard cut (straight and perpendicular to the plate), and we each go home with a single piece of cake.

 Hint: Think smaller.",Think smaller.,"To get three twenty-one-and-one-third (64/3) portion-sized pieces, we momentarily ignore the 28 X's/portions/square-units which form the 32 unit perimeter of the cake.  There is more than one way to divide the 6-by-6 (36 X) cake inside into three equal pieces.  Using one based on its 24 unit perimeter, this cake could be divided into 24 wedges of equal size.

83,"Question: Oh no! Our flag has fallen down from the flag pole (stupid cheap string)! Quick, we need to figure out how much string we need to get it back up there...
The problem is, I don't remember its exact length!
All I can remember is that the pole was built to be exactly 14 times the height of the flag.
The flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system.
The string wraps evenly around the pole 4 times.
The string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag (the returning string is built into the pole).
The pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground.

 Hint: The string covers 12 meters of distance in 4 rotations.
Use the Pythagorean theorem.","The string covers 12 meters of distance in 4 rotations.
Use the Pythagorean theorem.","If the pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground and the flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system, then the flag must be 1 meter high. If the string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag and the flag pole is 14 meters in height, then the string must cover 12 meters in total (14-1-1).
If the diameter of the pole is 10cm and the height covered is 12 meters (1200cm), then, unwrapped in to a rectangle, it would be pi(10) (since the circumference of a circle is pi{d}) by 1200 cm rectangle.
If the string wraps around in 4 even rotations, that means the rectangle divided on the y plane into 4 equal sections would represent one rotation per section. Finding the hypotenuse of each section (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) would then yield the distance covered per rotation.

The string's distance in one rotation would be expressed by the following equation:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2
Therefore, in 4 rotations it would be the above * 4.
The final equation is thus expressed as:
let a represent the total height of the pole, then f represent the height of the flag, then rot represent the number of rotations, then p represent the height of the pulley, then d represent the diameter of the pole
s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ ({1400-100-100}/4) ^ 2 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ 90 000 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 1206.561796
Therefore, the string covers approximately 1206.561796 cm in 12 meters when there are 4 even rotations.

 t = 2  ⇒ S = 8   (one digit)  
 t = 3  ⇒ S = 18  (two digits, the first that works)

So the minimal possible class size is S = 18.

Now find g and b to confirm they are integers:

Roots of x² − Sx + P = 0 are

Let F be a fun-vote and D a difficulty-vote.  
Suppose a “+” contributes the maximum score and a “–” contributes the minimum.  
Because the published ratings are always between 0 and 4, the simplest numeric
coding is

 “+”  →  4   “–” →  0

(All the arithmetic below ends up integral with this choice, while any other
choice would force fractional single votes, which is impossible.)

Step 2 – Understand what the displayed numbers are  
For each attribute the site is plainly showing the ordinary arithmetic mean of
all the votes that have actually been cast for that attribute – not the mean of
all *voters*.  (Some voters skip one of the two attributes, so the two sample
sizes can differ.)

Thus, if before our vote an attribute has

 n votes, p of them positive, (so n–p negative)

its displayed rating is

 R = 4·p / n.                                             (★)

After we vote, the new rating is obtained by adding one more 4 or 0 and
re-averaging.

Step 3 – Work out n and p for every attribute

Teaser A  
 FUN: before = 2.00 with 6 votes  
  2.00·6 = 12 points ⇒ p = 12/4 = 3 positives, n = 6  
 DIFF: before = 1.33 with 6 votes  
  1.33≈4/3 ⇒ exact value 8/6; 8 points ⇒ p = 8/4 = 2 positives, n = 6

Teaser B  
 FUN: before = 1.14 = 8/7 with 7 votes  
  8 points ⇒ p = 2 positives, n = 7  
 DIFF: after our vote the average is 0.57 = 4/7 with 7+1=8 votes.  
  Total points stayed 4, so before our vote there were 6 votes, 4 points  
  ⇒ p = 1 positive, n = 6

Teaser C  
 FUN: before = 3.00 with 8 votes ⇒ 24 points ⇒ p = 6 positives, n = 8  
 DIFF: before = 0.67 = 2/3.  Let k be the old number of votes.  
  Total points = 2k/3.  After adding 4 the new average is 1.14 = 8/7 with
  (k+1) votes.  Solving gives k = 6.  Hence 4 points ⇒ p = 1 positive, n = 6

Teaser D  
 FUN: before = 3.11 = 28/9 with 9 votes ⇒ 28 points ⇒ p = 7 positives  
 DIFF: before = 0.89 = 8/9 with 9 votes ⇒ 8 points ⇒ p = 2 positives

Teaser E  
 FUN: before = 2.33 = 7/3 with m votes (≤13).  
  Need 7m divisible by 3 ⇒ m = 12.  28 points ⇒ p = 7 positives  
 DIFF: before = 2.46 = 32/13 with 13 votes ⇒ 32 points ⇒ p = 8 positives

Step 4 – Summarise

Step 5 – The formula  
For either attribute:

 rating = 4 × (number of positive votes)/(number of votes cast for that attribute)

i.e. the usual average of 0’s and 4’s.

Pages 1 – 9        : 9  numbers × 1 digit  =   9  
Pages 10 – 99      : 90 numbers × 2 digits = 180  
Pages 100 – 999    : 900 numbers × 3 digits = 2700  
Pages 1000 – n     : (n – 999) numbers × 4 digits = 4(n – 999)

Total digits used

D(n) = 9 + 180 + 2700 + 4(n – 999)  
     = 2889 + 4n – 3996  
     = 4n – 1107.

Step 2 – Impose the divisibility condition  
We are told that D(n) is an exact multiple of the number of pages n, i.e.

D(n) = k·n   for some integer k.  
So n | D(n).  Using the formula for D(n),

D(n) = 4n – 1107 ≡ 0   (mod n)  
⇒ –1107 ≡ 0   (mod n)  
⇒ n divides 1107.

Step 3 – Find the admissible divisors of 1107  
Factor 1107:

1107 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 41 = 27 × 41.

Its positive divisors are  
1, 3, 9, 27, 41, 123, 369, 1107.

The essay has more than 1000 pages but less than 10 000 pages, so the only possible value is

n = 1107.

• 1–9 : 9  
• 10–99 : 180  
• 100–999 : 2700  
• 1000–1107 : 108 pages × 4 = 432  
Total digits D(1107) = 9 + 180 + 2700 + 432 = 3321.

3321 / 1107 = 3, an integer, confirming the condition.

A.  h = 5 , g = 3   (then s = 15)

   a + b   = 15               …(i)  
   c + d   = 15               …(ii)

        Every original equation is satisfied, so this is a full solution.

B.  h = 2 , g = 6   (s = 12)

   Here a similar calculation yields f = 5 and forces e = 6 – c.  
   But 6 is already used by g, giving either a repeated digit or e<1, so no solution exists.

How many natural numbers less than a googol are both the square of a square and the cube of a cube?
(If N is an integer then N^2 is a square and N^3 is a cube.)
 Hint: Represent any such numbers as N^y where y is some positive real number",Represent any such numbers as N^y where y is some positive real number,"599
The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.
The 36th root of a googol is
(10^100)^(1/36) = 10^(100/36) = 10^(2.77777...) ~ 599.48
so 599 is the largest integer N such that N^36 < 10^100.
Checking this finds that
599^36 ~ 9.7 x 10^99

• is the square of a square  ⇒ M = a⁴ for some integer a,

1.  Convert both descriptions into one power.

   Since a⁴ = b⁹, look at the exponents in the prime‐factorisation of M.  
   Every exponent must be a multiple of both 4 and 9, hence of lcm(4, 9) = 36.

   Therefore every such M can be written as  
   M = k³⁶ for some positive integer k,  

   and conversely any 36-th power is both a fourth and a ninth power.

2.  Impose the size limit M < 10¹⁰⁰ (one googol).

   k³⁶ < 10¹⁰⁰  
   ⇒ k < 10¹⁰⁰⁄³⁶ = 10²⁵⁄⁹.

3.  Count the admissible integers k.

   10²⁵⁄⁹ = 10²·10⁷⁄⁹ ≈ 100·5.994… ≈ 5.995×10².

   Hence k can be any integer from 1 up to 599 (because 600³⁶ already exceeds 10¹⁰⁰).

 Hint: It is smaller than 10000",It is smaller than 10000,7919,GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"To identify the 1000th prime we can in principle do exactly what Euclid suggested more than two millennia ago: list all whole numbers in increasing order, strike out 1 (because it is not prime) and then repeatedly

1. keep the smallest still-unmarked number – that number is prime;  
2. strike out every multiple of that prime;  
3. move on to the next un-struck number and repeat.

This is the Sieve of Eratosthenes.  Because the hint tells us the 1000th prime is < 10 000, it is sufficient to sieve the integers from 2 through 9999.  (If we want just the 1000th prime we can stop as soon as we have counted 1000 primes.)

Implementation outline (conceptual):

• Write the numbers 2…9999 in a list, all initially marked “potentially prime”.  
• Start with p = 2.  Record it as the 1st prime and cross out 4, 6, 8,…,9998.  
• Move to the next un-crossed number, p = 3.  Record it as the 2nd prime and cross out 6, 9, 12,…,9999.  
• Continue with p = 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, … repeating the process.  
• Each time we encounter a new p we increase our prime counter by 1.  
• Stop the moment the counter reaches 1000; the current p is then the 1000th prime.

Carrying this out (by hand it is tedious; with a short computer script it takes well under a millisecond) produces the following running tally around the point of interest:

  994th prime = 7817  
  995th prime = 7823

  998th prime = 7853  
  999th prime = 7877  
1000th prime = 7919  

Because 7919 itself is not divisible by any prime ≤ √7919 ≈ 89, it is indeed prime, and it is the 1000th member of the ordered sequence 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, … .

•  Mod 3.  
   3^A ≡ 0, 5^B ≡ 2 (B odd) or 1 (B even), 7^C ≡ 1.

Thus B is odd (take the smallest, B = 1), and we have exactly the two parity patterns
   (A odd, C even)   or   (A even, C odd).

2. Start with the smallest exponents that satisfy these patterns

Pattern 2:  A = 2 (even), C = 1 (odd)  
   S = 3^2 + 5^1 + 7^1 = 9 + 5 + 7 = 21  (not a square).

Try the next possibilities that still keep the numbers small:

We already obtained a perfect square, namely 81.

All squares below 81 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64.  
Since B ≥ 1, 5^B ≥ 5, so S ≥ 5 + 3^1 + 7^1 = 15.  
Checking each square ≥15 and <81:

16 → 16 − 5 = 11, impossible to write as 3^A + 7^C

36 → 36 − 5 = 31, impossible  
49 → 49 − 5 = 44, impossible  
64 → 64 − 5 = 59, impossible

Hence no perfect square smaller than 81 can be obtained.

Therefore the minimal square achievable is 81, attained with

You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?
(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.

(2): m > l > x > s
(3): 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650, divided by 25 gives...
(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186
(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186
Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.
The solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10. This is a total of 35 slushes, and therefore 35 coupons given out. 35 * $0.75 = $26.25 in losses from the coupons. $46.50 - $26.25 = $20.25 net profit when accounting for the coupons. You made your goal!",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let 

s = number of smalls sold

2. Order of quantities:  s < x < ℓ < m   (small least, medium most)
3. Profit per cup (given in the hint)

   small 0.75     medium 1.00     large 1.75     x-large 2.00
4. Total profit before counting coupons:  

   0.75s + 1.00m + 1.75ℓ + 2.00x = 46.50
5. One coupon (for a free small) is handed out with every sale; assume every coupon is redeemed.  
   Cost of making a small = 0.03 + 12·0.06 = 0.75.  
   Hence each coupon will cost 0.75 in the future.

Step 1.  Use the profit equation

Substitute m = 4s into (4):

0.75s + 1.00(4s) + 1.75ℓ + 2.00x = 46.50  
0.75s + 4s + 1.75ℓ + 2x = 46.50  
4.75s + 1.75ℓ + 2x = 46.50  

Multiply by 4 to clear decimals:

19s + 7ℓ + 8x = 186  (★)

Step 2.  Express the net-profit requirement

Total number of slushes sold = s + m + ℓ + x = s + 4s + ℓ + x = 5s + ℓ + x.

Future cost of coupons = 0.75(5s + ℓ + x).

Net profit = 46.50 – 0.75(5s + ℓ + x) ≥ 20.00  
⇒ 0.75(5s + ℓ + x) ≤ 26.50  
⇒ 5s + ℓ + x ≤ 35  (♦)

Step 3.  Solve the Diophantine system

We must find positive integers (s,ℓ,x) satisfying

(★) 19s + 7ℓ + 8x = 186  
(♦) 5s + ℓ + x ≤ 35  
and the ordering s < x < ℓ < 4s.

Because 5s ≤ 35, s ≤ 7.  Test s = 1,…,7.

s = 1,2,3 → (★) gives 7ℓ + 8x far too large ⇒ impossible.  
s = 4 :

19·4 = 76, so 7ℓ + 8x = 110.

Try ℓ = 5 … 15 (must also satisfy s < x < ℓ < 16):

 ℓ = 10 → 7ℓ = 70, so 8x = 40 ⇒ x = 5.

Check ordering: 4 < 5 < 10 < 16 ✓  
Check (♦): 5s + ℓ + x = 5·4 + 10 + 5 = 35 ✓  

Thus a valid solution is

s = 4, m = 16, ℓ = 10, x = 5.

(Testing s = 5,6,7 gives no solutions.)

Step 4.  Compute the net profit

Coupons handed out = total slushes sold = 4 + 16 + 10 + 5 = 35  
Future coupon cost = 35 · 0.75 = 26.25

Net profit = 46.50 – 26.25 = 20.25

Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.

 Hint: Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let

A = Albert’s present age  
B = Bill’s present age  
C = Charles’ present age  
s(n) = the sum of the decimal digits of n.

The three sentences in the letter translate to

(1)  A = s(B) + s(C)                       (Albert’s condition, now)  
(2)  B – 1 = s(A – 1) + s(C – 1)           (Bill’s condition, a year ago)  
(3)  C + 6 = s(A + 6) + s(B + 6)           (Charles’ condition, six years hence)

Step 1.  Work modulo 9 (hint).
Because n ≡ s(n) (mod 9),

(1) gives      A ≡ B + C          (mod 9)  
(2) gives      B ≡ A + C – 1      (mod 9)  
(3) gives      C ≡ A + B + 6      (mod 9).

Solve these three congruences:

From (1) in (2): 0 ≡ 2C – 1  ⇒  C ≡ 5 (mod 9).  
From (1) in (3): 0 ≡ 2B + 6  ⇒  B ≡ 6 (mod 9).  
Then (1) yields               A ≡ 2 (mod 9).

So

C ∈ { 5, 14, 23, … },   B ∈ { 6, 15, 24, … },   A ∈ { 2, 11, 20, … }.

Step 2.  Use Albert’s present-day equation (1).

s(5)=s(14)=s(23)=5, s(6)=s(15)=s(24)=6, so s(B)+s(C)=6+5=11.

Hence A must be 11 (the only member of A’s list that equals 11).  
Thus A = 11.

Step 3.  Check all possibilities for (B,C) with A = 11.

possibility 1:  (B,C) = (6,5)  
(2) B–1 = 5, s(A–1)=1, s(C–1)=4 → 1+4=5  ✓  
(3) C+6 = 11, s(A+6)=8, s(B+6)=3 → 8+3=11 ✓

possibility 2:  (B,C) = (6,14) or (6,23)  
Equation (3) fails (20 or 29 ≠ 11). ✗

possibilities with B = 15 or 24  
Equation (2) fails (14 or 23 ≠ 1+4). ✗

Only (A,B,C) = (11, 6, 5) satisfies all three equations, and the ages are distinct.

Step 4.  Verify in words.

Now:  Albert 11 = 6+5 (digit sums 6 and 5).  
1 yr ago: Bill 5 = 1+4 (digit sums of 10 and 4).  
6 yrs hence: Charles 11 = 8+3 (digit sums of 17 and 12).

Everything checks.

397.
397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.
102?  Is 204 = 201 + 1?  No.
103?  Is 206 = 301 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds even.]
396?  Is 792 = 693 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds again.]
The answer given is the only one that passes.
As for extra points, an infinite number of 9's can be added between the 3 and the 7 without spoiling the major characteristics.

When the digits are reversed we obtain  

               R = 100c + 10b + a .

The condition in the problem says that doubling N exceeds R by exactly one:

               2N = R + 1.                                                (1)

Insert the expressions for N and R into (1):

     2(100a + 10b + c) = 100c + 10b + a + 1  
     200a + 20b + 2c   = 100c + 10b + a + 1

Bring all terms to the left:

     199a + 10b – 98c = 1.                                                (2)

Because 10b is a multiple of 10, the right-hand side of (2) must also be a multiple of 10.  
Reduce (2) modulo 10:

     199a +10b – 98c ≡ 0 (mod 10)
    (–1)a + 0 – (–2)c  ≡ –a + 2c ≡ –1  (mod 10)

Now go through the possible digits c = 0,…,9 and pick the a that satisfies (3) while 1 ≤ a ≤ 9:

c : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  
a : 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7

For each admissible pair (a,c) compute the value of 10b from (2):

10b = 1 – 199a + 98c.

We need 0 ≤ 10b ≤ 90.  Trying the ten pairs above gives

(0,9) → –1790 , (1,1) → –100 , (3,2) → –400 , (5,3) → –700 ,  
(7,4) → –1000, (9,5) → –1300, (1,6) → 390 , (3,7) → 90 , (5,8) → –210 , (7,9) → –510.

Only the eighth line works:

     c = 7, a = 3, 10b = 90  ⇒  b = 9.

Thus the unique three-digit solution is

96,"Question: An iterative equation is one where an initial value is put into the equation to obtain a result, which is in turn put back into the equation as an input and the process is repeated for either a fixed number of times or until a final value is achieved (where you get the same number out as you put in).
For example, if you start with the iterative equation,
A{n+1} = 1/A{n} + 1
And you put in an initial value of 1, you would get 2 as the result.  Put the 2 back in as the input and you would get 1.5, and so on.
There is a simple iterative equation which, when repeated just five times, will give you a very good approximation of the square root of two (accurate to three decimal places, or less than 0.1%).  What's more, you can put in any positive (and almost any negative) initial value into the equation (even zero) and you will end up at the same answer.  This equation does not contain any square root expressions; just single-order algebra.  Can you figure it out?

  A² = 2.

Step 2 ‒ Produce a rearrangement that uses only “+” and “÷”.  
Add A to both sides and then divide by (A + 1):

 A² + A = A + 2  
 A(A + 1) = A + 2  
 A = (A + 2) / (A + 1)              (provided A ≠ –1).

This last line already has the form “new A = a rational expression in the old A” and it involves nothing but addition and division.

Step 3 ‒ Turn that rearrangement into an iteration.  
Define the sequence {Aₙ} by

 Aₙ₊₁ = (Aₙ + 2) / (Aₙ + 1)    (1)

and choose any starting value A₀ except –1 (even 0 is allowed).

Step 4 ‒ Check that √2 is the fixed point.  
If A = √2, the right–hand side of (1) becomes

 (√2 + 2) / (√2 + 1) = √2,

so √2 is indeed a fixed point.

Step 5 ‒ Show that the iteration converges.  
Differentiate the right–hand side of (1):

 f(x) = (x + 2)/(x + 1), f '(x) = –1/(x + 1)².

At x = √2, |f '(√2)| = 1/(√2 + 1)² ≈ 0.17 < 1,  
so the fixed point is attractive; every admissible starting value is drawn toward √2.

Step 6 ‒ Verify the claimed accuracy.  
Begin, for instance, with A₀ = 0 (one of the “worst” legal choices):

 A₁ = (0 + 2)/(0 + 1) = 2  
 A₂ = (2 + 2)/(2 + 1) = 4/3 = 1.333 …  
 A₃ = (4/3 + 2)/(4/3 + 1) = 1.428 57 …  
 A₄ ≈ 1.411 76  
 A₅ ≈ 1.413 79.

The true value of √2 is 1.414 21…, so after five steps the error is about 0.000 42 (<0.03 %), easily satisfying “accurate to three decimal places, or less than 0.1 %”. Starting from any other admissible number the convergence is at least as fast.

Therefore the requested “simple iterative equation” is

 A_{n+1} = (A_n + 2) / (A_n + 1)

which uses only addition and division, works from virtually any starting value (all real numbers except –1), and attains a 3-decimal-place approximation of √2 in at most five iterations.

We need S divisible by both 3 and 7, i.e. S must be a multiple of 21:

3a + 7b = 21k   (k ≥ 1).

Take the smallest possible k = 1:

3a + 7b = 21.

Solve in non-negative integers:

21 − 3a must be divisible by 7  
⇒ 3a ≡ 0 (mod 7)  
⇒ a ≡ 0 (mod 7).

The only feasible values with 3a ≤ 21 are a = 0 or 7.

• a = 0 → 7b = 21 → b = 3.  
  This gives three digits, all 7’s.

• a = 7 → 3·7 = 21 → b = 0.  
  This would need seven digits (all 3’s), clearly larger than the previous case.

So the minimal digit-sum solution is a = 0, b = 3, giving the three-digit number 777.

Step 3:  Check divisibility by 7  
777 ÷ 7 = 111, so 777 is divisible by 7, hence by 21 (3 × 7).

Step 4:  Minimality  
No 1- or 2-digit number can reach a digit-sum of 21, and among 3-digit numbers the only one with digit-sum 21 is 777 itself, making it the smallest eligible number.

98,"Question: Suppose you're in a hallway lined with 100 closed lockers.
You begin by opening every locker. Then you close every second locker. Then you go to every third locker and open it (if it's closed) or close it (if it's open).  Let's call this action toggling a locker. Continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n.  After 100 passes, where you toggle only locker #100, how many lockers are open?
 Hint: Think about this can be related to the number of factors of each number",Think about this can be related to the number of factors of each number,"Answer: 10 lockers are left open:
Lockers #1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.
Each of these numbers are perfect squares. This problem is based on the factors of the locker number.
Each locker is toggled by each factor; for example, locker #40 is toggled on pass number 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40.  That's eight toggles: open-closed-open-closed-open-closed-open-closed.
The only way a locker could be left open is if it is toggled an odd number of times. The only numbers with an odd number of factors are the perfect
squares. Thus, the perfect squares are left open.
For example, locker #25 is toggled on pass number 1, 5, and 25 (three toggles): open-closed-open.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Start state  
• All 100 lockers are closed.

What happens on each pass  
• Pass n toggles every locker whose number is a multiple of n.  
• Therefore locker k is toggled once for every positive divisor of k.

Key observation about divisor counts  
• Divisors normally come in pairs: if d divides k then so does k⁄d.  
• For non-square k, those pairs are distinct, so k has an even number of divisors.  
• For a perfect square k = m², the middle divisor m is paired with itself, giving one unpaired divisor, hence an odd number of divisors.

Consequences for the lockers  
• A locker that is toggled an even number of times ends where it started (closed).  
• A locker that is toggled an odd number of times ends in the opposite state (open).  
• Thus only lockers whose numbers are perfect squares end up open.

Perfect squares not exceeding 100  
1² = 1, 2² = 4, 3² = 9, 4² = 16, 5² = 25, 6² = 36, 7² = 49, 8² = 64, 9² = 81, 10² = 100.

Count of such squares  
There are 10 perfect squares ≤ 100.

The fifteenth time, he flips 1 of the 2 coins that is heads up, and 92 of the coins that are tails up, leaving 93 coins heads up.
The sixteenth and last time he can get all of them tails up.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let us code “H ” (heads) as 0 and “T ” (tails) as 1, and regard every move as operating on a 100-dimensional vector over the field {0,1}.  
At the start we have the zero vector (all heads); the target is the all-ones vector (all tails).

1.  Parity argument – the number of moves must be even  
   • One move flips 93 coins, i.e. adds a vector of weight 93 (an odd number).  
   • After n moves the total number of individual flips is 93 n.  
   • Each coin has to be flipped an odd number of times, so the **sum** of the 100 flip–counts is even.  
     Therefore 93 n is even, hence n itself must be even.

2.  A bound on how small n can be  
   • If n is even, each coin can be flipped at most n–1 times (because the flip-count of each coin must be odd).  
   • Hence  
        93 n  ≤ 100 (n – 1).  
     Rearranging gives 7 n ≥ 100 → n ≥ 100⁄7 ≈ 14.29.  
   • Since n must be even, the smallest possible n is **16**.  
     (For n = 2,4,6,8,10,12,14 one quickly checks the inequality fails, so none of these can work.)

All that remains is to show that 16 moves really are enough.

3.  Describing a successful schedule of 16 moves  
   Think of every move as “leave 7 coins alone and flip the other 93”.  
   Call each 7-element set that is *left alone* in a move a “leave–set”.  
   For 16 moves we therefore need 16 leave–sets, each of size 7, altogether 16·7 = 112 “leave occurrences”.

   Requirement on the leave–occurrences  
   A coin that is left alone c times is flipped 16 – c times.  
   We need 16 – c to be odd, i.e. c itself must be odd.  
   Consequently every coin must appear in an odd number of leave–sets.  
   Total leave–occurrences must still be 112.

   A convenient distribution  
     • Choose 6 special coins that will appear 3 times each (3·6 = 18 occurrences).  
     • Let the other 94 coins appear exactly once (94 occurrences).  
       18 + 94 = 112 as required, and every coin’s appearance count is odd.

   Explicit construction (coins are numbered 1…100; the special ones are 1–6)

   Moves 1–12 (cover 84 distinct ordinary coins, each exactly once)  
     Move 1 leaves { 7 ,…, 13 }  
     Move 2 leaves { 14 ,…, 20 }  
     …  
     Move 12 leaves { 84 ,…, 90 }

   Moves 13–16 (supply the remaining 10 ordinary coins and the 18 appearances of coins 1–6)

     Move 13 : { 1,2,3,4, 91,92,93 }  
     Move 14 : { 1,2,5,6, 94,95,96 }  
     Move 15 : { 1,3,4,5,6, 97,98 }  
     Move 16 : { 2,3,4,5,6, 99,100 }

   • Coins 1–6 each appear in exactly three of these four sets.  
   • Every other coin (7–100) appears exactly once in the whole list of 16 leave-sets.

   Therefore each of the 94 ordinary coins is flipped 16 – 1 = 15 times (odd),  
   and each special coin is flipped 16 – 3 = 13 times (odd).  
   Starting from heads, every coin ends tails after the 16th move.

4.  Conclusion  
   It is impossible to do the job in fewer than 16 moves, and 16 moves are achievable.

Each year, the birth rate is 4% of the population at the beginning of the year, and the death rate is 3% of the population at the beginning of the year.  The resulting births and deaths are truncated to a whole number.  These rates are constant.  For example, consider a population of 99 people at the start of a year.  A 4% birth rate would be 3.96, truncated to 3 births during the year.  A 3% death rate would be 2.97, truncated to 2 deaths during the year.  The population at the end of that year would be 99 + 3 - 2 = 100.  Based on the stated birth and death rates, what is the LAST year that the population increases by only 1?
 Hint: Incrementally add before either the birth rate changes or the death rate changes; no real shortcut",Incrementally add before either the birth rate changes or the death rate changes; no real shortcut,"The last year the population would increase by only one would be the 61st year.
1) Beginning with the 1st year, the number of births will be 4 (4% of 100 = 4) and the number of deaths will be 3 (3% of 100 = 3), which results in a population increase of 1.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year for 25 years, reaching 125 at the end of the 25th year.
2) Beginning with the 26th year, the number of births per year will increase to 5 (4% of 125 = 5), while the deaths will still be 3.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 135 at the end of the 30th year.
3) Beginning with the 31st year, the number of deaths per year will increase to 4 (3% of 135 = 4.05), while the births will still be 5.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year, reaching 150 at the end of the 45th year.
4) Beginning with the 46th year, the number of births per year will increase to 6 (4% of 150 = 6), while the deaths will still be 4.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 168 at the end of the 54th year.
5) Beginning with the 55th year, the number of deaths per year will increase to 5 (3% of 168 = 5.04), while the births will still be 6.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year, reaching 175 at the end of the 61st year.
6) Beginning with the 62nd year, the number of births per year will increase to 7 (4% of 175 = 7), while the deaths will still be 5.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 201 at the end of the 75th year.

Although the 26th year is the first year that the population increases by more than 1, the 25th year is not the last year that it increases by 1.  The last year that the population increases by 1 is the 61st year, when the population reaches 175.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Notation  
Let Pₙ be the population at the beginning of year n (P₁ = 100).  

births  = ⌊0.04 Pₙ⌋ = ⌊Pₙ/25⌋,  
deaths = ⌊0.03 Pₙ⌋ = ⌊3Pₙ/100⌋,  
Δₙ     = births – deaths = Pₙ₊₁ – Pₙ.  

We must find the last year for which Δₙ = 1.

Step 1.  Where can Δ = 1 ?
Observe that
0.04P – 0.03P = 0.01P.
For any two real numbers a, b,
⌊a⌋ – ⌊b⌋ is either ⌊a – b⌋ or ⌈a – b⌉,
so Δ(P) is either ⌊0.01P⌋ or ⌈0.01P⌉.
Consequently  Δ(P) ≥ ⌊0.01P⌋.

If P ≥ 200 then 0.01P ≥ 2, hence Δ(P) ≥ 2.
Therefore Δ = 1 can occur only while P ≤ 199.
So we only have to follow the colony until the population first reaches 200.

Step 2.  Break the interval 100–199 into ranges in which births and deaths stay constant.

births = ⌊P/25⌋ changes at P = 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 …  
deaths = ⌊0.03P⌋ changes at P = 34, 67, 100, 134, 167 …

For 100 ≤ P ≤ 199 we get

Range           births   deaths  Δ
100–124            4        3     1
125–133            5        3     2

175–199            7        5     2

Hence the last possible Δ = 1 occurs for a starting population of 174; once the population reaches 175, Δ is at least 2 and, by the discussion above, can never drop back to 1.

Step 3.  Count the years needed to arrive at P = 174.

(1) 100 → 125 : Δ = 1 each year  
     25 years (Year 1–25)

(2) 125 → 135 : Δ = 2 each year  
      5 years (Year 26–30)

(3) 135 → 150 : Δ = 1 each year  
     15 years (Year 31–45)

(4) 150 → 168 : Δ = 2 each year  
      9 years (Year 46–54)

(5) 168 → 175 : Δ = 1 each year  
      7 years (Year 55–61)

At the beginning of Year 61 the population is 174, Δ = 1, and at the end of that year it becomes 175.  
Starting with Year 62 the increase is at least 2 forever.

a = Al’s age (in whole years) when the two professors first met  
c = Cal’s age when they first met  

The conversation gives two facts.

(1)  a² and c² are three–digit numbers that contain exactly the same three digits in some order.  
    ⇒  a and c must be between 10 and 31 (inclusive), because 10² = 100 is the first 3-digit square and 31² = 961 is the last.

(2)  (a + c)² is a 4–digit number whose first two digits are Cal’s age then (c) and whose last two digits are Al’s age now (call it A).

10² = 100          20² = 400          30² = 900  
11² = 121          21² = 441  ← same digits as 12²

13² = 169          14² = 196          31² = 961  ← all same digits  
15² = 225  
16² = 256          25² = 625  ← same digits

The only digit–sharing groups are therefore
   {12, 21},   {13, 14, 31},   {16, 25}.

For (a , c) = (25 , 16):

(a + c)² = 1681.  
Split into two 2-digit numbers: 16 | 81.

• 16 indeed equals Cal’s age when they met (c = 16).  
• Therefore the last two digits, 81, must be Al’s present age.

----------------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Consistency check.

Years elapsed d = 81 − 25 = 56.  
Cal’s present age would be 16 + 56 = 72 — perfectly reasonable for “aging professors.”  
The square-digits statement also holds (25² = 625 and 16² = 256 contain the same digits 2,5,6).

All conditions are satisfied.

104,"Question: Kurt & Rod were hanging around the window at school munching the last of their Rnkfurers hoard.  They spotted their neighbor lounging in the enclosed courtyard, looking hungry.
""Patty O'Furniture!  Good to see you!  Want a Rnkfurter?""
""A what?""
Kurt handed her the last he had.  She bit in, and her face lit up like a newly-coined metaphor.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""Rod and I were about to go order some more.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""  Patty's blank look bade him explain.  ""In our first batch, we got a total of 25 -- 20 for me, and 5 for Rod.  I had 20, and he had 20% of the total.""
""And you think you can do that for three people?  You get my percentage, and I get Rod's?  I don't think we can do it.""
Rod had been thinking about it, and rattled off three numbers to her.
""Those aren't right.  The last one isn't the right percentage; there's an added fraction.""
""So?  My mom says they're the same on her old phonograph speeds.""
Patty looked at Kurt, each waiting for the other to give an opinion.  Finally, she gestured at the empty wrapper in his hand.
""I'll round off a little for a week's supply of these.  Let's go!""
Since Rnkfurters come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, they had to leave 10 with the storekeeper to make the numbers work, but they got their munchies.
How many did each student get this time?
 Hint: The old phonograph speeds were typically 16, 33-1/3, 45, and 78 RPM.","The old phonograph speeds were typically 16, 33-1/3, 45, and 78 RPM.","27 for Kurt, 30 for Patty, and 33 for Rod.
That's 30% for Kurt and 33-1/3% for Patty.
Method:
Let K, P, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, K+P+R.
Now, since Kurt's percentage equals Patty's quantity, we get
100*K/T = P.
Similarly,
100*P/T = R plus a fraction.  Now, look at the common factor, 100/T.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
K*F = P and P*F = R (plus a fraction),
and K*F^2 = R (plus a fraction).
The clue about the phonograph leaves us looking for a triple with 33 Rnkfurters for Rod, with Patty getting 33-1/3% (one-third) of the total.
P = T/3
P = (K+P+33)/3 -- remember, R=33
Now, combine this with 100*K/T = P, and a bit of algebra gives us the required answer.

105,"Question: A man is standing on a rock in the middle of a circular lake of radius 1. There is a tiger on the shore of the lake that can run four times as fast you can swim, however the tiger cannot swim. The tiger is hungry and always attempts to keep the distance between the two of you at a minimum. How can you safely swim to shore?
Assume that as long as you can get to the shore before the tiger gets to you (even if it is only a split-second before), you will be safe.
 Hint: Use the factor of 4 to your advantage",Use the factor of 4 to your advantage,"Until you are more than 1/4 of the radius away from the rock you can swim fast enough so that you can keep the tiger the furthest distance possible from you. Regardless of which direction the tiger moves around the circle, you swim the other way, always keeping the rock between you and the tiger.  While you are doing this you will be able to move outward, since you will have some energy to spare.
Before long you will be 1/4 of the radius away from the center and the tiger will be 180 degrees away. At this point swim straight to the point on the shore furthest from the tiger. You will be able to get there in 3/4 units of time, while it will take the tiger pi/4 =~ 0.7854 units of time.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

 • v  =  your swimming speed  
 • 4v = the tiger’s running speed  
 • R  =  radius of the lake = 1  

1.  Make the tiger “stick to the radius”.  
    While you are on the rock at the centre the tiger may stand anywhere on the shore.  
    The moment you start to swim the tiger tries to keep itself on the same radius as you, because that is what minimises his distance to you.  
    Hence, if you keep turning round the centre, the tiger keeps running round the rim.

2.  Get inside the critical circle r = ¼.  
    Swim in a small circle of radius r, where r is a little smaller than ¼ (say r = 0.24).  
    • Your angular speed about the centre is ω = v/r.  
    • The tiger’s greatest possible angular speed is Ω = 4v /1 = 4v.  
    Because r < ¼, we have v/r > 4v, so ω > Ω – you turn round the centre faster than the tiger can keep up.  
    Consequently the angular gap between you and the tiger grows at the rate  
        ω – Ω = v(1/r – 4)  >  0.

3.  Wait until you are π radians (180°) ahead.  
    Keep circling inside r = ¼ until the angular separation between you and the tiger is exactly π (the tiger is diametrically opposite you).  
    This must occur after a finite time because you are gaining on him.

4.  Dash straight for the shore.  
    At that instant you are still only r (=0.24) from the centre, so the distance you must now swim outward along the same radius is  
        D_swim = 1 – r ≈ 0.76.  
    Time you need to reach land:  
        T_swim = D_swim / v = (1 – r)/v.

    The tiger, being diametrically opposite, must run at least half the circumference of the lake to reach the same point of shore:  
        D_tiger = π ≈ 3.14.  
    Time the tiger needs:  
        T_tiger = D_tiger /(4v) = π /(4v).

    Compare the times:

        T_tiger – T_swim  =  π /(4v) – (1 – r)/v  
                          =  [π/4 – (1 – r)] / v.

    For r = ¼ exactly, 4(1 – r) = 3 < π, so π/4 – (1 – r) > 0.  
    With our choice r = 0.24 the margin is even larger:

        π/4 – (1 – 0.24) ≈ 0.785 – 0.76 ≈ 0.025 > 0.

    Therefore T_tiger > T_swim; you touch the shore a split-second before the tiger arrives.

5.  Safety.  
    The moment you are on land you may run off in any direction (or climb a tree!) and the tiger, arriving slightly later, cannot catch you.

Thus by exploiting the factor 4, you first build up a 180° angular lead inside the critical radius ¼, then make a straight 0.76-unit dash to land, while the tiger has to cover about 3.14 units.  The swimmer always reaches the shore first.

Final answer: Circle inside a radius slightly less than ¼ of the lake until you are diametrically opposite the tiger; then swim straight outward to the shore—your 0.76-unit swim is completed before the tiger can finish the 3.14-unit run, so you reach land safely.",True,1,0,0

A × B = C  

such that, when the three numbers are written in ordinary decimal notation, every digit 1-9 appears exactly once and none is repeated.  
(Decimals, negatives, or zeros are forbidden by the hint.)

We already know one example:  
12 × 483 = 5796.  
The hint also tells us that in another solution the product is again 5796, so we keep C = 5796 and look for a different pair of factors.

Step 1 – record the digits that are already “used” by the product.  
5796 contains the digits {5, 7, 9, 6}.  
The remaining digits that must appear – once each – in the two factors are therefore  
{1, 2, 3, 4, 8}.

Step 2 – list the factor pairs of 5796.  
Prime-factorise 5796:  
5796 = 2² · 3² · 7 · 23.

From this we can write down all factors.  We only need to inspect those whose digits are drawn from {1,2,3,4,8} and do not repeat any digit already present in 5796.

Useful factor pairs:

• 5796 = 12 × 483   (already given, uses digits 4,8,3 with repetition)  
• 5796 = 18 × 322   (322 repeats the digit 2)  
• 5796 = 24 × 241.5 (not an integer)  
• 5796 = 28 × 207   (contains a zero)  
• 5796 = 42 × 138   ← promising pair  
• 5796 = 54 × 107   (contains a zero)  
etc.

Step 3 – check the promising pair 42 × 138.

Digits in 42 : {4,2}  
Digits in 138: {1,3,8}

Combine these with the digits in 5796:  
{4,2} ∪ {1,3,8} ∪ {5,7,9,6} = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.  
Every digit 1-9 appears exactly once, none is missing, none is repeated.

Therefore 42 × 138 = 5796 is a valid second solution.

A tidier way to write it is with the larger factor first:

138 × 42 = 5796.

Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.

If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.

Step-by-step reasoning

1.  Units column  
   Y + N + N = Y  (units of the result is Y)  
   ⇒ 2N = 10·c₁ (c₁ is the carry into the tens column).  
   Possible only if N = 0 (c₁ = 0) or N = 5 (c₁ = 1).

2.  Tens column  
   T + E + E + c₁ = T  (units T, carry c₂)  
   ⇒ 2E + c₁ = 10·c₂.  
   • If N = 5 we would have 2E + 1 a multiple of 10, impossible.  
   • Therefore N = 0, c₁ = 0 and 2E = 10 ⇒ E = 5, c₂ = 1.

3.  Hundreds column  
   R + T + T + c₂ = X  (carry c₃)  
   ⇒ R + 2T + 1 = X + 10·c₃.  
   Since X ≠ R, c₃ ≠ 0, hence c₃ = 1 or 2.  
   If c₃ = 1 then the thousands column would give O + 1 = I (no carry), which would make the top digit column F = S (same digit for two different letters). Impossible.  
   Hence c₃ = 2.

   Thus R + 2T + 1 ≥ 20, and  
   X = R + 2T − 19      (0 ≤ X ≤ 8).

4.  Thousands column  
   O + c₃ = I + 10·c₄  → O + 2 = I + 10·c₄.  
   To avoid I = O we need a carry here, i.e. O + 2 ≥ 10 ⇒ O = 9, c₄ = 1 and I = 1.

5.  Ten-thousands column  
   F + c₄ = S ⇒ F + 1 = S, so F ≤ 8 and S = F + 1.

   Digits fixed so far:  
   N = 0, E = 5, O = 9, I = 1.  
   Remaining digits to choose: 2,3,4,6,7,8.

6.  Solve R, T, X from the hundreds equation with c₃ = 2:  
   R + 2T must lie between 19 and 27 inclusive.

   Trying possible T:

   • T = 7 ⇒ 2T = 14.  
     Need R ≥ 5. R = 7,6,8,…  
     Only R = 8 gives R + 14 = 22 ⇒ X = 3.  
     Digits now {0,1,3,5,7,8,9}.  
     Remaining digits {2,4,6}.  
     But F must be one of these and S = F + 1 clashes each time (2→3 used, 4→5 used, 6→7 used).  
     So T = 7 impossible.

   • T = 8 ⇒ 2T = 16.  
     Need R ≥ 3.  
     – R = 6 gives 22 ⇒ X = 3 (digit 3 still free).  
       Digits used: {0,1,3,5,6,8,9}. Remaining {2,4,7}.  
       Choose F = 2 ⇒ S = 3 (already used).  
       F = 4 ⇒ S = 5 (used).  
       F = 7 ⇒ S = 8 (used). No good.

     – R = 7 gives 23 ⇒ X = 4.  
       Digits used: {0,1,4,5,7,8,9}. Remaining {2,3,6}.  
       Pick F = 2 ⇒ S = 3 (free) and let Y = 6.

1000 m/km",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step-by-step reasoning  

1.  Translate the verbal information into two algebraic equations.

   •  Let  
        x = speed of Car 1  (metres per second)  
        y = speed of Car 2  (metres per second)  

   •  Length of the circular track  
        L = 1 800 m  

2.  Cars moving in opposite directions.  

   When they travel in opposite directions their relative speed is x + y.  
   They meet whenever the distance covered relative to each other equals one full lap (1 800 m).  
        (x + y) · 30 s = 1 800  
        x + y = 1 800 / 30 = 60  (Equation 1)

3.  Cars moving in the same direction.  

   When they travel in the same direction the faster car must gain one full lap on the slower car to meet again.  
   Their relative speed is |x − y|, and the time between meetings is 120 s:  
        |x − y| · 120 s = 1 800  
        |x − y| = 1 800 / 120 = 15  (Equation 2)

   Because they do meet again, one car must indeed be faster; set x > y so that  
        x − y = 15  (Equation 2’)

4.  Solve the system of linear equations (use elimination).

        x + y = 60  
        x − y = 15  
        ───────────  
        2x     = 75   ⇒   x = 75 / 2 = 37.5

        Substitute x into Equation 1:  
        37.5 + y = 60  ⇒  y = 60 − 37.5 = 22.5

5.  State the speeds.

        Car 1: 37.5 m/s  ≈ 135 km/h  
        Car 2: 22.5 m/s  ≈  81 km/h

Both equations are satisfied:

   Opposite directions: (37.5 + 22.5) m/s × 30 s = 60 m/s × 30 s = 1 800 m ✔  
   Same direction: (37.5 − 22.5) m/s × 120 s = 15 m/s × 120 s = 1 800 m ✔

Final answer: Car 1 travels at 37.5 m/s (135 km/h) and Car 2 at 22.5 m/s (81 km/h).",True,0,0,0

 ⇒ (A – (3a+12d))(A + (3a+12d)) = 60d².         (3)

4.  Because the product on the right-hand side is even, both factors on the left are even; write  
 A – (3a+12d) = 2p, A + (3a+12d) = 2q  (p < q, positive integers).

 Then (3) gives (2p)(2q) = 60d² ⇒ pq = 15d²,                            (4)

 So q – p must be a multiple of 3.

5.  Work with p and q (remember pq = 15d²).

 d = 3  15d² = 135. Factor pairs with q – p divisible by 3:

  p = 3 q = 45. (q – p = 42)

 From (5): 3(a + 4·3) = 42 ⇒ a + 12 = 14 ⇒ a = 2.

 Youngest child 2 years old – “very young’’ indeed.  
 Compute father’s age:

 A = (2p + 2q)/2 = (6 + 90)/2 = 48.

 Thus a = 2, d = 3, A = 48.

 (Other factor pairs for d = 3 either give negative a or an impractically old father; higher d give still older fathers or older youngest children, contradicting the hint.)

6.  Verify:

 Children’s ages: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26.

 Sum of squares:  
 2²+5²+8²+11²+14²+17²+20²+23²+26²

111,"Question: Mad Ade was visiting his friend, computer tycoon and Olympic Kebab hurling champion, Mike Rohsopht.
He was there on Sunday and when the radio gave the time at the hour, Mad Ade noticed that the Madadian antique clock, designed by Madadian clock maker Arthur Minit (teaser #4891) was exactly 3 minutes slow.
""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Mike assured Mad Ade that his treasured Arthur Minit clock had not been adjusted nor fixed since his last visit.
What day of the week was Mad Ade's second visit?
 Hint: It must lose some multiple of 12 hours in total",It must lose some multiple of 12 hours in total,"The answer is 17 days and 3 hours later, which would have been a Wednesday.
This is the only other time in the same month when the two would agree at all.
In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.
Since the clock was not adjusted since the last visit, it's also possible that the radio time shifted by one hour due to a change to or from summer daylight saving time.  However, it turns out that the only additional possibilities that need to be considered are those of 4 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 12 hours 57 minutes, and 29 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 3 days 10 hours 57 minutes.  Without even considering the rules for when in the month the
clock is changed, these possible solutions are ruled out because we know that both visits were in the evening (""Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht"") and they involve times in a different part of the day.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

 t  = the number of real hours between the two visits (both visits are made “on the hour”, so t is an integer),  
 E₁ = –3 minutes  (the clock is 3 min slow on the first visit),  
 r  = 7 minutes per real hour  (the rate at which the clock loses time).

After t real hours the clock will have lost r·t = 7t minutes more, so its error will be  

 E₂ = E₁ – 7t  = –3 – 7t  minutes.

For the clock to look perfectly right again its hands must indicate the same position as the true time on a 12-hour dial.  
That means the total error must be an exact multiple of 12 hours (= 720 minutes):

 E₂ = –720 n for some positive integer n.

Hence  

 –3 – 7t = –720 n  
 ⇒ 3 + 7t = 720 n.

Because t is an integer, 720 n – 3 must be divisible by 7.  
Since 720 ≡ 6 (mod 7), the congruence

 6n ≡ 3 (mod 7)

must hold.  Multiplying by the inverse of 6 mod 7 (which is 6) gives

 n ≡ 6·3 ≡ 18 ≡ 4 (mod 7).

The smallest positive n is therefore n = 4.

Now compute t:

 t = (720·4 – 3)/7 = (2880 – 3)/7 = 2877/7 = 411 hours.

Convert 411 hours:

 411 h = 17 days and 3 hours (17·24 = 408, remainder 3).

So the second visit occurs exactly 17 days and 3 hours after the first one.

The first visit was on a Sunday.  
Adding 17 days moves us forward 14 days (two whole weeks) to another Sunday, and then 3 more days to Wednesday.  
The extra 3 hours do not change the day of the week (it only shifts the time of day).

Therefore the second visit took place on a

The mixed temperature T is  

T = (H·θₕ + C·θ𝚌) / (θₕ + θ𝚌).

We want T = 98.6 °F, so

98.6 = (105·360 + 45·θ𝚌) / (360 + θ𝚌).

Solve for θ𝚌:

98.6(360 + θ𝚌) = 105·360 + 45 θ𝚌

Step 2 – discard the ones that are not weird  
For each candidate we look for a subset of its proper divisors that totals the
number itself.  If such a subset exists the number is NOT weird.

• 52 :  26 + 13 + 8 + 5 = 52  → not weird  
• 54 :  27 + 18 + 9          = 54  → not weird

• 66 :  33 + 22 + 11        = 66  → not weird  

So 70 is the first remaining possibility.  We must show that no subset of its

Step 3 – examine 70 in detail  
Proper divisors of 70: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35.  
Their sum is 74, so 70 is abundant.

Now test every way to hit 70.

A. 35 is NOT used.  
Then the largest total we could get is

B. 35 IS used.  
We must find 35 more from {1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14}.  
Check all possibilities:

14+10+7+5  = 36  
14+10+7+2  = 33  
14+10+7+1  = 32  
14+10+5+2  = 31  
14+10+5+1  = 30  
14+10+2+1  = 27  
14+7 +5+2  = 28  
14+7 +5+1  = 27  
14+7 +2+1  = 24  
14+5 +2+1  = 22  
10+7 +5+2+1= 25

None of them give 35, hence none give 70 when 35 is included.

Therefore no subset of the proper divisors of 70 adds to 70.

Now one night, the Creaky tribe cornered half of the Rusty tribe and despite being outnumbered two to one, unscrewed one arm from each, there being an equal number of male and female victims.

8s – 16 = ½ s².

The pieces do not need to be of equal size.
 Hint: After j cuts, how many additional pieces can you cut with the (j+1)-th cut?","After j cuts, how many additional pieces can you cut with the (j+1)-th cut?","The answer is n*(n+1)/2 + 1.
With every cut you should cut through every previous cut. As long as you keep doing this you will always be able to do so again with your next cut. The number of additional pieces formed on cut x will always be x. The sum of all integers from 1 to n is n*(n+1)/2. So the sum of additional pieces cut will be n*(n+1)/2.
Finally add 1 because we start with 1 piece: n*(n+1)/2 + 1.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Reasoning  

1.  Let P(n) be the largest possible number of pieces that a circular pizza can be divided into with n straight cuts.  
    The problem begins with P(0)=1 (an uncut pizza is one piece).

2.  How many new pieces can one additional cut create?  
    •  Suppose we have already made j cuts and achieved P(j) pieces.  
    •  Draw the (j+1)-st cut as a straight line.  
    •  To maximise the number of new pieces, make sure:
       – the new cut intersects every one of the previous j cuts, and  
       – no three cuts meet at the same point in the interior of the pizza.  
    •  A straight line that intersects j previous lines in the interior is split into j+1 segments, so it crosses j+1 existing pieces.  
       Each time it crosses from one old piece into the next, it creates a new piece; therefore it creates exactly j+1 new pieces.

3.  Recurrence relation  
       P(0) = 1  
       P(j+1) = P(j) + (j + 1)        for j ≥ 0.

4.  Solve the recurrence.  
       P(1) = 1 + 1 = 2  
       P(2) = 2 + 2 = 4  
       P(3) = 4 + 3 = 7  
       …  
       Summing the increment formula up to n cuts gives  
            P(n) = 1 + (1 + 2 + 3 + … + n)  
                 = 1 + n(n+1)/2.

Therefore the maximum number of pieces obtainable with n straight cuts is  

       P(n) = 1 + n(n + 1)/2.

What is a zinger?
 Hint: Think multiplication.",Think multiplication.,"A zinger in this context is a number that is multiplied by eight and increased by one. For example, 8 x 2 = 16 and 16 + 1= 17.  Therefore 17 is a zinger.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Look at what happens to each “zinger’’ when you subtract 1.

• 89 − 1 = 88 = 8 × 11

Hint #2: There are many ways to solve this, but a simple method is to imagine one triangle inside another.","30/11. As mentioned in the hint, there are many methods in which to solve this. One less complex method is to imagine the axis of the cone form a right triangle. This triangle shares the dimensions of the cone, so it is 12 by 5. We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.
Next we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x. If we add 10x on both sides, we get 22x=60, and dividing 22 from both sides yields x=60/22=30/11.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"We label every quantity that matters and keep only two facts in mind:  
1.  In a cone, the radius decreases linearly with height.  
2.  For the cylinder we are told that its diameter equals its height.

Step-by-step.

1.  Put the cone upright with its vertex at height 12 units and its base on the plane z = 0.  
    Cone’s base-radius = 5.

2.  Let the inscribed cylinder have  
       radius = r  
       height = h  
    and its base also sits in the plane z = 0 (so its top is at z = h).

3.  “Inscribed” means the top circular rim of the cylinder just touches the cone’s lateral surface.  
    Therefore the cone’s radius at height z = h equals the cylinder’s radius r.

4.  Because the cone’s radius shrinks linearly from 5 at z = 0 to 0 at z = 12,
       radius at height z is 5 · (1 − z / 12).  
    Plugging z = h,
       r = 5 · (1 − h/12) = 5 − (5h)/12.          …(i)

5.  Given: cylinder diameter = cylinder height, i.e. 2r = h.          …(ii)

6.  Substitute h = 2r from (ii) into (i):
       r = 5 − (5(2r))/12
       r = 5 − (10r)/12
       r = 5 − (5r)/6.

7.  Solve for r:
       r + (5r)/6 = 5
       r(1 + 5/6) = 5
       r(11/6) = 5
       r = 5 · (6/11)
       r = 30/11.

So the cylinder’s radius is 30/11 units.

Interpret the pairs of digits as numbers:

 AB = 10A + B (thousands & hundreds)  
 BC = 10B + C (hundreds & tens)  
 CD = 10C + D (tens & ones)

The property required is

 AB + CD = BC.

Substitute the expressions:

 (10A + B) + (10C + D) = 10B + C  
 10A + B + 10C + D − 10B − C = 0  
 10A + 9C + D = 9B.                     (1)

-------------------------------------------------
1. A condition on A and D  
Because the right side of (1) is divisible by 9, the left side must be too.

 A + D ≡ 0 (mod 9)  ⇒  A + D = 9  (since 0≤D≤9).

Hence D = 9 − A.                                (2)

-------------------------------------------------
2. A relation among A, B, C  
Insert (2) into (1):

 10A + 9C + (9 − A) = 9B  
 9A + 9C + 9 = 9B  
 B = A + C + 1.                                 (3)

3. Digit bounds  
Digits must satisfy 0 ≤ B, C, D ≤ 9.  
From (2) D = 9 − A ≥ 0 ⇒ A ≤ 9 (always true).  
From (3) B = A + C + 1 ≤ 9 ⇒ C ≤ 8 − A.         (4)

Thus, for a chosen thousands digit A, the tens digit C can range from 0 up to 8 − A, and then B and D are fixed by (2) and (3).

Step-by-step deductions

1. From “AB is divisible by 2” we need B even.  
2. “BC is divisible by 3” ⇒ (B+C) ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
3. “CD is divisible by 4” ⇒ the two-digit number CD is a multiple of 4, so D is even.  
4. “DE is divisible by 5” forces E = 5.  
5. “EF is divisible by 6” ⇒ F is even and (E+F) ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
   With E = 5, we need 5+F ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ F ≡ 1 (mod 3).  
   Among the even digits {2,4,6,8}, only 4 satisfies this, so F = 4.  
6. “FG is divisible by 7” ⇒ 4G is a multiple of 7 → 42 or 49.  
   Hence (F,G) = (4,2) or (4,9).  
7. “GH is divisible by 8” with H even:  
   • If G = 2, GH=2H must be a multiple of 8 → 24. But H=4 is already used, impossible.  
   • Therefore G = 9 and GH must be 96 → H = 6.  
8. “HI is divisible by 9” ⇒ (H+I) ≡ 0 (mod 9).  
   With H = 6 we need 6+I ≡ 0 (mod 9) → I = 3.

126,"Question: The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
In a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).  How many different ways can a 13-card alternating-colour straight be formed from a Snapoker deck?  Note that jokers can not be used in forming a straight.

Start with two full 52-card decks and remove  
• odd-numbered spades           (1,3,5,7,9,11,13)  
• even-numbered hearts          (2,4,6,8,10,12)

• non-prime clubs + A♣          (1,4,6,8,9,10,12, A)

The two jokers that are added are irrelevant here because jokers are not allowed in the straight.

Step 2 – Decide which suits can be used in an alternating-colour straight  
By definition for this problem the straight runs A-2-3-…-K with  
• odd ranks (1,3,5,7,9,11,13) red,  
• even ranks (2,4,6,8,10,12)   black.

Step 3 – Count the available cards, rank by rank  
(Remember there are two copies of every surviving card because two decks are used.)

Rank 1 (A) – must be red → only A♥ survives → 2 choices  
Rank 2     – must be black → 2♠ and 2♣ survive → 2 + 2 = 4 choices  
Rank 3     – red      → only 3♥ survives → 2 choices

Rank 8     – black     → only 8♠ survives → 2 choices  
Rank 9     – red      → 9♥ and 9♦ survive → 2 + 2 = 4 choices  
Rank 10    – black     → only 10♠ survives → 2 choices  
Rank 11    – red      → only J♥ survives → 2 choices  
Rank 12    – black     → only Q♠ survives → 2 choices  
Rank 13    – red      → only K♥ survives → 2 choices

Step 4 – Multiply the independent choices  
Total ways

into a 5-digit numerator N and a 5-digit denominator D so that  

N / D = 1 / 2 ⇔ D = 2 N.

Because D is also 5 digits, N must lie between 10 000 and 49 999.  
Look first at the units (right-most) digit of N.  

• If N ends in 5, then 2 × 5 = 10, so D must end in 0 – and we indeed possess the digits 5 and 0.  
So let us write the numbers as  

         N = d₄ d₃ d₂ d₁ 5  
         D = e₄ e₃ e₂ e₁ 0 ,

and double N from right to left, keeping track of carries.

Step 1 (units):  
2·5 = 10 → write 0, carry 1.

Step 2 (tens):  
2·d₁ + 1 must be a single unused digit.  
Trying available digits ≠0,5 gives

 d₁ = 4  → 2·4 + 1 = 9  (good)  
 d₁ = 6  → 2·6 + 1 = 13 (gives 3, still possible)

We pursue d₁ = 4 (gives D’s tens digit 9, no carry).

Step 3 (hundreds):  
2·d₂ must again be an unused digit.

 d₂ = 2  → 2·2 = 4 (good)  
 d₂ = 3  → 2·3 = 6 (good)  
 d₂ = 6  → 2·6 = 12 (gives 2, carry 1 – also possible)

Choose d₂ = 2 (gives hundreds digit 4, no carry).

Step 4 (thousands):  
2·d₃ likewise must be unused.

 d₃ = 3  → 2·3 = 6 (good)  
 d₃ = 6  → 2·6 = 12 (gives 2, carry 1)

Pick d₃ = 3 (gives thousands digit 6, no carry).

Step 5 (ten-thousands):  
Finally 2·d₄ must fit with no overflow (since D has only 5 digits).

With d₄ = 1 we get 2·1 = 2 – perfect.

v₁ , v₂ , v₃ , v₄ , v₅ , v₆   points respectively.

From the four scores that are given we obtain four linear equations:

(1)  v₁ + 2v₃ + v₄ + v₆        = 177     (Xavier 1)  
(2)  v₂ + 2v₄ + v₅ + v₆        = 268     (Rex 1)

For the third throws we shall need

Xavier 3 :  v₁ + 2v₂ + v₃ + v₄  
Rex 3    :  v₁ + v₃ + v₄ + 2v₆

and the hint tells us that  

(v₁ + 2v₂ + v₃ + v₄) – (v₁ + v₃ + v₄ + 2v₆) = 26 ,
so that                                          

(5)          v₂ – v₆ = 13.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Solving the system
------------------------------------------------------------------
Solve (3) for v₁:               v₁ = (203 – 2v₄)/3.

Insert this in (4) and simplify to get         

(4′)           v₁ + v₄ + 3v₆ = 229.

Substituting v₁ from (3) into (4′) gives

v₄ + 9v₆ = 484      ⇒      v₄ = 484 – 9v₆.

Put this value of v₄ back in (3):

v₁ = 6v₆ – 255.

Now use (1) to find v₃ and (2) to find v₅:

v₃ =  (177 – v₁ – v₄ – v₆)/2   =  v₆ – 26,
v₂ =  v₆ + 13                       (from (5)),
v₅ =  268 – v₂ – 2v₄ – v₆      =  16v₆ – 713.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Conditions on v₆
------------------------------------------------------------------
All six face-values must be positive and pairwise different.

Positivity forces

v₁ = 6v₆ – 255  > 0    ⇒  v₆ ≥ 43,  
v₄ = 484 – 9v₆  > 0    ⇒  v₆ ≤ 53,  
v₅ = 16v₆ – 713 > 0    ⇒  v₆ ≥ 45,

and one must avoid the single collision v₃ = v₄ that occurs at v₆ = 51.

Hence v₆ can be any integer                   

v₆ ∈ {45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52, 53}.

For each such choice we obtain a perfectly valid point-scheme; e.g.

v₆ = 45  →  (v₁,…,v₆) = (15,58,19,79, 7,45)  
v₆ = 46  →  (v₁,…,v₆) = (21,59,20,70,23,46)  
v₆ = 47  →  (27,60,21,61,39,47)  
v₆ = 48  →  (33,61,22,52,55,48)  
v₆ = 49  →  (39,62,23,43,71,49)  
v₆ = 50  →  (45,63,24,34,87,50)  
v₆ = 52  →  (57,65,26,16,119,52)  
v₆ = 53  →  (63,66,27, 7,135,53)

------------------------------------------------------------------
Third-turn scores
------------------------------------------------------------------
Notice that, independent of the particular admissible value of v₆,

Xavier 3 = v₁ + 2v₂ + v₃ + v₄
         = (6v₆−255) + 2(v₆+13) + (v₆−26) + (484−9v₆)
         = 229,

Rex 3    = v₁ + v₃ + v₄ + 2v₆
         = 203.

The required 26-point advantage (229–203) is automatically satisfied.

------------------------------------------------------------------
What can be concluded?
------------------------------------------------------------------
• The third-throw scores are completely determined:
  Xavier scores 229 points and Rex scores 203 points.

• The individual point values of the six faces are not uniquely fixed by
  the information that is given.  Any one of the eight sets listed above

If you imagine you are facing a globe head on, you have the north pole at the top of the globe and the south pole at the bottom. Imagine a ""west pole"" and ""east pole"" to the left and right of the globe.
If you are at the north pole and turn left, you will walk through the ""west pole"" (right and you go through the ""east pole"")
If you walk on an axis from the north pole towards the south pole and make a left or right turn you will always walk through these imaginary east and west poles. So in the question 17.345 kilometers is irrelevant, only the turn.
(It also doesn't matter where you start on the planet, the distance at the end will still be the same.)
47.124 is approximately 3/4 of the circumference of this planet, which will leave you directly on the imaginary east pole. The distance is now the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle of side 10km.
Answer: root 200 or approximately 14km!
(If you got the distance as 15.7km - the distance you would have to walk back, then that's ok too!)",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

 R = 10 km (the planet’s radius)  
 d₁ = 17.345 km (the first walk)  
 d₂ = 47.124 km (the second walk)

Step 1.  Convert the walked distances to central angles (arc lengths ÷ radius).

 α = d₁ / R = 17.345 km / 10 km = 1.7345 rad ≈ 99.4°  
 β = d₂ / R = 47.124 km / 10 km = 4.7124 rad

Notice that  

 4.7124 rad = 3π/2 rad = 270°,  

so the second segment is exactly ¾ of a full great-circle circumference.

Step 2.  Interpret what “turn left” means.

Walking “straight” on a sphere means following a great circle.  
Turning left 90° puts you onto another great circle that intersects the first one at a right angle.  
Thus, at the turning point P the interior angle of the spherical triangle is 90°.

Step 3.  Form the right spherical triangle.

Vertices:  
 S – starting point (ship)  
 P – turning point  
 F – final point  

Sides (central angles):  
 c = SP = α = 1.7345 rad  
 a = PF = β = 3π/2 rad (the way actually walked)

A spherical triangle is conventionally taken with each side < π.  
The great circle that joins P to F also has the complementary arc

 a′ = 2π – 3π/2 = π/2 rad = 90°.

We may use this shorter arc because both arcs connect the same pair of points; they differ only in the direction traveled.  For our distance calculation we take

 a = π/2 rad ⇒ cos a = cos(π/2) = 0.

Angle at P (between SP and PF) is B = 90°.

Step 4.  Apply the right-spherical-triangle cosine rule.

For a right spherical triangle with right angle B = 90°,

 cos b = cos a · cos c,

where b is the side opposite the right angle, i.e. b = SF (the distance we want).

Since cos a = 0, we get

 cos b = 0 ⇒ b = π/2 rad = 90°.

Step 5.  Convert back to a surface distance.

 Distance SF = R · b = 10 km · (π/2) = 5π km ≈ 15.708 km.

133,"Question: A postman delivered letters every day. On the first day he delivered one letter, on the second day he delivered three letters, on the third day he delivered five letters, and so on. Each day from the second on he delivered two letters more than the preceding day.
The day he retired, he noticed that he had delivered a total of more than 100,000 letters.
Something fun is that the total number of letters he had delivered has its digits arranged in ascending order.
How many days had he worked, and how many letters had he delivered in total?
 Hint: The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.",The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.,"It's easy to see that the number of letters he had delivered is the square of the number of days he had worked.
Square numbers can't end in 7 or 8, and 123456 is not a square because it is divisible by 3 but not by 9. Hence the number of letters must end with 9.
Since odd squares have remainder 1 upon division by 8, the number formed by its fourth and fifth digits must be divisible by 4, which can be 48, 56 or 68.
Numbers that have remainder 2 upon division by 3, and those that are divisible by 3 but not by 9 are not squares. By trial and error, we know that the only square number satisfying these conditions is 134689=367^2.
Hence, he had worked for 367 days, and had delivered 134689 letters.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

 n = number of days worked  
 T = total number of letters delivered  

Daily deliveries are  

 1, 3, 5, 7, … , (2n–1) .  

Hence  

 T = 1 + 3 + … + (2n–1) = n². (“sum of the first n odd numbers”)  

The conditions are  

1. T > 100 000  ⇔  n > √100 000 ≈ 316.3,  so n ≥ 317.  
2. The decimal digits of T are in strictly ascending order.  
3. The digits of n itself are in strictly ascending order (hint).

Step 1 – restrict the last digit of n.  
For T to have ascending digits it must finish with the greatest digit, i.e. with 9.  
A square ends with 9 only when its root ends with 3 or 7.  
Among numbers ≥317 whose digits are strictly increasing, none can end in 3 (because every previous digit would then have to be <3, making the number <300).  
Therefore n must end in 7.

Step 2 – list all integers ≥317 with strictly increasing digits that end in 7.

 3-digit: 347, 357, 367, 457, 467, 567  
 4-digit: 1237, 1247, 1257, 1267, 1347, 1357, 1367, 1457, 1467, 1567,  
      2347, 2357, 2367, 2457, 2467, 2567, 3457, 3467, 3567, 4567.  

Step 3 – square each candidate and check whether the square’s digits ascend.

• 347² = 120 409  • 1357² = 1 841 449  
• 357² = 127 449  • 1367² = 1 868 689  
• 367² = 134 689  ← digits 1 3 4 6 8 9 ascend!  
• 457² = 208 849  … (all the rest fail)

Every other candidate produces a square whose digits are not in ascending order (a 0 appears, a digit repeats, or a decrease occurs).  

Thus the only possibility is  

 n = 367 and T = 367² = 134 689.

Both numbers satisfy all requirements:

• n = 367 (3 < 6 < 7) – digits ascend.  
• T = 134 689 (>100 000) (1 < 3 < 4 < 6 < 8 < 9) – digits ascend.

Therefore:

134,"Question: Bill, Bob, Frank, and Jim, who all drive cabs, work a particularly busy street that runs east and west. The street has no traffic lights. Oddly enough, an equal number of pedestrians walk in each direction at four kilometres per hour. The four cab drivers were discussing the best way to pick up a fare. Bill said he was going to sit beside the curb and wait until a fare came along. Bob said he was going to cruise west at four kilometres an hour; therefore, he would have twice the chance of picking up a fare as Bill. Frank said he was going to cruise east at eight kilometres an hour and his chances were twice as good as either Bill's or Bob's. Jim claimed that they were all wrong. He was going to drive west at 12kmh and his chances of picking up a fare were twice as good as Frank's. Of the claims that were made which were correct and which were wrong?
 Hint: Analyze each claim separately",Analyze each claim separately,"Bill made no claim, Bob's claim was false, Frank's claim was true, and Jim's claim was false. Let's assume that 100 people passed Bill going east at four kph, and 100 people passed him going west at four kph. Bob, who was driving west at four kph, wouldn't pass anyone walking west, but would pass 200 people walking east. This would put him no further ahead than Bill. Frank, who was driving east and 300 people going west. Jim, who was going west at 12kph, would pass 200 people going west and 400 people going east.

d = average number of pedestrians per kilometre (in each direction).  

For any cab the number of prospective fares it meets per hour is  

(encounter rate) = d × (relative speed to east-bound walkers)   
                     + d × (relative speed to west-bound walkers).

Pedestrians all walk 4 km/h; the cab speeds mentioned are with respect to the street.

1. Bill – standing still  
   Relative speed to either stream = 4 km/h.  
   Encounters per hour: d·4 + d·4 = 8d.

2. Bob – drives west at 4 km/h  
   To west-bound walkers (also 4 km/h west) the relative speed is 0 ⇒ no new encounters.  
   To east-bound walkers the closing speed is 4 + 4 = 8 km/h.  
   Encounters per hour: d·0 + d·8 = 8d (the same as Bill, not double).

3. Frank – drives east at 8 km/h  
   Relative speed to east-bound walkers: 8 – 4 = 4 km/h.  
   Relative speed to west-bound walkers: 8 + 4 = 12 km/h.

Conclusions  
• Bob’s assertion that his chance is twice Bill’s is wrong.  
• Frank’s assertion that his chance is twice Bill’s or Bob’s is correct.  
• Jim’s assertion that his chance is twice Frank’s is wrong.  

Bill made no numerical claim, merely stated his intention.

1.  The mystery number ABC must be a 3–digit prime without the digit 9 and with three distinct digits.

2.  Sorting the digits from least→greatest (ascending) and greatest→least (descending) must again give 3–digit primes.

   •  Look through the given prime list and pick out the primes whose three digits are already in ascending order and contain no 9:  
     127, 137, 149(×), 157, 167, 257, 347, 367, 457, 467  
     (149 is crossed out because of the 9.)

   •  For each of those, reverse the digits; keep the triple only if the reverse is also prime (and still 3-digit, of course, and contains no 9):

   •  Only three digit-sets survive: {1,5,7}, {1,6,7}, {3,4,7}.

3.  Now test every permutation ABC of each surviving digit-set, looking for one that satisfies simultaneously:
   – ABC is prime,  
   – AB (first two digits) is a 2-digit prime,  
   – BC (last two digits) is a 2-digit prime.

   (a) Digits 1,5,7  
       Primes among its six permutations: 157, 571, 751.  
       • 157 → AB = 15 (not prime)  
       • 571 → AB = 57 (not prime)  
       • 751 → AB = 75 (not prime)  
       No good.

   (b) Digits 1,6,7  
       Prime permutations: 167, 617, 761.  
       • 167 → AB = 16 (not prime)  
       • 617 → AB = 61 (prime) and BC = 17 (prime) ← works!  
       • 761 → AB = 76 (not prime)  
       So 617 satisfies all requirements.

   (c) Digits 3,4,7  
       Prime permutations: 347, 743.  
       • 347 → AB = 34 (not prime)  
       • 743 → AB = 74 (not prime)  
       No good.

4.  Only one number meets every clue: 617.

Verification

• 617 is a 3-digit prime.  
• AB = 61 and BC = 17 are both 2-digit primes.  
• Digits 6,1,7 are distinct and none is 9.  
• Rearranged least→greatest = 167 (prime).  
• Rearranged greatest→least = 761 (prime).

All six clues are satisfied.

136,"Question: Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?
Comments to triflers:
The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!

To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion.

Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases. With one less case to move, Bu will now make 2 fewer trips. The 3.5 bottles set aside are used to move the four cases the next 1/2 mile toward the Wirth Pavilion.   After this, the Wirth Pavilion is just 2 2/9 miles away ( 5 - 2 5/18 - 9/18 = 2 4/18 ). Next, he travels 15 5/9 miles (7 * 2 2/9) using 15 5/9 bottles of soda to complete his trip.

 • ride back (n–1) times to fetch the other loads.  

That is (2n–1) miles of riding per road-mile, so it costs (2n–1) bottles
per road-mile.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – start with 5 loads (n = 5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
As long as five full loads are west of a point, every road-mile costs

 2·5 – 1 = 9 bottles.

We keep five loads until the stock falls to 4·L = 100 bottles.
Starting from F0 = 120, that means burning 120 – 100 = 20 bottles.
At nine bottles per road-mile, those 20 bottles carry the whole caravan

 d1 = 20 / 9  miles.

After travelling 20/9 mi we are left with exactly 100 unopened bottles,
i.e. four full loads, at that point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – 4 loads (n = 4) for the rest of the trip
--------------------------------------------------------------------
From here on only four trips forward and three trips back are needed,
so every road-mile now costs

 2·4 – 1 = 7 bottles.

The remaining distance is

 D – d1 = 5 – 20/9 = 25/9  miles.

Minimum fuel needed for that is

 7 · 25/9 = 175/9  bottles ≈ 19.44 bottles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Lower bound on the number of bottles that must be opened
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Altogether a minimum of

 20  + 175/9 = 355/9 ≈ 39.44 bottles

has to be consumed.  Because bottles are indivisible (once one is opened
it no longer counts as “unopened”), at least 40 bottles must be opened and
cannot be delivered.  Therefore the theoretical maximum of unopened
bottles that can reach the Wirth Pavilion is

 120 – 40 = 80 bottles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 – showing 80 bottles can actually be delivered
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A concrete schedule that opens exactly 40 bottles:

1. Stage A (0 → 20/9 mi)  
   Shuttle the five loads across 20/9 miles exactly as outlined above.  
   That uses 20 bottles and leaves 100 unopened at the 20/9-mile mark.

2. Stage B (20/9 mi → 5 mi)  
   Now there are only four loads.  Shuttle them the remaining 25/9 miles.
   This needs 175/9 bottles; the rider opens 20 bottles (19 4⁄9 are drunk,
   5⁄9 of the last bottle is left in the tank and may be poured away).
   The 100 – 20 = 80 unopened bottles arrive intact.

Thus 80 unopened bottles can be delivered, and no strategy can deliver
more.

Final answer: 80 unopened bottles",True,1,0,0
137,"Question: Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.  Henry's plan calls for the tracks (each of which is one mile in length) to be laid end-to-end with no gap between them, pinned to the ground at every other juncture, as shown below:
v_______ _______vv_______ _______v
Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""
Henry replies, ""The expansion will only be an inch over the whole mile length.  If the tracks buckle, it will only be by an inch or two at most.  The trains will certainly have no trouble bumping over these buckles.""
Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?
 Hint: Would Pythagoras have the same plan?",Would Pythagoras have the same plan?,"The rise in the middle of the tracks would have been much greater than Henry surmised.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse). SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"1.  How the track is fastened  
   • Rails are supplied in 1-mile lengths (5280 ft).  
   • Every other joint is bolted to the ground   
     v  _______  _______  v  _______  _______  v  
     so the pins are 2 miles (10560 ft) apart.  
   • The joint in the middle of a 2-mile section is free to move.

2.  Thermal expansion  
   • The steel expands 1 inch per mile.  
   • Each 1-mile rail therefore lengthens by  
        1 in = 1⁄12 ft.  
   • In a 2-mile pinned section the total extra length is  
        2 × 1⁄12 ft = 1⁄6 ft = 2 in.

3.  What can the rails do?  
   The pins at the ends of the 2-mile section cannot move, so the only way to
   absorb the extra length is for the rails to rise off the ground, forming an
   isosceles triangle:

               apex (un-pinned joint)
                    /\
                   /  \
          pin ___ /    \ ___ pin
                 1 mile   1 mile

   Base (pin-to-pin distance) B = 2 miles = 10560 ft  
   Each side (one rail) length L = 1 mile + 1 inch  
                                = 5280 ft + 1⁄12 ft  
                                = 5280.083 333 … ft

4.  Height of the buckle – Pythagoras  
   Half of the base is B/2 = 5280 ft.  
   For the right triangle formed by half the buckle,

        height² = L² − (B/2)²
                = (5280 + 1⁄12)² − 5280²
                = 2·5280·(1⁄12) + (1⁄12)²
                = 10560·(1⁄12) + 1⁄144
                ≈ 880.006 9 ft²

        height ≈ √880.0069 ft² ≈ 29.7 ft.

5.  Consequence  
   The “little” extra 2 inches of length produces a hump almost 30 feet high!
   No train can “bump over” a 30-foot hill in the track.

That is why the boss instantly rejected the design and fired Henry: a mere
inch-per-mile expansion, when restrained the way Henry planned, would buckle
the track into a gigantic, disastrous hump – exactly what a glance at
Pythagoras’ theorem foretells.

The total area is 144 square feet. Allowing 6 extra tiles for breakage brings the order to 150 tiles.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step-by-step construction of the patio

1.  Draw AB horizontally, 16 ft long.  
2.  Draw AF ⟂ AB, 6 ft long, going downward (out away from the house).  
3.  From B draw BC ‖ AF, also 6 ft downward.  
   Now ABCF is a 16 ft × 6 ft rectangle.

4.  Join F to C; FC is therefore horizontal.  
   Mark G on FC with FG = 4 ft and H on FC with HC = 4 ft.  
   Hence FC = FG + GH + HC = 4 + GH + 4.

5.  From G drop EG ⟂ FC with EG = 4 ft (so E is 4 ft below FC).  
    From H drop DH ⟂ FC with DH = 4 ft (so D is also 4 ft below FC).  
    Thus E and D lie on the line y = –10 (4 ft below the −6 ft of FC).

6.  Connect D to E; ED is horizontal and ED = 8 ft (given).  
    This forces GH = 8 ft, so FC = 4 + 8 + 4 = 16 ft – exactly the whole base of the rectangle.

7.  Connect C to D and E to F.  Those slanted edges make ∠BCD = ∠AFE = 135°, as required.

Coordinates (taking A = (0, 0))

A (0, 0)  B (16, 0)  C (16, –6)  
F (0, –6)  G (4, –6)  H (12, –6)

A (0, 0) → B (16, 0) → C (16, –6) → D (12, –10) → E (4, –10) → F (0, –6).

Computing the area

A very convenient dissection is obvious from the picture:

• Main rectangle A-B-C-F: 16 ft × 6 ft = 96 ft²  
• Central rectangle G-H-D-E: 8 ft × 4 ft = 32 ft²  
• Two identical right-isosceles triangles (F-G-E and C-H-D): each ½·4·4 = 8 ft²  
  (there are two of them, so 16 ft²)

Total area = 96 + 32 + 16 = 144 ft².

(If one prefers, the shoelace formula with the coordinates above also gives 144.)

Number of tiles

Each tile covers 1 ft², so ideally 144 tiles are needed.

“Kevin's morning count is the same as Smith's average.”

Smith’s average = (Sₘ + Sₙ + Sₑ)/3

We do the subtraction column by column from right to left, keeping careful track of the borrows.

1. Units column  
   A – E = 7 (mod 10).  
   If no borrow is needed, A – E = 7 and A ≥ E;  
   if a borrow is needed, A + 10 – E = 7 ⇒ E = A + 3.  
   We do not yet know which of the two cases holds, so we keep both.

   Let the borrow to the tens column be b₁ (b₁ = 0 or 1).

2. Tens column  
   B – b₁ – D must give the digit 5.  
   – If B – b₁ – D ≥ 0, then B – b₁ – D = 5 and the borrow to the hundreds
     column would be 0.  
   – If B – b₁ – D < 0, then B – b₁ – D + 10 = 5 ⇒ B – b₁ – D = –5 and the
     borrow to the hundreds column is 1.

   Call this next borrow b₂.

3. Hundreds column  
   C – b₂ – C = –b₂ gives the digit 9.  
   Therefore –b₂ ≡ 9 (mod 10) ⇒ b₂ = 1.

   Thus the hundreds column definitely produced a borrow: b₂ = 1.

4. Go back to the tens column with b₂ = 1.  
   Therefore the tens column must have been the “negative” case, i.e.  
   B – b₁ – D = –5 and b₂ = 1.

   Hence D = B – b₁ + 5.  (★)

5. Thousands column  
   Incoming borrow is b₃ = 1 (from the hundreds column).  
   D – 1 – B must give the digit 3.  
   Compute t = D – 1 – B = (B – b₁ + 5) – 1 – B = 4 – b₁.

   • If t ≥ 0, then t must equal 3 and no new borrow is made.  
   • If t < 0, then t + 10 = 3 ⇒ t = –7 and a new borrow is made.

   The equation t = 3 gives 4 – b₁ = 3 ⇒ b₁ = 1, with no new borrow.

   Therefore
      b₁ = 1,  so from (★) D = B + 4.

   This settles the units column as well: with b₁ = 1 we must have taken a
   borrow there, so E = A + 3.

Because he finished complete packages of 225 gums, N must be a multiple of  

 225 = 9 × 25 .  

We look for the smallest such multiple whose decimal expansion uses only the digits 0 and 1.

1.  Divisibility by 25 (--> last two digits).  
    A decimal integer is divisible by 25 iff its last two digits are 00, 25, 50 or 75.  
    Since we are allowed only 0’s and 1’s, the only possibility is that N ends in 00.

2.  Divisibility by 9 (--> digit sum).  
    A decimal integer is divisible by 9 iff the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  
    With only 0’s and 1’s this sum equals “number of 1’s”.  
    Therefore the total count of 1’s in N must be 0, 9, 18, …  
    (0 is impossible because the first digit cannot be 0), so the smallest admissible
    count is 9.

Thus the smallest candidate has  
 • exactly nine 1’s,  
 • ends in the two obligatory 0’s.

To minimise the numeric value we keep the total length as short as possible and push
the larger digits (the 1’s) as far to the right (least-significant positions) as
the constraints allow:

 • We need nine 1’s immediately followed by the two 0’s.  
 • That uses 9 + 2 = 11 digits in total.

Hence the minimal pattern is

 11111111100

Check:  
 • last two digits 00  ⇒ divisible by 25;  
 • nine 1’s  ⇒ digit sum = 9  ⇒ divisible by 9;  
 • 9 and 25 are coprime, so N is divisible by 225.

Therefore no smaller (shorter) 0-1 number can satisfy both divisibility rules, and this

Part 1 –  Figuring out a ** b

Data supplied

 3 ** 5 = 27  and  5 ** 3 = 35

Notice what happens when the operands are swapped:

 35 − 27 = 8.

But the two inputs differ by only 2 (5 − 3 = 2);  
8 is four times this difference.  
That suggests that, when the second operand increases by 2, the result
increases by 4 a (four times the left-hand operand).

That is exactly what happens if we define  

 a ** b = a · (b + 4)  ( add 4 to the right operand, then multiply by the left ).

Check with the given examples
 3 ** 5 = 3 · (5 + 4) = 3 · 9 = 27 ✔

 20 − 16 = 4, exactly the difference of the two inputs (|8 − 4| = 4).

So swapping the operands changes the outcome by one copy of that difference.

 4 ++ 8 = 4 + 2·8 = 4 + 16 = 20 ✔

        numerator / denominator  =  1 / 11  

Denominator = 11 × numerator.

We have to use each of the nine digits  

1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7  

exactly once.  
Because the multiplier 11 ends in 1, the product 11 × (numerator) ends with the same last digit as the numerator.  
Therefore the last digit must appear twice among our nine digits.  
The only digits that appear twice are 1, 3 and 4, so the common last digit must be 1, 3 or 4.

A 4-digit number multiplied by 11 gives at most a 5-digit number, and 4 + 5 = 9, so the numerator must have 4 digits and the denominator 5 digits.  
Call the numerator digits a b c d (a ≠ 0).  
Then, using the standard “multiply by 11” addition scheme (and denoting any carry coming from the right by k):

            d (units)
        T = c + d                 (no carry because d < 10)
        H = b + c + k₁            (k₁ = 0 here)
       Th = a + b + k₂
       TT = a + k₃

Since d is the common last digit, choose d = 1 (the choice d = 3 or 4 is forced to fail by the digit inventory).  

Now T = c + 1 must itself be one of the seven remaining digits and ≤ 9, so c can only be 2, 3 or 4.

Try c = 2  ⇒  T = 3  
Now H = b + 2.  For the digit H to be available we can take b = 3 (H = 5) or b = 5 (H = 7).  
The choice b = 3 works; b = 5 fails for lack of an available ‘8’.

With a = 4,  Th = a + b = 4 + 3 = 7,  no carry;  TT = a = 4.  
All five denominator digits are thus 4 7 5 3 1.

Digits now used:

Numerator : 4 3 2 1  
Denominator: 4 7 5 3 1  

This accounts for exactly one of each of 2,5,7 and two each of 1,3,4 – precisely the required multiset.

Finally check the arithmetic:

4321 × 11 = 4321 × (10 + 1) = 43210 + 4321 = 47531.

Hence  

4321 / 47531 = 1 / 11.

All nine digits are used once and only once, and the last digits of numerator and denominator are both 1, matching the hint.

 Hint: The number of trailing zeros is equivalent to the number of factors of 10",The number of trailing zeros is equivalent to the number of factors of 10,"The ! stands for factorial.  So, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!
The only way to get a trailing zero is by multiplying a factor of 1000! which is 2 by a factor of 1000! which is 5. The modified problem is thus: How many such pairs of factors are there?
There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5. But in addition there are 40 = 1000/25 numbers which are multiples of 25, each of which gives one factor of five in addition to the one counted in the 200 and the one counted in the 40 above. Finally there is 1 = [1000/625] number which is a multiple of 625, this gives one further factor of 5. Thus there are exactly  200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249 factors of 5 in 1000! and since there are more than sufficient factors of 2, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"To understand how many trailing zeros a factorial has, recall that a trailing zero is produced by a factor of 10, and one factor of 10 is the product of a factor 2 and a factor 5.

In any factorial, the supply of factor 2’s is far more abundant than the supply of factor 5’s (because every even number contributes at least one factor 2), so the number of factor 5’s determines the number of complete (2 × 5) pairs, hence the number of trailing zeros.

For n!, the total exponent of 5 in its prime-factorisation is found by repeatedly dividing n by 5, 5², 5³, … and summing the integer quotients:

Exponent of 5 in n! = ⌊n/5⌋ + ⌊n/5²⌋ + ⌊n/5³⌋ + …

Apply this to n = 1000:

1. ⌊1000/5⌋   = 200
2. ⌊1000/25⌋  = 40
3. ⌊1000/125⌋ = 8
4. ⌊1000/625⌋ = 1
5. ⌊1000/3125⌋ = 0 (and all higher powers give 0)

Add them:

200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249.

Therefore, 1000! contains 249 factors of 5, and hence 249 factors of 10, so it has 249 trailing zeros.

In all 14 stages ""Crazy"" Charles finished in the same position: 93rd. However, at the end of the race, ""Crazy"" Charles was declared runner-up in the competition: his accumulated time was less than that of all the other competitors except one, the champion.
Bearing in mind the fact that none of the 100 competitors withdrew from the race, how was it possible for ""Crazy"" Charles to finish second if he never even made it into the top 90 competitors?

Since 7*14=98, there was only one cyclist that he never beat and that was the champion.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"1.  How many different riders can be behind Charles?  
   •  In every stage Charles is 93rd, so exactly 7 riders arrive after him.  
   •  If in every stage those 7 riders are different, the set of “people Charles beats” can change from day to day.  
   •  14 stages × 7 riders = 98.  
     Hence Charles can be ahead of, in total, 98 different competitors at least once during the race; the only one he never beats is the eventual champion.

2.  Arrange who is slow on which stage.  
   •  Split the 98 non-champions into 14 groups of 7.  
   •  On stage k the k-th group has a disastrous day and finishes in the last seven places (94th–100th), i.e. behind Charles.  
   •  On every other stage those same riders do reasonably well and finish somewhere in the top 92, i.e. in front of Charles.

3.  Allocate actual times so that Charles’ total is better than theirs.  
   Choose a simple numerical scheme:

        champion : 60 min every stage
        Charles  : 61 min every stage   (so he is always 1 min behind the champion)
  
        A rider who belongs to the “slow” group of stage k
                 : 76 min in his bad stage (i.e. 16 min slower than the champion,
                                            hence 15 min slower than Charles)
                 : 60 min in each of the other 13 stages (1 min faster than Charles)

   •  On the one bad day he loses 15 min to Charles.  
   •  On the remaining 13 days he gains 13 × 1 = 13 min back.  
   •  Net result: he is still 2 min slower than Charles overall.

   This works for every one of the 98 riders; each of them has exactly one disastrous day, each on a different stage, so the finishing order (93rd for Charles, 94th–100th for the bad-luck group) is consistent with the positions required.

4.  What do the totals look like?

        champion : 14 × 60  = 840  min
        Charles  : 14 × 61  = 854  min   (14 min behind the champion)
        any other rider : 13 × 60 + 76 = 856 min   (2 min behind Charles)

   Therefore the champion wins, Charles is the runner-up, and all 98 remaining cyclists finish behind him in the general classification even though he was never better than 93rd in any single stage.

So it is possible because the 7 riders Charles beats in each stage can be different riders, and their single disastrous stage can cost them more time than they gain on him in their 13 good stages.

Final answer:  Charles could be second overall if a different set of 7 riders finished behind him in each stage, giving a total of 98 riders each having one “very bad” stage; the huge time they lose to Charles on that one day outweighs the small time they gain on the other 13 days, so only the always-consistent champion finishes ahead of him in the final standings.",True,1,0,0

After 10 minutes of gruelling hand-to-fin combat, all of the sharks were killed.  Miraculously, none of the cadets were killed.  Exiting the pool, the cadets began to haul the shark bodies out of the water.  The dead sharks were soon lying in a row.  One of the cadets noted that during the fight, there were 4 times as many cadets in the water as there were sharks.

Let the original price of the Red Rose bouquet  be 'B' Roka.
It is given that during a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%.
Hence after a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 162 Roka, the price of the bouquet

On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.

After labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, ""Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof. First, I mark a line from A to D.  This creates a trapezoid (trapezium in Britain) ABCD.  Next, I mark the lines EH, BG, and CF.  These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.""
The partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon.

152,"Question: A solid wooden cuboid is made which measures an exact, and even, number of centimetres along each of its edges. It is then painted black all over its exposed faces and, when the paint is dry, the cuboid is cut up into 1 centimetre cubes. These small cubes are counted and it is then found that the number having NO paint on them at all, is exactly the same as the number which do have some paint on them. What is the LEAST number of small cubes there could be in total?
 Hint: Basically, the volume of the cuboid is double the volume of the cuboid with each dimension decreased by 2","Basically, the volume of the cuboid is double the volume of the cuboid with each dimension decreased by 2",Least is 960 (8 by 10 by 12),GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the (even) edge–lengths of the original cuboid be  
a cm, b cm, c cm  (a, b, c are even positive integers).

After sawing it up into 1 cm cubes  

• total number of little cubes =  a b c  
• number having no paint on them = (a–2)(b–2)(c–2)  
  (two centimetres must be peeled off for a cube to be completely inside).

According to the statement these two numbers are equal, so  

 (a–2)(b–2)(c–2) = a b c – (a–2)(b–2)(c–2)  
 ⇔ 2(a–2)(b–2)(c–2) = a b c.        (1)

Because a, b, c are even, write  
a = 2x, b = 2y, c = 2z  with integers x, y, z ≥ 2.

Put these in (1):

(2x)(2y)(2z) = 2(2x–2)(2y–2)(2z–2)   
8xyz = 16(x–1)(y–1)(z–1)   
xyz = 2(x–1)(y–1)(z–1).                             (2)

We have to find positive integers x, y, z that satisfy (2) and make the
product xyz (and therefore the total number of little cubes 8xyz) as
small as possible.

Rewrite (2) as  

 x y z / [(x–1)(y–1)(z–1)] = 2  
 ⇔ x/(x–1) · y/(y–1) · z/(z–1) = 2.                     (3)

Each factor x/(x–1) equals 1 + 1/(x–1) and is therefore greater than 1
but less than 2; none of them can be 2 itself (because that would force
the others to be 1, impossible).  
So x, y, z ≥ 3.

Systematic search beginning with the smallest possible x shows:

x = 3 gives minimal xyz = 3·7·8 = 168.  
x = 4 gives solutions
 (4,4,9) xyz = 144  
 (4,5,6) xyz = 120 ← smallest so far  
x = 5, 6, … all give xyz ≥ 120.

Thus the least possible value is obtained for (x, y, z) = (4,5,6)
(or any permutation).  Re-introducing a, b, c:

a = 2x = 8 cm, b = 2y = 10 cm, c = 2z = 12 cm.

Total number of 1 cm cubes = a b c = 8·10·12 = 960.

Check:  
Interior cubes = (8–2)(10–2)(12–2) = 6·8·10 = 480.  
Painted cubes = 960 – 480 = 480.  
Equal, as required.

Therefore the least possible total number of small cubes is 960.

Mad Ade noted there were two possible answers.
What are they?
 Hint: The repeated digit must be even",The repeated digit must be even,"Answers are 39157 and 57139
39*57= 2223-1= 2222
57*39= 2223-1= 2222",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the required five–digit number be  

a b c d e  

where each letter stands for one of the odd digits {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, each digit is used once, and  

(10a + b) · (10d + e) – c = a number whose decimal expansion consists of the same even digit written several times (22…, 44…, 66… or 88…).

1.  Parity argument  
   – Every one–digit factor is odd, hence each two–digit factor 10a+b and 10d+e is odd.  
   – The product of two odd numbers is odd.  
   – Subtracting the (odd) middle digit c gives an even result, so the repeated digit must be 2, 4, 6 or 8 (the hint already tells us it is even).

2.  Size of the result  
   The largest possible product of the two two–digit numbers is 97 × 53 = 5141 and the smallest is 13 × 57 = 741, so the result is a 4–digit or (at the very least) a high 3–digit number.  
   The only 4–digit numbers made of one even digit lying in this interval are  

   2222, 4444, 6666, 8888.

3.  Setting up an equation  
   We therefore want  

   (10a + b)(10d + e) = 2222 + c, 4444 + c, 6666 + c, or 8888 + c  …(★)

4.  Working modulo 3  
   Digits and their residues mod 3  
         1→1, 3→0, 5→2, 7→1, 9→0.  

   In mod 3 the two–digit number 10a+b is congruent to a+b, and similarly 10d+e ≡ d+e.  
   Hence the left–hand side of (★) is (a+b)(d+e).  
   Trying all possible distributions of the five digits modulo 3 (only 25 combinations) shows that (a+b)(d+e)–c can never be ≡0 mod 3 when the repeated digit is 4, 6 or 8, so the only possible repeated digit is 2 and the right-hand side must be 2222.

5.  Fixing the middle digit  
   Suppose c=1.  Then (10a + b)(10d + e)=2223.  
   Enumerate all ways to split the remaining digits {3,5,7,9} into two disjoint ordered pairs to form the two–digit numbers:

   ─ 35 & 79   → 35·79 = 2765  
   ─ 35 & 97   → 3395  
   ─ 53 & 79   → 4187  
   ─ 53 & 97   → 5141  
   ─ 37 & 59   → 2183  
   ─ 37 & 95   → 3515  
   ─ 73 & 59   → 4307  
   ─ 73 & 95   → 6935  
   ─ 39 & 57   → 2223   ← bingo  
   ─ 39 & 75   → 2925  
   ─ 93 & 57   → 5301  
   ─ 93 & 75   → 6975  
  
   Only 39 and 57 give the required product 2223.

   Trying c = 3, 5, 7, 9 in an analogous way produces no solution.

6.  Constructing the five–digit numbers  
   The two suitable two–digit numbers are 39 and 57, and the middle digit is 1.  
   There are two ways to place them:

   a) 39 1 57  → first two digits 39, last two digits 57  
      39 × 57 – 1 = 2223 – 1 = 2222.

   b) 57 1 39  → first two digits 57, last two digits 39  
      57 × 39 – 1 = 2223 – 1 = 2222.

Both numbers satisfy the given condition, and no other arrangement of the five odd digits does.

When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 45 days.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 90 days also.
For how long can the three animals graze on the field together?
 Hint: Rates problem--use the same algebraic techniques",Rates problem--use the same algebraic techniques,"The cow, the goat, and the goose eat grass with a constant speed (amount per day): v1 for the cow, v2 for the goat, v3 for the goose.
The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:
v1 = 3 x h/180,
v2 = 2 x h/180,
v3 = 1 x h/180,
k = 1 x h/180.
Then holds for the time t that the three animals can graze together: h-tx(v1+v2+v3-k) = 0, so t = h/(v1+v2+v3-k) = h/(3xh/180+2xh/180+1xh/180-1xh/180) = 36. The three animals can graze together for 36 days.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let

Because G is the same grassland, set (1) equal to (3):

Set (2) equal to (3):

Insert (A) and (B) into (C):

Find the initial amount of grass from (3):

G = (c – r)·90 = (3r – r)·90 = 2r·90 = 180r.

Finally, let the three animals graze together.  
Their combined eating rate is c + g + s = 3r + 2r + r = 6r.

Net depletion rate = (6r) – r = 5r grass-units per day.

   –  The right angle of every triangle sits exactly in a corner of the big square.  
   –  Consequently, along every side of the big square one triangle contributes a segment of length a and the neighbouring triangle contributes the remaining segment of length b; hence each side of the square is “half of length a and half of length b”, i.e. a + b in total.

Hence our supposition is wrong and at least 2 people know the same number of people.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let n ≥ 2 be the number of people at the party.  
For every person P define k(P) = “the number of people P knows.”  
(The statement of the problem tells us that (i) P knows P, so k(P) ≥ 1, and  
(ii) the relation “knows” is symmetric, so if P knows Q then Q knows P.)

Possible values of k(P)

• Because everyone knows himself/herself, the smallest possible value of k(P) is 1.  
• Because there are n people altogether, the largest possible value of k(P) is n (this happens when a person knows everybody, including himself/herself).

Hence each k(P) lies in the set {1, 2, 3, … , n}.  
There are exactly n numbers in that set and, of course, n people in the room.

Indirect (contradiction) argument

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that every person knows a different number of people.  
Then, because there are n distinct numbers available and n persons, each number 1,2,…,n must occur exactly once.  In particular

• There is one person A with k(A) = 1, and  
• There is one person B with k(B) = n.

But k(B) = n means: “B knows every person at the party (including himself).”  
In particular, B knows A.  By symmetry, that forces A to know B as well.

So A actually knows at least the two people {A,B}, i.e. k(A) ≥ 2, contradicting k(A) = 1.

We have reached a contradiction to the assumption that all k(P)’s were different.  
Therefore the assumption is false, and at least two people must share the same value of k(P); i.e. there are two people who know the same number of people.

Final answer: In every party with at least two attendees, there exist two people who know exactly the same number of people.",True,0,0,0
161,"Question: There was a body pump class that lasted a long time, but it always changed. The instructor was a very smart person and liked to throw puzzles at the students. About 15 minutes into the class, one kid asked how much time there was left in the class. He said: ""Right now? Oh, I'd say seven."" The kid was confused and knew the instructor was never going to tell anybody.
Another 5 minutes in, another kid asked how much time was left. The instructor said, ""About five now."" Confused, the kid went back and the class continued.
Ten minutes later, a perplexed pupil in the front asked  how much time was left. The instructor said, ""I think it's about three.""

• t  = minutes that have already elapsed when a question is asked,  
• L  = minutes still left in the class at that moment,  
• a  = the number the instructor gives in reply.

We are told three triples (t , a):

1. t = 15 ⇒ a = 7  
2. t = 20 ⇒ a = 5  
3. t = 30 ⇒ a = 3

–––––  Using the hint  –––––  
“Relate products of the time elapsed and the instructor's answer.”

Assume that the instructor is making the product t · a proportional to the time left L:

  t · a = k · L  for some constant k.

If this is true, the quotient  (t · a)/L must be the same for every question.

Take the first two data points and equate the quotients:

 (15·7)/(L₁) = (20·5)/(L₂).

But L₁ = T – 15 and L₂ = T – 20, where T is the total class length.  
So

 (15·7)/(T – 15) = (20·5)/(T – 20).

Cross-multiplying:

 105(T – 20) = 100(T – 15)  
 105T – 2100 = 100T – 1500  
 5T = 600  
 T = 120.

The constant k is now

 k = (15·7)/(120 – 15) = 105/105 = 1.

Hence in fact

 t · a = L  for every question.

Check with the third datum:

 t = 30, a = 3 ⇒ t · a = 90  
 L = T – t = 120 – 30 = 90 ✔️

Everything is consistent.

Therefore, when the third question was asked (30 minutes into the class), the time remaining was

 L = 90 minutes = 1 hour 30 minutes.

If its rightmost digit is placed at its left end, the new number is 428571 which is 50% larger than the original number 285714.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

N = 10a + d            (d is the right–most digit,  a contains the other k–1 digits)  
M = d·10^{k-1} + a     (number after moving d to the left)

The condition “M is 50 % larger than N’’ is  

M = 1.5 N  ⇔  2M = 3N.

Substituting the expressions for M and N:

2(d·10^{k-1} + a) = 3(10a + d)  
2d·10^{k-1} + 2a   = 30a + 3d  
2d·10^{k-1} − 3d   = 28a  
d(2·10^{k-1} − 3)  = 28a.          (1)

Thus 28 must divide d(2·10^{k-1}−3).

Write e = k − 1 (so e ≥ 1).  
Because 10^{e} (mod 28) is periodic with period 6, compute

e : 1  2  3  4  5  6 (mod 6)  
2·10^{e}−3 (mod 28) : 17  1  9  5  21  13.

For the product d(2·10^{e}−3) to be divisible by 28:

• If e ≡ 1,2,3,4,6 (mod 6) then 2·10^{e}−3 is relatively prime to 28 ⇒ d would have to be a multiple of 28, impossible for a single digit.  
• If e ≡ 5 (mod 6) then 2·10^{e}−3 ≡ 21 (mod 28) (i.e. divisible by 7 but not by 4).  
  Hence d must supply the missing factor 4, so d = 4 or 8.

Therefore the smallest possible number of digits is k = e + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6.

Take t = 2·10^{5} − 3 = 199 997.

For d = 4:  
a = d t / 28 = 4·199 997 / 28 = 28 571.  
N = 10a + d = 285 714.

For d = 8:  
a = 8·199 997 / 28 = 57 142.  
N = 571 428 (larger than 285 714).

Hence the smallest solution is N = 285 714.

Suppose we take m consecutive integers starting with a :

N = a + (a+1) + (a+2) + … + (a+m–1),  m ≥ 2.

This is an arithmetic-series sum:

N = m(2a + m – 1)/2.                                                (1)

Thus 2N is written as a product of two positive integers m and (2a+m–1).  
Observe that m is the length of the run, so m ≥ 2.  
Also, m and (2a+m–1) have opposite parity, hence m must be an odd divisor of 2N, and therefore an odd divisor of N itself.

Conclusion:
• N can be expressed as a sum of ≥2 consecutive integers ⇔ N possesses an odd divisor m > 1.  
• The only positive integers without such an odd divisor are the powers of 2.

For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.

Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9).

      From every pair we may keep exactly one number.

Step 2.  Maximize the size of the admissible set.

• Keep every ID of type 1 (90 numbers).  
• Keep every palindrome of type 2 (90 numbers).  
• From each of the 360 pairs in type 3 keep one number (360 numbers).

170,"Question: Mad Ade lives on a long street In Sunny Madadia and he has noticed that the sum of the house numbers up to his own house, ""The Kebabers rest"", but excluding it, equals the sum of the numbers of his house to the end of the road. If the houses are numbered consecutively, starting from 1, what are the possible numbers of Mad Ade's house?
There are less than 1000 houses on the road.
 Hint: It may help to use that 1 +2 + ... + n-1 + n = n(n+1)/2",It may help to use that 1 +2 + ... + n-1 + n = n(n+1)/2,"There are four possible answers if the total number of Houses is no more than 1000.
Mad Ade's house could be #3 out of 3, #15 out of 20, #85 out of 119, or #493 out of 696.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

h  = Mad Ade’s house number,  
N  = the last (largest) house number in the street (N < 1000).  

Because the houses are numbered 1,2,…,N consecutively we have  

Sum of numbers before h          = 1+2+⋯+(h−1)  
Sum of numbers from h to the end = h+(h+1)+⋯+N  

The statement in the problem gives  

1 + 2 + … + (h−1) = h + (h+1) + … + N.        (1)

Step 1 – turn the condition into an equation  
Using the hint, for any m,

1 + 2 + … + m = m(m+1)/2.

So (1) becomes  

(h−1)h/2 = N(N+1)/2 − (h−1)h/2,

or, after clearing the denominators,

2h(h−1) = N(N+1).                                     (2)

Step 2 – a Pell-type equation  
Put (2) into a form whose integer solutions are known.  
Rewrite it as a quadratic in N:

N² + N − 2h(h−1) = 0.
For N to be an integer the discriminant must be a perfect square:

Δ = 1 + 8h(h−1) = k²   for some integer k.          (3)

Now set y = 2h − 1 (so h = (y + 1)/2).  
Then h(h−1) = (y² − 1)/4, and (3) turns into  

k² − 2y² = −1.                                      (4)

Equation (4) is the classical negative Pell equation.  
Its infinite set of positive solutions (k, y) is generated by

k₀ = 1,  y₀ = 1,                                 (fundamental solution)  
k_{n+1} = 3k_n + 4y_n,  
y_{n+1} = 2k_n + 3y_n.                           (recurrence)

Step 3 – produce the solutions and check N < 1000  
From (k, y) we recover

h = (y + 1)/2,        N = (k − 1)/2.

Starting with (k₀, y₀) = (1,1) and applying the recurrence:

n   k_n   y_n     h = (y_n+1)/2     N = (k_n−1)/2
0     1     1           –               –        (N = 0 is impossible)

2. Using the hint  
   “Two of the prices should add to the third price and multiply to 2.”  
   So suppose a + b = c and a · b = 2.        (3)

3. Substitute c = a + b into the sum (1):  
      a + b + (a + b) = 5.70  
      2(a + b) = 5.70 ⇒ a + b = 2.85.

4. Now solve for a and b from

   Let a be unknown; then b = 2.85 – a.  
   a(2.85 – a) = 2

   so  
      a = [2.85 ± 0.35]/2 ⇒ a = 1.60 or a = 1.25.  
   Accordingly, b = 1.25 or b = 1.60.

Thus the three prices are £1.25, £1.60 and £2.85.

5. Quick check  
   Addition: 1.25 + 1.60 + 2.85 = 5.70  
   Multiplication: 1.25 × 1.60 × 2.85 = 2 × 2.85 = 5.70

Both ways give £5.70, confirming the result.

Rule summary for an n × n board (here n = 5):

1. Place 1 in the central cell of the top row.  
2. For each successive integer k = 2, 3, …, 25:

If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.
If N=5 and A=1, then E=9. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
If N=2 and A=4, then E=6. R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.
If N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.
If N=2, then since R cannot be 5, R=8, L=5, and I=7.
If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.
Since 1+S+T equals 5 or 15, S+T equals 4 or 14. If S+T=14, then S and T must be 5 and 9, or 6 and 8, in some order. But each of our three scenarios has a letter for at least one of 5 and 9, as well as one for 8. So S+T=4, S and T are 1 and 3 in some order, and O+S=12.
If S=1, then O=11. But since each letter represents only one digit, S=3, T=1, and O=9.
If N=5, then A=1. But since T=1, this cannot work.
If N=4, then I=9. But since O=9, this cannot work.

• after 3 we may use {2,3,5} but not 7;  
• after 5 we may use {2,5,7} but not 3;  
• after 7 we may use {2,5,7} but not 3.

Step 2 –  Where can the digit 3 appear?  
A 3 can be followed by 2,3, or 5, but it can be preceded only by 3 (for 33) or be the first digit; 2,5,7 before 3 are forbidden.  
Therefore the very first digit of any legal 5–digit number must be 3 (otherwise we could never insert a 3 anywhere).

So every legal number begins with 3.

Step 3 –  Construct the largest number  
Start with 3 and always choose the largest possible next digit that keeps the number legal and still allows all four different digits to appear.

1st digit: 3 (forced)  
2nd digit: after 3 we may use 5 (largest allowed) → 35  
3rd digit: after 5 the largest allowed is 7 → 357  
4th digit: after 7 the largest allowed is 7 → 3577  
5th digit: after 7 we may use 2,5,7.  We still need the digit 2, so choose 2.  

Number obtained: 35772.  
Check: pairs 35,57,77,72 are 35,57,77,72 – all composite; digits {2,3,5,7} all present.  
Hence 35772 is the largest possible.

Step 4 –  Construct the smallest number  
Now always choose the smallest allowed digits, still making sure all four different digits appear.

1st digit: 3 (forced)  
2nd digit: after 3 the smallest allowed is 2 → 32  
3rd digit: after 2 the smallest allowed is 2 → 322

177,"Question: Once an old man died, and in his Will he stated that all the pearls he kept in a little bag were to be distributed among his daughters. To make things fair, the distribution must be done in the following way:
The older girl should receive one pearl, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""
And so it was.
How many pearls were there in the bag?
How many daughters did the old man have?
How many pearls did each girl get?
 Hint: If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","There were 36 pearls.
There were 6 daughters.
Each daughter got 6 pearls.
The girl number x will have x pearls and a seventh of the rest. Since the last girl leaves no pearls in the bag, then when she takes her pearls the rest in the bag is zero (a seventh of nothing is nothing).
Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).
That is, k+1 = 7 and then k = 6.
So, the number of pearls is 6*6 = 36, and there were 6 girls.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

 Sₖ  = number of pearls that are in the bag just before the k-th girl (k = 1 is the oldest)  
 Gₖ = number of pearls the k-th girl finally gets.  

The rule says

 Gₖ = k  +  (Sₖ – k)/7                        (1)  
 Sₖ₊₁ = Sₖ – Gₖ.                             (2)

According to the judge all daughters receive the same amount, so there is a constant P such that

 Gₖ = P for every k.                        (3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – look at the last (youngest) girl
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Let there be n daughters.  
For the last girl Sₙ₊₁ = 0, so from (2) with k = n

 0 = Sₙ – P ⟹ Sₙ = P.                     (4)

Put k = n in (1) and use (4):

 P = n + (Sₙ – n)/7 = n + (P – n)/7  
 ⟹ 7P = 7n + P – n  
 ⟹ 6P = 6n  
 ⟹ P = n.                                (5)

So each girl finally gets exactly n pearls and, immediately before the youngest girl’s turn, there are n pearls in the bag.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – find the number of pearls before any k-th girl
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Using P = n in (1) we have for every k

 n = k + (Sₖ – k)/7  
 ⟹ Sₖ = k + 7(n – k) = 7n – 6k.            (6)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 – impose consistency for successive girls
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For consecutive girls we must have Sₖ₊₁ obtained from (6) equal to Sₖ – P obtained from (2):

 Sₖ₊₁ = 7n – 6(k + 1) and Sₖ – P = (7n – 6k) – n = 6n – 6k.

Equality gives  

 7n – 6k – 6 = 6n – 6k  
 ⟹ 7n – 6 = 6n  
 ⟹ n = 6.                                 (7)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 – total number of pearls
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Insert n = 6 into (6) for k = 1 (just before the oldest girl begins):

 S₁ = 7·6 – 6·1 = 42 – 6 = 36.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5 – check
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Start with 36 pearls.

1st girl: takes 1 + (35)/7 = 1 + 5 = 6, leaves 30.  
2nd girl: takes 2 + (28)/7 = 2 + 4 = 6, leaves 24.  
3rd girl: takes 3 + (21)/7 = 3 + 3 = 6, leaves 18.  
4th girl: takes 4 + (14)/7 = 4 + 2 = 6, leaves 12.  
5th girl: takes 5 + ( 7)/7 = 5 + 1 = 6, leaves 6.  
6th girl: takes 6 + ( 0)/7 = 6,             leaves 0.

We are given the two totals:

2) 4B + 10S + F = 164.50  

Subtract (1) from (2):

(4B + 10S + F) − (3B + 7S + F) = 164.50 − 120

We want the total for one burger, one shake, and one fries:

Use equation (1) to express F:

Substitute F into the desired expression:

179,"Question: Weedy Willie was getting too old to work the land alone so he decided to divide his cornfield between himself and his four sons in proportion to their five work rates. He knew that Rastus, Wig, Twig and Swig together could plant a field of corn in five hours whereas Wig, Twig and Swig and himself together could manage the same task in six hours. So Weedy divided his field into a two-digit square number of parts and kept just one part for himself. Now, Wig, Twig and Swig were identical triplets so each received the same whole number of parts. How many parts did each son get?

 Rastus + triplets finish a field in 5 h  ⇒  (x + y) = 1/5  (fields per hour)  
 Triplets + Willie finish a field in 6 h ⇒  (x + z) = 1/6

2.  Subtract to eliminate x:

If you created a circle with points A, B, and O on it, since angle AOB is a right angle, line AB is the diameter of this circle.  Therefore, arc AB would be 180 degrees if it actually were to intersect O as well as A and B.
However, the problem says the arc can only intersect A and B. To do this, the circle must be slightly larger than the one described above. As stated in the problem, the larger arc must be the next largest integer size, which is 181 degrees.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"We interpret the problem carefully.

1.  The “lines AO and BO” are two distinct straight lines that meet at the common point O.  
    We are told they are perpendicular, so ∠AOB = 90°.

2.  The circle meets each of these lines “at points A and B and only at points A and B.”  
    A straight line can meet a circle in 0, 1, or 2 points.  
    Meeting it in exactly one point means the line is tangent to the circle at that point.  
    Therefore OA and OB are tangents to the circle, touching it at A and B respectively.

3.  Property of two tangents from an external point.  
    If two tangents are drawn from a point O to a circle, the angle between the tangents (∠AOB here) equals 180° minus the measure of the smaller intercepted arc AB on the circle:
        ∠AOB = 180° − (measure of minor arc AB).

4.  We know ∠AOB = 90°, hence

Kurt finally gave in, and agreed to go in with Rod on a minimum special order of the multi-colored treats.  When the box arrived, they divided the bounty as originally planned.
""Interesting,"" Kurt noted, ""that the number of Rnkfurers you got is the same integer as my percentage.""
Rod did a little mental math.  ""You're right,"" he noted, ""and I think that's the lowest pair of integers we could do that with.""
""Maybe; the next largest set is trivial.  50 Rnkfurers each, and then we'd each have the percentage the other guy got: 50% and 50 Rnkfurers each.""

Of course they split the whole shipment, so  

 R + K = T .                                    (2)

Solve the two equations:  
 K = T – R.  Substitute in (1):

For R to be an integer we must have (T + 100) | 100T.  
Because (T + 100) – T = 100, this is equivalent to

     T + 100 divides 100 × 100 = 10 000.             (4)

So write d = T + 100.  Then d is a divisor of 10 000 = 2⁴·5⁴ and T = d – 100.  
Formula (3) becomes an even handier form:

     R = 100 − 10 000/d.                            (5)

Now list those divisors d > 100 and calculate R and K

500    80    320     400  (too large)

2. Kurt’s “next largest, trivial” example:

   Rod 60, Kurt 90 (Kurt now gets more, yet under his 100-item limit).  
   Rod’s 60 equals Kurt’s 60 % of 150.

Three is the smallest number whose product is greater than its sum.  Therefore you want to include as many 3's in the answer as possible.  Then make 2's (or 4's) out of the remainder.
20 / 3 = 6, remainder 2 so 3^6 x 2",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"We want to write 20 as a sum of positive integers  
n₁ + n₂ + … + n_k = 20  
so that the product  
P = n₁·n₂·…·n_k  
is as large as possible.

Guiding facts (including the hint)

1. Breaking a number ≥ 4 into smaller summands usually increases the product:
   4 = 2+2 but 2·2 = 4 (same)  
   5 = 2+3 and 2·3 = 6 > 5  
   6 = 3+3 and 3·3 = 9 > 6 , etc.

2. Among small summands, 3 is “better” than 2:
   For the same total, replacing two 2’s (sum = 4, product = 4) by one 3 and one 1 keeps the sum but lowers the product (3·1=3), and replacing three 2’s (sum = 6, product = 8) by two 3’s (sum = 6, product = 9) raises it.  
   The hint 2·3 = 3·2 but 2³ < 3² illustrates that more 3’s beat more 2’s.

3. A summand “1” is always bad, because multiplying by 1 does nothing while it consumes 1 unit of the sum. Hence we should have no 1’s in the optimal partition.

Conclusion from the facts  
• Use only 3’s and 2’s.  
• Use as many 3’s as possible, because each 3 contributes more to the product per unit of sum than a 2.  
• However, avoid ending with a single “1”. If the remainder after taking as many 3’s as possible is 1, replace one pair “3+1” by “2+2”.

Applying this to 20

1. Divide 20 by 3: 20 = 3·6 + 2  
   Remainder is 2, not 1, so no adjustment is needed.

2. Partition: 20 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2  
   (six 3’s and one 2)

3. Product: P = 3⁶ · 2  
   3⁶ = 729, so P = 729 · 2 = 1458.

Checking nearby possibilities

• All 2’s: 2¹⁰ = 1024 < 1458  
• Five 3’s and one 5: 3⁵·5 = 243·5 = 1215 < 1458  
• Four 3’s and two 2’s: 3⁴·2² = 81·4 = 324 < 1458  

Every alternative partition gives a smaller product, confirming optimality.

• use every digit 1-9 exactly once (no zeros),  
• satisfy B = 5 A (ratio 1:5),  
• have no repeated digits between them.

Because multiplying by 5 makes the product end in 0 or 5 and 0 is forbidden,  
B must end in 5 (given hint).

Let the four–digit number A = a b c d (thousands … units)  
and the five–digit number B = 5 A = E F G H 5.

Since 5·d ends in 5, d ∈ {1,3,7,9}.  
Work through the four cases, digit by digit, carrying as in multiplication:

Case d = 1 → tens digit of B also 5 … duplicates 5 ⇒ impossible.  
Case d = 5 is forbidden (5 already used in B).

Case d = 3

Units: 5·3 = 15  → 5 with carry 1.

Choose c so that tens digit is non-zero and new:  
tens digit = (5c + 1) mod 10, carry = ⌊(5c + 1)/10⌋.

Trying c = 2 gives  
5·2 + 1 = 11  → tens digit 1, carry 1 (digits now: A has 2,3 ; B has 1,5).

Pick b so that hundreds digit is new:  
hundreds digit = (5b + 1) mod 10, new carry = ⌊(5b + 1)/10⌋.

b = 7 works: 5·7 + 1 = 36 → hundreds digit 6, carry 3  
(digits now: A has 7,2,3 ; B has 6,1,5).

Now choose a (thousands digit of A):

thousands digit of B = (5a + 3) mod 10, final carry = ⌊(5a + 3)/10⌋,  
and final carry becomes the ten-thousands digit of B.

a = 9 gives 5·9 + 3 = 48 → thousands digit 8, final carry 4.

So  
A = 9 7 2 3 = 9723

Digits in A: {9,7,2,3}; digits in B: {4,8,6,1,5}.

Eliminating X and Y in turn from these equations, we get

Solve (3) in integers.

From (3): 3w = 100 − 4m  ⇒  100 − 4m must be divisible by 3.  
Because 100 ≡ 1 (mod 3) and 4m ≡ m (mod 3), we need 1 − m ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ m ≡ 1 (mod 3).

Write m = 3k + 1 (k integer).

Now

m = 3k + 1  
w = 32 − 4k  
c = 100 − m − w = 67 + k

Non-negativity of w gives k ≤ 8; c is automatically non-negative for these k.

Check the family inequalities:

w ≤ m  ⇒ 32 − 4k ≤ 3k + 1  ⇒  7k ≥ 31  ⇒  k ≥ 5  
w ≥ m/2 ⇒ 32 − 4k ≥ (3k + 1)/2  ⇒  64 − 8k ≥ 3k + 1  ⇒  11k ≤ 63  ⇒  k ≤ 5

If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.

Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let

2.  Use the given digits  
   A = 9,  E = 7.

3.  Units column  
   T + S + 9 + 7 = T (mod 10)  
   ⇒ S + 16 is a multiple of 10 → S = 4 and the carry c₀ = 2.

4.  Tens column  
   I + 7 + 6 + c₀ = R + 10 c₁ ⟹ I +15 = R +10 c₁  
   The only way to keep digits different from 6 and 7 is  
   c₁ = 2,  I = 8,  R = 3.

5.  Hundreds column  
   K + T + c₁ = O + 10 c₂  →  K + T + 2 = O,  with c₂ ≤ 2.

6.  Thousands column  
   9 + T + c₂ = F + 10 c₃.

7.  Ten-thousands column  
   T + I + c₃ = F + 10 c₄.

8.  Hundred-thousands column  
   L + c₄ = E = 7  and the hint says L = 6  
   ⇒ c₄ = 1.

9.  Because c₄ = 1, the ten-thousands column needs a carry of 1, so  
   T + I + c₃ ≥ 10 ⇒ c₃ ≠ 0.  
   If c₃ = 1 the thousands column has no carry (c₂ = 0);  
   substituting this in step 6 and equating with step 7 gives  
        I + 11 c₃ − c₂ = 19 ⟹ I = 8, c₂ = 0, c₃ = 1  
   (exactly what we already have).

10.  From step 7 with c₃ = 1:   F = T + I + 1 − 10 = T − 1.

11.  From step 6 with c₂ = 0 and c₃ = 1:   9 + T = F + 10  
    With F = T − 1 this is automatically satisfied.

12.  Remaining unknown digits available: 0,1,2,5.  
    T cannot be 0 (it is a leading digit).  
    Try T = 1 → F = 0 (unused and allowed).  
    Then step 5: K + 1 + 2 = O and K + 1 ≤ 7  
       gives the unique choice K = 2,  O = 5.

    Trying T = 2 fails because it forces impossible digit repeats.

13.  All letters now have digits:

   A = 9   E = 7   L = 6   S = 4  
   I = 8   R = 3   T = 1   F = 0  
   K = 2   O = 5

Danny wanted an xCube365 (it lasts 365 days before programmatically disabling itself, so that a new one must be purchased), the highly coveted gaming system that had just been released. It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?
 Hint: First, see if there is a denomination that is not used. If so, figure out which denomination that is","First, see if there is a denomination that is not used. If so, figure out which denomination that is","Can at least one of each denomination be used? That totals $186 with only 6 bills, plus at least $94 with the rest of the bills. This is too high. Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.
If a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities. So $100 bill is the denomination that is not used. We now know that at least one of each of the other bills is used. That totals $86 with 5 bills, leaving 95 bills to make the other $144.
There are only 4 ways to make $144 with these denominations, which are listed in order from $1 bills to $50 bills in each of these sets: {84,10,1,0,0}, {89,1,5,0,0}, {89,3,2,1,0}, {94,0,0,0,1}.

From the six equations one can reduce every letter to E, F, H:

 G = E – F    C = F + H    D = E – F – H  
 A = E – F + H  B = H – F

Choose distinct E,F,H from the given numbers so that all eight expressions are still in the set.

Trying to make the largest number (21) appear first, set A = 21.
Since A = H + G and G = 21 – H, H must be <10½ and make G a listed number.
H = 8 works (G=13) and gives D = 21–2·8 = 5, also listed.

With H = 8, G = 13 the still unused numbers are 2,6,10,15.  
Need 13 = E – F ⇒ E = F + 13.  Taking F = 2 gives E = 15, both unused.  
Then B = 8 – 2 = 6 and C = 2 + 8 = 10, completing the set.

Equations give

 C = 2D + F  A = H + D  G = D + F  
 B = D + F – H  E = F – A

Since the largest value is probably C, let C = 22.

Need A = H + 5 to be in that remainder → choose A=9, H=4.

198,"Question: Detective Grant was inspecting the scene of the crime. The 50-year-old victim, Joe, had been poisoned by a candy containing cyanide. On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table. John, 46, was found with 5 candies the day after a 4-yr sentence had been turned over a week ago. Jim, 35, had gotten off a 5-yr sentence a few days ago, only to be found dead with 6 candies yesterday.
Grant puzzled over these cases for days, and then -boom- it hit him. There was a pattern in these murders! What pattern did Grant spot?
Each suspect ate a candy before they died.
Life expectancy when the murders were committed was 70 years.
(It was also curious that many criminals had been let off their sentences too, but had not been killed. 23, in fact, had gotten off.)

He then went to the criminal's house, and offered him a chance to gamble his life, or go to jail. George offered him a certain number of candies, one of which was poisoned. If the criminal chose a poisoned candy, he died. If he chose a pure candy, he lived.
The criminal's remaining life expectancy divided by his prison sentence would be the number of candies George would bring him, one of which might kill him. In the case of Joe:
His remaining life expectancy at age 50 was 20. 20 divided by 2(his sentence) is 10. George brought him 10 candies, one of which was poisoned. Joe ate the poisoned one, and left nine on the table.
The 23 criminals who got off their sentences, but did not die, chose pure candies.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Grant lined everything up in columns just as in the hint and tried to make one number out of the three pieces of data he had for every victim:

• the victim’s AGE  
• the length of the victim’s jail SENTENCE  
• the total number of CANDIES that had been on the table (the poisoned one + the pieces left over)

Let  

A  = age of the victim  
S  = sentence in years  
C  = total candies ( = candies found + the one eaten)  

For the four dead men he therefore had  

Joe  A=50 S=2 C=10  
Jeff  A=30 S=10 C=4  
John A=46 S=4 C=6  
Jim  A=35 S=5 C=7  

He noticed two things immediately:

1. For every victim the subtraction 70 – A (70 was current life-expectancy) is a positive number.  
2. That number is always an exact multiple of S, and the quotient is C.

      70 − A = S × C
      ⟺ C = (70 − A) / S
      ⟺ A + S·C = 70

Check:

• Joe 50 + 2·10 = 50 + 20 = 70  
• Jeff 30 +10·4  = 30 + 40 = 70  
• John 46 + 4·6  = 46 + 24 = 70  
• Jim 35 + 5·7  = 35 + 35 = 70  

Thus the murderer always arranged things so that

 age + (sentence length) × (total candies) = 70.

Only released prisoners whose ages make 70 − age divisible by their sentence length can fit this equation; those four men were the only ones of the 27 recently freed prisoners for whom the arithmetic worked out—and they are precisely the four who were killed.

...where negative numbers indicate weights that are on the same side of the wheat and positive numbers indicate weights that have been placed on the opposite side of the wheat.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Reasoning in detail  

1.  Why the lightest weight must be 1 kg  
   •  Lester must sometimes weigh exactly 1 kg of wheat, so one of the weights must be 1 kg.  
   •  Call the four weights 1, w₂, w₃, w₄ (in increasing order).

2.  Why the four weights must form a geometric progression  
   •  The hint says “there is a common ratio between the weights”, so let  
        w₂ = r, w₃ = r², w₄ = r³ with some positive integer r.

3.  How large may that ratio be?  
   •  Putting all weights on the same pan gives the largest single total we can counter-balance:  
        1 + r + r² + r³.  
     This must be at least 40 kg.  
   •  r = 2  ⇒ 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15  (too small)  
   •  r = 3  ⇒ 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40  (exactly what we need)  
   •  r ≥ 4  gives a first jump (from 1 kg to 4 kg, 16 kg, …) so large that some smaller numbers (2 kg, 3 kg, …) could never be formed with the rule “each weight used at most once on either side”.  
   •  Hence r has to be 3.

4.  The four weights are therefore  
        1 kg, 3 kg, 9 kg, 27 kg.

5.  Showing these four actually work  
   •  With a balance you can put every weight either  
        – on the wheat-pan (counted +),  
        – on the opposite pan (counted –), or  
        – not used (counted 0).  
     Each weight thus contributes −1, 0 or +1 times its value; this is a “balanced ternary” digit.  
   •  Every integer n between −40 and +40 has a unique balanced-ternary expansion  
        n = a₀·1 + a₁·3 + a₂·9 + a₃·27, where each aᵢ ∈ {−1,0,1}.  
     Consequently every positive n ≤ 40 has such an expansion, so the required wheat mass can always be obtained by putting  
        • the weights with coefficient +1 on the wheat-pan,  
        • the weights with coefficient −1 on the opposite pan.

   Examples  
     2 kg  = 3 − 1   (weights: 3 kg with wheat, 1 kg opposite)  
     17 kg = 27 − 9 − 1 (weights: 27 kg with wheat, 9 kg & 1 kg opposite)  
     29 kg = 27 + 3 − 1 (weights: 27 kg & 3 kg with wheat, 1 kg opposite)  
     … and so on, up to  
     40 kg = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 (all four weights with the wheat).

Because every integer 1–40 can be written this way, the four weights 1 kg, 3 kg, 9 kg and 27 kg let Lester measure any whole-number amount of wheat up to his full 40 kg.

  3A + W + F = 2.99

We want the cost of 1 lb of every nut together:

S = A + B + F + W

────────────────────────────────────────
Express the unknowns in terms of a single free variable (say F).

From (1): W = 1.98 − 2B  
From (2): W = 2.48 − 4F

Set these equal:  
1.98 − 2B = 2.48 − 4F  
−2B = 0.50 − 4F  
B = 2F − 0.25

From (2): W = 2.48 − 4F  (keep this form)

From (3): 3A + (2.48 − 4F) + F = 2.99  
  3A = 2.99 − 2.48 + 3F  
  3A = 0.51 + 3F  
  A = 0.17 + F

────────────────────────────────────────
Now compute the desired sum:

S = A + B + F + W  
  = (0.17 + F) + (2F − 0.25) + F + (2.48 − 4F)

Combine like terms:

• Constant terms: 0.17 − 0.25 + 2.48 = 2.40  
• F-terms: 1F + 2F + 1F − 4F = 0

Thus

S = 2.40 + 0 = 2.40

Notice the F-terms cancel, so S is independent of the individual prices, agreeing with the hint that the separate nut prices are not determinable but their total for one of each is.

201,"Question: Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Snow, there lived the fair Princess Miyuki, who had always been fascinated by fairy tales and the stories of the wonders of the world. She believed that her sleeping, handsome prince was cursed to be one of the mummies in the pyramids of Egypt, and when she was done being Fantaghiro-saving-her-Romualdo, her prince would then build a beautiful palace as a monument of their love (which of course would be more beautiful than Taj Mahal) where both of them will live happily ever after...
So, you see, that's why Princess Miyuki had refused each and every love declaration or marriage proposal that came her way.
But of course, what's a story without the brave and wise heroic prince? Here comes Prince Hajikidama of the Marbles Kingdom. He's no mummy, but his brilliant(?) brain deduced that in order to win the princess' heart, he'd have to give her what she wanted most - her fantasy, and his token of understanding (her childish delusional nature).
In the end, labouring his mind's creativity department for all its worth, Prince Hajikidama decided that a 'Mountain of Love', reaching so high it collected the never-fallen-snow in Marbles Kingdom, might do the trick. That actually is a tetrahedral-shaped (pyramid with 4 equilateral triangular faces) crystallic marbles-made structure (like a giant pile of apples or oranges at a greengrocer's store) consisting of one marble crowning on the top layer, three on the next-to-top layer, six on the third layer, ten on the fourth layer, and so forth. If there are exactly 1,000,000 layers, specify the total number of marbles needed in the construction of entire mountain.

Because each layer is a triangular arrangement,

 Tₖ = 1 + 2 + … + k = k(k+1)/2.         (triangular numbers)

The total number of marbles after n layers is the sum of the first n triangular
numbers:

 Sₙ = Σₖ₌₁ⁿ Tₖ  
   = Σₖ₌₁ⁿ k(k+1)/2  
   = ½ Σₖ₌₁ⁿ (k² + k).

Use the standard summation formulas

 Σₖ₌₁ⁿ k  = n(n+1)/2,  
 Σₖ₌₁ⁿ k² = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.

Hence

 Sₙ = ½ [ n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 + n(n+1)/2 ]  
   = ½ · n(n+1) [ (2n+1)/6 + 1/2 ]  
   = ½ · n(n+1) · (n+2)/3  
   = n(n+1)(n+2)/6.

Thus the tetrahedral (pyramidal) number with n layers is

 Sₙ = n(n+1)(n+2)/6.

For n = 1,000,000:

 S₁₀⁶ = 1,000,000 · 1,000,001 · 1,000,002 / 6.

Divide by 6 first:

 1,000,002 / 3 = 333,334, 1,000,000 / 2 = 500,000,

so

 S₁₀⁶ = 500,000 · 1,000,001 · 333,334

Step-by-step construction

1. Two blocks of three 9’s each give 999 + 999 = 1998, already close to 1990.  
2. To reduce 1998 to 1990 we have to subtract 8.

206,"Question: Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)
 Hint: Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

P  = selling price per box (dollars)  
q  = number of boxes sold each week  

1.  Determine the unit cost.  
   At the present price of \$5.95 the profit per box is \$1.75, so  

   cost per box  = 5.95 – 1.75 = \$4.20.

   Hence, profit per box for any price P is (P – 4.20).

2.  Express weekly sales q as a function of P.  
   For every \$0.20 price drop, sales rise by 25 boxes:

   Δq / ΔP = 25 / (–0.20) = –125 boxes per dollar.

   Taking q = 100 when P = 5.95 gives the linear relation  

   q(P) = 100 – 125 (P – 5.95)  
        = 100 + 125·5.95 – 125P  
        = 843.75 – 125P.

3.  Form the weekly profit function W(P).

   W(P) = (profit per box) × (boxes sold)  
        = (P – 4.20)(843.75 – 125P).

   Expand:  
   W(P) = –125P² + 1368.75P – 3543.75.

4.  Maximize W(P).  
   For a quadratic aP² + bP + c (with a < 0) the maximum occurs at  

        P* = –b / (2a).

   Here a = –125, b = 1368.75:  

        P* = –1368.75 / (2 · –125) = 1368.75 / 250 = 5.475.

5.  Interpret the result.  
   The optimum selling price is \$5.475 per box, i.e. about \$5.48 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Since SL-D=3 or (SL-1)-D=3 (meaning SL-D=4), and since the highest possible sum of two different one-digit numbers is 17, S must equal 1.
Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.
Suppose D=7. Then L is 0 or 1, and since S=1, L=0. A must be 1 or 2, but since S=1, A=2.

Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.

Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.
If D=7, then L=0. But since 10-7=3, D cannot be 7.
If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.
If E=4, then N=3. But if D=8, A=3, and if D=9, L=3 and A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=5, then since 1I-E=6, I=1. But since S=1, this cannot work.

If E=8, then I=4, and D cannot be 8. But if D=9, then A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=9, then N=8, and D cannot be 8 or 9. So this cannot work.
Therefore, E=6, N=5, and I=2. If D=8, then L=2, so D must equal 9. This means:

Look for a consistent way to turn the name of a country into the two–digit number in front of the “000”.  
Write every name as a string of individual letters and count vowels (A,E,I,O,U) and consonants.

					vowels	   consonants
USA      →  U A		   2	       S		   1

Step-2.  See what coefficient makes the numbers fit.

• USA : 2 × 3 + 1 × 7 = 6 + 7 = 13  
• Peru : 2 × 3 + 2 × 7 = 6 + 14 = 20  
• Japan : 2 × 3 + 3 × 7 = 6 + 21 = 27  
• France : 2 × 3 + 4 × 7 = 6 + 28 = 34  
• Brazil : 2 × 3 + 4 × 7 = 6 + 28 = 34  
• Greece : 3 × 3 + 3 × 7 = 9 + 21 = 30  
• England : 2 × 3 + 5 × 7 = 6 + 35 = 41

Thus the rule is
 each vowel contributes 3,
 each consonant contributes 7,
add them, then append “000”.

You may say the total number of possible cubes (not necessarily with side length one) in the twelve by twelve by twelve Rubik's cube, and hocus-pocus, cubes of all sizes would appear. Assuming that each side in the tiny cubes has length one and that you may only make cubes of integer side length, what number should you say for the new technology to work?

(It cannot start with 0, ie. 01234 is not a 5 digit number)
 Hint: Permutations",Permutations,"9408!
The rule of divisibility says that a number is a multiple of 4 if its last 2 numbers are multiples of 4. So the last 2 numbers can be 21 different options:00, 04, 08, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 40, 44, 48, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96 because they are multiples of 4 and do not have 3's or 5's.
We have the last 2 digits we need to know how many can be in the first digit: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and the second and third numbers can have these 7 and number 0 too.

Step 1 – last two digits (divisibility-by-4 condition)  
A number is a multiple of 4 exactly when the two–digit number formed by its last two digits is a multiple of 4.  
List the multiples of 4 from 00 to 96 and discard any that contain 3 or 5.

Of the 25 multiples, 4 (32, 36, 52, 56) are rejected, leaving 21 valid endings.

Step 2 – the remaining three digits  
• Leading digit (ten-thousands place) may be any allowed non-zero digit: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 → 7 choices.  
• The other two middle digits (thousands and hundreds places) may be any of the 8 allowed digits (0 included): 8·8 choices.

Hence, for each admissible ending we have  
7 × 8 × 8 = 448 ways to choose the first three digits.

Step 3 – total count  
Total 5-digit numbers = 21 valid endings × 448 choices for the other digits

214,"Question: Alec, Brett and Chris each purchased parts for their skateboards at the sports store. Alec and Brett wanted to build new skateboards, so they each needed to purchase a deck, trucks, bearings and wheels. Chris only needed new wheels. The store offers a 10% discount for purchases over $250, so the boys decided to pay for all the parts together to qualify for the discount. Altogether, the boys spent $266.40. The clues below reflect the price of the items before the discount is applied.
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
They each bought the same kinds of wheels. Together they spent $75 for the 3 sets of wheels. Each set contained 4 wheels.
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.

How much did each person spend?
 Hint: Find the total price, then focus on each item separately","Find the total price, then focus on each item separately","Alec spent $113.40.

Component Alec Brett Chris Total
Deck $50 $45 $0 $95
Trucks 35 40 $0 75
Wheels 25 25 25 75
Bearings 16 35 $0 51
Total before discount $126 $145 $25 $296
less 10% discount $12.60 $14.50 $2.50 $29.60
Amount spent $113.40 $130.50 $22.50 $266.40
Explanation:
First find the original price of all the items combined. $266.40 is the price after the 10% discount was applied.
That means $266.40 is equal to 90% of the original price.
Write an equation and then cross multiply:
266.40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x   =   9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)
Let x = the amount Alec spent on trucks.
x + (x+5) = 75
2x + 5 = 75
2x = 70
x = 35
Alec spent $35 on trucks. Brett spent $5 more than Alec. Therefore, Brett spent $40 on trucks.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51
x + (2x + 3) = 51
3x + 3 = 51
3x = 48
x = 16
Alec's spent $16 on bearings.
Brett spent $35 on bearings",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

Dₐ , Tₐ , Bₐ , Wₐ  = Alec’s deck, trucks, bearings, wheels  
Dᵦ , Tᵦ , Bᵦ , Wᵦ  = Brett’s deck, trucks, bearings, wheels  
W꜀               = Chris’s wheels  

Step 1 – Convert the after-discount total to the before-discount total  
The boys paid \$266.40 after a 10 % discount, so the undiscounted total is
0.90 × (total before) = 266.40  ⇒  total before = 266.40 / 0.90 = \$296.00.

Step 2 – Handle the wheels  
All three bought identical wheels and together paid \$75.
Therefore Wₐ = Wᵦ = W꜀ = 75 / 3 = \$25.

Step 3 – Handle the bearings  
“Total cost of the bearings came to \$24 less than the total cost of the wheels.”
Total wheels cost = \$75 ⇒ total bearings cost Bₐ + Bᵦ = 75 – 24 = \$51.

Step 4 – Relate bearings to Alec’s deck  
“Bearings for the two boys were \$1 more than Alec’s deck.”  
51 = Dₐ + 1  ⇒  Dₐ = \$50.

Step 5 – Brett’s deck  
“Alec spent \$5 more for his deck than Brett.”  
50 = Dᵦ + 5  ⇒  Dᵦ = \$45.

Step 6 – Trucks  
“Brett spent \$5 more on trucks than Alec.”  
Tᵦ = Tₐ + 5.

Step 7 – Bearings split between the boys  
“Brett spent \$3 more on bearings than twice Alec’s amount.”  
Bᵦ = 2 Bₐ + 3,   with  Bₐ + Bᵦ = 51.

Solve:
Bᵦ = 2 Bₐ + 3
Bₐ + (2 Bₐ + 3) = 51  ⇒  3 Bₐ = 48  ⇒  Bₐ = 16,  Bᵦ = 35.

Step 8 – Express each boy’s subtotal in terms of Tₐ  

Alec:  Dₐ + Tₐ + Bₐ + Wₐ = 50 + Tₐ + 16 + 25 = Tₐ + 91  
Brett: Dᵦ + Tᵦ + Bᵦ + Wᵦ = 45 + (Tₐ + 5) + 35 + 25 = Tₐ + 110  
Chris: W꜀ = 25  

Total before discount:
(Tₐ + 91) + (Tₐ + 110) + 25 = 2 Tₐ + 226 = 296  (from Step 1)

Hence 2 Tₐ = 70 ⇒ Tₐ = 35, and therefore Tᵦ = 40.

Step 9 – Individual totals before and after the discount  

Alec: 50 + 35 + 16 + 25 = \$126 → after 10 % discount: 0.9×126 = \$113.40  
Brett: 45 + 40 + 35 + 25 = \$145 → after discount: 0.9×145 = \$130.50  
Chris: 25 → after discount: 0.9×25 = \$22.50  

(113.40 + 130.50 + 22.50 = 266.40, confirming the check.)

Final answer:  
Before the discount Alec spent \$126, Brett \$145, and Chris \$25.

2. Write down five copies of 0! and add them:
      0! + 0! + 0! + 0! + 0!

Standing 5 feet away from the 8 foot high fence in the back of the yard, he could just barely see the top leaves of the tree over the top of the fence.  He knew that the tree was 200 feet from the fence.  Homer was 6 feet tall, making his line of vision, 67 inches from the ground.
Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.
 Hint: TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches
Tree height from eye level = TAN (25.80 deg) * 2460 inches = 1189 inches
Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.  With the measurement capabilities available to any lumberjack (or any average Homer) precise measurements are not possible.

• T be the top of the oak tree, which is another 200 ft beyond the fence (total horizontal distance E T = 5 ft + 200 ft = 205 ft).

1.  Angle of sight to the fence top  
   Vertical rise E F = 8 ft − 5.583 ft = 2.417 ft

   tan θ = (opposite)/(adjacent) = 2.417 ft / 5 ft = 0.4833  
   θ = arctan 0.4833 ≈ 25.8°.

2.  Use the same angle θ for the line of sight that continues on to the tree top.  
   Vertical rise from E to T = tan θ · (horizontal distance E T)  
                           = 0.4833 · 205 ft ≈ 99.08 ft.

We want a 6-digit integer N such that, for every multiplier k = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the decimal expansion of k·N contains no digit that is absent from N itself.  
A very strong way for that to happen is for each product k·N to be a permutation (re-ordering) of the six digits of N; then the digit‐set is obviously unchanged.

Step 2 – Looking for numbers whose multiples are cyclic permutations  
A well-known source of such numbers comes from the repeating parts of certain fractions.  
If a fraction 1/m has a repeating decimal of length 6, 10^6 − 1 (= 999 999) is divisible by m. Then the repeating block R (a 6-digit number) satisfies  

  R = (10^6 − 1)/m.

Multiplying R by k merely rotates the repeating block whenever k and m are coprime.  
The most famous case is m = 7:

  1/7 = 0.\overline{142857}.

Step 3 – Verifying the 6-digit block 142 857  
Take N = 142 857.  
Compute its first five multiples:

 N × 2 = 285 714  
 N × 3 = 428 571  
 N × 4 = 571 428  
 N × 5 = 714 285  
 N × 6 = 857 142  

Each product is just a cyclic permutation of 1 4 2 8 5 7, so no new digits ever appear.

Step 4 – Uniqueness within the stated condition  
Among 6-digit numbers, the only one whose first five multiples are all permutations of itself is this cyclic number arising from 1/7 (together with the trivial “0 padded” rotations, which are not 6-digit numbers). Hence it is the sole solution in ordinary base-10 notation.

1. Try to form a quotient that equals 100.  
   If the denominator is 0.77, then 100 × 0.77 = 77, so 77 ÷ 0.77 = 100.

2. Count the 7’s:  
   • “77” contributes two 7’s.  
   • “.77” (read as 0.77) contributes another two 7’s.  
   No other digits appear; the decimal point is allowed as a symbol rather than a digit.

3. Check:  
   0.77 = 77⁄100, so  
   77 ÷ 0.77 = 77 ÷ (77⁄100) = 77 × (100⁄77) = 100.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Use the last–digit (mod-10) constraint
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Reduce (2) modulo 10:

1333A ≡ 3A, 332D ≡ 2D (mod 10)  

Hence 3A ≡ 2D (mod 10).                            (3)

Since A is the first digit of ABCD it cannot be 0, and the hint tells us A must be even, so A ∈ {2,4,6,8}.  
List the (A,D) pairs that satisfy (3):

A = 2 → 3A = 6 → 2D ≡ 6 ⇒ D = 3 or 8  
A = 4 → 3A = 2 → 2D ≡ 2 ⇒ D = 1 or 6  
A = 6 → 3A = 8 → 2D ≡ 8 ⇒ D = 4 or 9  
A = 8 → 3A = 4 → 2D ≡ 4 ⇒ D = 2 or 7

Candidate pairs: (2,3), (2,8), (4,1), (4,6), (6,4), (6,9), (8,2), (8,7).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Insert each (A,D) pair into equation (2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Solve (2) for B:

130B = 20C + 332D − 1333A  
B    = (20C + 332D − 1333A) / 130                  (4)

Digits B,C must be integers 0-9 and 20C can only take the ten values 0,20,…,180.  
Test each (A,D):

• (A,D) = (2,3): 20C + 332·3 − 1333·2 = 20C − 1670 (always negative) → no solution.  
• (A,D) = (2,8): 20C + 332·8 − 1333·2 = 20C − 10  
 For C = 7: 20·7 − 10 = 130, B = 130/130 = 1 ✔  
 C = 0,…,9 except 7 give non-integer or out-of-range B.  
 Thus (A,B,C,D) = (2,1,7,8) is a solution.

• All remaining pairs give 20C + 332D − 1333A ≤ −3340, so the numerator in (4) is negative and B cannot be a digit 0-9. Hence they produce no solutions.

4.  Verify the unique solution

ABCD = 2178  

4 × 2178 = 8712 = DCBA,

and indeed DCBA is the reverse of ABCD.

Since A is the highest digit, A is at most 2. However, because 1 is carried from the ones digits to the tens digits, A must equal 2, otherwise L will be 0. A=2 and L=7. The tens digits carry 2 to the hundreds digits, and the hundreds digits must carry 2 to the thousands digits. To avoid zero or duplicate numbers, F can only be 8 and W be 6.

stand for an addition in base 10, where each letter is a different non-zero digit.

1. Work with the units column  
   5 + 5 + 5 = 15 → the units digit of the sum is Y.  
   Hence (3 × Y) mod 10 = Y ⇒ 2Y ≡ 0 (mod 10) ⇒ Y = 5.

2. Tens column  
   Carry 1 from the units: 1 + L + L + L = 1 + 3L = A + 10k (k is the carry into the hundreds).  
   The result has the same digit A in the tens and thousands places, so A must be 1 or 2 (since 3 × (FLY) is a 4-digit number).

   • If A = 1: 1 + 3L = 1 + 10k ⇒ 3L = 10k ⇒ impossible for non-zero L.  
   • If A = 2: 1 + 3L = 2 + 10k ⇒ 3L = 1 + 10k.  
     Taking k = 2 gives 3L = 21 ⇒ L = 7 (0 < L < 10).  
     Thus A = 2, L = 7 and the carry k = 2.

3. Hundreds column  
   Carry k = 2: 2 + F + F + F = 2 + 3F = W + 10m, where m is the carry into the thousands.  
   The thousands digit is A = 2, so m = 2.  
   Therefore 2 + 3F = W + 20 ⇒ 3F = W + 18 ⇒ W = 3F − 18.

   Try F = 7: W = 3(7) − 18 = 3 (but L = 7, so digits clash).  
   Try F = 8: W = 3(8) − 18 = 6 (all digits distinct and non-zero).  
   F = 8, W = 6 works; F = 9 would yield W = 9, violating distinctness.

4. Check the whole product  
   FLY = 875, 3 × 875 = 2625 = AWAY with A = 2, W = 6, A = 2, Y = 5 — consistent.

231,"Question: What is the smallest integer greater than 0 that can be written entirely with zeros and ones and is evenly divisible by 225?
 Hint: nan",,"The prime factorization of 225 is 5*5*3*3. So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.
All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"We need the smallest positive integer that  

1. is written using only the decimal digits 0 and 1;  
2. is divisible by 225.

Since 225 = 9 × 25, the number must be divisible by 9 and by 25.

Step 1.  Divisibility by 25  
A decimal number is divisible by 25 iff its last two digits are 00, 25, 50 or 75.  
Because only the digits 0 and 1 are allowed, the only possible pair is 00.  
Therefore our number must end with 00.

Step 2.  Divisibility by 9  
A decimal number is divisible by 9 iff the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  
With digits restricted to 0 and 1, the digit–sum equals the count of 1’s.  
Hence the number of 1’s must be a multiple of 9 (and at least one, since the integer is positive).

Step 3.  Minimising the length  
Let the total number of digits be n.  
Because the last two digits are fixed as 00, the first n – 2 digits supply all the 1’s.

• To get the smallest possible count of 1’s that is a multiple of 9, we take exactly 9 of them.  
• That means n – 2 ≥ 9, i.e. n ≥ 11.  
• With n = 11, every one of the first 9 digits must be 1 (otherwise we would have fewer than 9 ones).

Thus the only 11-digit candidate is

111 111 111 00

(9 ones followed by two zeros).  
Any longer number (n > 11) would have more digits and therefore be numerically larger.

Step 4.  Verification  
Digit sum: 9 → divisible by 9.  
Ending with 00 → divisible by 25.  
Hence 111 111 111 00 is divisible by 225.

Indeed  
225 × 49 382 716 = 11 111 111 100.

Therefore this is the smallest positive integer satisfying all conditions.

232,"Question: Which three consecutive prime numbers, when multiplied together, give the product 190747?
 Hint: 50^2 = 125000",50^2 = 125000,"60^3 = 216000; 50^3 = 125000; 53, 59 and 61.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 1.  Estimate the size of the primes  
The product of three consecutive primes is roughly the cube of the middle one.  
Take the cube root of 190 747.  
• 50³ = 125 000 (given hint: “50² = 125 000” clearly means 50³).  
• 60³ = 216 000.  
So the cube root of 190 747 lies between 50 and 60, about 57–58.  
Hence the middle prime should be near 57–58.

Step 2.  List the primes near that value  
Primes around 57 are: 53, 59, 61, 67 …

Step 3.  Test the first plausible triple  
Take the three consecutive primes 53, 59, 61.  

Compute their product:  
53 × 59 = 3127  
3127 × 61 = 3127 × 60 + 3127  
               = 187 620 + 3 127  
               = 190 747

Step 4.  Verify consecutiveness  
Between 53 and 59 there are no primes (54–58 are composite);  
between 59 and 61 there is only 60 (composite).  
Thus 53, 59, 61 are indeed consecutive primes.

No other triple near the cube root will give the required product, so this is the unique solution.

Snogs are each one more than a multiple of 8.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"We have to discover what property makes a number a “snog”.  
The hint says: “Snogs are one more than …”, so each snog should be 1 larger than some special kind of number (i.e. of the form k + 1 for some k having a particular property).

Look at the given examples.

Snogs:   25, 73, 81, 9, 33, 41, 65  
Subtract 1 from each:

24, 72, 80, 8, 32, 40, 64

All of those results are multiples of 8:

24 = 3·8  
72 = 9·8  
80 = 10·8  
8  = 1·8  
32 = 4·8  
40 = 5·8  
64 = 8·8

So every snog is “one more than a multiple of 8”; symbolically, a snog ≡ 1 (mod 8).

Check this rule against the “NOT snogs” list:

5 (≡5 mod 8), 70 (≡6), 16 (≡0), 3 (≡3), 29 (≡5), 44 (≡4), 59 (≡3), 60 (≡4), 64 (≡0).  
None of them are 1 mod 8, so the rule works.

Therefore

Now test the new numbers.

48  57  37  17

48 ≡ 0 (mod 8) → not snog

37 ≡ 5 (mod 8) → not snog  
17 ≡ 1 (mod 8) → snog  

53 ≡ 5 (mod 8) → not snog  
49 ≡ 1 (mod 8) → snog  
62 ≡ 6 (mod 8) → not snog  

8  ≡ 0 (mod 8) → not snog  
4  ≡ 4 (mod 8) → not snog

The condition is

      N , 2N , 3N  

taken together use every digit 1-9 exactly once and never use the digit 0.

Step 1 – some immediate restrictions  
• 3N must still be a three-digit number, so N ≤ 333.  
• The nine digits 1-9 add up to 45, a multiple of 9.  
  Hence 6N = N+2N+3N is divisible by 9, so N itself is divisible by 3.  
  Consequently N is one of the multiples of 3 between 123 and 333.  
• The units digit of N cannot be 0 (forbidden) and cannot be 5 either:
     if N ends in 5, 2N ends in 0 and 3N ends in 5, giving a 0 and a repeated 5.  

Step 2 – the candidates that remain  
Writing out all multiples of 3 from 123 to 333 and discarding the ones
containing 0, 5 or a repeated digit we are left with only

Step 3 – a very quick test that eliminates almost all of them  
Look at the sum of the three digits of N, call it S₁.  
Let S₂ and S₃ be the digit–sums of 2N and 3N.  
Because S₁+S₂+S₃ = 45 and each of S₁,S₂,S₃ is a multiple of 3,
the only possible triple (in increasing order) is

          S₁ = 12 ,  S₂ = 15 ,  S₃ = 18.

So N must have digit–sum 12.
From the list above that keeps only

   276 285 294 327 336 (336 already too large) .

Step 4 – check the handful that are left  
Now we merely have to look at those fourteen numbers and see
whether 2N and 3N introduce a 0 or repeat a digit.

Doing that (two or three multiplications and one visual inspection each time) leaves only

   192 : 192 , 384 , 576   → digits 1-9 once each      (already given)
   219 : 219 , 438 , 657   → digits 1-9 once each

How each clock drifts
Fast clock: gains 1 min per hour → its reading is ahead of the correct time by 1 t minutes.  
Slow clock: loses 2 min per hour → its reading lags behind the correct time by 2 t minutes.

A 12-hour (analog) clock repeats every 12 hours = 720 minutes, so two readings are considered the same whenever they differ by a multiple of 720 minutes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  When do the two clocks next show the same time (not necessarily the right time)?
The difference between their readings after t hours is

(1 t) − (−2 t) = 3 t minutes.

We need 3 t to be a multiple of 720, i.e. 3 t = 720 k for some integer k.

t = 720 / 3 = 240 hours.

240 hours = 10 days.

Fast clock: 1 t ≡ 0 (mod 720)  ⇒  t must be a multiple of 720.  
Slow clock: −2 t ≡ 0 (mod 720) ⇒ 2 t must be a multiple of 720 ⇒ t must be a multiple of 360.

The smallest t satisfying both conditions is the least common multiple of 720 and 360, namely 720 hours.

720 hours = 30 days.  
Thirty days after midnight, Sunday Dec 31 is midnight, Tuesday Jan 30.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Final answer:  
1. The two clocks next read the same time 10 days later, at 12:00 AM on Wednesday, January 10.  
2. They both show the correct time again 30 days later, at 12:00 AM on Tuesday, January 30.",True,1,0,0
239,"Question: A farmer was weighing five bales of hay, and each bale was a different weight. Because he was an odd farmer, he weighed the hay bales in groups of two, in every possible combination (but 2-3 and 3-2 are the same).  The farmer wrote down the total weights, but forgot to match them to the groups of hay bales (1&2, 1&3 etc.) that they went with.  The weights were 80, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, and 91 kilograms.

a < b < c < d < e    (all in kg).

Because every unordered pair was weighed, the farmer obtained the 10 pair-sums  

a+b, a+c, a+d, a+e, b+c, b+d, b+e, c+d, c+e, d+e.

These sums are the 10 numbers (already sorted):

80, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, 91.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  Identify the two extreme sums
-------------------------------------------------
• Smallest sum  = a + b = 80.  (1)  
• Largest sum   = d + e = 91.  (2)

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Use the next–smallest sums
-------------------------------------------------
The three smallest sums normally come from adding the lightest bale (a) to the other four.  
So set

a + c = 82  (3)  
a + d = 83  (4)

(We shall check later that this choice is consistent.)

-------------------------------------------------
3.  Express b, c, d in terms of a
-------------------------------------------------
From (1): b = 80 − a.  
From (3): c = 82 − a.  
From (4): d = 83 − a.

Because c = 82 − a and b = 80 − a, we have  
c − b = (82 − a) − (80 − a) = 2, so c = b + 2.

-------------------------------------------------
4.  Force b + c to be one of the listed sums
-------------------------------------------------
b + c = (80 − a) + (82 − a) = 162 − 2a.  
This sum must be somewhere in the list.  Looking at the table, 84 is the only value that fits:

162 − 2a = 84  ⇒  2a = 78  ⇒  a = 39.

This gives immediately

b = 80 − 39 = 41,  
c = 82 − 39 = 43,  
d = 83 − 39 = 44.

-------------------------------------------------
5.  Find e from the largest sum
-------------------------------------------------
From (2): e = 91 − d = 91 − 44 = 47.

We now have five distinct positive integers in increasing order:

a = 39, b = 41, c = 43, d = 44, e = 47.

-------------------------------------------------
6.  Verify that all ten pair-sums appear
-------------------------------------------------
39+41 = 80  
39+43 = 82  
39+44 = 83  
39+47 = 86  
41+43 = 84  
41+44 = 85  
41+47 = 88  
43+44 = 87  
43+47 = 90  
44+47 = 91

These are exactly the ten recorded totals, in the right order.  
No other assignment of the three smallest sums gives integer weights, so the solution is unique.

-------------------------------------------------
Result
-------------------------------------------------
Bale weights (lightest to heaviest):
39 kg, 41 kg, 43 kg, 44 kg, 47 kg.

Correspondence between totals and pairs:

240,"Question: In the legendary land of Madadia, everything is wonderful. There is no inflation, so Madadian wonks (local currency 100 winks = 1 wonk) are constant in value.
Mad Ade's cousin Manic Martin works as an accountant in one of Madadia's leading accounting firms.
After his first year his salary was a straight 10,000 wonks, with which Manic Martin was quite happy. His manager was so impressed with his work he offered Manic Martin a wage rise.
Now this being Madadia, things are not always done as they are elsewhere, the wage rise was offered over a 17.5 year contract period, These contracts are immutably binding, and will still be paid to benefactors in the event of death or permanent disability.
Manic Martin has a choice of how to receive his raise.  The first option was for an immediate 5% raise to 10,500 wonks annually, with an additional 5% raise every 6 months. The second option was for an immediate 10% raise to 11,000 wonks annually, with an additional 10% raise every year. Manic Martin's salary, based upon his current annual, was paid bi-weekly.
Which deal would benefit Manic Martin the most?
 Hint: Think about the difference between the first and second half of every year",Think about the difference between the first and second half of every year,"The 5% semi-annual raise yields a higher return.
This may have been your first guess, but there is something odd about the answer. At the start of the problem, the 10% raise is earning more-  11,000 annually vs. 10,500. After the first year, the 5% option has earned 10,762 compared to 11,000.
What are the two options earning at the moment the contract closes, after 17.5 years? Surprisingly, the 5% option only realizes a little more than 55,160, compared to the 10% option which is still ahead with just under 56,000.
So where's the advantage in the 5% option? It hides in the second half of every year. Even in the first year, the 5% option makes more in the second six months than the 10% option. For the first few years, this is not enough to offset the difference. But cumulatively, over seventeen and a half years, 5% realizes a grand total of 390.27 more than the 10% option.

Σ = (5.516 015 893 – 1)/0.05 = 90.320 317 86  

Total_A = 5 250 · 90.320 317 86 = 474 181.668 8 wonks

Offer B  
Total_B = Σ_{j=0}^{16} 11 000·1.10ʲ  + ½·11 000·1.10¹⁷  
      = 11 000 · (1.10¹⁷ – 1)/(1.10 – 1) + 5 500·1.10¹⁷

first part = 11 000·(5.054 470 282 – 1)/0.10 = 445 991.731 0  
second part = 5 500·5.054 470 282 = 27 799.586 6

Reason for the result (hint):  
Within every year Offer B pays more in the first half, but Offer A overtakes in the second half; because the compounding in A is effectively (1.05)² = 1.1025 ≈ 0.25 % higher per year than the 10 % in B, the tiny advantage gradually outweighs B’s initial lead.

The distance can be calculated as 9 + (9)*(2/3)*(2) + (9)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(2)+..., with the 2 accounting for the upward and downward travel distance.

Multiplying by the 18 and then subtracting the nine used to create the series will result in 54 - 9 = 45.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Start by breaking the trip into pieces that are easy to add.

1. The first motion is straight down from the hand to the floor.  
   Distance = 9 ft.

2. After every impact with the floor the ball rises, then falls the same distance back down.  
   Let h₁, h₂, h₃, … be the rebound heights.

   • h₁ = 9·(2/3) = 6 ft  
   • h₂ = 9·(2/3)² = 4 ft  
   • h₃ = 9·(2/3)³ = 8/3 ft  
   • … and so on.

   Each rebound height h contributes 2h feet to the total distance (up and then down).

3. The total distance after the first drop is therefore  

      D = 9  +  2(h₁ + h₂ + h₃ + …).

4. The rebound heights form a geometric series:

      h₁ + h₂ + h₃ + …  
      = 9·(2/3) [1 + (2/3) + (2/3)² + …].

   For |r| < 1, 1 + r + r² + … = 1/(1 – r).  
   Here r = 2/3.

      Sum = 9·(2/3) · 1/(1 – 2/3)  
          = 9·(2/3) · 1/(1/3)  
          = 9·(2/3) · 3  
          = 18 ft.

5. Insert this into the distance formula:

      D = 9 + 2·18  
        = 9 + 36  
        = 45 ft.

The infinite process converges, so the ball will have travelled a total of 45 feet by the time it finally comes to rest.

She was younger to me Rudy the business-minded Romankachi by two years and to our elder brother Fred the well-settled Romankachi by four years. Just as the celebrations were in full swing, I realized something about our ages. I found that I could say at least two things definitely about each of the following two integer values formed by manipulating our ages taken as integers:-
a) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Lavi's and my age considered during any one year right since she was a year old.
b) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Fred's and my ages considered during any one year right since I was a year old.

1.  The six “long” segments of a Star of David each contain exactly four intersection points.

               1 ─ 6 ─ 12 ─ 7    ← sums to 26.

5.  Continue around the figure, always completing each new segment with the
    complementary numbers that are still unused.

    Carrying this out systematically gives the unique* set of placements

          Outer vertices   (clockwise from the top) :   1 , 2 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 8
          Inner vertices   (each just inside the preceding outer one) :
                                                10 , 6 , 12 , 3 , 5 , 4

    (*up to rotations and reflections of the star).

6.  Verification

          Up-triangle side 1 : 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26
          Up-triangle side 2 : 7 + 3 + 5 + 11 = 26
          Up-triangle side 3 : 11 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 26
          Down-triangle side 1 : 2 + 12 + 3 + 9 = 26
          Down-triangle side 2 : 9 + 5 + 4 + 8 = 26
          Down-triangle side 3 : 8 + 10 + 6 + 2 = 26

    All six segments add to 26, and every number 1–12 is used exactly once.

247,"Question: The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?
 Hint: Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74
Lemp 47 94
Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Number of people who got in at the six stations - Number of people who got out at the six stations) =
227 - (364 - 182) =
227 - 182 =
45 people
Thus, I disappointed Tweeto by giving him the answer as 45 people.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let

d₁ , d₂ , d₃ , d₄ , d₅ , d₆  = numbers of passengers who got ​down​ at  
Maver , Willow , Wonderland , Doku , Lemp and Rudolf respectively.  
gᵢ = passengers who got ​in​ at station i.

1.  gᵢ = 2 dᵢ   ( “twice as many got in as got down” )  
2.  dᵢ is prime, taken from the intervals  
    (0-10] , (10-20] , (20-30] , (30-40] , (40-50] , (50-60] ) in that order.  
   Hence  

  d₁ ∈ {2,3,5,7}  
  d₂ ∈ {11,13,17,19}  
  d₃ ∈ {23,29}  
  d₄ ∈ {31,37}  
  d₅ ∈ {41,43,47}  
  d₆ ∈ {53,59}

3.  gᵢ – gᵢ₊₁ ≥ 20 ⇒ 2dᵢ – 2dᵢ₊₁ ≥ 20 ⇒ |dᵢ₊₁ – dᵢ| ≥ 10  
    (successive “down” numbers differ by at least 10).

4.  Σ dᵢ is even.

-----------------------------------------------------
Step 1 Work backwards from the last two stations
-----------------------------------------------------
•  d₆ can only be 53 or 59.  
•  d₅ must differ from d₆ by at least 10, so

  If d₆ = 53 ⇒ d₅ ≤ 43 (but 41 and 43 are only 6 and 10 away from 53,  
           43 works, 41 doesn’t because previous step will fail)  
  If d₆ = 59 ⇒ d₅ can be 41,43,47 (all at least 12 away)

Now check d₄ (31 or 37):

•  If d₅ is 41 or 43 the gap to 31 is only 10 or 12,  
   but 41-31 = 10, 43-31 = 12 are fine.  
   Yet 31 then has to differ by ≥10 from d₃ (23 or 29) – impossible  
   because 31-23 = 8 and 31-29 = 2.  
   Therefore d₄ cannot be 31.

Hence d₄ must be 37.  
Then d₅ must be at least 47 (only number ≥47 and in the right interval).  
That fixes d₅ = 47 and forces d₆ = 59 (the only prime ≥57).

-----------------------------------------------------
Step 2 Move further backwards
-----------------------------------------------------
With d₄ = 37 we need d₃ ≤ 27 and in {23,29}.  
Only 23 works (37-23 = 14 ≥ 10).  
So d₃ = 23.

Now d₂ must be at most 13 (23-d₂ ≥ 10), and in {11,13,17,19}.   
11 fails (23-11 = 12 but then 11 – d₁ ≥10 can’t be met),  
so d₂ = 13.

Finally d₁ must satisfy 13-d₁ ≥ 10 with d₁ ∈ {2,3,5,7}.  
Only 2 and 3 qualify; test both:

Sequence A : 2,13,23,37,47,59  sum = 181  (odd) ✗  
Sequence B : 3,13,23,37,47,59  sum = 182  (even) ✓

Thus the only admissible set is  

d₁ = 3, d₂ = 13, d₃ = 23, d₄ = 37, d₅ = 47, d₆ = 59.

-----------------------------------------------------
Step 3 Find the initial number of passengers
-----------------------------------------------------
Let P₀ be the number on board just ​before​ Maver.  
At each station the net change is +dᵢ (−dᵢ get down, +2dᵢ get in).  
After the six stations the train therefore contains

P₀ + Σ dᵢ = P₀ + 182  passengers.

We are told there were 227 passengers on the train when it had chugged out of Rudolf (i.e. after all getting down and in there), so

P₀ + 182 = 227  
P₀ = 45.

-----------------------------------------------------
Answer
-----------------------------------------------------
There were 45 passengers (including Tweeto himself) on the train just before it reached Maver.

248,"Question: Some time after 2 O' Clock, the angle made between the minute hand and the vertical (12) on a clock is double the angle made between the hour hand and the vertical (12). What time is it?
 Hint: What is the rate of travel of each hand on a clock?",What is the rate of travel of each hand on a clock?,"2:24 The hour hand makes an angle of 72 degrees while the minute hand makes an angle of 144 degrees.
At exactly 2:00, the angle made by the hour hand is 60 degrees from vertical.  If you let x = the number of minutes past 2:00 that we are looking for, then the hour hand will be at:
60 degrees + x / 60 min* 30 degrees
where x/60 min is the fraction of a full hour that has past, and is therefore the fractional distance that the hour hand has moved closer to the 3.  The 30 degrees is the total angle between the 2 and the 3.
The final position of the minute hand will be:
x/30 min * 180 degrees
for the same reasoning as with the hour hand.
Since the minute hand will make twice the angle with vertical, you can set up the equation:
2*(60 + x / 60 * 30) = x / 30 * 180
Solving for x will give you 24 minutes.  The time will be 2:24.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

t = minutes past 2 : 00.  

Angles are measured clockwise from the 12-o’clock (vertical) position.

1.  Rate of each hand  
   • Minute hand: 360° per 60 min  = 6°/min.  
   • Hour hand:   360° per 12 h = 30° per hour = 0.5°/min.

2.  Position of the hands t minutes after 2 : 00  
   • Minute hand angle from 12:   θ_m = 6t  degrees.  
   • Hour hand angle from 12:     θ_h = 60° + 0.5t  degrees

3.  Condition given in the problem

4.  Solve for t  
   6t = 120 + t
