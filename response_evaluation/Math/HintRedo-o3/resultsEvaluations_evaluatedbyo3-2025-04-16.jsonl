{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.\nThe island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.\nOn April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.\nIf the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?\nBonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?\n Hint: To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.", "Hint": "To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.", "Human Solution": "The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.\nBonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.\nAll villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:\n1) First set the starting point to one.\n2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.\n3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)\n4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.\nWhich points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.\nNote that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.\nThe routes:\nThis is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.\nRoutes to an adjacent village (A to B):\nTo determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.\nThe farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.\nThe next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.\nThe next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.\nThe next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.\nThere are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.\nRoutes to the second village along the coast (A to C):\nA = 1\nAFi = A = 1\nFi = AFi = 1\nAi = A + AFi = 2\nABi = Ai + A = 3\nM and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nM = Ai + Fi = 3\nB = A + ABi = 4\nBi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBi = B + ABi + M = 10\nDi = M = 3\nBCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBCi = B + Bi = 14\nCDi = Di = 3\nCi = BCi + CDi + M = 20\nC = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41\nThere are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.\nRoutes to the opposite village (A to D):\nSince the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.\nA = 1\nF, B = A = 1\nFAi, ABi = A + B = 2\nAi = A + ABi + FAi = 5\nFi, Bi = ABi + B = 3\nEFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4\nM, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:\nM = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11\nE, C = B + BCi = 5\nEi, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20\nDEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25\nDi = M + CDi + DEi = 61\nD = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121\nThere are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.\nBonus Question:\nThe longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:\nA-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D\nand the mirror route\nA-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D\n(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)\nIf the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.\nThe path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.\nThe paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is\n5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)\nSo the total distance traveled is\n10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": NaN, "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.\nSince the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": "Let  \n\n\u2003N = ABCDEF  \n  \ndenote the 6\u2013digit number (all digits different, A \u2260 0).\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n1.  \u201cThe digital sum matches the number formed by the last two digits.\u201d\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nDigital sum : S = A + B + C + D + E + F  \nLast two-digit number : EF = 10E + F.\n\nThus  \n\u2003A + B + C + D + E + F = 10E + F \u2003\u27f9\u2003C + D + F = 8E\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nBecause the digital sum of six different decimal digits is at most 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39,  \nE can only be 1, 2 or 3.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n2.  \u201cThe sum of the first two digits is the same as the sum of the last two digits.\u201d\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nA + B = E + F\u2003\u2003(2)\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n3.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?\n Hint: A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Hint": "A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": NaN, "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.\n Hint: You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.\nThe problem is as much about logic as it is about math.", "Hint": "You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.\nThe problem is as much about logic as it is about math.", "Human Solution": "The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": NaN, "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 10, "Question": "Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.\nWhat is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?\n Hint: The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.\nOf course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.", "Hint": "The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly.

This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.\nFour of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:\nF = (N5)/5\nN5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1\nN4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1\nN3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1\nN2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1\nN1 = 4(N)/5 - 1\nF is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts.

{"ID": 15, "Question": "Question: I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.

The following is the conversation we had.\n\"How old are you Tammy?\"\n\"I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.\"\n\"How old is your Mum now?\"\n\"There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.\"\nAssuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?\n Hint: Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework", "Hint": "Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework", "Human Solution": "Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.\nSolution:\nx = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born\nFrom Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "Question: The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.\n\"That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?\"\nBill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?\n Hint: 1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Hint": "1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Human Solution": "Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.

Doing the same for the professor  \n\n   We need p\u00b2 + p\u00b3 = 10 digits, all different.\n\n   \u2022  If p is 1-digit, p\u00b2 has \u22642 digits \u2192 impossible.  \n   \u2022  If p is 2-digit, p\u00b2 has 3 or 4 digits, p\u00b3 has 5\u20136\u20137 digits.  \n     \u2013  (3+7) or (5+5) can\u2019t occur for a 2-digit number, so again only (4+6) works.\n\n     p\u00b2 has 4 digits when p \u2265 32.  \n     p\u00b3 has 6 digits when p \u2265 47 (because 46\u00b3 = 97 336 is still 5-digit).  \n     p\u00b3 becomes 7-digit at p = 100, so the only range to check is\n\n           47 \u2264 p \u2264 99\n\n   Extra quick eliminations\n     \u2022  If p ends in 0,1,5,6 then the last digit of p\u00b2 equals that of p\u00b3, giving a repeated digit; so those endings are impossible.\n\n     Remaining endings: 2,3,4,7,8,9.  That still leaves only 53 numbers to test.\n\n   A systematic inspection (or a short computer script) of 47\u201399 with those endings gives just one pandigital pair:\n\n       69\u00b2 =  4 7 6 1\n       69\u00b3 = 3 2 8 5 0 9\n\n       Digits used: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 once each \u2013 no repetition, none missing.\n\n   All other candidates fail because some digit is repeated or missing.\n\n   Therefore the professor was 69 years old.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nFinal answer:  Gauss was 18 years old, and the professor was 69 years old.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "1", "human_bruteforce": "1"}

Last-digit condition  \n    The last digit of the product equals O.  In a product of two-digit numbers this last digit is\n        (I \u00b7 O) mod 10.\n    Hence\n        I \u00b7 O \u2261 O  (mod 10)  \u27f9  O \u00b7 (I \u2013 1) \u2261 0  (mod 10).\n\n    So we need 10 | O(I\u20131).  Because I \u2260 1, this forces one of the following:\n        \u2022 O = 0; or\n        \u2022 O = 5 and I odd; or\n        \u2022 I = 6 and O even.\n\n3.  O = 0 is impossible  \n    If O = 0 then the product ends in 70 (since the tens digit is R = 7).  \n    Writing (10H+I) = 40+I and (10T+O) = 10T, we get\n        (40+I)T \u2261 77  (mod 100),\n    but no choice of I (0\u20139 with I \u2260 1) and T (1\u20139) gives a number ending in 77.  \n    Hence O \u2260 0.\n\n4.  O = 5 is impossible  \n    Here I must be 3, 5, 7, or 9.  Trying every I in {3,5,7,9} and every two-digit number ending in 5 shows none give a product whose two centre digits are both 7.  Hence O \u2260 5.\n\n5.  Therefore I = 6 and O is even  \n    O may be 2, 4, 6, 8, but digits must be distinct and H = 4 is already used; O also cannot equal I.  \n    So the only possibilities are O = 2 or O = 8.\n\n6.

{"ID": 63, "Question": "Question: Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.\nEileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.\nNow, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of \"off\".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.\n\"I know that voice!  C'mon down.\"\n\"Who is it?\" Eileen prodded.\n\"Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?\"\nEileen shrugged.  \"C'mon down, Jay,\" Patty called into the leaves.\n\"Why should I?\"\n\"I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.\"\n\"Is that the new Sinatra CD?\"\n\"No, it's the world's greatest snack.\"\n\"I'm hungry, too!\" the other voice whined.\n\"Who's up there with you?\"  Patty asked.\n\"I'll bet I know!\" Eileen called.  \"It's obvious!\"\nPatty's face lit up in realization.  \"Robin!\" they laughed together.\nA pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.\n\"But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,\" Eileen added.\n\"That's okay,\" Robin said.  \"Does it have to be percentages?\"\n\"There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?\"\n\"We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.\"\n\"What are those?\"\n\"You know what a perfect number is?\"\n\"Sure,\" Patty interjected, \"a number equal to the sum of its divisors.\"\n\"Great,\" Jay continued.  \"Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.\"\nPatty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.\n\"So, what do you have for four people?\" Patty encouraged.\n\"I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?\"\n\"I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.

Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.\"\n\"Well, how about an aliquot sequence?\"\n\"Okay.  How does it taste?\" Patty asked.\n\"Can you hum a few bars?\" Eileen offered at the same time.\nRobin laughed.  \"No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.\"\nEileen and Patty understood.  \"So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?\"\n\"Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.\"\n\"Well, do you have any of those handy?\"\n\"It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?\"\n\"Sure.\"  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  \"At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.\"\nJay and Robin shared a glance.  \"Robin, is your homework still in your pack?\"\n\"It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.\"\nTen minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.

Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.

You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?\n(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)\n Hint: ere is the profit made on each size (found using the information in the first few sentences):\nSmall: $0.75\nMedium: $1.00\nLarge: $1.75\nX-large: $2.00", "Hint": "ere is the profit made on each size (found using the information in the first few sentences):\nSmall: $0.75\nMedium: $1.00\nLarge: $1.75\nX-large: $2.00", "Human Solution": "(1): m=4s\n(2): m > l > x > s\n(3): 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650, divided by 25 gives...\n(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186\n(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186\nCan s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.\nCan s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.\nNow we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.\nSubstituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7\nWe know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).\nIf x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.\nIf x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.\nIf x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.\nThis proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.\nSubstituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.\nNow we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.\nThe solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10. This is a total of 35 slushes, and therefore 35 coupons given out. 35 * $0.75 = $26.25 in losses from the coupons. $46.50 - $26.25 = $20.25 net profit when accounting for the coupons.

A 4% birth rate would be 3.96, truncated to 3 births during the year.  A 3% death rate would be 2.97, truncated to 2 deaths during the year.

Dash straight for the shore.  \n    At that instant you are still only r (=0.24) from the centre, so the distance you must now swim outward along the same radius is  \n        D_swim = 1 \u2013 r \u2248 0.76.  \n    Time you need to reach land:  \n        T_swim = D_swim / v = (1 \u2013 r)/v.\n\n    The tiger, being diametrically opposite, must run at least half the circumference of the lake to reach the same point of shore:  \n        D_tiger = \u03c0 \u2248 3.14.  \n    Time the tiger needs:  \n        T_tiger = D_tiger /(4v) = \u03c0 /(4v).\n\n    Compare the times:\n\n        T_tiger \u2013 T_swim  =  \u03c0 /(4v) \u2013 (1 \u2013 r)/v  \n                          =  [\u03c0/4 \u2013 (1 \u2013 r)] / v.\n\n    For r = \u00bc exactly, 4(1 \u2013 r) = 3 < \u03c0, so \u03c0/4 \u2013 (1 \u2013 r) > 0.  \n    With our choice r = 0.24 the margin is even larger:\n\n        \u03c0/4 \u2013 (1 \u2013 0.24) \u2248 0.785 \u2013 0.76 \u2248 0.025 > 0.\n\n    Therefore T_tiger > T_swim; you touch the shore a split-second before the tiger arrives.\n\n5.  Safety.  \n    The moment you are on land you may run off in any direction (or climb a tree!) and the tiger, arriving slightly later, cannot catch you.\n\nThus by exploiting the factor 4, you first build up a 180\u00b0 angular lead inside the critical radius \u00bc, then make a straight 0.76-unit dash to land, while the tiger has to cover about 3.14 units.  The swimmer always reaches the shore first.\n\nFinal answer: Circle inside a radius slightly less than \u00bc of the lake until you are diametrically opposite the tiger; then swim straight outward to the shore\u2014your 0.76-unit swim is completed before the tiger can finish the 3.14-unit run, so you reach land safely.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 126, "Question": "Question: The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.

{"ID": 151, "Question": "Question: In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.\nOn one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.\nFirst, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.\nSecond, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.\nThird, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.\nFourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)\nFor discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.

Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's.

He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.\nHow fast can the man run?\n Hint: You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.", "Hint": "You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.", "Human Solution": "Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.\nFeel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.

This number can be expressed as follows.\na*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =\n9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .\n9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.\nThe smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": "We need the smallest positive integer that  \n\n1. is written using only the decimal digits 0 and 1;  \n2. is divisible by 225.\n\nSince 225 = 9 \u00d7 25, the number must be divisible by 9 and by 25.\n\nStep 1.  Divisibility by 25  \nA decimal number is divisible by 25 iff its last two digits are 00, 25, 50 or 75.  \nBecause only the digits 0 and 1 are allowed, the only possible pair is 00.  \nTherefore our number must end with 00.\n\nStep 2.  Divisibility by 9  \nA decimal number is divisible by 9 iff the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  \nWith digits restricted to 0 and 1, the digit\u2013sum equals the count of 1\u2019s.  \nHence the number of 1\u2019s must be a multiple of 9 (and at least one, since the integer is positive).\n\nStep 3.  Minimising the length  \nLet the total number of digits be n.  \nBecause the last two digits are fixed as 00, the first n \u2013 2 digits supply all the 1\u2019s.\n\n\u2022 To get the smallest possible count of 1\u2019s that is a multiple of 9, we take exactly 9 of them.  \n\u2022 That means n \u2013 2 \u2265 9, i.e. n \u2265 11.  \n\u2022 With n = 11, every one of the first 9 digits must be 1 (otherwise we would have fewer than 9 ones).\n\nThus the only 11-digit candidate is\n\n111 111 111 00\n\n(9 ones followed by two zeros).  \nAny longer number (n > 11) would have more digits and therefore be numerically larger.\n\nStep 4.  Verification  \nDigit sum: 9 \u2192 divisible by 9.  \nEnding with 00 \u2192 divisible by 25.  \nHence 111 111 111 00 is divisible by 225.\n\nIndeed  \n225 \u00d7 49 382 716 = 11 111 111 100.\n\nTherefore this is the smallest positive integer satisfying all conditions.\n\nFinal answer: 11111111100", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0", "human_bruteforce": "0"}
