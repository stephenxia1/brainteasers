{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.\nThe island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.\nOn April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.\nIf the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?\nBonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?\n Hint: To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.", "Hint": "To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.

Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:\n1) First set the starting point to one.\n2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.\n3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)\n4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.\nWhich points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.\nNote that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.\nThe routes:\nThis is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.\nRoutes to an adjacent village (A to B):\nTo determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.\nThe farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.\nThe next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.\nThe next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.\nThe next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.\nThere are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.\nRoutes to the second village along the coast (A to C):\nA = 1\nAFi = A = 1\nFi = AFi = 1\nAi = A + AFi = 2\nABi = Ai + A = 3\nM and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nM = Ai + Fi = 3\nB = A + ABi = 4\nBi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBi = B + ABi + M = 10\nDi = M = 3\nBCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBCi = B + Bi = 14\nCDi = Di = 3\nCi = BCi + CDi + M = 20\nC = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41\nThere are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.\nRoutes to the opposite village (A to D):\nSince the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.\nA = 1\nF, B = A = 1\nFAi, ABi = A + B = 2\nAi = A + ABi + FAi = 5\nFi, Bi = ABi + B = 3\nEFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4\nM, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:\nM = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11\nE, C = B + BCi = 5\nEi, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20\nDEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25\nDi = M + CDi + DEi = 61\nD = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121\nThere are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.\nBonus Question:\nThe longest route is a route to the opposite village.

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits.

There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.

I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?\n Hint: A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.

The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.

The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.\nWe use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).\nThe radius of the circumscribed circle is given by R = abc/4A.", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Let the triangle be denoted by $\\triangle ABC$ with side lengths $a, b, c$ opposite to vertices $A, B, C$ respectively.\nLet $A$ denote the area of the triangle.\nLet $s$ denote the semi-perimeter of the triangle, given by $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$.\nLet $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle (inradius).\nLet $R$ be the radius of the circumscribed circle (circumradius).\n\nWe will use the area of the triangle, as suggested by the hint, to find formulas for $r$ and $R$.\n\n**Finding the radius of the inscribed circle (inradius), $r$:**\n\nThe inscribed circle has its center (the incenter, let's call it $I$) inside the triangle, and it is tangent to all three sides. The distance from the incenter $I$ to each side is equal to the radius $r$.\nWe can divide the triangle $\\triangle ABC$ into three smaller triangles by connecting the incenter $I$ to the vertices $A, B, C$. These three smaller triangles are $\\triangle IAB$, $\\triangle IBC$, and $\\triangle ICA$.\nThe base of $\\triangle IAB$ is side $c$, and its height is the perpendicular distance from $I$ to side $c$, which is $r$. The area of $\\triangle IAB$ is thus $\\frac{1}{2} \\times c \\times r$.\nSimilarly, the base of $\\triangle IBC$ is side $a$, and its height is $r$. The area of $\\triangle IBC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times r$.\nThe base of $\\triangle ICA$ is side $b$, and its height is $r$. The area of $\\triangle ICA$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times b \\times r$.\nThe total area of $\\triangle ABC$ is the sum of the areas of these three smaller triangles:\n$A = \\text{Area}(\\triangle IAB) + \\text{Area}(\\triangle IBC) + \\text{Area}(\\triangle ICA)$\n$A = \\frac{1}{2}cr + \\frac{1}{2}ar + \\frac{1}{2}br$\nWe can factor out $\\frac{1}{2}r$:\n$A = \\frac{1}{2}(c+a+b)r$\nSince the semi-perimeter $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$, we have $a+b+c = 2s$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$A = \\frac{1}{2}(2s)r$\n$A = sr$\nSolving for $r$, we get the formula for the radius of the inscribed circle:\n$r = \\frac{A}{s}$\n\n**Finding the radius of the circumscribed circle (circumradius), $R$:**\n\nThe circumscribed circle passes through all three vertices of the triangle $A, B, C$. Its center (the circumcenter) is equidistant from the vertices, and this distance is the radius $R$.\nWe can use the standard formula for the area of a triangle in terms of two sides and the sine of the included angle. For example, the area $A$ of $\\triangle ABC$ can be given by:\n$A = \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of two sides, and $C$ is the angle between them.\nThe Law of Sines states that for any triangle, the ratio of the side length to the sine of the opposite angle is constant and is equal to twice the circumradius $R$:\n$\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C} = 2R$\nFrom the Law of Sines, we can express $\\sin C$ in terms of side $c$ and the circumradius $R$:\n$\\frac{c}{\\sin C} = 2R \\implies \\sin C = \\frac{c}{2R}$\nNow, substitute this expression for $\\sin C$ into the area formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C$:\n$A = \\frac{1}{2}ab \\left(\\frac{c}{2R}\\right)$\n$A = \\frac{abc}{4R}$\nSolving for $R$, we get the formula for the radius of the circumscribed circle:\n$4AR = abc$\n$R = \\frac{abc}{4A}$\n\nThese formulas express the radii of the inscribed and circumscribed circles in terms of the properties of the triangle, using the area as suggested by the hint.\n\nFinal answer: The radius of the inscribed circle for a triangle with area $A$ and semi-perimeter $s$ is $r = \\frac{A}{s}$.

{"ID": 8, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.\n\"The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.\"\n\"OK,\" says Ralph after a moment.  \"That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?\"\n\"No, no, no,\" replies Rex.  \"I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.\"\n\"The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.\"\nRalph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.\n\"The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.\"\n\"What number am I thinking of?\" asks Rex.\nRalph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, \"OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.\"\nRex frowns and says, \"One of those numbers is divisible by 13.\"\nRalph smiles and tells Rex the number.\nWhat were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?\nNote: The \"digital sum\" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.\n Hint: You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.\nThe problem is as much about logic as it is about math.", "Hint": "You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.\nThe problem is as much about logic as it is about math.", "Human Solution": "The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": NaN, "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "NULL"}

{"ID": 10, "Question": "Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves.

Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.\nOf course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.", "Hint": "The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly.

When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem.

The hint suggests using this ratio.\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system. Let the initial position of Al and Ben be the origin (0). Let the train be moving in the positive direction.\nAt time $t=0$, the front of the train is at position 0, and the back of the train is at position $-L$.\n\nConsider Al's motion. Al starts walking at $t=0$ in the opposite direction of the train (negative direction).\nAl's position at time $t$ is $x_A(t) = -v_p t$.\nAl stops walking when the back of the train passes him. This means at the time Al stops, let's call it $t_A$, Al's position is equal to the position of the back of the train.\nThe position of the back of the train at time $t$ is $x_{train\\_back}(t) = v_t t - L$.\nSo, at $t=t_A$, we have $x_A(t_A) = x_{train\\_back}(t_A)$:\n$-v_p t_A = v_t t_A - L$.\n\nWe are given that Al walks a distance $d_A = 30$ feet. The distance Al walks is $|x_A(t_A) - x_A(0)| = |-v_p t_A - 0| = v_p t_A$ (since $v_p \\ge 0$ and $t_A \\ge 0$).\nSo, $v_p t_A = 30$. This implies $t_A = \\frac{30}{v_p}$.\n\nSubstitute $t_A$ into the equation for Al's stopping condition:\n$-v_p \\left(\\frac{30}{v_p}\\right) = v_t \\left(\\frac{30}{v_p}\\right) - L$.\n$-30 = \\frac{30 v_t}{v_p} - L$.\nUsing the ratio $r = v_t / v_p$, we get:\n$-30 = 30r - L$.\nRearranging this equation, we get $L - 30 = 30r$.

The distance Ben walks is $|x_B(t_B) - x_B(0)| = |v_p t_B - 0| = v_p t_B$.\nSo, $v_p t_B = 45$.

(Equation 2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables, $L$ and $r$:\n1) $L - 30 = 30r$\n2) $L + 45 = 45r$\n\nWe want to find $L$. We can solve this system by eliminating $r$.\nFrom Equation 1, $r = \\frac{L - 30}{30}$.\nFrom Equation 2, $r = \\frac{L + 45}{45}$.\n\nSet the expressions for $r$ equal to each other:\n$\\frac{L - 30}{30} = \\frac{L + 45}{45}$.\nTo eliminate the denominators, multiply both sides by the least common multiple of 30 and 45, which is 90:\n$90 \\times \\frac{L - 30}{30} = 90 \\times \\frac{L + 45}{45}$.\n$3(L - 30) = 2(L + 45)$.\nDistribute the numbers:\n$3L - 90 = 2L + 90$.\nRearrange the terms to solve for $L$:\n$3L - 2L = 90 + 90$.\n$L = 180$.\n\nThe length of the train is 180 feet.\n\nWe can find the value of $r$ as well to check our solution. Using $L=180$ in Equation 1:\n$180 - 30 = 30r$\n$150 = 30r$\n$r = \\frac{150}{30} = 5$.\nUsing $L=180$ in Equation 2:\n$180 + 45 = 45r$\n$225 = 45r$\n$r = \\frac{225}{45} = 5$.\nSince $r=5$, the train's speed is 5 times the speed of Al and Ben ($v_t = 5v_p$). This ratio is greater than 1, which is necessary for the back of the train to catch up to Ben who is walking in the same direction. The solution is consistent.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{180}$.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

The following is the conversation we had.\n\"How old are you Tammy?\"\n\"I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.

By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.

The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.

That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.

If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.

While this is still a large amount, it is significantly more plausible in the context of corporate finance compared to the base-10 result.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the notation 'log' and the wildly different scales of the results, the implausibility of the result from assuming base 10 strongly suggests that the intended base of the logarithm was e.\n\nTherefore, we proceed with the solution obtained assuming the base is e.\nThe amount of money the company will have to spend on research is x million dollars, where x = e^(25/3) - 2.\nThe problem asks for the amount of money in millions of dollars.

They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.\nEileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.\nNow, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of \"off\".

Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with \"rock\", 2 points with \"scissors\", and 1 point with \"paper\".

No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.\n(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.\n(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.\n(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.\nWith these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.\nSo, we're looking to mix our \"throws\" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation\nE = 0*R -3*S +1*P\nwhere\nE = expected payoff\nR = proportion of rocks\nS = proportion of scissors\nP = proportion of paper\nAgainst an all-paper opponent:\nE = -1*R + 2*S -0*P\nAgainst someone running with scissors all the time:\nE = 3*R + 0*S -1*P\nWe know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.

The \"best strategy\" in this context, especially when knowing nothing about the opponents and playing against different opponents each minute, is the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. In a zero-sum game, the Nash equilibrium strategy is also the maximin strategy, which guarantees the highest possible minimum expected payoff. For a symmetric zero-sum game, the expected payoff at equilibrium is zero, which corresponds to maintaining the chip balance over the long run.\n\nLet our strategy be a probability distribution (r, p, s), where r is the probability of playing Rock, p is the probability of playing Paper, and s is the probability of playing Scissors, with r + p + s = 1 and r, p, s >= 0.\n\nThe payoffs from our perspective (Player A) when playing against an opponent (Player B) are given by the rules. Let's construct the payoff matrix, where the entries represent the chip change for Player A:\n\n| A vs B | Rock (r_B) | Paper (p_B) | Scissors (s_B) |\n|--------|------------|-------------|----------------|\n| Rock (r) | 0          | -1          | +3             |\n| Paper (p)| +1         | 0           | -2             |\n| Scissors (s)| -3         | +2          | 0              |\n\nFor example, if we play Rock and the opponent plays Paper, we lose 1 chip (Paper beats Rock, winner gets 1 chip). If we play Rock and the opponent plays Scissors, we win 3 chips (Rock beats Scissors, winner gets 3 chips).\n\nIn a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of a symmetric zero-sum game, both players play the same strategy (r, p, s), and the expected payoff for each player is zero. For a player to be willing to play a mixed strategy involving Rock, Paper, and Scissors with non-zero probabilities, the expected payoff from choosing each of these pure strategies against the opponent's mixed strategy must be equal. Since the equilibrium expected payoff is 0, the expected payoff from each pure strategy must be 0.\n\nLet E_R, E_P, and E_S be our expected payoffs from playing Rock, Paper, and Scissors, respectively, against an opponent who also plays the strategy (r, p, s).\n\nE_R = r * 0 + p * (-1) + s * 3 = -p + 3s\nE_P = r * 1 + p * 0 + s * (-2) = r - 2s\nE_S = r * (-3) + p * 2 + s * 0 = -3r + 2p\n\nAt the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, E_R = E_P = E_S = 0.\nThis gives us a system of linear equations:\n1) -p + 3s = 0  => p = 3s\n2) r - 2s = 0   => r = 2s\n3) -3r + 2p = 0\n\nLet's check if the third equation is consistent with the first two. Substitute r = 2s and p = 3s into the third equation: -3(2s) + 2(3s) = -6s + 6s = 0. The equations are consistent.\n\nWe also have the constraint that the probabilities must sum to 1:\nr + p + s = 1\n\nSubstitute the expressions for r and p in terms of s into this equation:\n(2s) + (3s) + s = 1\n6s = 1\ns = 1/6\n\nNow we can find r and p:\nr = 2s = 2 * (1/6) = 2/6 = 1/3\np = 3s = 3 * (1/6) = 3/6 = 1/2\n\nSo, the mixed strategy is to play Rock with probability 1/3, Paper with probability 1/2, and Scissors with probability 1/6.\n\nLet's verify that this strategy yields an expected payoff of 0 against any pure strategy of the opponent.\nSuppose the opponent plays Rock (r_B=1, p_B=0, s_B=0). Our expected payoff is (1/3)*0 + (1/2)*1 + (1/6)*(-3) = 0 + 1/2 - 3/6 = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0.\nSuppose the opponent plays Paper (r_B=0, p_B=1, s_B=0). Our expected payoff is (1/3)*(-1) + (1/2)*0 + (1/6)*2 = -1/3 + 0 + 2/6 = -1/3 + 1/3 = 0.\nSuppose the opponent plays Scissors (r_B=0, p_B=0, s_B=1). Our expected payoff is (1/3)*3 + (1/2)*(-2) + (1/6)*0 = 3/3 - 2/2 + 0 = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nSince the expected payoff is 0 against any pure strategy, the expected payoff against any mixed strategy is also 0. This strategy guarantees that, on average, your chip balance will remain constant over time, regardless of how your opponents play. This is the best strategy for maintaining your balance of chips.\n\nThe probabilities (1/3, 1/2, 1/6) define the required mixture of Rock, Paper, and Scissors.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Rock: 1/3, Paper: 1/2, Scissors: 1/6}$.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

We need to be able to measure any integer weight $W$ where $1 \\le W \\le 121$.\n\nWe are using a set of scales, which means we can place weights on either pan of the balance. If the item to be weighed, with weight $W$, is placed on one pan, we can achieve balance by placing a combination of our available weights on the other pan, or by placing some weights on the same pan as the item and others on the opposite pan.\nLet the set of weights be $\\{w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n\\}$. To measure a weight $W$, we need to find coefficients $c_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ such that $W = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_i w_i$. A coefficient $c_i = 1$ means the weight $w_i$ is placed on the pan opposite the item. A coefficient $c_i = -1$ means the weight $w_i$ is placed on the same pan as the item. A coefficient $c_i = 0$ means the weight $w_i$ is not used.\n\nThe range of integer weights that can be measured with a set of weights $\\{w_1, \\dots, w_n\\}$ using coefficients $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ spans from $-\\sum w_i$ to $\\sum w_i$. Specifically, any integer weight $W$ that can be expressed in the form $\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i w_i$ with $c_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ is measurable.\nTo be able to measure every integer weight from 1 up to some maximum value $M$, the set of measurable weights must include all integers from 1 to $M$. The total number of distinct non-zero sums $\\sum c_i w_i$ possible is at most $3^n - 1$ (excluding the sum where all $c_i=0$). Since if a sum $S$ is possible, then $-S$ is also possible by flipping all the signs, the number of distinct positive sums is at most $(3^n-1)/2$.\nTo be able to measure all integer weights from 1 to 121, the number of distinct positive measurable weights must be at least 121.\nThus, we must have $(3^n-1)/2 \\ge 121$.\n$3^n - 1 \\ge 242$\n$3^n \\ge 243$.\n\nWe need to find the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies this inequality. Let's calculate powers of 3:\n$3^1 = 3$\n$3^2 = 9$\n$3^3 = 27$\n$3^4 = 81$\n$3^5 = 243$\nThe smallest integer $n$ such that $3^n \\ge 243$ is $n=5$.\nTherefore, the minimum number of weights required is at least 5.\n\nNow we need to find a set of 5 weights that can measure any integer weight from 1 to 121. It is a known result in weighing problems that the optimal set of weights for a balance scale to measure consecutive integers are powers of 3. With $n$ weights $\\{3^0, 3^1, \\dots, 3^{n-1}\\}$, any integer $N$ such that $-\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 3^i \\le N \\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 3^i$ can be uniquely represented in the form $\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i 3^i$ with $c_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. This is the balanced ternary representation of $N$.\nThe maximum positive weight measurable with weights $\\{3^0, 3^1, \\dots, 3^{n-1}\\}$ is the sum of all weights:\n$S_n = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 3^i = \\frac{3^n-1}{3-1} = \\frac{3^n-1}{2}$.\n\nWith $n=5$, the weights are $\\{3^0, 3^1, 3^2, 3^3, 3^4\\} = \\{1, 3, 9, 27, 81\\}$.\nThe maximum weight measurable with these weights is $S_5 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = \\frac{3^5-1}{2} = \\frac{243-1}{2} = \\frac{242}{2} = 121$.\nSince any integer from $-121$ to $121$ can be represented in balanced ternary using these weights, any integer weight from 1 to 121 stone can be measured by placing the item on one pan and the appropriate combination of weights on either pan according to the balanced ternary representation.\n\nFor example, to weigh 50 stone:\nWe find the balanced ternary representation of 50:\n$50 = 1 \\cdot 81 - 1 \\cdot 27 + 0 \\cdot 9 - 1 \\cdot 3 - 1 \\cdot 1$.\n$50 = 81 - 27 - 3 - 1$.\nThis means placing the 81 stone weight on one pan and the 50 stone item along with the 27, 3, and 1 stone weights", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

If the player loses a bet, their money decreases by $B$.\nLet $n_w$ be the number of wins and $n_l$ be the number of losses in the 5 bets.\nThe total number of bets is 5, so $n_w + n_l = 5$.\nThe net change in the player's money after 5 bets is the total amount won minus the total amount lost. Assuming the amount won equals the amount lost per bet (which is typical for a 50-50 chance game unless specified otherwise, and is necessary to set up the equation for net gain), the net change is $n_w B - n_l B = (n_w - n_l)B$.\nWe are asked for the chances of winning $0.20$. This means the net gain is $0.20$.\nSo, $(n_w - n_l)B = 0.20$.\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1) $n_w + n_l = 5$\n2) $(n_w - n_l)B = 0.20$\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express $n_l$ as $n_l = 5 - n_w$.\nSubstitute this into equation (2):\n$(n_w - (5 - n_w))B = 0.20$\n$(2n_w - 5)B = 0.20$.\n\nSince $n_w$ must be an integer representing the number of wins in 5 bets, the possible values for $n_w$ are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nSince the net gain is positive ($0.20$), and the bet amount $B$ must be positive, the factor $(2n_w - 5)$ must be positive.\n$2n_w - 5 > 0 \\implies 2n_w > 5 \\implies n_w > 2.5$.\nSo, the possible integer values for $n_w$ are 3, 4, 5.\n\nLet's consider these possibilities for $n_w$:\nCase 1: $n_w = 3$.

The condition becomes $(5 - 0)B = 0.20 \\implies 5B = 0.20 \\implies B = 0.04$.\n\nThe problem asks for \"your chances\", implying a unique probability. This suggests that there is a specific bet amount $B$ that is intended. The most natural interpretation, given the target winning amount is $0.20, is that the bet amount for each game is $0.20$. This interpretation makes the required difference between wins and losses equal to 1 ($n_w - n_l = 1$).\n\nAssuming the bet amount is $B = 0.20$:\nThe condition for winning $0.20$ is $n_w - n_l = 1$.\nCombined with $n_w + n_l = 5$, we solve for $n_w$ and $n_l$.\nAdding the two equations: $(n_w + n_l) + (n_w - n_l) = 5 + 1 \\implies 2n_w = 6 \\implies n_w = 3$.\nSubstituting $n_w = 3$ into $n_w + n_l = 5$, we get $3 + n_l = 5 \\implies n_l = 2$.\nSo, to win exactly $0.20$ with a bet amount of $0.20, the player must win exactly 3 out of the 5 bets and lose exactly 2 bets.\n\nThe outcome of each bet is independent, with a probability of winning $P(W) = 0.5$ and a probability of losing $P(L) = 0.5$.\nWe need to find the probability of getting exactly 3 wins in 5 independent trials.

There are 9 such pages, using $9 \\times 1 = 9$ digits.\nPages 10 through 99 are two-digit numbers. There are $99 - 10 + 1 = 90$ such pages, using $90 \\times 2 = 180$ digits.\nPages 100 through 999 are three-digit numbers.

The total number of digits used for these pages is $4 \\times (N - 999)$.\n\nThe total number of digits $D(N)$ is the sum of the digits used for pages 1-999 and the digits used for pages 1000-N.\n$D(N) = (\\text{digits for 1-999}) + (\\text{digits for 1000-N})$\n$D(N) = 2889 + 4(N - 999)$\n$D(N) = 2889 + 4N - 3996$\n$D(N) = 4N - 1107$.\nThis formula is valid for $N \\ge 1000$. Since $1000 < N < 10000$, this formula is applicable.\n\nThe problem states that the number of digits used, $D(N)$, was a multiple of the number of actual pages, $N$.\nThis means $D(N) = kN$ for some integer $k$.\nSubstituting the expression for $D(N)$:\n$4N - 1107 = kN$\nWe can rearrange this equation to find information about $N$:\n$1107 = 4N - kN$\n$1107 = N(4-k)$\n\nThis equation implies that $N$ must be a divisor of 1107. Also, $4-k$ must be an integer, which is true if $k$ is an integer.\nWe need to find the divisors of 1107. Let's find the prime factorization of 1107.\nSum of digits of 1107 is $1+1+0+7=9$, which is divisible by 3, so 1107 is divisible by 3.\n$1107 \\div 3 = 369$.\nSum of digits of 369 is $3+6+9=18$, which is divisible by 3, so 369 is divisible by 3.\n$369 \\div 3 = 123$.\nSum of digits of 123 is $1+2+3=6$, which is divisible by 3, so 123 is divisible by 3.\n$123 \\div 3 = 41$.\n41 is a prime number.\nSo, the prime factorization of 1107 is $3^3 \\times 41^1$.\n\nThe divisors of 1107 are found by taking combinations of the prime factors:\n$3^0 \\times 41^0 = 1$\n$3^1 \\times 41^0 = 3$\n$3^2 \\times 41^0 = 9$\n$3^3 \\times 41^0 = 27$\n$3^0 \\times 41^1 = 41$\n$3^1 \\times 41^1 = 123$\n$3^2 \\times 41^1 = 369$\n$3^3 \\times 41^1 = 1107$\nThe divisors of 1107 are 1, 3, 9, 27, 41, 123, 369, and 1107.\n\nThe problem states that the number of pages $N$ is in the range $1000 < N < 10000$.\nWe need to find which of the divisors of 1107 fall within this range.\nComparing the list of divisors with the range condition:\n1 is not in the range.\n3 is not in the range.\n9 is not in the range.\n27 is not in the range.\n41 is not in the range.\n123 is not in the range.\n369 is not in the range.\n1107 is in the range ($1000 < 1107 < 10000$).\n\nThe only divisor of 1107 that satisfies the condition $1000 < N < 10000$ is $N=1107$.\n\nLet's verify this solution.\nIf $N=1107$, the number of digits used is $D(1107) = 4(1107) - 1107 = 3 \\times 1107 = 3321$.\nThe number of pages is $N=1107$.\nIs $D(N)$ a multiple of $N$?\n$3321 \\div 1107 = 3$.\nSince 3 is an integer, $D(1107)$ is indeed a multiple of $N=1107$. The integer $k$ is 3.\nThe condition $1000 < N < 10000$ is also satisfied since $1000 < 1107 < 10000$.\n\nThe hint suggests observing the number of digits for 1000 pages and thinking about the ratio between digits and pages.\nFor $N=1000$, $D(1000) = 2889 + 4 = 2893$. The ratio $D(1000)/1000 = 2893/1000 = 2.893$.\nFor $N$ in the range $1000 < N < 10000$, the ratio is $D(N)/N = (4N - 1107)/N = 4 - 1107/N$.\nThis ratio must be a whole number $k$. So $k = 4 - 1107/N$.\nSince $1000 < N < 10000$, we can find the range of the ratio $k$.\n$1/10000 < 1/N < 1/1000$ (Note: strict inequality is important).\nMultiplying by 1107:\n$1107/10000 < 1107/N < 1107/1000$\n$0.1107 < 1107/N < 1.107$\nNow consider $k = 4 - 1107/N$. Subtracting the inequality from 4 and reversing the signs:\n$4 - 1.107 < 4 - 1107/N < 4 - 0.1107$\n$2.893 < k < 3.8893$\nSince $k$ must be a whole number (integer), the only possible integer value for $k$ in the range $(2.893, 3.8893)$ is $k=3$.\nSo, $k=3$.\nSubstituting this back into the equation $k = 4 - 1107/N$:\n$3 = 4 - 1107/N$\n$1107/N = 4 - 3$\n$1107/N = 1$\n$N = 1107$.\nThis result is consistent with the divisor method and fully incorporates the hint.\n\nThe number of pages the essay contained is 1107.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1107}$.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 92, "Question": "Question: You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?\n(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)\n Hint: ere is the profit made on each size (found using the information in the first few sentences):\nSmall: $0.75\nMedium: $1.00\nLarge: $1.75\nX-large: $2.00", "Hint": "ere is the profit made on each size (found using the information in the first few sentences):\nSmall: $0.75\nMedium: $1.00\nLarge: $1.75\nX-large: $2.00", "Human Solution": "(1): m=4s\n(2): m > l > x > s\n(3): 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650, divided by 25 gives...\n(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186\n(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186\nCan s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.\nCan s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.\nNow we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.\nSubstituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7\nWe know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).\nIf x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.\nIf x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.\nIf x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.\nThis proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.\nSubstituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.\nNow we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.\nThe solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10. This is a total of 35 slushes, and therefore 35 coupons given out. 35 * $0.75 = $26.25 in losses from the coupons. $46.50 - $26.25 = $20.25 net profit when accounting for the coupons.

There are 100 lockers, numbered from 1 to 100. Initially, all lockers are closed.\n\nConsider locker number $k$, where $k$ is an integer from 1 to 100.\nOn pass number $n$, you toggle every $n$-th locker. This means locker $k$ is toggled during pass $n$ if $k$ is a multiple of $n$. In other words, locker $k$ is toggled during pass $n$ if $n$ is a divisor of $k$.\n\nThe passes are numbered from 1 to 100. So, locker $k$ is toggled on pass $n$ if $n$ is a divisor of $k$ and $1 \\le n \\le 100$. Since $k$ is between 1 and 100, any divisor $n$ of $k$ must satisfy $1 \\le n \\le k$. If $k \\le 100$, then any divisor $n$ of $k$ must satisfy $1 \\le n \\le 100$.\nThus, locker $k$ is toggled once for each divisor of $k$. The total number of times locker $k$ is toggled is equal to the number of divisors of $k$.\n\nLet $d(k)$ denote the number of divisors of $k$.\nThe initial state of locker $k$ is closed.\nAfter 1 toggle, it is open.\nAfter 2 toggles, it is closed.\nAfter 3 toggles, it is open.\nAfter $m$ toggles, the locker is open if $m$ is odd, and closed if $m$ is even.\n\nTherefore, locker $k$ is open after 100 passes if and only if the total number of times it has been toggled is odd. This means locker $k$ is open if and only if the number of divisors of $k$, $d(k)$, is odd.\n\nNow we need to determine which numbers $k$ between 1 and 100 have an odd number of divisors.\nConsider the divisors of a number $k$. Divisors typically come in pairs $(d, k/d)$, where $d \\cdot (k/d) = k$.\nFor example, the divisors of 12 are (1, 12), (2, 6), (3, 4). There are 6 divisors (an even number).\nFor a number $k$ to have an odd number of divisors, at least one of these pairs $(d, k/d)$ must consist of only one distinct number, meaning $d = k/d$. This occurs if and only if $d^2 = k$.\nSo, a number $k$ has an odd number of divisors if and only if $k$ is a perfect square.\n\nWe are looking for the number of lockers that are open, which is the number of integers $k$ between 1 and 100 (inclusive) such that $k$ is a perfect square.\nThe perfect squares are the squares of integers. We need to find the integers $m$ such that $1 \\le m^2 \\le 100$.\nTaking the square root of the inequality, we get $1 \\le m \\le \\sqrt{100}$, which means $1 \\le m \\le 10$.\nThe integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\nThe corresponding perfect squares are:\n$1^2 = 1$\n$2^2 = 4$\n$3^2 = 9$\n$4^2 = 16$\n$5^2 = 25$\n$6^2 = 36$\n$7^2 = 49$\n$8^2 = 64$\n$9^2 = 81$\n$10^2 = 100$\n\nThere are exactly 10 perfect squares between 1 and 100.

The length of the circular track is 1800 meters.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, when the two cars race in opposite directions, they start at the same point and meet every 30 seconds. When moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds, $x + y$. The distance covered by car 1 in 30 seconds is $30x$, and the distance covered by car 2 in 30 seconds is $30y$. When they meet for the first time after starting from the same point, the sum of the distances they have traveled is equal to the length of the track.\nSo, we have the equation:\n$30x + 30y = 1800$\nDividing both sides of this equation by 30, we simplify it to:\n$x + y = 60$ (Equation 1)\nThis equation is consistent with the information provided in the hint: $1800m = 30x + 30y$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, when the two cars race in the same direction, they start at the same point and meet every 120 seconds. When moving in the same direction, they meet when the faster car has completed exactly one more lap than the slower car. The relative speed at which the distance between the cars changes is the absolute difference of their speeds, $|x - y|$. The distance the faster car gains on the slower car to meet again at the starting point is one full lap, which is 1800 meters. This takes 120 seconds.\nSo, the relative distance covered in 120 seconds is equal to the track length:\n$120 \\times |x - y| = 1800$\nDividing both sides of this equation by 120, we get:\n$|x - y| = 15$\n\nThis absolute value equation gives us two possibilities for the difference in speeds:\nCase 1: $x - y = 15$ (This assumes $x \\ge y$)\nCase 2: $y - x = 15$ (This assumes $y \\ge x$)\n\nWe will solve the system of equations using the first case, $x - y = 15$, assuming $x \\ge y$. We will verify if this assumption is consistent with the solution we find. The system of equations is:\n1) $x + y = 60$\n2) $x - y = 15$\n\nWe can solve this system using the elimination method, as suggested by the hint (\"Use method of substitution or elimination\"). We add Equation 1 and Equation 2:\n$(x + y) + (x - y) = 60 + 15$\n$x + y + x - y = 75$\n$2x = 75$\nDividing both sides by 2:\n$x = \\frac{75}{2}$\n$x = 37.5$ m/s\n\nNow, we substitute the value of $x$ into Equation 1 ($x + y = 60$):\n$37.5 + y = 60$\nSubtracting 37.5 from both sides:\n$y = 60 - 37.5$\n$y = 22.5$ m/s\n\nWe found $x = 37.5$ m/s and $y = 22.5$ m/s. Since $37.5 \\ge 22.5$, our initial assumption in Case 1 ($x \\ge y$) is consistent with the solution.\nIf we had used Case 2 ($y - x = 15$), we would have added $x + y = 60$ and $-x + y = 15$, which results in $2y = 75$, so $y = 37.5$ and $x = 60 - 37.5 = 22.5$. This solution ($x = 22.5$, $y = 37.5$) is also valid and corresponds to simply labeling the cars differently.\n\nBoth solutions indicate that the speeds of the two cars are 37.5 m/s and 22.5 m/s.\n\nTo confirm, let's check these speeds against the problem conditions:\nOpposite directions: Relative speed = $37.5 + 22.5 = 60$ m/s. Time to meet = Distance / Relative speed = $1800 / 60 = 30$ seconds. This matches the problem statement.\nSame direction: Assume car 1 is faster with speed 37.5 m/s and car 2 is slower with speed 22.5 m/s. Relative speed = $37.5 - 22.5 = 15$ m/s. Time for the faster car to gain one lap = Distance / Relative speed = $1800 / 15 = 120$ seconds. This matches the problem statement.\n\nThe hint also showed a step for substitution from $1800 = 30x + 30y$, which is $1800 - 30x = 30y$. Dividing by 30 gives $y = \\frac{1800 - 30x}{30} = 60 - x$. Substituting this into the second equation, $x - y = 15$, yields $x - (60 - x) = 15$, which simplifies to $2x - 60 = 15$, giving $2x = 75$ and $x = 37.5$. Then $y = 60 - 37.5 = 22.5$. This demonstrates the substitution method also yields the same correct speeds.\n\nThe speeds of the two cars are 37.5 m/s and 22.5 m/s.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{37.5 \\text{ m/s and } 22.5 \\text{ m/s}}$.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

We are given $N_1 = 242$, $N_2 = 160$, $N_3 = 64$, and $N_4 = 22$. Let $N_1$ be the number of teeth on the largest cog.\n\nThe cogs are in constant mesh, forming a gear train. When cogs are in mesh, the distance traveled along the circumference at the point of engagement is the same. If a cog with $N$ teeth rotates by $R$ revolutions, the total \"tooth units\" that have passed a reference point is $R \\times N$. For all cogs in a meshed train, this value must be the same for any given period of time. Let this common value be $L$.\nSo, we have $R_1 N_1 = R_2 N_2 = R_3 N_3 = R_4 N_4 = L$, where $R_i$ is the number of revolutions of the cog with $N_i$ teeth.\n\nFor each cog to be back in its starting position, the number of revolutions it has made must be an integer. That is, $R_i$ must be a non-negative integer for $i=1, 2, 3, 4$. Since we are looking for the first time this happens after the initial state (where $R_i=0$), we are looking for the smallest positive integer values for $R_i$.\n\nFrom the relation $R_i N_i = L$, we have $R_i = L/N_i$. For $R_i$ to be an integer for all $i$, $L$ must be a multiple of $N_i$ for all $i=1, 2, 3, 4$. Thus, $L$ must be a common multiple of $N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4$.\nWe are looking for the first time all cogs are simultaneously in their starting positions, which corresponds to the smallest positive integer values for $R_i$. This occurs when $L$ is the smallest positive common multiple, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of $N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4$.\nSo, $L = \\text{lcm}(N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4)$.\n\nWe need to calculate $\\text{lcm}(242, 160, 64, 22)$.

The highest power is $2^6$.\nPrime factor 5: The powers are $5^0, 5^1, 5^0, 5^0$. The highest power is $5^1$.\nPrime factor 11: The powers are $11^2, 11^0, 11^0, 11^1$. The highest power is $11^2$.\n\nSo, $\\text{lcm}(242, 160, 64, 22) = 2^6 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^2 = 64 \\times 5 \\times 121$.\n$\\text{lcm} = 320 \\times 121 = 38720$.\n\nThe value of $L$ is 38720.\nThe question asks for the number of revolutions the largest cog must make. The largest cog has $N_1 = 242$ teeth. The number of revolutions for the largest cog is $R_1 = L / N_1$.\n$R_1 = 38720 / 242$.\n\nWe can use the prime factorizations to perform the division:\n$R_1 = (2^6 \\times 5 \\times 11^2) / (2^1 \\times 11^2)$\n$R_1 = 2^{6-1} \\times 5^{1-0} \\times 11^{2-2}$\n$R_1 = 2^5 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^0$\n$R_1 = 32 \\times 5 \\times 1$\n$R_1 = 160$.\n\nThe largest cog must make 160 revolutions for all cogs to be simultaneously back in their starting positions for the first time.\nLet's check the revolutions for the other cogs:\n$R_2 = 38720 / 160 = 242$ revolutions.\n$R_3 = 38720 / 64 = 605$ revolutions.\n$R_4 = 38720 / 22 = 1760$ revolutions.\nSince $R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4$ are all integers, all cogs are simultaneously back in their starting positions after 160 revolutions of the largest cog.

Bill said he was going to sit beside the curb and wait until a fare came along.

Frank said he was going to cruise east at eight kilometres an hour and his chances were twice as good as either Bill's or Bob's. Jim claimed that they were all wrong.

Let's define East as the positive direction.\nPedestrians walking east have velocity $v_E = +4$ km/h.\nPedestrians walking west have velocity $v_W = -4$ km/h.\n\nThe problem states that an equal number of pedestrians walk in each direction. This implies that the linear density of pedestrians walking east, $\\rho_E$, is equal to the linear density of pedestrians walking west, $\\rho_W$. Let's denote this density by $\\rho$.\n\nThe rate at which a driver encounters potential fares (pedestrians) depends on the relative speed between the cab and the pedestrians and the density of pedestrians. A higher encounter rate implies a higher \"chance of picking up a fare\". We assume the chance of picking up a fare is directly proportional to the total rate of encountering pedestrians.\n\nFor a driver with velocity $v_d$, the rate of encountering eastbound pedestrians is proportional to $\\rho_E |v_d - v_E|$.\nThe rate of encountering westbound pedestrians is proportional to $\\rho_W |v_d - v_W|$.\nThe total rate of encountering pedestrians ($R$) is proportional to the sum of these rates:\n$R \\propto \\rho_E |v_d - v_E| + \\rho_W |v_d - v_W|$\nGiven $\\rho_E = \\rho_W = \\rho$, $v_E = 4$, and $v_W = -4$, the total rate is proportional to:\n$R \\propto \\rho (|v_d - 4| + |v_d - (-4)|) = \\rho (|v_d - 4| + |v_d + 4|)$.\n\nWe can compare the \"chances of picking up a fare\" by comparing the factor $(|v_d - 4| + |v_d + 4|)$ for each driver.\n\nLet's calculate this factor for each driver based on their strategy:\n\n1.  **Bill:** Sits beside the curb and waits. His velocity is $v_{Bill} = 0$ km/h.\n    Factor for Bill = $|0 - 4| + |0 + 4| = |-4| + |4| = 4 + 4 = 8$.\n    So, Bill's chance is proportional to $8\\rho$.\n\n2.  **Bob:** Cruises west at 4 km/h. His velocity is $v_{Bob} = -4$ km/h (since west is the negative direction).\n    Factor for Bob = $|-4 - 4| + |-4 + 4| = |-8| + |0| = 8 + 0 = 8$.\n    So, Bob's chance is proportional to $8\\rho$.\n\n3.  **Frank:** Cruises east at 8 km/h. His velocity is $v_{Frank} = +8$ km/h.\n    Factor for Frank = $|8 - 4| + |8 + 4| = |4| + |12| = 4 + 12 = 16$.\n    So, Frank's chance is proportional to $16\\rho$.\n\n4.  **Jim:** Cruises west at 12 km/h. His velocity is $v_{Jim} = -12$ km/h.\n    Factor for Jim = $|-12 - 4| + |-12 + 4| = |-16| + |-8| = 16 + 8 = 24$.\n    So, Jim's chance is proportional to $24\\rho$.\n\nLet $C_{Driver}$ represent the chance of picking up a fare for each driver. We have $C_{Bill} \\propto 8$, $C_{Bob} \\propto 8$, $C_{Frank} \\propto 16$, and $C_{Jim} \\propto 24$.

This is false, as $8 \\neq 16$.\n    Bob's chance ($8\\rho$) is equal to Bill's chance ($8\\rho$).\n    Bob's claim is wrong.\n\n*   **Frank's claim:** His chances were twice as good as either Bill's or Bob's.\n    The claim is $C_{Frank} = 2 \\times C_{Bill}$ AND $C_{Frank} = 2 \\times C_{Bob}$.\n    Comparing $C_{Frank}$ and $C_{Bill}$: $16 = 2 \\times 8$. This is true, as $16 = 16$.\n    Comparing $C_{Frank}$ and $C_{Bob}$: $16 = 2 \\times 8$. This is true, as $16 = 16$.\n    Both parts of Frank's claim are true.\n    Frank's claim is correct.\n\n*   **Jim's claim:** His chances of picking up a fare were twice as good as Frank's.\n    The claim is $C_{Jim} = 2 \\times C_{Frank}$.\n    Comparing the proportional factors: $24 = 2 \\times 16$.

This means the total number of gums $N$ must be a multiple of 225. So, $N = 225k$ for some positive integer $k$.\n\nThe problem states that the number of gums $N$, when written in base 10, contains nothing but the digits 1 and 0.\nWe are looking for the minimum such number $N$.\n\nSince $N$ is a multiple of 225, and $225 = 9 \\times 25 = 3^2 \\times 5^2$, $N$ must be divisible by both 9 and 25.\n\nThe divisibility rule for 25 states that a number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since the digits of $N$ can only be 0 or 1, the last two digits of $N$ must be 00. So $N$ must end in 00.\n\nThe divisibility rule for 9 states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. Since the digits of $N$ can only be 0 or 1, the sum of the digits of $N$ is simply the number of 1's in its decimal representation. Let $n_1$ be the number of 1's in $N$. Then $n_1$ must be a multiple of 9. Since $N$ is a positive number (Rob ate some gums), $N$ must contain at least one digit 1, so $n_1 \\ge 1$. The possible values for $n_1$ are 9, 18, 27, and so on. To find the minimum number $N$, we should consider the smallest possible values for $n_1$ first.\n\nLet's start with the smallest possible value for the sum of digits, which is $n_1 = 9$. This means $N$ must contain exactly nine digits equal to 1.\n\nWe know $N$ must end in 00. Let the decimal representation of $N$ be $d_m d_{m-1} \\dots d_2 d_1 d_0$. We know $d_1=0$ and $d_0=0$. The other digits $d_m, \\dots, d_2$ must be either 0 or 1. The sum of all digits is $d_m + \\dots + d_2 + d_1 + d_0 = d_m + \\dots + d_2$. This sum must be equal to $n_1 = 9$.\n\nSo, among the digits $d_m, d_{m-1}, \\dots, d_2$, exactly nine of them must be 1, and the rest must be 0. The number of these digits is $m-2+1 = m-1$. Since exactly 9 of these digits are 1, the total number of these digits must be at least 9. So $m-1 \\ge 9$, which means $m \\ge 10$.\nThe total number of digits in $N$ is $m+1$. The minimum number of digits is $10+1=11$.\n\nLet's consider the case where $N$ has the minimum possible number of digits, which is 11. So $m=10$. The digits are $d_{10} d_9 \\dots d_2 d_1 d_0$. We know $d_1=0$ and $d_0=0$. The remaining digits are $d_{10}, d_9, \\dots, d_2$. There are $10-2+1 = 9$ such digits. The sum of these 9 digits must be 9 (since the total sum of digits is 9). Since each of these digits can only be 0 or 1, the only way for their sum to be 9 is if all 9 digits are equal to 1.\nSo, $d_{10}=1, d_9=1, \\dots, d_2=1$.\nThis determines the number $N$ completely: $N = 11111111100$.\n\nLet's check if this number satisfies all conditions:\n1. It consists only of digits 1 and 0: Yes, it is $11,111,111,100$.\n2. It is a multiple of 225:\n   - The sum of its digits is $9 \\times 1 + 2 \\times 0 = 9$, which is divisible by 9.\n   - It ends in 00, so it is divisible by 25.\n   - Since it is divisible by both 9 and 25, and $\\gcd(9, 25)=1$, it is divisible by $9 \\times 25 = 225$.\n\nSo, the number $11111111100$ satisfies the conditions. We need to confirm it is the *minimum* such number.\nWe found that the minimum number of digits is 11 when the sum of digits is 9. For an 11-digit number ending in 00 with a sum of digits 9, the digits $d_{10}, \\dots, d_2$ must all be 1, which leads uniquely to $11111111100$.\n\nWhat if the sum of digits is 18? Then we need eighteen 1's. The number must end in 00. So we need at least 18 digits equal to 1 and at least 2 digits equal to 0 (at the end). The minimum number of digits in this case would be $18 + 2 = 20$. The smallest such number would have eighteen 1's followed by two 0's: $11111111111111111100$. This is a 20-digit number. Any 20-digit number is much larger than any 11-digit number (the smallest 20-digit number is $10^{19}$, while $11111111100$ is approximately $1.1 \\times 10^{10}$).\nHigher multiples of 9 for the sum of digits will lead to numbers with even more digits, hence even larger numbers.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number satisfying the conditions is indeed the one with the smallest possible sum of digits (9) and the minimum number of digits (11), which is $11111111100$.\n\nThe final", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

This matches the given value.\nSo, the rule for '**' is a**b = a*b + 4a.\nLet's verify this rule with the hint about the difference when swapping.\nf(a, b) - f(b, a) = (a*b + 4a) - (b*a + 4b) = ab + 4a - ab - 4b = 4a - 4b = 4(a-b).\nFor (3, 5), f(3, 5) - f(5, 3) = 27 - 35 = -8.

This is a classic problem of constructing a normal magic square of order 5.\n\nThe numbers to be used are 1, 2, 3, ..., 25. The sum of these numbers is S = $\\frac{25 \\times (25+1)}{2} = \\frac{25 \\times 26}{2} = 25 \\times 13 = 325$.\nSince the sum of each of the 5 rows must be the same magic constant, let's call it M. The total sum of all numbers in the grid is also the sum of the sums of the 5 rows, which is 5M.\nSo, 5M = 325.\nM = $\\frac{325}{5} = 65$.\nThis confirms the hint given: all the rows, columns, and diagonals must add up to 65.\n\nFor constructing an odd-order magic square (like a 5x5 square), a standard method is the Siamese method. Here's how one variant of this method works:\n1.  Start by placing the number 1 in the center cell of the top row. In a 5x5 grid, the center cell of the top row is at row 1, column 3 (using 1-based indexing).\n2.  Place consecutive numbers by moving diagonally up and to the right.\n3.  If the move goes out of the top row, wrap around to the bottom row of the next column.\n4.  If the move goes out of the rightmost column, wrap around to the leftmost column of the row one step up.\n5.  If the move goes to a cell that is already filled, place the number directly below the current cell instead.\n6.  If the move goes out of the top-right corner simultaneously (i.e., out of the top row and the rightmost column), place the number directly below the current cell instead. (Note: In this specific variant, rule 6 is covered by rules 3, 4, and 5. Moving up-right from the top-right cell (1,5) goes to (0,6). Rule 3 wraps row 0 to 5, giving (5,6). Rule 4 wraps col 6 to 1, giving (5,1). If cell (5,1) is occupied, apply rule 5). A simpler combined rule for boundary wrap: if moving up from row 1 goes to row 0, move to row 5. If moving right from col 5 goes to col 6, move to col 1.\nLet's use the simplified wrap rules: if the move takes you to row 0, go to row n (5); if the move takes you to column n+1 (6), go to column 1.

In terms of our variables, we want to find the value of B + S + F.\n\nWe have a system of two equations with three variables. While we cannot find the unique values for B, S, and F individually, we can potentially find the unique value for the combination B + S + F.\n\nFollowing the hint, we will set up the system of equations and try to eliminate into a desirable equation. Let's eliminate F by subtracting the first equation from the second equation, as the coefficient of F is 1 in both equations.\n\nSubtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):\n(4B + 10S + F) - (3B + 7S + F) = 164.50 - 120\n\nPerform the subtraction on the left side:\n4B - 3B + 10S - 7S + F - F = B + 3S\n\nPerform the subtraction on the right side:\n164.50 - 120 = 44.50\n\nSo, we obtain a new equation:\n3) B + 3S = 44.50\n\nThis equation gives us a relationship between the cost of a burger and the cost of three shakes. Now we need to see how this relationship helps us find the value of B + S + F.\n\nConsider the expression we want to find: B + S + F.\nLet's look at Equation (1) again: 3B + 7S + F = 120.\nWe can rearrange the terms on the left side to highlight the desired expression B + S + F and terms related to our new Equation (3):\n3B + 7S + F = (B + S + F) + 2B + 6S\n\nNotice that the term 2B + 6S can be factored as 2(B + 3S).\nSo, Equation (1) can be rewritten as:\n(B + S + F) + 2(B + 3S) = 120\n\nNow we can substitute the value of B + 3S from Equation (3) into this equation. We found that B + 3S = 44.50.\n(B + S + F) + 2(44.50) = 120\n\nCalculate the value of 2(44.50):\n2 * 44.50 = 89\n\nSubstitute this value back into the equation:\n(B + S + F) + 89 = 120\n\nTo find the value of B + S + F, subtract 89 from both sides of the equation:\nB + S + F = 120 - 89\nB + S + F = 31\n\nThe cost of one burger, one shake, and one order of fries is $31.\n\nWe can verify this result using Equation (2) as well.\nEquation (2) is 4B + 10S + F = 164.50.\nWe can rearrange the terms on the left side:\n4B + 10S + F = (B + S + F) + 3B + 9S\n\nNotice that the term 3B + 9S can be factored as 3(B + 3S).\nSo, Equation (2) can be rewritten as:\n(B + S + F) + 3(B + 3S) = 164.50\n\nNow substitute the value of B + 3S from Equation (3), which is 44.50:\n(B + S + F) + 3(44.50) = 164.50\n\nCalculate the value of 3(44.50):\n3 * 44.50 = 133.50\n\nSubstitute this value back into the equation:\n(B + S + F) + 133.50 = 164.50\n\nTo find the value of B + S + F, subtract 133.50 from both sides of the equation:\nB + S + F = 164.50 - 133.50\nB + S + F = 31\n\nBoth original equations lead to the same result for B + S + F when using the derived relationship B + 3S = 44.50. Therefore, the cost of an ordinary meal consisting of one burger, one shake, and one order of fries is indeed $31.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{31}$.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.", "Human Solution": "Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.\nFeel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.

This is a round-robin tournament.\nThe total number of participants is $M+W = M+4$.\nThe total number of games played in the tournament is the number of pairs of people that can be chosen from the $M+W$ participants, which is given by the combination formula $\\binom{M+W}{2}$.\nTotal games $G_{total} = \\binom{M+W}{2} = \\binom{M+4}{2} = \\frac{(M+4)(M+4-1)}{2} = \\frac{(M+4)(M+3)}{2}$.\n\nThe games played can be divided into three categories:\n1. Games played between two men (Man vs Man). The number of such games is the number of ways to choose 2 men from $M$ men: $G_{MM} = \\binom{M}{2} = \\frac{M(M-1)}{2}$.\n2. Games played between two women (Woman vs Woman). The number of such games is the number of ways to choose 2 women from $W$ women: $G_{WW} = \\binom{W}{2}$. Since $W=4$, $G_{WW} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\n3. Games played between a man and a woman (Man vs Woman). The number of such games is the number of ways to choose 1 man from $M$ men and 1 woman from $W$ women: $G_{MW} = M \\times W$. Since $W=4$, $G_{MW} = M \\times 4 = 4M$.\n\nThe total number of games is also the sum of games from these three categories: $G_{total} = G_{MM} + G_{WW} + G_{MW}$.\n$\\frac{(M+4)(M+3)}{2} = \\frac{M(M-1)}{2} + 6 + 4M$.\n$\\frac{M^2 + 7M + 12}{2} = \\frac{M^2 - M}{2} + 6 + 4M$.\nMultiply by 2: $M^2 + 7M + 12 = M^2 - M + 12 + 8M$.\n$M^2 + 7M + 12 = M^2 + 7M + 12$. This confirms the breakdown of games is consistent with the total number of games formula, but it does not help us find $M$.\n\nThe problem gives a specific condition relating the number of games: \"The total number of games that men played between themselves exceeded those played by men with women by 18\".\nThis can be written as the equation: $G_{MM} - G_{MW} = 18$.\n\nSubstitute the expressions for $G_{MM}$ and $G_{MW}$ in terms of $M$ and $W$:\n$\\frac{M(M-1)}{2} - MW = 18$.\n\nWe know $W=4$, so substitute this value into the equation:\n$\\frac{M(M-1)}{2} - M(4) = 18$.\n$\\frac{M(M-1)}{2} - 4M = 18$.\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $M$.\nMultiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n$M(M-1) - 8M = 36$.\nExpand the term $M(M-1)$:\n$M^2 - M - 8M = 36$.\nCombine the terms involving $M$:\n$M^2 - 9M = 36$.\nMove the constant term to the left side to form a standard quadratic equation:\n$M^2 - 9M - 36 = 0$.\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. We need to find two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -9. These numbers are 3 and -12, because $3 \\times (-12) = -36$ and $3 + (-12) = -9$.\nSo, we can factor the quadratic equation as:\n$(M+3)(M-12) = 0$.\n\nThis equation gives two possible solutions for $M$:\n$M+3 = 0 \\implies M = -3$.\n$M-12 = 0 \\implies M = 12$.\n\nSince $M$ represents the number of men, it must be a non-negative integer. The number of men must be greater than or equal to 0. In the context of a tournament with games between men, $M$ must be at least 2 for $G_{MM}$ to be non-zero. However, the problem does not state $G_{MM} > 0$. But $M$ must be an integer $\\ge 0$.\nA negative number of men is not physically possible, so $M=-3$ is not a valid solution.\nThus, the number of men is $M=12$.\n\nNow that we have the number of men ($M=12$) and the number of women ($W=4$), we can find the total number of games played in the tournament.\nThe total number of participants is $M+W = 12+4 = 16$.\nThe total number of games is $\\binom{M+W}{2} = \\binom{16}{2}$.\n$\\binom{16}{2} = \\frac{16 \\times (16-1)}{2} = \\frac{16 \\times 15}{2} = \\frac{240}{2} = 120$.\n\nLet's verify the condition with $M=12$ and $W=4$.\nNumber of games between men: $G_{MM} = \\binom{12}{2} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66$.\nNumber of games between men and women: $G_{MW} = 12 \\times 4 = 48$.\nThe condition is $G_{MM} - G_{MW} = 18$.\n$66 - 48 = 18$. This is true, so our value of $M=12$ is correct.\n\nThe total number of games played is 120.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{120}$.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

If $N < 70$ or $N > 79$, then $N$ is a multiple of 6.\n\nThe hint suggests eliminating possibilities within the range [50, 79]. Let's consider the number $N$ based on which of the ranges [50, 59], [60, 69], or [70, 79] it falls into. These three ranges cover the entire interval [50, 79].\n\nCase 1: $50 \\le N \\le 59$.\nIf $N$ is in this range, then $N < 60$. From condition 1', if $N < 60$, then $N$ must be a multiple of 4. So, $N$ must be a multiple of 4. The multiples of 4 in the range [50, 59] are 52 and 56.\nIf $N$ is in this range, then $N < 70$. From condition 3', if $N < 70$, then $N$ must be a multiple of 6. So, $N$ must be a multiple of 6. The multiples of 6 in the range [50, 59] are 54.\nFor $N$ to be in the range [50, 59] and satisfy conditions 1 and 3 (specifically, their contrapositives, which apply here), $N$ must be a multiple of 4 and a multiple of 6. This means $N$ must be a multiple of the least common multiple of 4 and 6, which is 12. The multiples of 12 are ..., 36, 48, 60, ... There are no multiples of 12 in the range [50, 59].\nTherefore, there is no number in the range [50, 59] that satisfies conditions 1 and 3. So, the number cannot be in this range.\n\nCase 2: $60 \\le N \\le 69$.\nIf $N$ is in this range, then $N$ is not in the range [50, 59]. From condition 2', if $N < 50$ or $N > 59$, then $N$ is not a multiple of 3. Since $N \\ge 60 > 59$, $N$ must not be a multiple of 3.\nIf $N$ is in this range, then $N$ is not in the range [70, 79]. From condition 3', if $N < 70$ or $N > 79$, then $N$ is a multiple of 6. Since $N \\le 69 < 70$, $N$ must be a multiple of 6.\nSo, if $60 \\le N \\le 69$, $N$ must not be a multiple of 3 and $N$ must be a multiple of 6. However, any multiple of 6 is also a multiple of 3 (since $6 = 2 \\times 3$). This is a contradiction. A number cannot be a multiple of 6 and not a multiple of 3 simultaneously.\nTherefore, there is no number in the range [60, 69] that satisfies conditions 2 and 3.

From condition 1', if $N < 60$ or $N > 69$, then $N$ is a multiple of 4. Since $N \\ge 70 > 69$, $N$ must be a multiple of 4. The multiples of 4 in the range [70, 79] are 72 and 76.\nIf $N$ is in this range, then $N$ is not in the range [50, 59]. From condition 2', if $N < 50$ or $N > 59$, then $N$ is not a multiple of 3. Since $N \\ge 70 > 59$, $N$ must not be a multiple of 3.\nSo, if $70 \\le N \\le 79$, $N$ must be a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. Let's check the multiples of 4 in this range:\n- 72: Is 72 a multiple of 3? Yes, $7+2=9$, which is divisible by 3. So 72 is a multiple of 3.\n- 76: Is 76 a multiple of 3? No, $7+6=13$, which is not divisible by 3.

So the premise \"76 is not a multiple of 4\" is false. A conditional statement with a false premise is true. Condition 1 is satisfied.\n- Condition 2: If 76 is a multiple of 3, then $50 \\le 76 \\le 59$.\n  76 is not a multiple of 3. So the premise \"76 is a multiple of 3\" is false. A conditional statement with a false premise is true. Condition 2 is satisfied.\n- Condition 3: If 76 is not a multiple of 6, then $70 \\le 76 \\le 79$.\n  76 is not a multiple of 6 (since it's not a multiple of 3). So the premise \"76 is not a multiple of 6\" is true.\n  The conclusion is \"$70 \\le 76 \\le 79$\". This is true.\n  A conditional statement with a true premise and a true conclusion is true. Condition 3 is satisfied.\n\nSince $N=76$ satisfies all three conditions, it is the number we are looking for.\n\nWe should also confirm that the number cannot be outside the range [50, 79].\nIf $N < 50$:\nFrom condition 1' ($N < 60$), $N$ is a multiple of 4.\nFrom condition 2' ($N < 50$), $N$ is not a multiple of 3.\nFrom condition 3' ($N < 70$), $N$ is a multiple of 6.\nIf $N$ is a multiple of 6, it is also a multiple of 3. This contradicts the requirement that $N$ is not a multiple of 3. So, no number less than 50 satisfies the conditions.\n\nIf $N > 79$:\nFrom condition 1' ($N > 69$), $N$ is a multiple of 4.\nFrom condition 2' ($N > 59$), $N$ is not a multiple of 3.\nFrom condition 3' ($N > 79$), $N$ is a multiple of 6.\nIf $N$ is a multiple of 6, it is also a multiple of 3. This contradicts the requirement that $N$ is not a multiple of 3. So, no number greater than 79 satisfies the conditions.\n\nThus, the number must be in the range [50, 79], and we have shown that the only number in this range satisfying all conditions is 76.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{76}$.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

We can test squares of integers: 1^2=1, 2^2=4, 3^2=9, 4^2=16, 5^2=25, ..., 12^2=144, 13^2=169.\nIf a^2 = 25 (5^2), then b^2 = 169 - 25 = 144 = 12^2. Since 5 and 12 are positive integers, 25 and 144 are positive perfect squares. So, 169 = 25 + 144 = 5^2 + 12^2.\nFor 225: We look for positive integers a and b such that a^2 + b^2 = 225. We can test squares of integers: ..., 9^2=81, ..., 12^2=144, ..., 15^2=225.\nIf a^2 = 81 (9^2), then b^2 = 225 - 81 = 144 = 12^2. Since 9 and 12 are positive integers, 81 and 144 are positive perfect squares. So, 225 = 81 + 144 = 9^2 + 12^2.\n\nWe have now shown that all four numbers in the list can be expressed as the sum of two positive perfect squares:\n25 = 3^2 + 4^2\n100 = 6^2 + 8^2\n169 = 5^2 + 12^2\n225 = 9^2 + 12^2\n\nThis property is common to all the numbers in the list. The question asks for a property *besides* being perfect squares. For this property to be \"besides being perfect squares\", it must not be true for all perfect squares. Let's check some other perfect squares:\n1 = 1^2. Can 1 be written as the sum of two positive perfect squares? No (1 = a^2 + b^2 with a,b > 0 implies 1 = 1^2 + b^2 is impossible, 1 = a^2 + 1^2 is impossible).\n4 = 2^2. Can 4 be written as the sum of two positive perfect squares? No (a^2 + b^2 = 4 with a,b > 0. Possible squares are 1. 1+1 = 2 != 4).\n9 = 3^2. Can 9 be written as the sum of two positive perfect squares? No (a^2 + b^2 = 9 with a,b > 0. Possible squares are 1, 4. 1+4=5 != 9).\n16 = 4^2. Can 16 be written as the sum of two positive perfect squares? No (a^2 + b^2 = 16 with a,b > 0. Possible squares are 1, 4, 9. 1+4=5, 1+9=10, 4+9=13. None sum to 16).\n36 = 6^2. Can 36 be written as the sum of two positive perfect squares? No (a^2 + b^2 = 36 with a,b > 0. Possible squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25. Sums: 1+4=5, ..., 1+25=26, 4+9=13, ..., 4+25=29, 9+16=25, 9+25=34, 16+25=41).\n\nSince there are perfect squares (like 1, 4, 9, 16, 36) that cannot be expressed as the sum of two positive perfect squares, the property \"being the sum of two positive perfect squares\" is not true for all perfect squares. Therefore, it is a property that the given numbers have in common *besides* being perfect squares.\n\nThe common property is that each number can be expressed as the sum of two positive perfect squares.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{They are the sum of two positive perfect squares}$.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

Since the cubes must have integer side length and must be contained within the $N \\times N \\times N$ object, the possible values for $s$ are integers from 1 to $N$. In this case, $1 \\le s \\le 12$.\n\nConsider a cube of side length $s$. We can specify the position of such a cube by the coordinates of its corner with the smallest x, y, and z values. Let's assume the tiny cubes are indexed by coordinates $(x, y, z)$ where $1 \\le x, y, z \\le N$. A cube of side length $s$ with its corner at $(x, y, z)$ occupies the space of tiny cubes from $(x, y, z)$ to $(x+s-1, y+s-1, z+s-1)$.\n\nFor the entire cube of side length $s$ to be contained within the $N \\times N \\times N$ object, all its tiny cubes must be within the bounds $[1, N] \\times [1, N] \\times [1, N]$.

The hint mentions that the full length of the word does not matter, implying that some other characteristic of the word might be relevant. Let's look at the first letter of each country name.\nAustralia starts with A.\nPeru starts with P.\nIndia starts with I.\nScotland starts with S.\nFrance starts with F.\n\nLet's consider the alphabetical position of these first letters:\nA is the 1st letter of the alphabet.\nP is the 16th letter of the alphabet.\nI is the 9th letter of the alphabet.\nS is the 19th letter of the alphabet.\nF is the 6th letter of the alphabet.\n\nNow let's compare the alphabetical positions of the first letters with the doubled distances:\nAustralia (First letter A, position 1): Doubled distance is 1000.\nPeru (First letter P, position 16): Doubled distance is 16000.\nIndia (First letter I, position 9): Doubled distance is 9000.\nScotland (First letter S, position 19): Doubled distance is 19000.\n\nObserving the pattern, we can see that the doubled distance appears to be the alphabetical position of the first letter multiplied by 1000.\nFor Australia: 1 * 1000 = 1000. This matches the doubled distance.\nFor Peru: 16 * 1000 = 16000. This matches the doubled distance.\nFor India: 9 * 1000 = 9000. This matches the doubled distance.\nFor Scotland: 19 * 1000 = 19000. This matches the doubled distance.\n\nThe pattern holds true for all given examples. The rule is: Doubled Distance = (Alphabetical Position of the First Letter) * 1000.\n\nNow we can apply this pattern to find the distance listed for France.\nFrance starts with the letter F.\nThe alphabetical position of F is 6.\n\nAccording to the pattern, the doubled distance for France is:\nDoubled Distance for France = (Alphabetical position of F) * 1000\nDoubled Distance for France = 6 * 1000 = 6000 miles.\n\nThe question asks for the original distance listed for France, not the doubled distance. Since we doubled the original distance to find the pattern, we now need to divide the result by 2 to get the original distance.\n\nOriginal Distance for France = Doubled Distance for France / 2\nOriginal Distance for France = 6000 miles / 2 = 3000 miles.\n\nTherefore, the atlas listed France as being 3,000 miles away.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3000}$.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

The factorial of 0, denoted by 0!, is defined as 1. This is a crucial step as it allows us to introduce non-zero values into our calculation starting from zeroes.\n\nWe are given five zeroes. Let's apply the factorial operation to each of them:\n1. Apply the factorial operation to the first zero: 0! = 1. (We have used one zero).\n2. Apply the factorial operation to the second zero: 0! = 1. (We have used two zeroes).\n3. Apply the factorial operation to the third zero: 0! = 1. (We have used three zeroes).\n4. Apply the factorial operation to the fourth zero: 0! = 1. (We have used four zeroes).\n5. Apply the factorial operation to the fifth zero: 0! = 1. (We have used five zeroes).\n\nAfter performing these operations, we have used all five of the given zeroes, and the result of these operations is five numbers, each equal to 1. We now have the numbers {1, 1, 1, 1, 1} derived from the original five zeroes.\n\nOur goal is to reach a total of 120 using these numbers and any further mathematical operations. We know that 120 is equal to 5! (5 factorial). If we can combine the five numbers equal to 1 to form the number 5, we can then take the factorial of that result to obtain 120.\n\nWe can use the addition operation to combine the five 1s:\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nThis addition operation combines the results obtained from using the five zeroes.

With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.  With the measurement capabilities available to any lumberjack (or any average Homer) precise measurements are not possible.  Thus the need to clarify these calculations as estimates.", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Here is the step-by-step solution to estimate the height of the old oak tree.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n1. Distance from Homer to the fence = 5 feet.\n2. Height of the fence = 8 feet.\n3. Distance from the fence to the tree = 200 feet.\n4. Homer's line of vision = 67 inches from the ground.\n\nWe need to estimate the height of the tree.\n\nFirst, we convert all measurements to a consistent unit, feet.\nHomer's line of vision is 67 inches from the ground. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, his eye height in feet is 67 inches * (1 foot / 12 inches) = 67/12 feet.\n\nThe problem states that Homer could just barely see the top leaves of the tree over the top of the fence. This means Homer's line of sight from his eye level to the top of the tree passes exactly over the top of the 8-foot-high fence. We can model this situation using similar triangles or trigonometry, as suggested by the hint.\n\nLet's use trigonometry based on the hint.\nImagine a right triangle formed by:\n1. The horizontal line from Homer's eye level extending towards the fence.\n2. The vertical line from the top of the fence downwards to Homer's eye level.\n3. The line of sight from Homer's eye to the top of the fence.\n\nThe horizontal distance from Homer to the fence is 5 feet. This is the adjacent side of the angle of elevation from Homer's eye level.\nThe vertical distance from Homer's eye level to the top of the fence is the height of the fence minus Homer's eye height.\nVertical distance = 8 feet (fence height) - 67/12 feet (eye height) = 96/12 feet - 67/12 feet = 29/12 feet. This is the opposite side of the angle of elevation.\n\nLet A be the angle of elevation from Homer's eye level to the line of sight passing over the top of the fence. Using the definition of tangent:\nTAN A = Opposite / Adjacent\nTAN A = (29/12 feet) / (5 feet)\nTAN A = 29 / (12 * 5)\nTAN A = 29/60.\n\nNow, consider a larger right triangle formed by:\n1. The horizontal line from Homer's eye level extending towards the tree.\n2. The vertical line from the top of the tree downwards to Homer's eye level.\n3. The line of sight from Homer's eye to the top of the tree.\n\nThe horizontal distance from Homer to the tree is the distance from Homer to the fence plus the distance from the fence to the tree: 5 feet + 200 feet = 205 feet. This is the adjacent side of the angle of elevation A for the large triangle.\n\nLet H be the total height of the tree from the ground. The height of the tree above Homer's eye level is H - 67/12 feet. This is the opposite side of the angle of elevation A for the large triangle.\n\nUsing the definition of tangent for the large triangle, with the same angle A:\nTAN A = (Height of tree above eye level) / (Horizontal distance to tree)\nTAN A = (H - 67/12 feet) / (205 feet).\n\nSince the angle A is the same in both cases, the tangent values must be equal:\n(H - 67/12) / 205 = 29/60.\n\nNow, we solve this equation for H:\nMultiply both sides by 205:\nH - 67/12 = 205 * (29/60).\n\nCalculate the right side:\n205 * 29 = 5945.\nSo, H - 67/12 = 5945 / 60.\n\nSimplify the fraction 5945/60 by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:\n5945 / 5 = 1189.\n60 / 5 = 12.\nSo, H - 67/12 = 1189 / 12.\n\nNow, isolate H by adding 67/12 to both sides:\nH = 1189/12 + 67/12.\n\nAdd the fractions since they have a common denominator:\nH = (1189 + 67) / 12\nH = 1256 / 12.\n\nSimplify the fraction 1256/12 by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:\n1256 / 4 = 314.\n12 / 4 = 3.\nSo, H = 314/3 feet.\n\nThe calculated height of the tree is 314/3 feet. To provide an estimate in a common format, we can convert this fraction to feet and inches.\n314 divided by 3 is 104 with a remainder of 2.\nSo, 314/3 feet = 104 feet and 2/3 of a foot.\n\nConvert the fractional part of a foot to inches:\n(2/3) feet * (12 inches / 1 foot) = (2 * 12) / 3 inches = 24 / 3 inches = 8 inches.\n\nSo, the height of the tree is 104 feet and 8 inches.\n\nFinal answer: 104 feet 8 inches", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

This is related to geometry, not time.\nD is about the duration of a chess marathon. This is time-related.\nE is about the duration of a show. This is time-related.\n\nQuote C is clearly different from the others because it deals with angles and geometry, while A, B, D, and E deal with time or duration. Therefore, quote C does not belong.\n\nStep 3: Among the time-related quotes, identify a mathematical property that distinguishes one from the others based on their numerical values.\nThe time-related quotes are A, B, D, and E, with assigned numerical values 29, 5, 16, and 60. We need to find a property that one of these numbers (5, 16, 29, 60) does not share with the other three.\n\nLet's consider the property of being a sum of two integer squares. An integer n can be written as the sum of two integer squares (n = a^2 + b^2 for integers a and b) if and only if the prime factorization of n contains no prime number congruent to 3 mod 4 raised to an odd power.\n\nLet's check this property for each number:\n- For 5: The prime factorization of 5 is just 5. 5 is a prime congruent to 1 mod 4 (5 = 4*1 + 1). Thus, 5 is a sum of two squares: 5 = 1^2 + 2^2.\n- For 16: The prime factorization of 16 is 2^4. The only prime factor is 2, which is not congruent to 3 mod 4. Thus, 16 is a sum of two squares: 16 = 4^2 + 0^2.\n- For 29: The prime factorization of 29 is just 29. 29 is a prime congruent to 1 mod 4 (29 = 4*7 + 1). Thus, 29 is a sum of two squares: 29 = 2^2 + 5^2.\n- For 60: The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. The prime factor 3 is congruent to 3 mod 4 (3 = 4*0 + 3). The power of 3 in the factorization is 1, which is odd. According to the theorem, 60 is not a sum of two integer squares.\n\nBased on this property, the numbers 5, 16, and 29 are all sums of two integer squares, but 60 is not. The number 60 is associated with quote E.\n\nStep 4: State the two quotes that do not belong.\nWe have identified that quote C does not belong because it is not related to time.\nAmong the time-related quotes (A, B, D, E), quote E is distinguished by its associated numerical value (60) not being a sum of two integer squares, a property shared by the numbers associated with A, B, and D (29, 5, 16).\n\nTherefore, the two time-related quotes that do not belong are C and E.\n\nFinal Answer Justification:\nQuote C does not belong because it refers to the sum of angles, which is a concept from geometry, unlike the other quotes that pertain to time or duration.\nQuotes A, B, D, and E are time-related, and their associated numerical values (29, 5, 16, and 60 respectively) can be examined for a distinguishing property. The numbers 5, 16, and 29 are all sums of two integer squares (5 = 1^2 + 2^2, 16 = 4^2 + 0^2, 29 = 2^2 + 5^2). The number 60, however, is not a sum of two integer squares (as its prime factorization contains 3 raised to an odd power). Thus, quote E does not belong with the other time-related quotes based on this numerical property.\n\nThe two quotes that do not belong are C and E.\n\nFinal answer should list the quotes by their letter.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C, E}$.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "0", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

In modular arithmetic notation, $p \\equiv 9 \\pmod{20}$.\n\nWe are looking for prime numbers $p$ in the range $(1, 100)$ that are of the form $20t + 9$.\nLet's list the numbers of this form within the given range:\nFor $t=0$, $p = 20(0) + 9 = 9$.\nFor $t=1$, $p = 20(1) + 9 = 29$.\nFor $t=2$, $p = 20(2) + 9 = 49$.\nFor $t=3$, $p = 20(3) + 9 = 69$.\nFor $t=4$, $p = 20(4) + 9 = 89$.\nFor $t=5$, $p = 20(5) + 9 = 109$, which is greater than 100, so we stop here.\n\nThe numbers between 1 and 100 that satisfy the given congruences are 9, 29, 49, 69, and 89.\n\nNow we need to determine which of these numbers are prime.\n- 9 is divisible by 3 ($9 = 3 \\times 3$), so it is not prime.\n- To check if 29 is prime, we test for divisibility by prime numbers up to $\\sqrt{29}$. Since $\\sqrt{29} \\approx 5.38$, we only need to check primes 2, 3, and 5.\n  - 29 is not divisible by 2 (it is odd).\n  - The sum of the digits of 29 is $2+9=11$, which is not divisible by 3, so 29 is not divisible by 3.\n  - 29 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.\n  Therefore, 29 is a prime number.\n- 49 is divisible by 7 ($49 = 7 \\times 7$), so it is not prime.\n- 69 is divisible by 3 ($69 = 3 \\times 23$), so it is not prime.\n- To check if 89 is prime, we test for divisibility by prime numbers up to $\\sqrt{89}$. Since $\\sqrt{89} \\approx 9.43$, we need to check primes 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n  - 89 is not divisible by 2 (it is odd).\n  - The sum of the digits of 89 is $8+9=17$, which is not divisible by 3, so 89 is not divisible by 3.\n  - 89 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.\n  - Divide 89 by 7: $89 = 12 \\times 7 + 5$. The remainder is not 0, so 89 is not divisible by 7.\n  Therefore, 89 is a prime number.\n\nThe prime numbers between 1 and 100 that satisfy both conditions are 29 and 89.\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of all such prime numbers.\nSum = 29 + 89 = 118.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{118}$.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

The hint suggests that if n is a snog, then n = m + 1 for some number m that has a certain property. Let's examine the numbers m = n - 1 for the given snogs:\nIf 25 is a snog, then 25 - 1 = 24.\nIf 73 is a snog, then 73 - 1 = 72.\nIf 81 is a snog, then 81 - 1 = 80.\nIf 9 is a snog, then 9 - 1 = 8.\nIf 33 is a snog, then 33 - 1 = 32.\nIf 41 is a snog, then 41 - 1 = 40.\nIf 65 is a snog, then 65 - 1 = 64.\nThe numbers m derived from the snogs are {24, 72, 80, 8, 32, 40, 64}.

According to our hypothesis, if n is NOT a snog, then n - 1 should NOT be a multiple of 8.\nIf 5 is NOT a snog, then 5 - 1 = 4. Is 4 a multiple of 8?

{"ID": 247, "Question": "Question: The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.\nHe said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?\n Hint: Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations", "Hint": "Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations", "Human Solution": "The observations given are :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nFrom observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.\nLet us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.\nFrom observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.\nHence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.\nIf it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.\nThis means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.\nNow the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number.

By simple substitution the answer is revealed.", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Let the two whole numbers be $x$ and $y$.\nAccording to the problem statement, the square of one whole number minus the square of another whole number equals 73. We can represent this equation as $x^2 - y^2 = 73$.\n\nSince the difference of the squares is a positive number (73), the square of the first number must be greater than the square of the second number. Since $x$ and $y$ are whole numbers (non-negative integers), this implies that the first number, $x$, must be greater than the second number, $y$. Thus, we assume $x > y \\ge 0$.\n\nWe can factor the left side of the equation $x^2 - y^2 = 73$ as a difference of squares:\n$(x - y)(x + y) = 73$.\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are whole numbers and $x > y \\ge 0$, $x-y$ and $x+y$ must be integers.\nFurthermore, since $x > y \\ge 0$, $x-y$ must be a positive integer, and $x+y$ must be a positive integer.\nLet $a = x-y$ and $b = x+y$. We have $ab = 73$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers.\n\nWe need to find the positive integer factors of 73. The number 73 is a prime number. The only positive integer factors of a prime number are 1 and the number itself.\nSo, the only pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ such that $ab = 73$ are $(1, 73)$ and $(73, 1)$.\n\nWe also know that $x+y \\ge x-y$ because $y \\ge 0$ implies $x+y - (x-y) = 2y \\ge 0$. Therefore, $b \\ge a$.\nConsidering the possible pairs $(a, b) = (x-y, x+y)$, we must have $b \\ge a$.\nThis leaves only one possibility for the pair $(a, b)$:\n$a = x-y = 1$\n$b = x+y = 73$\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables $x$ and $y$:\n1) $x - y = 1$\n2) $x + y = 73$\n\nWe can solve this system by adding the two equations:\n$(x - y) + (x + y) = 1 + 73$\n$2x = 74$\n$x = \\frac{74}{2} = 37$.\n\nNow substitute the value of $x$ into either equation to find $y$.

This primality is crucial because it limits the number of factors, making the factorization method very efficient compared to trial and error on the squares of numbers. If the number was composite, there would be more pairs of factors to check, although the parity condition ($x-y$ and $x+y$ must have the same parity) would still limit the possibilities. For a prime number $p > 2$, the factors are 1 and $p$, which are both odd, so $x-y=1$ and $x+y=p$ always gives integer solutions for $x$ and $y$.\n\nThe two whole numbers are 37 and 36.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{37 \\text{ and } 36}$.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}
