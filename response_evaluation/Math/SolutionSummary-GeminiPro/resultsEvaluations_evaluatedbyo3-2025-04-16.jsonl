{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.\nThe island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.\nOn April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.\nIf the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?\nBonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?\n Solution: The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.\nBonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.\nAll villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:\n1) First set the starting point to one.\n2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.\n3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)\n4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.\nWhich points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.\nNote that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.\nThe routes:\nThis is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.

Straight paths connect every pair of villages, creating intersections inside the island. A courtship custom requires a suitor to travel every possible route from his village to the bride's village, with the constraint that he must *always be getting closer* to the destination village. Three sons from village A start wooing brides in villages B, C, and D (the next three clockwise) on April 1st. We need to find the number of valid routes for each son to determine their wedding dates (the day after the last trip). We also need to find the length of the longest valid route if the island's circumference is 10 miles.\n\n**Reasoning and Solution Steps:**\n\n1.  **Model the Island and Paths:**\n    *   The six villages form a regular hexagon (let's label them A to F clockwise).\n    *   Paths connect every pair of vertices (villages).\n    *   These paths intersect inside. The solution identifies specific intersection points:\n        *   `M`: The central intersection.\n        *   `Ai`, `Bi`, etc.: The intersection closest to village A on the path AM, closest to B on BM, etc.\n        *   `ABi`, `BCi`, etc.: The intersection formed by paths like AC and BF (between villages A and B), BD and CE (between B and C), etc.\n    *   This forms a graph where villages and intersections are nodes, and path segments between them are edges.\n\n2.  **Define the \"Getting Closer\" Rule:**\n    *   The core constraint is that travel is only allowed along path segments that move the traveler strictly closer to the destination village.\n    *   Closeness is determined geometrically (e.g., using distances or right-angle projections as mentioned in the original solution, although detailed geometric checks aren't explicitly shown in the route calculation itself, it's the underlying principle).\n\n3.  **Develop a Method to Count Valid Routes:**\n    *   A dynamic programming approach is used. The number of valid routes to reach any node (village or intersection) is the sum of the valid routes to reach the adjacent nodes *from which one can travel to the current node* (meaning the adjacent node is farther from the destination).\n    *   Algorithm:\n        *   Set the starting village's route count to 1.\n        *   Identify all unvisited nodes adjacent to visited nodes that are closer to the destination.\n        *   Select the *farthest* such unvisited node from the destination.\n        *   Calculate its route count by summing the route counts of all adjacent, already visited nodes (which, by the selection process, are farther from the destination).\n        *   Repeat until the destination node's route count is calculated.\n\n4.  **Calculate Routes for Son 1 (Village A to Village B - Adjacent):**\n    *   Start: A = 1.\n    *   Farthest valid adjacent node from B: Ai. Reached only from A. Ai = 1.\n    *   Next farthest: ABi. Reached from A and Ai. ABi = A + Ai = 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Next farthest: Bi. Reached only from ABi (since B is destination). Bi = ABi = 2.\n    *   Destination: B. Reached from A, ABi, and Bi. B = A + ABi + Bi = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n    *   **Result:** 5 valid routes from A to B.\n\n5.  **Calculate Routes for Son 2 (Village A to Village C - Second Village):**\n    *   Start: A = 1.\n    *   Working roughly from farthest to nearest valid nodes relative to C:\n        *   AFi = A = 1.\n        *   Fi = AFi = 1.\n        *   Ai = A + AFi = 1 + 1 = 2.\n        *   ABi = Ai + A = 2 + 1 = 3.\n        *   M = Ai + Fi = 2 + 1 = 3. (M is farther than B from C)\n        *   B = A + ABi = 1 + 3 = 4.\n        *   Bi = B + ABi + M = 4 + 3 + 3 = 10. (Bi is farther than Di from C)\n        *   Di = M = 3.\n        *   BCi = B + Bi = 4 + 10 = 14. (BCi is farther than CDi from C)\n        *   CDi = Di = 3.\n        *   Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 14 + 3 + 3 = 20.\n        *   Destination: C. Reached from B, BCi, CDi, Ci. C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 4 + 14 + 3 + 20 = 41.\n    *   **Result:** 41 valid routes from A to C.\n\n6.  **Calculate Routes for Son 3 (Village A to Village D - Opposite):**\n    *   Start: A = 1.\n    *   Use symmetry (paths/counts on the left side, e.g., via F, mirror those on the right, e.g., via B). Calculate one side and apply to both where appropriate.\n    *   F = 1, B = 1. (From A)\n    *   FAi = A + F = 1 + 1 = 2, ABi = A + B = 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Ai = A + FAi + ABi = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n    *   Fi = FAi + F = 2 + 1 = 3, Bi = ABi + B = 2 + 1 = 3.\n    *   EFi = F + Fi = 1 + 3 = 4, BCi = B + Bi = 1 + 3 = 4.\n    *   M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.\n    *   E = F + EFi = 1 + 4 = 5, C = B + BCi = 1 + 4 = 5.\n    *   Ei = EFi + M + E = 4 + 11 + 5 = 20, Ci = BCi + M + C = 4 + 11 + 5 = 20.\n    *   DEi = E + Ei = 5 + 20 = 25, CDi = C + Ci = 5 + 20 = 25.\n    *   Di = M + DEi + CDi = 11 + 25 + 25 = 61.\n    *   Destination: D. Reached from E, C, DEi, CDi, Di. D = E + C + DEi + CDi + Di = 5 + 5 + 25 + 25 + 61 = 121.\n    *   **Result:** 121 valid routes from A to D.\n\n7.  **Determine the Wedding Dates:**\n    *   Courtship starts April 1st. The number of routes equals the number of days the son makes trips (inclusive of the first day). The wedding is the day *after* the last trip.\n    *   Son 1 (A->B): 5 routes. Last trip is 5 days from April 1st (inclusive), which is April 5th. Wedding: **April 6th**.\n    *   Son 2 (A->C): 41 routes. Last trip is 41 days from April 1st. April has 30 days. 41 - 30 = 11 days into May. Last trip is May 11th. Wedding: **May 12th**.\n    *   Son 3 (A->D): 121 routes. Last trip is 121 days from April 1st. Days in April(30) + May(31) + June(30) + July(31) = 122 days. So, 121 days ends on July 31st. Wedding: **August 1st**.\n\n8.  **Bonus Question: Longest Route Length:**\n    *   **Identify Longest Route Type:** The longest routes occur for the A->D case (opposite village) and involve a path that zig-zags near the destination, like A-B-ABi-BCi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D (and its mirror A-F-FAi-...). *Correction based on original text: The example path given is A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D, implying a jump ABi-C rather than ABi-BCi-C.* Let's assume the provided path A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D is correct within the problem's logic, even if it seems geometrically unusual without the diagram/precise rules. Let's re-examine the text's calculation. It uses A-B-ABi-BCi-C... wait, it *does* use BCi. Let's re-read the calculation part: \"A-B is 5/Pi. B-D bisects C-M, so C-Ci and Di-D are half radius. A-B + C-Ci + Di-D = diameter (10/Pi). Paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, BCi-C are sides of equilateral triangles... Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are half sides...\" This implies the path A-B + B-ABi + ABi-BCi + BCi-C + C-Ci + Ci-CDi + CDi-Di + Di-D contains these segments. Let's recalculate based on *this* interpretation.\n    *   **Calculate Geometric Values:**\n        *   Circumference C = 10 miles.\n        *   Radius R = C / (2 * Pi) = 10 / (2 * Pi) = 5/Pi miles.\n        *   Hexagon side length = Radius = 5/Pi. (This is path A-B).\n        *   The large diagonal (A-D) is the diameter = 2R = 10/Pi.\n        *   The solution identifies smaller equilateral triangles formed by intersections. The height of these is stated as R/2. For an equilateral triangle, height = side * sqrt(3)/2. So, R/2 = side * sqrt(3)/2 => side = R/sqrt(3) = (5/Pi)/sqrt(3) = 5 / (sqrt(3)*Pi). These are segments like B-ABi, ABi-BCi, BCi-C.\n        *   Segments C-Ci and Di-D are identified as half the radius = R/2 = (5/Pi)/2 = 5/(2*Pi).\n        *   Segments Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are identified as half the side of the small equilateral triangle = (1/2) * [5 / (sqrt(3)*Pi)] = 5 / (2*sqrt(3)*Pi).\n    *   **Sum Lengths for the Path A-B-ABi-BCi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D:**\n        *   A-B: R = 5/Pi\n        *   B-ABi: R/sqrt(3) = 5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)\n        *   ABi-BCi: R/sqrt(3) = 5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)\n        *   BCi-C: R/sqrt(3) = 5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)\n        *   C-Ci: R/2 = 5/(2*Pi)\n        *   Ci-CDi: R/(2*sqrt(3)) = 5/(2*sqrt(3)*Pi)\n        *   CDi-Di: R/(2*sqrt(3)) = 5/(2*sqrt(3)*Pi)\n        *   Di-D: R/2 = 5/(2*Pi)\n        *   Total = R + 3 * (R/sqrt(3)) + 2 * (R/2) + 2 * (R/(2*sqrt(3)))\n        *   Total = R + sqrt(3)*R + R + R/sqrt(3)\n        *   Total = 2R + (sqrt(3) + 1/sqrt(3))R = 2R + (3/sqrt(3) + 1/sqrt(3))R = 2R + (4/sqrt(3))R\n        *   Total = R * (2 + 4/sqrt(3)) = (5/Pi) * (2 + 4/sqrt(3))\n        *   Total = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) \u2248 3.183 + 3.677 \u2248 6.86 miles.\n    *   **Result (Bonus):** The longest route is approximately **6.86 miles**.

The new number `y` can be expressed as: `y = r * 10 + d`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Core Equation:**\n    *   The problem states that the rotated number `y` is 1.5 times the original number `x`.\n    *   So, `y = 1.5x`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `x` and `y`: `r * 10 + d = 1.5 * (d * 10^(k-1) + r)`.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Equation (Solve for x):**\n    *   Multiply by 2 to remove the decimal: `2 * (10r + d) = 3 * (d * 10^(k-1) + r)`\n    *   `20r + 2d = 3d * 10^(k-1) + 3r`\n    *   Rearrange to isolate `r`: `17r = 3d * 10^(k-1) - 2d`\n    *   `17r = d * (3 * 10^(k-1) - 2)`\n    *   Now substitute `r = x - d * 10^(k-1)` back into the equation:\n    *   `17 * (x - d * 10^(k-1)) = d * (3 * 10^(k-1) - 2)`\n    *   `17x - 17d * 10^(k-1) = 3d * 10^(k-1) - 2d`\n    *   `17x = 20d * 10^(k-1) - 2d`\n    *   `17x = d * (20 * 10^(k-1) - 2)`\n    *   `17x = d * (2 * 10 * 10^(k-1) - 2)`\n    *   `17x = d * (2 * 10^k - 2)`\n    *   `17x = 2d * (10^k - 1)`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Equation `17x = 2d * (10^k - 1)`:**\n    *   This equation relates the number `x`, its first digit `d`, and its number of digits `k`.\n    *   `10^k - 1` represents a number consisting of `k` nines (e.g., 9, 99, 999...).\n    *   Since `x`, `d`, and `k` must be integers, and 17 is a prime number that does not divide 2, `(10^k - 1)` must be divisible by 17.\n\n5.  **Connect to Repeating Decimals:**\n    *   The condition `(10^k - 1)` is divisible by 17 means `10^k \u2261 1 (mod 17)`.\n    *   This is directly related to the length of the repeating cycle (period) of the decimal expansion of `1/17`.\n    *   The period length of `1/17` is the smallest integer `k` such that `10^k \u2261 1 (mod 17)`. Calculating this (or knowing the property of prime reciprocals) reveals the period length is `k = 16`.\n    *   Therefore, the smallest possible number of digits the solution `x` can have is `k=16`.\n\n6.  **Solve for x when k=16:**\n    *   Substitute `k=16` into the equation: `17x = 2d * (10^16 - 1)`\n    *   Solve for `x`: `x = (2d/17) * (10^16 - 1)`\n    *   The term `(10^16 - 1) / 17` is precisely the integer represented by the repeating block of digits in the decimal expansion of `1/17`.\n    *   `1/17 = 0.0588235294117647...` The repeating block is `R = 0588235294117647`.

This occurs when `d` is smallest, i.e., `d=1`.\n    *   The smallest solution is `x = 1176470588235294`.\n\n**Summary of Solution:**\n\n1.  **Algebraic Setup:** Express the original number `x` and the left-rotated number `y` using the first digit `d`, the number of digits `k`, and the remaining part `r`.\n2.  **Equation Formulation:** Set up the equation `y = 1.5x` based on the problem statement.\n3.  **Simplification:** Manipulate the equation algebraically to isolate `x`, resulting in `17x = 2d * (10^k - 1)`.\n4.  **Divisibility Condition:** Deduce that `10^k - 1` must be divisible by 17, which implies `10^k \u2261 1 (mod 17)`.\n5.  **Period Length:** Recognize that the smallest `k` satisfying this condition is the period length of the decimal expansion of `1/17`, which is `k=16`.\n6.  **Calculate Candidate `x`:** Substitute `k=16` and express `x` as `x = 2d * R`, where `R` is the integer formed by the 16 repeating digits of `1/17` (`R = 0588235294117647`).\n7.  **First Digit Constraint:** Check which values of `d` (from 1 to 9) result in a number `x` that actually starts with the digit `d`. Only `d = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5` work.\n8.  **Smallest Result:** Select the smallest valid `x` by choosing the smallest valid `d`, which is `d=1`.

{"ID": 5, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Ralph was impressed by the ingenuity of Rex's last attempt using clues involving prime numbers, but he thinks he's got an even better one for Rex.

The sum of the first two digits is the same as the sum of the last two digits.\"\n\"Take the sum of the number, the number rotated one to the left, the number rotated one to the right, the number with the first three and last three digits swapped, the number with the digit pairs rotated to the left, and the number with the digit pairs rotated to the right. The first and last digits of this sum match the last two digits of the number, in some order.\"\nRalph then asks, \"If each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs in the number is prime, then what is the number?\"\nRex looks confused, and for a moment Ralph thinks he's finally gotten him. Then Rex smiles, scribbles a few things down on a pad of paper and then says, \"Very nice, Ralph!\"\nRex then tells Ralph his number.\nWhat did Rex say?\n(See the hint for an explanation of the terminology.)\n Solution: 416723\nHere's how Rex determined Ralph's number:\nThe insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.\nSince the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.", "Hint": "The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number.

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y).

The solution finds the number 416723 by systematically applying the given constraints to narrow down the possibilities. A key insight involves analyzing the sum of six permutations of the number's digits, which reveals a condition on the digits of the number's digital sum. This condition, combined with the prime number requirements and digit sum equalities, allows for the elimination of incorrect possibilities until only the correct number remains.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Summation Clue:**\n    *   Let the 6-digit number be ABCDEF. The problem defines a sum `T` of six numbers: ABCDEF, BCDEFA, FABCDE, DEFABC, CDEFAB, EFABCD.\n    *   When these six numbers are added column-wise, each column (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) contains all six distinct digits A, B, C, D, E, F.\n    *   The sum of digits in each column is therefore the digital sum of the original number, let's call it `S = A+B+C+D+E+F`.\n    *   The total sum `T` is equivalent to `S * 111111`.\n    *   The clue states that the first and last digits of `T` match the digits of the number formed by the last two digits (EF). Let `S = 10X + Y` (where X and Y are the digits of `S`). The first digit of `T` will be X and the last digit Y *only if* there is no significant carry-over in the multiplication `S * 111111`. This occurs when the sum of the digits of `S`, `X + Y`, is less than 10.\n\n2.  **Determine Possible Values for the Digital Sum (S):**\n    *   The clue states `S` equals the number formed by the last two digits, `10E + F`. Let this number be `EF`.\n    *   Since EF must be formed from two distinct digits of the 6-digit number, and the pair EF must form a prime number, `S` itself must be a prime number formed by the last two digits.\n    *   The minimum digital sum S (using 0,1,2,3,4,5) is 15. The maximum (using 9,8,7,6,5,4) is 39.\n    *   The primes `S` between 15 and 39 are: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37.\n    *   Apply the condition `X + Y < 10` (where `S = 10X + Y`):\n        *   17 -> 1+7 = 8 (< 10) -> Possible\n        *   19 -> 1+9 = 10 (not < 10) -> Impossible\n        *   23 -> 2+3 = 5 (< 10) -> Possible\n        *   29 -> 2+9 = 11 (not < 10) -> Impossible\n        *   31 -> 3+1 = 4 (< 10) -> Possible\n        *   37 -> 3+7 = 10 (not < 10) -> Impossible\n    *   So, the possible values for S (and the prime EF) are 17, 23, or 31.\n\n3.  **Apply the Digit Sum Equality (A+B = E+F):**\n    *   The clue states the sum of the first two digits (A+B) equals the sum of the last two digits (E+F).\n    *   Test S=31 (EF=31): E=3, F=1. E+F = 3+1 = 4. So A+B must equal 4. The pair AB must form a prime number using distinct digits not already used (3, 1). Possible pairs (A,B) summing to 4 are (4,0) or (0,4). Neither 40 nor 04 is prime. So S cannot be 31.\n    *   Test S=17 (EF=17): E=1, F=7. E+F = 1+7 = 8. So A+B must equal 8. The digits used are {A, B, C, D, 1, 7} and they must sum to 17. The available digits for A, B are {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}. Pairs (A,B) summing to 8 are (8,0), (6,2), (5,3). None of 80, 08, 62, 26, 35 are prime. Only 53 is prime. So maybe A=5, B=3. Digits used {5, 3, 1, 7}. Sum=16. Remaining digits C, D must sum to S - (A+B+E+F) = 17 - (8+8) = 1. The only distinct digits summing to 1 are 1 and 0. But 1 is already used (E=1). So S cannot be 17. (Alternatively, the solution notes the set of digits must sum to 17. Only {0,1,2,3,4,7} works for S=17 and contains 1,7. The remaining {0,2,3,4} have no pair summing to E+F=8.)\n\n4.  **Determine the Full Number for S=23:**\n    *   The only remaining possibility is S=23 (EF=23). E=2, F=3. E+F = 2+3 = 5. So A+B must equal 5.\n    *   The pair AB must form a prime number using distinct digits not already used (2, 3). Available digits {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Pairs (A,B) summing to 5 are (5,0) and (4,1).\n    *   (5,0): AB=05 (prime, but A=0 means it's a 5-digit number, reject) or AB=50 (not prime).\n    *   (4,1): AB=41 (prime!) or AB=14 (not prime). So A=4, B=1.\n    *   Digits used so far: {4, 1, 2, 3}. These are A, B, E, F.\n    *   The total digital sum S is 23. The sum of the middle digits C+D must be S - (A+B) - (E+F) = 23 - 5 - 5 = 13.\n    *   The pair CD must form a prime number using distinct digits not already used ({4, 1, 2, 3}). Available digits: {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.\n    *   Pairs (C,D) summing to 13 are (5,8) and (6,7).\n    *   (5,8): CD=58 (not prime) or CD=85 (not prime).\n    *   (6,7): CD=67 (prime!) or CD=76 (not prime). So C=6, D=7.\n    *   The digits are A=4, B=1, C=6, D=7, E=2, F=3. All are distinct: {4, 1, 6, 7, 2, 3}.\n    *   Check the prime pairs: AB=41 (prime), CD=67 (prime), EF=23 (prime). Yes.\n\n5.  **Final Answer:** All conditions are met. The number is ABCDEF = 416723.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}
{"ID": 6, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?\n Solution: 2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.

Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Hint": "A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.

To find this, we first need to determine the shape (number of sides) of the house and property, which are identical regular polygons. The key information linking the unknown shape to the known dimensions is the length of the excavated pipe, which equals one side of the property and also bisects the area of the house. By setting up and solving an inequality based on the possible lengths of area-bisecting chords for a regular polygon relative to the property side length, the number of sides is found to be 10 (a decagon). Using the given fence length (400 feet for 9 sides), the dimensions of the property and house foundation are calculated. From these, the area of the decagonal house floor plan is found. The area of the central circular atrium is calculated based on its diameter being one-tenth of the property's longest dimension (the diameter of its circumscribing circle). The atrium area is subtracted from the house floor plan area, and the result is doubled for the two stories to get the final square footage.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core unknown:** The shape (number of sides, *n*) of the regular polygon house and property lot is unknown. This is needed to use the geometric relationships and the fence measurement.\n2.  **Relate Property and House Dimensions:** The property is a regular polygon circumscribing a circle with radius *R*. The house foundation is a concentric circle with radius *r*. The distance from the foundation edge to the property edge is equal to the foundation diameter (2*r*). This means the radius of the property's circumscribed circle *R* is *r* + 2*r* = 3*r*. The house is a regular polygon inscribed within the foundation circle (radius *r*).\n3.  **Use the Pipe Information:** An old pipe bisected the *area* of the house polygon, with its ends on the house edge. The *length* of this pipe is equal to the length of one *side* of the property polygon (*s_property*).\n4.  **Establish Bounds on Pipe Length:** For a regular *n*-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius *r* (the house), the length of a chord that bisects its area must be between a minimum (Min(*n*)) and maximum (Max(*n*)) value. These depend on *n* and *r*.\n5.  **Express Property Side Length:** The side length of the property polygon (*s_property*) can be expressed in terms of the radius of its *inscribed* circle (which is *R* = 3*r*) and the number of sides *n*. Using trigonometry, *s_property* = 2 * (3*r*) * Tan(Pi/*n*) = 6*r* * Tan(Pi/*n*).\n6.  **Formulate and Solve Inequality for *n*:** Since the pipe length equals *s_property*, we have: Min(*n*) \u2264 6*r* * Tan(Pi/*n*) \u2264 Max(*n*). We can simplify by setting the house radius *r* = 1. The bounds Min(*n*) and Max(*n*) can also be expressed relative to *r*=1 (e.g., using 2*r* and 2*a* for even *n*, where *a* is apothem). Solving this inequality for integer *n* yields *n* = 10. The house and property are decagons.\n7.  **Calculate Property Side Length:** The fence covers *n*-1 = 9 sides and is 400 feet long. Therefore, the length of one side of the property (and the pipe) is *s_property* = 400 / 9 feet.\n8.  **Calculate Property and Foundation Radii:** Using *s_property* = 400/9 feet and *n*=10 in the formula *s_property* = 6*r* * Tan(Pi/10), solve for the foundation radius *r*. Then find the radius of the property's circumscribing circle *R_prop_circum* (needed for atrium calculation) using the property's apothem (3*r*) and *n*=10: *R_prop_circum* = (3*r*) / Cos(Pi/10).\n9.  **Calculate House Area:** Calculate the area of the decagonal house (*A_house*) inscribed in the foundation circle of radius *r*. The area is *A_house* = 10 * (1/2 * base * height) = 10 * (1/2 * *s_house* * *a_house*), where *s_house* and *a_house* are the side length and apothem of the house decagon, calculated using *r* and *n*=10.

For the inradius, it relates the triangle's area (`A`) to its semiperimeter (`s`) and the inradius (`x`) by dividing the triangle into three smaller triangles using the incenter. This yields `A = sx`, leading to `x = A/s`. By substituting Heron's formula for the area (`A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))`), the inradius is expressed purely in terms of side lengths: `x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s)`. The solution then states the standard formula for the circumradius: `R = abc / 4A`.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n**Finding the Inradius (x):**\n\n1.  **Define variables:** Let the triangle have side lengths `a`, `b`, `c`. Define the semiperimeter `s = (a + b + c) / 2`. Let `A` be the area of the triangle, and `x` be the radius of the inscribed circle (inradius).\n2.  **Geometric Decomposition:** Imagine drawing line segments from the center of the inscribed circle (the incenter) to each of the three vertices. This divides the main triangle into three smaller triangles.\n3.  **Calculate Areas of Smaller Triangles:** Each of these smaller triangles has one side of the original triangle as its base (`a`, `b`, or `c`). The height of each smaller triangle, measured from the incenter perpendicular to the side, is equal to the inradius `x`. Therefore, their areas are `(a * x) / 2`, `(b * x) / 2`, and `(c * x) / 2`.\n4.  **Relate Total Area to Smaller Areas:** The area `A` of the original triangle is the sum of the areas of these three smaller triangles: `A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2`.\n5.  **Factor and Substitute Semiperimeter:** Factor out `x/2` from the expression: `A = (a + b + c) * x / 2`. Recognize that `(a + b + c) / 2` is the semiperimeter `s`. Thus, `A = s * x`.\n6.  **Solve for Inradius (First Formula):** Rearrange the equation from Step 5 to find the inradius in terms of area and semiperimeter: `x = A / s`.\n7.  **Introduce Heron's Formula:** State Heron's formula, which calculates the area `A` using only the side lengths: `A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))`.\n8.  **Substitute Area (Second Formula):** Substitute the expression for `A` from Heron's formula (Step 7) into the formula for `x` (Step 6): `x = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) / s`.\n9.  **Simplify:** Bring `s` inside the square root (as `s^2` in the denominator) and simplify: `x = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) / s^2) = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c) / s)`. This gives the inradius purely in terms of side lengths.\n\n**Finding the Circumradius (R):**\n\n1.  **State the Formula:** The solution directly states the standard formula for the radius of the circumscribed circle (circumradius, `R`) without derivation: `R = abc / 4A`. (Here `a, b, c` are the side lengths and `A` is the area of the triangle).", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}
{"ID": 8, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.\n\"The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.\"\n\"OK,\" says Ralph after a moment.  \"That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?\"\n\"No, no, no,\" replies Rex.  \"I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.\"\n\"The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.\"\nRalph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.\n\"The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.\"\n\"What number am I thinking of?\" asks Rex.\nRalph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, \"OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.\"\nRex frowns and says, \"One of those numbers is divisible by 13.\"\nRalph smiles and tells Rex the number.\nWhat were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?\nNote: The \"digital sum\" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.\n Solution: The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Hint": "You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.\nThe problem is as much about logic as it is about math.", "Human Solution": "The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.

[see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.\"\nNakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.\nIt is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": "Okay, here is a summary and step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning used to solve the Sum and Product puzzle.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe problem is solved by sequentially analyzing the statements made by Sachin and Prashant. Each statement reveals information that allows the participants (and us) to eliminate possibilities for the two unknown numbers. Sachin's first statement narrows down the possible sums. Prashant's statement, combined with the narrowed list of sums, allows him to identify the numbers based on the product he knows. Sachin's second statement confirms that only one initial pair (summing to the sum he knows) leads to a product that would allow Prashant to deduce the numbers. Nakul's statement confirms the uniqueness of the solution derived through this process. By simulating this deductive reasoning, the numbers are found to be 4 and 13.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Initial Setup:** Let the two unknown integers be `x` and `y`, both greater than 1. Brahma calculates `S = x + y` and tells Sachin, and `P = x * y` and tells Prashant.\n\n2.  **Analyze Sachin's First Statement:** \"Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.\"\n    *   Sachin knows `S`. He considers all possible pairs `(a, b)` such that `a > 1`, `b > 1`, and `a + b = S`.\n    *   His statement means he is *certain* that Prashant cannot *already* know the numbers just from the product `P`.\n    *   This implies that for *every* pair `(a, b)` summing to `S`, the product `P = a * b` must have *more than one* possible factorization `(c, d)` (with `c, d > 1`) such that `c + d` *could* potentially be the sum `S`.\n    *   Crucially (as used in the solution), this eliminates sums `S` that can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. If `S = p1 + p2` (where p1, p2 are prime), Sachin couldn't be sure, because if the actual numbers *were* p1 and p2, Prashant (knowing `P = p1 * p2`) might potentially identify them if `p1 + p2` is the only plausible sum arising from the factors of `P`.\n    *   This step generates a list of \"Possible Sums\" that `S` could be (e.g., 11, 17, 23, 27...). Let's call this `List_S1`.\n\n3.  **Analyze Prashant's Statement:** \"Aha! Now I know the numbers.\"\n    *   Prashant knows `P`. He considers all possible pairs `(c, d)` such that `c > 1`, `d > 1`, and `c * d = P`.\n    *   For each pair `(c, d)`, he calculates the potential sum `c + d`.\n    *   Prashant heard Sachin's first statement, so he knows the true sum `S` must be in `List_S1` (from Step 2).\n    *   Prashant can only deduce the numbers `(x, y)` if *exactly one* of the potential sums `(c + d)` calculated from the factors of `P` is present in `List_S1`.\n\n4.  **Analyze Sachin's Second Statement:** \"Oh, now I also know the numbers.\"\n    *   Sachin knows `S`. He originally considered all pairs `(a, b)` summing to `S`.\n    *   He hears Prashant's statement and understands Prashant's logic (from Step 3).\n    *   Sachin simulates Prashant's reasoning for *each* of his initial candidate pairs `(a, b)` and their corresponding products `P = a * b`.\n    *   Sachin can only deduce the correct pair `(x, y)` if *exactly one* of his candidate pairs `(a, b)` results in a product `P` that would allow Prashant to uniquely determine the numbers (i.e., satisfies the condition in Step 3).\n\n5.  **Analyze Nakul's Statement:** \"Now I also know the numbers.\"\n    *   Nakul heard the entire conversation but knew neither `S` nor `P` initially.\n    *   He performs the same deductions as outlined in Steps 1-4.\n    *   His ability to also find the numbers confirms that the entire deductive process leads to a *single, unique* pair `(x, y)`.\n\n6.  **Finding the Solution (Example Walkthrough for S=17):**\n    *   From Step 2, S=17 is a \"Possible Sum\" (17 cannot be written as the sum of two primes).\n    *   Sachin's candidate pairs for S=17 are: (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10), (8,9). Products: 30, 42, 52, 60, 66, 70, 72.\n    *   Prashant's logic (Step 3):\n        *   If P=30: Factors (2,15), (3,10), (5,6). Sums 17, 13, 11. Both 17 and 11 are in `List_S1`. Prashant is unsure.\n        *   If P=42: Factors (2,21), (3,14), (6,7). Sums 23, 17, 13. Both 23 and 17 are in `List_S1`. Prashant is unsure.\n        *   If P=52: Factors (2,26), (4,13). Sums 28, 17. Only 17 is in `List_S1` (28 = 5+23 = 11+17 etc, but the key is 28 is not in the initial `List_S1`). Prashant *knows* the numbers are (4,13).\n        *   (Checking other products for S=17 would show Prashant remains unsure).\n    *   Sachin's logic (Step 4): Knowing S=17, Sachin sees that only the pair (4,13) yields a product (P=52) for which Prashant can deduce the numbers. Therefore, Sachin concludes the numbers must be (4,13).\n    *   Since this works uniquely for S=17, Nakul can also deduce it.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The sequence of deductions logically constrains the possibilities until only the pair (4, 13) remains consistent with all statements. Therefore, the numbers are 4 and 13.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}
{"ID": 10, "Question": "Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.\nWhat is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?\n Solution: First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.\nFour of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:\nF = (N5)/5\nN5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1\nN4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1\nN3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1\nN2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1\nN1 = 4(N)/5 - 1\nF is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.\nSubstitution results in the following equation:\n(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6\nor\n1024N = 15625F + 8404\nGiven that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.", "Hint": "The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly.

In the morning, the final pile is divided evenly by five. This scenario can be modeled using algebra. By defining variables for the number of coconuts at each stage and writing equations for the transformations, we arrive at a linear Diophantine equation relating the initial number of coconuts (`N`) and the final share per person (`F`). Solving this equation for the smallest positive integers `N` and `F` gives the minimum initial number of coconuts. An alternative, more conceptual approach involves using the idea of \"negative coconuts\" or \"borrowing\" coconuts, observing that if we add 4 coconuts to the pile at each stage, the division by 5 becomes exact. This insight leads directly to the solution `N = 5^5 - 4 = 3121`.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning (Based on the Equation Method):**\n\n1.  **Define the State:** Let `N` be the initial number of coconuts before anyone takes any. Let `C_i` be the number of coconuts in the pile just before the *i*-th person takes their share (`C_1 = N`). Let `C_6` be the number of coconuts in the morning before the final division.\n2.  **Model the Night-time Action:** When the *i*-th person acts (for i=1 to 5):\n    *   The pile `C_i` must be divisible by 5 with a remainder of 1. So, `C_i = 5k + 1` for some integer `k`.\n    *   1 coconut is given to the monkey, leaving `5k` coconuts.\n    *   The person takes their share of `k = (C_i - 1) / 5` coconuts.\n    *   The remaining pile for the next person (or the morning) is `C_{i+1} = 5k - k = 4k`.\n    *   Substituting `k`, we get the relationship: `C_{i+1} = 4 * (C_i - 1) / 5`. This formula describes how the pile size changes after each person takes their share.\n3.  **Model the Morning Action:** In the morning, the pile `C_6` is divided evenly by 5. Let `F` be the number of coconuts each person receives in this final division.\n    *   Therefore, `C_6` must be divisible by 5, or `C_6 = 5F`.\n4.  **Combine the Steps Algebraically:** Apply the transformation `C_{i+1} = (4/5)(C_i - 1)` repeatedly for i=1 to 5:\n    *   `C_2 = (4/5)(C_1 - 1) = (4/5)(N - 1)`\n    *   `C_3 = (4/5)(C_2 - 1)`\n    *   ...\n    *   `C_6 = (4/5)(C_5 - 1)`\n    *   By repeatedly substituting, we can express `C_6` purely in terms of `N`. This process leads to the equation: `C_6 = (1024 N - 8404) / 3125`. (This requires careful algebraic expansion and summation of a geometric series, as shown in the thought process).\n5.  **Form the Diophantine Equation:** Substitute `C_6 = 5F` into the equation from Step 4:\n    *   `5F = (1024 N - 8404) / 3125`\n    *   Multiplying by 3125 gives: `15625 F = 1024 N - 8404`\n    *   Rearranging gives the linear Diophantine equation: `1024 N - 15625 F = 8404`.\n6.  **Solve for the Smallest Positive Integer Solution:** We need the smallest positive integer `N` (initial coconuts) for which there exists a positive integer `F` (final share). This equation can be solved using techniques like the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or modular arithmetic.\n    *   Working modulo 1024 simplifies the equation: `-15625 F = 8404 (mod 1024)`.\n    *   Reducing the coefficients modulo 1024 gives: `-265 F = 212 (mod 1024)` or `265 F = -212 = 812 (mod 1024)`.\n    *   Solving this congruence yields the smallest positive integer solution for `F` as `F = 204`.\n7.  **Calculate the Minimum Initial Number:** Substitute `F = 204` back into the Diophantine equation:\n    *   `1024 N = 15625 * 204 + 8404`\n    *   `1024 N = 3187500 + 8404 = 3195904`\n    *   `N = 3195904 / 1024 = 3121`.\n    *   Therefore, the least number of whole coconuts the pile could have had initially is 3121.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

Parentheses can be used for grouping, but digits cannot be combined (e.g., '44' is not allowed).\n2.  **Demonstrate Formation of Lower Integers (Basic Operations):** Show through examples (like 0 = 4+4-4-4, 1 = 4/4 * 4/4, ..., 9 = 4+4+4/4) that the integers from 0 to 9 can be formed, initially relying heavily on basic arithmetic operations.

This is determined by comparing the distances walked by Al and Ben with the distance traveled by the train in the same time intervals, establishing the relative speed of the train, and then calculating the train's length based on the positions of its front and back when the back passes Al.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key Events:** The two key events are: (A) the back of the train passing Al, and (B) the back of the train passing Ben. Al stops walking at event A, Ben stops walking at event B.\n2.  **Analyze Distances at Event A:** Since Al and Ben walk at the same speed, by the time the back of the train passes Al (who has walked 30 feet), Ben must have also walked 30 feet in the opposite direction.\n3.  **Analyze the Interval Between Events A and B:** After the back of the train passes Al (Event A), Ben continues walking until the back passes him (Event B). During this time interval, Ben walks an additional 45 ft (his total) - 30 ft (walked by Event A) = 15 feet.\n4.  **Calculate Distance Traveled by Train's Back Between A and B:** At Event A, Al is 30 feet from the start point (opposite the train's direction) and Ben is 30 feet from the start point (in the train's direction). The distance between them is 30 + 30 = 60 feet. For the back of the train to reach Ben later (at Event B), it must cover this 60-foot gap *plus* the extra 15 feet Ben walks during this interval. So, the back of the train travels 60 + 15 = 75 feet between Event A and Event B.\n5.  **Determine Relative Speeds:** In the time interval between Event A and Event B, Ben walks 15 feet, and the back of the train travels 75 feet. Since they travel for the same amount of time, the train's speed must be 75 / 15 = 5 times Ben's (and Al's) walking speed.\n6.  **Calculate Train Length:** Consider the time from the start until Event A (when the back passes Al).\n    *   Al walks 30 feet away from the train's direction. Let the starting point be 0. Al is at position -30. The back of the train is also at position -30.\n    *   In this same time, the train travels 5 times the distance Al walked, relative to the starting point. So the train (specifically its front, which started at 0) has moved 5 * 30 = 150 feet. The front of the train is at position +150.\n    *   The length of the train is the distance between its front and back: Length = Position(Front) - Position(Back) = 150 - (-30) = 150 + 30 = 180 feet.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

If the hour hand is in the sector corresponding to hour `i` (where `i = floor(H/30)`), then `H = 30*i + (M/360) * 30 = 30i + M/12`.

So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?\n Solution: Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.\nSolution:\nx = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born\nFrom Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.\nGoing back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.

So, `z = x + y`.\n    *   The clue \"When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy (`x`)\" implies `Tony's current age + (50 - Mum's current age) = x`.\n    *   Since `Mum's current age = z + Tony's current age`, substituting gives `Tony's current age + (50 - (z + Tony's current age)) = x`, which simplifies to `50 - z = x`.\n    *   Substitute `x = 50 - z` into `z = x + y`: `z = (50 - z) + y`, which rearranges to `2z - y = 50` or `2z = 50 + y`.\n\n2.  **Find possible values for Mum's and Tommy's ages when Tony was born:**\n    *   We know `y` (Tommy's age when Tony was born) must be a factor of `z` (Mum's age when Tony was born) because Mum gave birth to Tommy `y` years before Tony.\n    *   We need to find integer pairs `(y, z)` that satisfy `2z = 50 + y` where `y` is a factor of `z`.\n    *   Testing integer values reveals two possible solutions: (`y=2, z=26`) and (`y=10, z=30`).\n\n3.  **Determine the correct ages using the 'factors' clue:**\n    *   The clue states that when Tony was born (Mum age `z`, Tommy age `y`), the ages of Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, and Tracey were *all* factors of Mum's age (`z`).\n    *   Case 1: `z=26`, `y=10`. Factors of 26 are 1, 2, 13, 26. Tommy is 2. The other three children (Timmy, Tammy, Tracey) must have distinct ages less than 2, which must be factors of 26. The only factor less than 2 is 1. It's impossible for three distinct children to all be age 1. So, this case is invalid.\n    *   Case 2: `z=30`, `y=10`. Factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30. Tommy is 10. We need three more distinct ages for Timmy, Tammy, and Tracey from the factors of 30 that are less than 10 ({1, 2, 3, 5, 6}). This is possible.\n    *   Therefore, when Tony was born, Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10.\n\n4.  **Determine the specific ages of Timmy, Tammy, and Tracey when Tony was born:**\n    *   Their ages must be chosen from the factors {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}.\n    *   Given the birth order (Tommy oldest, Timmy, Tammy middle, Tracey, Tony youngest), their ages must be in decreasing order: Tommy (10) > Timmy > Tammy > Tracey > Tony (0).\n    *   The clue \"Tammy, the middle child\" helps place her relative to Timmy and Tracey.\n    *   The clue \"I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born\" implies Timmy's age then was a factor of Tammy's current age divided by 3.\n    *   The clue about the \"second factor year\" (when Tracey was half Tammy's current age) helps confirm the ages. Let's assume ages and verify later: The only assignment from {1, 2, 3, 5, 6} fitting the birth order and Tammy being the middle child is Timmy=6, Tammy=5, Tracey=3.\n\n5.  **Calculate Tammy's current age:**\n    *   Tammy states: \"I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.\"\n    *   Using Timmy's age = 6 from Step 4, Tammy's current age = 3 * 6 = 18.\n\n6.  **Verify ages using the \"second factor year\" clue:**\n    *   This second year occurred when Tracey was half Tammy's current age: Tracey's age = 18 / 2 = 9.\n    *   Tracey was 3 when Tony was born. To reach age 9, `9 - 3 = 6` years must have passed since Tony's birth. So, this second year was when Tony was 6.\n    *   Ages in the second year (Tony=6): Mum=30+6=36, Tommy=10+6=16, Timmy=6+6=12, Tammy=5+6=11, Tracey=3+6=9, Tony=6.\n    *   Check if \"more than two\" (at least 3) children's ages are factors of Mum's age (36). Factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.\n    *   The children's ages that are factors of 36 are 6 (Tony), 9 (Tracey), and 12 (Timmy). There are exactly 3, which satisfies \"more than two\".\n    *   This confirms the ages assigned in Step 4 (Timmy=6, Tammy=5, Tracey=3 when Tony was born) are correct.\n\n7.  **Calculate the time elapsed and current ages:**\n    *   Tammy was 5 when Tony was born, and she is now 18.\n    *   The time elapsed since Tony was born is `18 - 5 = 13` years.\n    *   Add 13 years to everyone's age from when Tony was born (Age 0):\n        *   Mum: 30 + 13 = 43\n        *   Tommy: 10 + 13 = 23\n        *   Timmy: 6 + 13 = 19\n        *   Tammy: 5 + 13 = 18\n        *   Tracey: 3 + 13 = 16\n        *   Tony: 0 + 13 = 13\n\n8.  **Final Answer:** The current ages are: Tommy=23, Timmy=19, Tammy=18, Tracey=16, Tony=13, and Mum=43.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}
{"ID": 16, "Question": "Question: The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.\n\"That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?\"\nBill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?\n Solution: Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.

Using modular arithmetic (specifically modulo 9) and logical deduction based on age constraints and the wedding timeline, the solution concludes that the current ages are Alice 27, Barbara 28, Cheryl 20, and Denise 21.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Define Variables and Conditions:** Let the current ages of Alice, Barbara, Cheryl, and Denise be a, b, c, and d, respectively. The problem states there were four weddings on June 30th over the last four years (3 years ago, 2 years ago, 1 year ago, and this year) for Alice, Barbara, Cheryl, and Denise, respectively. The key condition is that on the day of her wedding, the bride's age was equal to the sum of the digits (sod) of her three sisters' ages *at that time*.\n\n2.  **Introduce Modular Arithmetic Property:** Utilize the mathematical property that any integer N is congruent to the sum of its digits modulo 9 (N \u2261 sod(N) mod 9). This property allows transforming the condition involving the sum of digits into a simpler congruence relation involving the ages themselves.\n\n3.  **Formulate Congruences:** Apply the property from Step 2 to the wedding condition for each sister, considering their ages at the time of each wedding:\n    *   Denise's wedding (now): `d = sod(a) + sod(b) + sod(c)` => `d \u2261 a + b + c (mod 9)`\n    *   Cheryl's wedding (1 year ago): `c-1 = sod(a-1) + sod(b-1) + sod(d-1)` => `c-1 \u2261 (a-1) + (b-1) + (d-1) (mod 9)`\n    *   Barbara's wedding (2 years ago): `b-2 = sod(a-2) + sod(c-2) + sod(d-2)` => `b-2 \u2261 (a-2) + (c-2) + (d-2) (mod 9)`\n    *   Alice's wedding (3 years ago): `a-3 = sod(b-3) + sod(c-3) + sod(d-3)` => `a-3 \u2261 (b-3) + (c-3) + (d-3) (mod 9)`\n\n4.  **Solve the System of Congruences:** Solve the system of four linear congruences derived in Step 3 for the variables a, b, c, and d modulo 9. The solution finds the unique result:\n    *   `a \u2261 0 (mod 9)`\n    *   `b \u2261 1 (mod 9)`\n    *   `c \u2261 2 (mod 9)`\n    *   `d \u2261 3 (mod 9)`\n    This tells us the remainder of each sister's current age when divided by 9.\n\n5.  **Deduce Exact Ages using Constraints (Starting with Alice):** Combine the congruences (Step 4) with the original digit sum condition and logical constraints. Start with the earliest wedding (Alice's, 3 years ago).\n    *   At that time, ages were a-3, b-3, c-3, d-3. Their congruences (mod 9) were 6, 7, 8, 0 respectively.\n    *   Alice's condition: `a-3 = sod(b-3) + sod(c-3) + sod(d-3)`.\n    *   Using reasonable age limits (e.g., ages are likely below 100, limiting digit sums) and the congruences, deduce the only plausible digit sums for sisters' ages lead to `a-3 = 24`. This makes Alice's current age `a = 27`. (Note: `24 \u2261 6 mod 9` fits).\n\n6.  **Deduce Subsequent Ages (Barbara, Cheryl, Denise):** Repeat the deductive process for the subsequent weddings, incorporating the ages already found:\n    *   Barbara's wedding (2 years ago): Ages were a-2=25, b-2, c-2, d-2. Congruences (mod 9) were 7, 8, 0, 1. Condition: `b-2 = sod(a-2) + sod(c-2) + sod(d-2)`. This leads to `b-2 = 26`, so current age `b = 28`.\n    *   Cheryl's wedding (1 year ago): Ages were a-1=26, b-1=27, c-1, d-1. Congruences (mod 9) were 8, 0, 1, 2. Condition: `c-1 = sod(a-1) + sod(b-1) + sod(d-1)`. This leads to `c-1 = 19`, so current age `c = 20`.\n    *   Denise's wedding (now): Ages are a=27, b=28, c=20, d. Condition: `d = sod(a) + sod(b) + sod(c)`. `d = sod(27) + sod(28) + sod(20) = (2+7) + (2+8) + (2+0) = 9 + 10 + 2 = 21`. So current age `d = 21`. (Note: `21 \u2261 3 mod 9` fits).\n\n7.  **Final Verification:** Check that the determined current ages (A=27, B=28, C=20, D=21) satisfy the digit sum condition for all four weddings as demonstrated in the original solution's verification section.

The provided answer for this is 169,518,829,100,544,000.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the total number of distinct sequences of legal moves that can occur from the start of a chess game up to Black's 10th move (a total of 20 plies or half-moves).\n\n2.  **Identify the Process:** Calculating this number involves exploring the \"game tree\" of chess.\n    *   Start at the initial position.\n    *   Determine all legal moves for White (1st ply).\n    *   For *each* resulting board position, determine all legal moves for Black (2nd ply).\n    *   Continue this process, alternating players, for 20 plies.\n    *   The total count of unique sequences of moves generated by this process is the desired number.\n\n3.  **Recognize the Complexity:** The number of legal moves available changes significantly at each step (ply) and depends entirely on the specific board position reached. There isn't a simple constant branching factor. This means:\n    *   The number of possible game sequences grows extremely rapidly (often described as exponential, though the rate varies).\n    *   You cannot simply extrapolate the number of ways for 20 plies based *only* on the number of ways for 8 plies using a basic mathematical formula (like simple multiplication or raising to a power).

This involves building a game tree where each path represents a unique sequence of moves.

The solution uses algebraic equations derived from these statements to find the unique amounts. Sandy's statements establish a fixed ratio between their wealth (Sue has 7/5 times Sandy's wealth). Sue's statement describes a relationship based on manipulating the digits of her wealth to get Sandy's wealth. Combining these relationships leads to an equation involving the digits of Sue's wealth, which is solved using number theory (divisibility) and checking possibilities for the number of digits, ultimately revealing their exact wealth amounts.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Define variables and translate Sandy's statement into equations:** Let X be Sandy's amount, Y be Sue's amount, and Z be the amount transferred. Sandy's statement gives two equations:\n    *   `X + Z = Y - Z` (If Sue gives Z dollars, they have the same amount)\n    *   `Y + Z = 2(X - Z)` (If Sandy gives Z dollars, Sue has twice Sandy's amount)\n\n2.  **Solve the system of equations from Step 1:** Solving these two equations simultaneously yields the relationship between their wealth: `X = 5Z` and `Y = 7Z`. This means their amounts are in the ratio X:Y = 5:7, or equivalently, `7X = 5Y`.\n\n3.  **Translate Sue's statement into an equation using digit manipulation:** Let Y (Sue's wealth) have `n` digits, with the first digit being `A` and the number formed by the remaining digits being `B`. Then `Y = A * 10^(n-1) + B`. Sue states that moving the first digit `A` to the end results in Sandy's wealth `X`. This means `X = 10B + A`.\n\n4.  **Combine the relationships from Step 2 and Step 3:** Substitute the expressions for X and Y from Step 3 into the ratio `7X = 5Y` found in Step 2:\n    *   `7 * (10B + A) = 5 * (A * 10^(n-1) + B)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the combined equation and isolate terms involving A and B:** Rearranging the equation from Step 4 gives:\n    *   `70B + 7A = 5A * 10^(n-1) + 5B`\n    *   `65B = A * (5 * 10^(n-1) - 7)`\n\n6.  **Deduce the value of the first digit (A) using divisibility:** Observe that the left side, `65B`, is divisible by 5. On the right side, the term `(5 * 10^(n-1) - 7)` is *not* divisible by 5 (it ends in 3). Therefore, for the right side to be divisible by 5, the factor `A` must be divisible by 5. Since `A` is a single, non-zero first digit, `A` must equal 5.\n\n7.  **Substitute A=5 and find the condition for n (number of digits):** Replace A with 5 in the equation from Step 5:\n    *   `65B = 5 * (5 * 10^(n-1) - 7)`\n    *   Divide by 5: `13B = 5 * 10^(n-1) - 7`\n    This shows that `(5 * 10^(n-1) - 7)` must be divisible by 13.\n\n8.  **Find the smallest valid number of digits (n):** Test small integer values for `n` to find when `(5 * 10^(n-1) - 7)` is divisible by 13.

We need to calculate `LCM(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)`.\n    *   Prime factorizations: 2=2, 3=3, 4=2\u00b2, 5=5, 6=2*3, 7=7, 8=2\u00b3, 9=3\u00b2, 10=2*5.\n    *   LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor present: `2\u00b3 * 3\u00b2 * 5 * 7 = 8 * 9 * 5 * 7 = 72 * 35 = 2520`.\n    *   Therefore, `N - 1` must be a multiple of 2520.\n\n4.  **Express N in terms of the LCM:**\n    Since `N - 1` is a multiple of 2520, we can write `N - 1 = k * 2520` for some positive integer `k`. This means `N = k * 2520 + 1`. Our goal is to find the smallest positive integer `k` that satisfies the final condition.\n\n5.  **Apply the final condition (divisibility by 11):**\n    We know that `N` must be divisible by 11, which means `N \u2261 0 (mod 11)`. Substituting the expression for `N` from Step 4:\n    `k * 2520 + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 11)`\n\n6.  **Solve the congruence for k:**\n    First, find the remainder of 2520 when divided by 11:\n    `2520 = 229 * 11 + 1`. So, `2520 \u2261 1 (mod 11)`.\n    Substitute this back into the congruence:\n    `k * (1) + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 11)`\n    `k + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 11)`\n    `k \u2261 -1 (mod 11)`\n    `k \u2261 10 (mod 11)`\n\n7.  **Determine the minimum value for k:**\n    The congruence `k \u2261 10 (mod 11)` means `k` can be 10, 21, 32, etc. Since we are looking for the *minimum* number of eggs, we need the smallest *positive* integer value for `k`, which is `k = 10`.\n\n8.  **Calculate the minimum number of eggs (N):**\n    Substitute the minimum value `k = 10` back into the equation for `N` from Step 4:\n    `N = 10 * 2520 + 1`\n    `N = 25200 + 1`\n    `N = 25201`\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of eggs the old lady could have is 25,201.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "1"}

They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.\nEileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.\nNow, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.

{"ID": 64, "Question": "Question: The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with \"rock\", 2 points with \"scissors\", and 1 point with \"paper\".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one \"throw\", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.\nThe players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.\nKnowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?\n Solution: Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.\nMethod:\nTo avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.\n(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.\n(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.\n(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.\n(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.\nWith these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.\nSo, we're looking to mix our \"throws\" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.

{"ID": 65, "Question": "Question: The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nAssume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.

Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?\"\n\"No, you could not.\"\n\"Aha!

Now, what was the number of the bus?\nThe bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.\n Solution: The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5.

This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem \u2014 the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't \u2014 he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10.

For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't \u2014 he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10.

{"ID": 73, "Question": "Question: Achmed and Ali were camel-drivers and on one day they decided to quit their job. They wanted to become shepherds. So they went to the market and sold all their camels. The amount of money (dinars) they received for each camel was the same as the total number of camels they owned. With that money they bought as many sheep as possible at 10 dinars a sheep. With the money that was left they bought a goat.\nOn their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, \"I take the last sheep and you can get the goat\". \"That's not fair,\" said Achmed, \"a goat costs less than a sheep\". \"OK,\" Ali said, \"then I will give you one of my dogs and then we are even\".

{"ID": 74, "Question": "Question: Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.\nThe system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.\nSo: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.\nThe problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?\n Solution: The minimum number of weights is 5.\nweight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0\nweight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1\nweight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2\nweight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3\nweight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4\nAll five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.\nThe progression from one stone to one mass would be:\n1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....", "Hint": "The title has a slight hint.\nThe number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.", "Human Solution": "The minimum number of weights is 5.\nweight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0\nweight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1\nweight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2\nweight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3\nweight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4\nAll five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.\nThe progression from one stone to one mass would be:\n1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": NaN, "Status": false, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "0"}

{"ID": 92, "Question": "Question: You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?\n(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)\n Solution: (1): m=4s\n(2): m > l > x > s\n(3): 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650, divided by 25 gives...\n(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186\n(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186\nCan s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.\nCan s=5?

The resulting births and deaths are truncated to a whole number.  These rates are constant.  For example, consider a population of 99 people at the start of a year.

Now one night, the Creaky tribe cornered half of the Rusty tribe and despite being outnumbered two to one, unscrewed one arm from each, there being an equal number of male and female victims. However, the Creaky tribe were extremely poor at arithmetic and had failed to realise that they needed 24 times their actual haul of spare arms in order that the number of links their members could then make, each with the same number of extra arms, was half the maximum number of links the Rusty tribe could then make.

{"ID": 126, "Question": "Question: The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nIn a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).  How many different ways can a 13-card alternating-colour straight be formed from a Snapoker deck?  Note that jokers can not be used in forming a straight.\n Solution: There are 32,768 possible ways a 13-card alternating-colour straight can be formed in a Snapoker deck.\nTo form a 13-card alternating-colour straight in Snapoker the following cards can be used:\n2 x red aces\n4 x black twos\n2 x red threes\n2 x black fours\n2 x red fives\n2 x black sixes\n2 x red sevens\n2 x black eights\n4 x red nines\n2 x black tens\n2 x red jacks\n2 x black queens\n2 x red kings\nTherefore, there are 2x4x2x2x2x2x2x2x4x2x2x2x2 = 32,768 possible 13-card alternating-colour straights that can be formed.", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "There are 32,768 possible ways a 13-card alternating-colour straight can be formed in a Snapoker deck.\nTo form a 13-card alternating-colour straight in Snapoker the following cards can be used:\n2 x red aces\n4 x black twos\n2 x red threes\n2 x black fours\n2 x red fives\n2 x black sixes\n2 x red sevens\n2 x black eights\n4 x red nines\n2 x black tens\n2 x red jacks\n2 x black queens\n2 x red kings\nTherefore, there are 2x4x2x2x2x2x2x2x4x2x2x2x2 = 32,768 possible 13-card alternating-colour straights that can be formed.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": NaN, "Status": false, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "0"}

It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?\nComments to triflers:\nThe bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!\n Solution: 80\nTo achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion.

However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.\nOn one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.\nFirst, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.\nSecond, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.\nThird, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.\nFourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)\nFor discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.

{"ID": 169, "Question": "Question: Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.\nWe were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.\nAfter a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?\n Solution: It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.\nHence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.\nOut of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.

{"ID": 189, "Question": "Question: A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.\nHow fast can the man run?\n Solution: Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.\nFeel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.", "Hint": "You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.

It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?\n Solution: Can at least one of each denomination be used? That totals $186 with only 6 bills, plus at least $94 with the rest of the bills. This is too high. Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.\nIf a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities. So $100 bill is the denomination that is not used. We now know that at least one of each of the other bills is used. That totals $86 with 5 bills, leaving 95 bills to make the other $144.\nThere are only 4 ways to make $144 with these denominations, which are listed in order from $1 bills to $50 bills in each of these sets: {84,10,1,0,0}, {89,1,5,0,0}, {89,3,2,1,0}, {94,0,0,0,1}.

On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.\nGrant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved.

{"ID": 206, "Question": "Question: Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  \"Cracker, Jack\" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.\nWhen they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.\nFor each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.\nWhat did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?\n(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)\n Solution: This can be solved in a few different ways.

So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.\nA traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, \"You may only cross my bridge if you know the password.\" He then wrote an equation on a rock:\nSLIDE\n-DEAN\n______\n3651\n\"Each letter in the equation represents a different digit,\" said the troll. \"The letters in the password represent 3651.\"\nSo, what is the password?\n Solution: The password is LENS.\nSince SL-D=3 or (SL-1)-D=3 (meaning SL-D=4), and since the highest possible sum of two different one-digit numbers is 17, S must equal 1.\nSince SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.\nSuppose D=6.

Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.\nHe said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer.

Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.\nListing all these figures we have\n(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)\nMaver 3 6\nWillow 13 26\nWonderland 23 46\nDoku 37 74\nLemp 47 94\nRudolf 59 118\nTotal 182 364\nGiven that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =\n(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =\n(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Number of people who got in at the six stations - Number of people who got out at the six stations) =\n227 - (364 - 182) =\n227 - 182 =\n45 people\nThus, I disappointed Tweeto by giving him the answer as 45 people.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": NaN, "Status": false, "Correct": NaN, "Summary": "0"}
{"ID": 248, "Question": "Question: Some time after 2 O' Clock, the angle made between the minute hand and the vertical (12) on a clock is double the angle made between the hour hand and the vertical (12). What time is it?\n Solution: 2:24 The hour hand makes an angle of 72 degrees while the minute hand makes an angle of 144 degrees.\nAt exactly 2:00, the angle made by the hour hand is 60 degrees from vertical.  If you let x = the number of minutes past 2:00 that we are looking for, then the hour hand will be at:\n60 degrees + x / 60 min* 30 degrees\nwhere x/60 min is the fraction of a full hour that has past, and is therefore the fractional distance that the hour hand has moved closer to the 3.  The 30 degrees is the total angle between the 2 and the 3.\nThe final position of the minute hand will be:\nx/30 min * 180 degrees\nfor the same reasoning as with the hour hand.\nSince the minute hand will make twice the angle with vertical, you can set up the equation:\n2*(60 + x / 60 * 30) = x / 30 * 180\nSolving for x will give you 24 minutes.

{"ID": 249, "Question": "Question: The square of one whole number minus the square of another whole number equals 73.\nWhat are the two numbers? This can be done by trial and error but a little mathematical knowledge and maybe some algebra will get the answer fast.\n Solution: The two numbers are 37 & 36. Therefore (37x37)1369 minus (36x36)1296 = 73.    The number 73 is a \"prime\" number i.e. the only two multiples for it are \"73\" & \"1\". By algebra, x2-y2 = 73 which is  (x+y)(x-y)=73. One of those two numbers must be \"1\". It can't be x+y (that would be more than \"1\") so it must be x-y=1.
