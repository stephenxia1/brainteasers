{"ID": 0, "Question": "There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.\nThe island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.\nOn April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.\nIf the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?\nBonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?", "Hint": "To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.", "Human Solution": "The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.\nBonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.\nAll villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:\n1) First set the starting point to one.\n2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.\n3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)\n4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.\nWhich points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.\nNote that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.\nThe routes:\nThis is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.\nRoutes to an adjacent village (A to B):\nTo determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.\nThe farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.\nThe next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.\nThe next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.\nThe next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.\nThere are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.\nRoutes to the second village along the coast (A to C):\nA = 1\nAFi = A = 1\nFi = AFi = 1\nAi = A + AFi = 2\nABi = Ai + A = 3\nM and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nM = Ai + Fi = 3\nB = A + ABi = 4\nBi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBi = B + ABi + M = 10\nDi = M = 3\nBCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBCi = B + Bi = 14\nCDi = Di = 3\nCi = BCi + CDi + M = 20\nC = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41\nThere are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.\nRoutes to the opposite village (A to D):\nSince the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.\nA = 1\nF, B = A = 1\nFAi, ABi = A + B = 2\nAi = A + ABi + FAi = 5\nFi, Bi = ABi + B = 3\nEFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4\nM, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:\nM = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11\nE, C = B + BCi = 5\nEi, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20\nDEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25\nDi = M + CDi + DEi = 61\nD = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121\nThere are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.\nBonus Question:\nThe longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:\nA-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D\nand the mirror route\nA-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D\n(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)\nIf the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.\nThe path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.\nThe paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is\n5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)\nSo the total distance traveled is\n10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Reasoning\n\n1.

The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y.

Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.\nSince the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?", "Hint": "A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.

If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "1.  \u201cOne less\u201d and \u201cone more\u201d are each the product of five primes  \n   \u21d2  N \u2013 1 and N + 1 have 5 primes apiece.  \n   The three numbers together possess 13 different primes  \n   \u21d2  the 5 primes of N \u2013 1, the 5 primes of N + 1 and the primes of N are pair-wise disjoint, so N itself has 13 \u2013 5 \u2013 5 = 3 distinct prime factors.\n\n2.

{"ID": 10, "Question": "After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.\nWhat is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?", "Hint": "The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly.

When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem.

The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.\"\n\"How old is your Mum now?\"\n\"There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.\"\nAssuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?", "Hint": "Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework", "Human Solution": "Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.\nSolution:\nx = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born\nFrom Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.\nGoing back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Let  \n\nTommy\u2019s present age = T  \nTimmy\u2019s present age = t  \nTammy\u2019s present age = m  \nTracey\u2019s present age = r  \nTony\u2019s present age = n  \nMother\u2019s present age = M  \n\nAll ages are whole numbers and the birth-order is  \n\nTommy  > Timmy  > Tammy  > Tracey  > Tony.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.  \u201cI am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.\u201d\n\nWhen Tony was born the children were n years younger, so Timmy\u2019s age then\nwas t \u2013 n.  \nHence            m = 3(t \u2013 n).

{"ID": 16, "Question": "The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.\n\"That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?\"\nBill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?", "Hint": "1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Human Solution": "Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.

Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.\nEileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.\nNow, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of \"off\".

What do you have in mind?\"\n\"We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.\"\n\"What are those?\"\n\"You know what a perfect number is?\"\n\"Sure,\" Patty interjected, \"a number equal to the sum of its divisors.\"\n\"Great,\" Jay continued.  \"Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.\"\nPatty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.\n\"So, what do you have for four people?\" Patty encouraged.\n\"I don't know.

{"ID": 64, "Question": "The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with \"rock\", 2 points with \"scissors\", and 1 point with \"paper\".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one \"throw\", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.\nThe players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.\nKnowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?", "Hint": "(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.\n(2) This is a \"zero-sum\" game: what one player wins, the other loses.\n(3) The game is \"symmetric\": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.\n(4) The game is \"open\": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.", "Human Solution": "Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.\nMethod:\nTo avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.\n(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.\n(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.\n(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.\n(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.\nWith these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.\nSo, we're looking to mix our \"throws\" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation\nE = 0*R -3*S +1*P\nwhere\nE = expected payoff\nR = proportion of rocks\nS = proportion of scissors\nP = proportion of paper\nAgainst an all-paper opponent:\nE = -1*R + 2*S -0*P\nAgainst someone running with scissors all the time:\nE = 3*R + 0*S -1*P\nWe know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.

In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.

{"ID": 68, "Question": "Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.\n\"Joseph, your idea worked!

What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?\"\nJoseph smiled and replied, \"Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.\"\n\"Really? But then why did the company like it?\" wondered Martin, \"What use does it have then?

First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N.

Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.

For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.\nCan s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.\nNow we know that s must be either 3 or 4.

Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.\nThis proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.\nSubstituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.\nNow we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10.

To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit.

Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x.

{"ID": 126, "Question": "The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nIn a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).

{"ID": 147, "Question": "The Boldavian navy has a rigorous training program.  In order to graduate from the naval academy, cadets must enter a pool and fight sharks.  Today, a group of cadets was tested.  Each cadet put on his mask, snorkel, and two flippers; and armed himself with a knife.  Then the cadets jumped into the pool.  The sharks were then released from their pens.  After 10 minutes of gruelling hand-to-fin combat, all of the sharks were killed.  Miraculously, none of the cadets were killed.  Exiting the pool, the cadets began to haul the shark bodies out of the water.  The dead sharks were soon lying in a row.  One of the cadets noted that during the fight, there were 4 times as many cadets in the water as there were sharks.

{"ID": 151, "Question": "In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.\nOn one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.\nFirst, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.\nSecond, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.\nThird, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.\nFourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)\nFor discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.\nAbout this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, \"Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.\"\nKnowing Junior, we asked, \"How big a headache is your math gonna give us?\"\nShe answered, \"I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.\"\nName the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.", "Hint": "Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.", "Human Solution": "Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.\nAfter labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, \"Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof. First, I mark a line from A to D.  This creates a trapezoid (trapezium in Britain) ABCD.  Next, I mark the lines EH, BG, and CF.  These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.\"\nThe partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's.

Luckily, in addition to medical supplies, the truck is carrying a Desert Patrol Vehicle (DPV) and two barrels of fuel.\nThe DPV has a full 10 gallon tank, but to make room for the medical supplies, it can only carry one of the 45 gallon barrels at a time. While you can't transfer fuel between barrels, you can refill the tank from the barrels. Assume the DPV can get 12 miles per gallon, regardless of the load it carries.\nHow far can you go?

F is the barrel used first, and L is the barrel used last.\nUse half of a tank (5 gallons) to carry L 5*12=60 miles, and then return for F (uses another 5 gallons). Refill the tank from F and carry it to where you left L (also uses 5 gallons). Refill the tank again from F and switch barrels.

The tank and L are still full, but F is empty. Leave F behind and make a run for it, carrying L. Refill the tank from L as needed. There are 55 gallons of fuel left so you can travel an additional 55*12=660 miles, for a maximum of (180+660) 840 miles.

To make things fair, the distribution must be done in the following way:\nThe older girl should receive one pearl, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.\nThe second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.\nThe third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.\nAnd so on until all the pearls are exhausted.\nNeedless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.\nThe wise Judge looked at her and said: \"Don't worry, my child.

That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.\nLet's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the \"seventh of the rest\" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).\nThat is, k+1 = 7 and then k = 6.\nSo, the number of pearls is 6*6 = 36, and there were 6 girls.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Let  \n\nR\u2080 = number of pearls originally in the bag  \nR\u1d62 = number left after the i-th girl has received her share (R\u2096 = 0 after the last girl)  \n\nDistribution rule for the i-th girl (i = 1,2, \u2026 , k)  \n1.

{"ID": 189, "Question": "A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.\nHow fast can the man run?", "Hint": "You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.", "Human Solution": "Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.\nFeel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.

{"ID": 194, "Question": "Difficult Danny has acquired his nickname (and some other, less polite nicknames) due to the fact that, whenever he buys anything, he insists upon paying the exact amount, with precisely 100 pieces of currency. Danny wanted an xCube365 (it lasts 365 days before programmatically disabling itself, so that a new one must be purchased), the highly coveted gaming system that had just been released. It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?", "Hint": "First, see if there is a denomination that is not used. If so, figure out which denomination that is", "Human Solution": "Can at least one of each denomination be used? That totals $186 with only 6 bills, plus at least $94 with the rest of the bills. This is too high. Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.\nIf a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities. So $100 bill is the denomination that is not used. We now know that at least one of each of the other bills is used. That totals $86 with 5 bills, leaving 95 bills to make the other $144.\nThere are only 4 ways to make $144 with these denominations, which are listed in order from $1 bills to $50 bills in each of these sets: {84,10,1,0,0}, {89,1,5,0,0}, {89,3,2,1,0}, {94,0,0,0,1}.

Last person to leave  \n   \u2022 Latest time anyone is phoned = 60 \u00d7 8 = 480 s.  \n   \u2022 A depth-8 resident has no one left to phone, so leaves after an additional 90 s.  \n     Time out of building = 480 s + 90 s = 570 s.\n\n   \u2022 A depth-7 resident who is the last of his generation to be phoned gets the news at 60 \u00d7 7 = 420 s, then spends 60 s phoning two children and 90 s leaving:  \n     420 s + 60 s + 90 s = 570 s.  \n     Thus no one can leave later than 570 s.\n\n5.

The size of N.  \nBecause N is six\u2013digit while 6 N must not exceed seven digits (an eight\u2013digit product would have to contain a 1 followed exclusively by zeros, which would introduce a new digit 0 if it were absent from N), we get  \n6 N \u2264 1 000 000 \u21d2 N \u2264 166 666.  \nHence 2 N, 3 N, 4 N, 5 N, 6 N are all six\u2013 or seven\u2013digit numbers whose first digits can only be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 8 \u2013 all of which must therefore also be present in N.\n\n4. Collecting the compulsory digits.  \nFrom the preceding points we have already forced the six different digits {1,2,4,5,7,8} to be contained in N, and there is room for no further different digit (N has only six places).  \nTherefore N must use each of those six digits exactly once and no others.\n\n5. Determination of the order of the digits.  \nWrite the unknown number as abcdef with {a,b,c,d,e,f} = {1,2,4,5,7,8}.  \nBecause 5 N ends with 5, f must be 7 or 9 (the only digits whose product with 5 ends in 5). 9 is impossible, hence f = 7.  \nThen 5 N ends in 5 and the second\u2013to\u2013last digit of 5 N is produced by the carry 3 coming from 5\u00b77 = 35; hence the tens digit of 5 N equals the units digit of N plus 3 (mod 10).  This forces the units digit of N to be 2, making the tens digit of 5 N equal to 5.  \nContinuing that carry analysis through the whole multiplication by 5 fixes the successive digits uniquely; the only permutation that works is\n\n          N = 1 4 2 8 5 7.\n\n6.

Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.\nHe said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?", "Hint": "Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations", "Human Solution": "The observations given are :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nFrom observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.\nLet us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.\nFrom observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.\nHence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.\nIf it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.\nThis means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10).

These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.\nThe island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.\nOn April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.\nIf the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?\nBonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?", "Hint": "To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.\nSince the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?", "Hint": "A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Rex did not have to \u201chunt\u2019\u2019 for dimensions \u2013 the numbers that Ralph gave can be satisfied by one and only one regular polygon, so once that polygon is identified every other measurement is forced.\n\n1.

{"ID": 10, "Question": "After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.\nWhat is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?", "Hint": "The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.\nOf course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.", "Human Solution": "First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.\nFour of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:\nF = (N5)/5\nN5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1\nN4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1\nN3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1\nN2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1\nN1 = 4(N)/5 - 1\nF is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.\nSubstitution results in the following equation:\n(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6\nor\n1024N = 15625F + 8404\nGiven that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Let  \n\nN\u2080  = number of coconuts in the common pile when night falls,  \nN\u2081  = pile just after the 1st survivor has finished,  \nN\u2082  = pile just after the 2nd survivor has finished, \u2026 ,  \nN\u2085  = pile that remains on the beach at day-break.\n\nWhat happens each time a survivor acts is identical:\n\n\u201cdivide what you see into 5 equal piles, 1 coconut is left over, give that 1 to the monkey, hide one of the five equal piles, and heap the other four back together\u201d.\n\nThus, if S is the size of the pile a survivor sees when he arrives, the size T he leaves behind satisfies  \n\n4 \u00b7 (S \u2013 1)/5 = T,            (because he removes 1 for the monkey and keeps one fifth).\n\nRe-arranged, S and T are connected by  \n\nS = (5/4) T + 1.

{"ID": 15, "Question": "I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.\n\"How old are you Tammy?\"\n\"I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.\"\n\"How old is your Mum now?\"\n\"There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.\"\nAssuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?", "Hint": "Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework", "Human Solution": "Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.\nSolution:\nx = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born\nFrom Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.\nGoing back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.

Necessities for 47\u201399.  \n   \u2013 p\u00b2 must be a four\u2010digit number with **no repeated digit**.  \n   \u2013 p\u00b3 must be a six\u2010digit number with **no repeated digit**.  \n   \u2013 The two digit sets must be disjoint so that together they furnish all ten digits.\n\n   Examining the 53 numbers 47\u201399 is still feasible by hand because the square immediately shows if a candidate fails (any repeated digit in the square eliminates it).\n\n   The squares with all different digits are:\n\n      48\u00b2=2304, 49\u00b2=2401, 51\u00b2=2601, 52\u00b2=2704, 53\u00b2=2809,\n      54\u00b2=2916, 55\u00b2=3025, 57\u00b2=3249, 59\u00b2=3481, 61\u00b2=3721,\n      64\u00b2=4096, 66\u00b2=4356, 69\u00b2=4761, 71\u00b2=5041, 72\u00b2=5184,\n      73\u00b2=5329, 74\u00b2=5476, 78\u00b2=6084, 79\u00b2=6241, 82\u00b2=6724,\n      84\u00b2=7056, 86\u00b2=7396, 87\u00b2=7569, 89\u00b2=7921, 93\u00b2=8649,\n      95\u00b2=9025, 96\u00b2=9216, 98\u00b2=9604, 99\u00b2=9801.\n\n   Now we check each of their cubes; as soon as a cube either repeats a digit or shares a digit with its square we discard the candidate.

{"ID": 63, "Question": "Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.\nEileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.\nNow, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of \"off\".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.\n\"I know that voice!  C'mon down.\"\n\"Who is it?\" Eileen prodded.\n\"Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?\"\nEileen shrugged.  \"C'mon down, Jay,\" Patty called into the leaves.\n\"Why should I?\"\n\"I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.\"\n\"Is that the new Sinatra CD?\"\n\"No, it's the world's greatest snack.\"\n\"I'm hungry, too!\" the other voice whined.\n\"Who's up there with you?\"  Patty asked.\n\"I'll bet I know!\" Eileen called.  \"It's obvious!\"\nPatty's face lit up in realization.  \"Robin!\" they laughed together.\nA pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.\n\"But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,\" Eileen added.\n\"That's okay,\" Robin said.  \"Does it have to be percentages?\"\n\"There's no law; just tradition.

How does it taste?\" Patty asked.\n\"Can you hum a few bars?\" Eileen offered at the same time.\nRobin laughed.  \"No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.\"\nEileen and Patty understood.  \"So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?\"\n\"Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.\"\n\"Well, do you have any of those handy?\"\n\"It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?\"\n\"Sure.\"  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  \"At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.\"\nJay and Robin shared a glance.  \"Robin, is your homework still in your pack?\"\n\"It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.\"\nTen minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.

A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.

First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer.

For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16.

{"ID": 92, "Question": "You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?\n(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.

For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.\nCan s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.\nNow we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.\nSubstituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7\nWe know x is at least 4, because s is 3.

Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false.

How often each coin may be left untouched in a move  \n\n   During one move 7 coins are *not* flipped.  \n   Call a coin \u201cskipped\u2019\u2019 in a move when it is one of these 7 untouched coins.  \n   For coin i let s\u1d62 be the number of moves in which it is skipped.  \n   In k moves the coin is flipped k \u2013 s\u1d62 times, and this number has to be odd.  \n   Because k is even, k \u2013 s\u1d62 is odd \u21d4 s\u1d62 is odd.  \n   Hence every coin must be skipped an odd (therefore at least one) number of times.\n\n3.  A lower bound for k  \n\n   The total number of skip\u2013occurrences in k moves equals 7k, and this must cover at least one\n   skip for each of the 100 coins:\n\n        7k  \u2265  100   \u21d2   k \u2265 100\u20447 > 14.\n\n   With k forced to be even, the first possible value is k = 16.  \n   Thus at least 16 moves are necessary.\n\n4.  Constructing 16 moves that work  \n\n   Label the coins 1,2,\u2026,100.  \n   Designate the six coins 1-6 to be skipped three times each; the remaining 94 coins\n   will be skipped once each.  \n   Then\n\n        (6 coins)\u00b73  +  (94 coins)\u00b71  = 18 + 94 = 112 = 7\u00b716\n\n   so the numbers of skips fit exactly into 16 moves.\n\n   Arrange the moves as follows (each line lists the 7 coins **not** flipped in that move).\n\n        Move 1 :  1 ,  7  8  9 10 11 12\n        Move 2 :  1 , 13 14 15 16 17 18\n        Move 3 :  2 , 19 20 21 22 23 24\n        Move 4 :  2 , 25 26 27 28 29 30\n        Move 5 :  3 , 31 32 33 34 35 36\n        Move 6 :  3 , 37 38 39 40 41 42\n        Move 7 :  4 , 43 44 45 46 47 48\n        Move 8 :  4 , 49 50 51 52 53 54\n        Move 9 :  5 , 55 56 57 58 59 60\n        Move10 :  5 , 61 62 63 64 65 66\n        Move11 :  6 , 67 68 69 70 71 72\n        Move12 :  6 , 73 74 75 76 77 78\n        Move13 :  1 , 79 80 81 82 83 84\n        Move14 :  2 , 85 86 87 88 89 90\n        Move15 :  3  4 , 91 92 93 94 95\n        Move16 :  5  6 , 96 97 98 99 100\n\n   Check of the skip\u2013counts  \n   \u2022  Coins 1-6 are each skipped three times (once in two single-coin moves and once in a\n      double-coin move).  \n   \u2022  Every other coin, 7-100, is skipped exactly once.  \n   Therefore every coin is skipped an odd number of times, complying with the requirement.\n\n   Consequently each coin is flipped\n\n        coins 1-6 : 16 \u2013 3 = 13 times  (odd)  \n        coins 7-100 : 16 \u2013 1 = 15 times  (odd),\n\n   so all 100 coins finish tails-up.\n\nSince 16 moves are achievable and fewer than 16 are impossible, the least number of moves required is 16.\n\nFinal answer: 16", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 107, "Question": "Arrogant Arnold and Witty Will are brothers. One day, they were going from New Jersey to Florida. Bored, they decided to ask each other brain teasers. After a while, they got bored with this, so Arnold decided to place a bet. He would ask Will one teaser, which he thought was very hard. If Will got it right, Arnold would clean his room for the rest of the year. However, if Will got it WRONG, he would have to clean Arnold's room for a year and do his dishes for a month. After thinking for a while, Will agreed to this. This was Arnold's teaser:\nUse each digit 1-9 only once each, so that one number multiplied by another equals the third. One example is 12*483=5796. Name at least one more!!!\nBeing witty as his name suggests, Will easily answered this. The question is, can you find one?", "Hint": "1) They can't be -12*483=-5796, 1.2*48.3=57.96, etc.\n2) The third number in another possibility is also 5796.", "Human Solution": "The other possibilities are [drum roll please :)]...\n18 , 297 , 5346\n27 , 198 , 5346\n28 , 157 , 4396\n39 , 186 , 7254\n42 , 138 , 5796\n48 , 159 , 7632", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "We must build three positive integers that\n\n\u2022 together use every digit 1-9 exactly once (no zeros), and  \n\u2022 satisfy \u201cfirst \u00d7 second = third\u201d.\n\nHow many digits can the three numbers have?\n\nLet the two factors have a and b digits and the product have c digits.  \nWe need\u2003a + b + c = 9.\n\nBecause the product of two numbers having at least two digits already exceeds 99, c cannot be 2; if both factors had three digits, their product would have at least five digits; hence the only feasible split is\n\na = 2,\u2003b = 3,\u2003c = 4.              (2-digit) \u00d7 (3-digit) = (4-digit)\n\nStep 1.  Use divisibility by 9  \nThe sum of the nine different digits 1+2+\u2026+9 = 45 is divisible by 9, so the product itself must be divisible by 9.  Therefore at least one of the two factors must be a multiple of 9.  It is simplest to make the 2-digit factor a multiple of 9.\n\nAmong the two-digit multiples of 9 that do not repeat a digit and contain no 0 we have  \n18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81.\n\nStep 2.  Choose the final digit of the product  \nSince no factor may contain a 0 or a 5, the only convenient way to obtain a final digit 5 or 0 in the product is impossible, so let the product end in 6 (a very common final digit: 2\u00d73, 2\u00d78, 4\u00d74, 7\u00d78 \u2026 all give 6).\n\nIf the 2-digit factor ends in 7, multiplying by a number that ends in 8 gives the desired last-digit pattern 7 \u00d7 8 \u2261 6 (mod 10).  \nHence pick the 2-digit factor 27 and let the 3-digit factor end in 8.\n\nStep 3.  Finish the 3-digit factor  \nThe digits 2 and 7 are used, leaving 1,3,4,5,6,8,9.  To ensure the 3-digit factor is divisible by 9 (so the whole product is divisible by 81), its digit-sum must be a multiple of 9.  With the ending 8, selecting 1 and 9 gives 1+9+8 = 18, indeed a multiple of 9.  Thus choose the 3-digit factor 198.\n\nStep 4.  Verify the multiplication and digit-usage  \n27 \u00d7 198 = 5346\n\nDigits used:  \n27\u2003\u2192 2,7  \n198 \u2192 1,9,8  \n5346 \u2192 5,3,4,6  \n\nAll nine digits 1-9 appear exactly once, with none repeated and none omitted.

Determine the parity of the factors.  \nThe two factors on the left differ by 6p, hence they have the same parity.  \nBecause their product is divisible by 3, each is divisible by 3; write  \n\n\u2003F\u22123p = 6u,\u2003F+3p = 6v\u2003\u2003(u,v positive, v>u).  \n\nThen from (3)\n\n\u20036u\u00b76v = 60d^2 \u2003\u21d2\u2003uv = 15d^2.            (4)\n\n5.  Remove the square\u2013free part.  \nBecause 15 = 3\u00b75 is square\u2013free, (4) implies that d itself must contain the factor 3; write d = 3e (e>0).  \nThen (4) becomes  \n\n\u2003uv = 15e^2.                                                 (5)\n\n6.  Solve (5).  \nThe positive divisors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, 15.  Hence the possibilities for {u,v} (with u\u2264v) are\n\n\u2003{1,15}, {3,5}.  \n\n(The larger sets that appear when e\u22652 give rise to father\u2019s ages far beyond the children-bearing span and will be discussed later.)\n\n7.  Use the first possibility u = 1, v = 15, with e = 1.  \nThen\n\n\u2003d = 3e = 3,  \n\u2003F = 3(u+v) = 3\u00b716 = 48,  \n\u2003p = v\u2212u = 14,  \n\u2003a = p\u22124d = 14 \u2212 12 = 2.\n\nThus the children are\n\n\u20032, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26 years old.\n\nA check:\n\n\u20032^2+5^2+8^2+11^2+14^2+17^2+20^2+23^2+26^2  \n\u2003= 4+25+64+121+196+289+400+529+676  \n\u2003= 2304 = 48^2 = F^2.\n\n8.  Why the other formal solutions are rejected.  \nWith d = 3e = 6, 9, \u2026 (obtained by taking e \u2265 2 or the second factor-pair {3,5}) one gets father\u2019s ages 96, 144, \u2026 and intervals of 6, 9, \u2026 years between births; the nine births would have to extend over 48, 72, \u2026 years, which is biologically impossible for a single set of parents.

A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.

Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.

When does the spider reach the end?  \n   The spider is at (or beyond) the end as soon as p \u2265 1.  \n   From (3) this is the first n for which H\u2099 \u2265 3.\n\n   H\u2081\u2080 \u2248 2.929 \u2026,\u2003H\u2081\u2081 \u2248 3.020 \u2026,\u2003so the condition is met for n = 11.\n   Thus the spider arrives sometime during the 11th minute (between 10 and 11 min).\n\n4.  How far into that minute?  \n   At the start of the 11th minute (after 10 stretches)\n\n           p\u2081\u2080 = (1/3) \u00b7 H\u2081\u2080 = (1/3) \u00b7 7381/2520 = 7381/7560.\n\n   Band length then: \u2113\u2081\u2080 = 3\u00b711 = 33 in.\n\n   Remaining distance to the free end:\n\n           \u0394 = \u2113\u2081\u2080 (1 \u2212 p\u2081\u2080)\n             = 33 \u00b7 (1 \u2212 7381/7560)\n             = 33 \u00b7 179/7560\n             = 1969/2520 in.\n\n   Walking 1 in per minute, the time needed is the same number of minutes:\n\n           t_extra = 1969/2520 min.\n\n5.

{"ID": 136, "Question": "Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?\nComments to triflers:\nThe bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering.

For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.\nAfter a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system.

{"ID": 189, "Question": "A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.\nHow fast can the man run?", "Hint": "You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.", "Human Solution": "Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.\nFeel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.

{"ID": 247, "Question": "The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.\nHe said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?", "Hint": "Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations", "Human Solution": "The observations given are :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nFrom observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.\nLet us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.\nFrom observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.\nHence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.\nIf it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.\nThis means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.\nNow the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number.

Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits.

I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?", "Hint": "A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Let  \n\nn = number of sides of both the lot and of the house (they are \u201cmatching\u201d regular polygons),  \nL = length of one side of the lot,  \nr = in-radius of the house (distance from the centre to a side),  \nR = circum-radius of the house (radius of the circular foundation),  \n\u03c1 = in-radius of the lot,  \nP = circum-radius of the lot.\n\n1.

{"ID": 10, "Question": "After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.\nWhat is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?", "Hint": "The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.\nOf course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.", "Human Solution": "First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.\nFour of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:\nF = (N5)/5\nN5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1\nN4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1\nN3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1\nN2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1\nN1 = 4(N)/5 - 1\nF is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts.

So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?", "Hint": "Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework", "Human Solution": "Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.\nSolution:\nx = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born\nFrom Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.\nGoing back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Let   \n\nTommy\u2019s present age = T, \u2003 Timmy\u2019s = I, \u2003 Tammy\u2019s = A, \u2003 Tracey\u2019s = R, \u2003 Tony\u2019s = O, \u2003 Mum\u2019s = M  \n(all measured in completed whole years).\n\n1.

(3)  \n\u2003Since all ages are integers, T + O + 50 must be even.\n\n2.  Expressing z in terms of y  \n\nBecause y = T \u2013 O, equation (3) gives  \n\u2003M = (y + 50)/2 + O.  \nHence\u2003z = M \u2013 O = (y + 50)/2.                                       (4)\n\n3.  First restrictions on y and z  \n\nFor z to be integral, y must be even.  \nMoreover, from z = (y + 50)/2 and the divisibility condition y | z we have  \n\u2003z = ky\u2003\u21d2\u2003y + 50 = 2ky\u2003\u21d2\u200350 = (2k \u2013 1)y,  \nso y is a divisor of 50.  \nThe only even divisors of 50 are 2, 10 and 50, but y = 50 would give\nz = 50 (impossible because Mum is younger than 50 now), and y = 2 would force\nimpossible age\u2013ordering among the children (oldest only two years old at the\nyoungest\u2019s birth).  Hence\n\n\u2003y = 10\u2003and\u2003z = (10 + 50)/2 = 30.                                 (5)\n\nThus, at Tony\u2019s birth Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10.\n\n4.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.\n\"That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?\"\nBill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?", "Hint": "1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Human Solution": "Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Let  \n\nA , B , C , D = the girls\u2019 ages to-day, 30 June of this year,  \n(the day of Denise\u2019s wedding and of Bill\u2019s monologue).\n\nBecause the weddings were all exactly one year apart (all on 30 June),\neach girl was exactly one year younger on the same date last year,\ntwo years younger two years ago, etc.\nThus, at the four weddings we had\n\n\u2022 Denise\u2019s wedding (to-day):             D  \n\u2022 Cheryl\u2019s wedding (1 yr ago):           C \u2013 1  \n\u2022 Barbara\u2019s wedding (2 yrs ago):       B \u2013 2  \n\u2022 Alice\u2019s wedding (3 yrs ago):          A \u2013 3  \n\nand, at those instants, the other sisters\u2019 ages were obtained from\nA , B , C , D by subtracting the same number of years.\n\nFor every wedding the bride\u2019s age equalled the sum of the digits of\nthe ages of her three sisters present that day.

(1)\n\nBecause the sum of all ten different digits 0\u20139 is 45, let the two bracketed sums be S\u2081 (odd positions) and S\u2082 (even positions).  \nThen S\u2081+S\u2082 = 45 and (1) says S\u2081\u2212S\u2082 is a multiple of 11.  \nOnly the odd multiples \u00b111, \u00b133,\u2026 are possible, and the only workable choices are\n\n\u2003S\u2081=28,  S\u2082=17   or   S\u2081=17,  S\u2082=28.

(1)\n\n   No move ever joins the sets {a , b} and {c , d} in any other way.\n\n2.  What a closed tour would have to do  \n   A closed tour is a cycle of 48 edges (one for every square).  \n   Because every square is visited exactly once, each square contributes\n   degree 2 to the tour.\n\n   \u2022 Every a\u2013square can be joined only to b\u2013squares, therefore both of the\n     edges incident with each of the 12 a\u2013squares are of type a-b.\n     Hence the tour must contain 12 \u00d7 2 = 24 edges of the form a-b.        (2)\n\n   \u2022 Symmetrically every d\u2013square can be joined only to c\u2013squares, so the\n     tour must also contain 12 \u00d7 2 = 24 edges of the form c-d.             (3)\n\n   Taken together (2) and (3) already account for all 48 edges of the\n   supposed tour.\n\n3.  The contradiction  \n   After the 24 a-b edges every b\u2013square has already degree 2, so no edge\n   of the tour can be of type b-c.\n   After the 24 c-d edges every c\u2013square has degree 2, so no edge of the\n   tour can be of type b-c either.\n\n   Thus no edge of the tour connects a or b with c or d; the 48 edges split\n   into two disjoint cycles, one running exclusively through a\u2013 and\n   b\u2013squares, the other exclusively through c\u2013 and d\u2013squares.\n\n   But a Hamiltonian tour has to be a single cycle that visits every square\n   once, not two separate cycles.  Hence a closed knight\u2019s tour on the\n   12 \u00d7 4 board cannot exist.\n\nTherefore the knight failed because on a 12 \u00d7 4 board a closed knight\u2019s\ntour (one that returns to the starting square) is impossible.\n\nFinal answer:  No closed knight\u2019s tour exists on a 12 \u00d7 4 board; the knight\u2019s moves always keep the colours {a,b} and {c,d} separate, so one single cycle visiting all 48 squares cannot be formed.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.\nEileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.\nNow, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of \"off\".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.\n\"I know that voice!

Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.\n\"But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,\" Eileen added.\n\"That's okay,\" Robin said.  \"Does it have to be percentages?\"\n\"There's no law; just tradition.

Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.\"\nEileen and Patty understood.  \"So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?\"\n\"Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.\"\n\"Well, do you have any of those handy?\"\n\"It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?\"\n\"Sure.\"  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  \"At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.\"\nJay and Robin shared a glance.  \"Robin, is your homework still in your pack?\"\n\"It sure is.

{"ID": 64, "Question": "The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with \"rock\", 2 points with \"scissors\", and 1 point with \"paper\".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one \"throw\", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.\nThe players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.\nKnowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?", "Hint": "(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.\n(2) This is a \"zero-sum\" game: what one player wins, the other loses.\n(3) The game is \"symmetric\": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.\n(4) The game is \"open\": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.", "Human Solution": "Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.\nMethod:\nTo avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.\n(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.\n(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.\n(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.\n(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.\nWith these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.\nSo, we're looking to mix our \"throws\" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation\nE = 0*R -3*S +1*P\nwhere\nE = expected payoff\nR = proportion of rocks\nS = proportion of scissors\nP = proportion of paper\nAgainst an all-paper opponent:\nE = -1*R + 2*S -0*P\nAgainst someone running with scissors all the time:\nE = 3*R + 0*S -1*P\nWe know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.

Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nAssume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.

{"ID": 92, "Question": "You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?\n(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)", "Hint": "ere is the profit made on each size (found using the information in the first few sentences):\nSmall: $0.75\nMedium: $1.00\nLarge: $1.75\nX-large: $2.00", "Human Solution": "(1): m=4s\n(2): m > l > x > s\n(3): 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650, divided by 25 gives...\n(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186\n(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186\nCan s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.\nCan s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.\nNow we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.\nSubstituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7\nWe know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).\nIf x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.\nIf x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.\nIf x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.\nThis proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.\nSubstituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.\nNow we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10.

Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nIn a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).

Where do the single 5 and 7 go?  \n    Digit 5 and digit 7 occur only once, so they cannot be the repeated\n    last digit; they must lie somewhere inside the 5-digit denominator y.\n    Looking at the pattern a (a+b) (b+c) (c+d) d, 5 and 7 must be equal to\n    one (or two) of the four interior \u201csum\u2013digits\u201d\n           a+b ,\u2003b+c ,\u2003c+d ,\u2003or to a itself.\n    Hence one of those sums must be 5 and one must be 7.\n\n5.  Choosing the last digit.\n\n    \u2022  If d = 1  \n      then c+d = c+1 \u2265 2 and b+c \u2265 b+? \u2026 none of these sums can be 7\n      without making the other sums 6,8,9 or 0, digits we do not possess.\n      So d \u2260 1.\n\n    \u2022  If d = 3  \n      then c+d = c+3.  To obtain 7 we would need c = 4; but with c = 4\n      the available digits would give b+c = b+4 \u2265 5; the only unused digits\n      \u22655 are 5 and 7, forcing b = 1 or 3, both impossible because the\n      corresponding a+b or a would repeat digits too often.  Thus d \u2260 3.\n\n    \u2022  Hence d = 4.\n\n6.  Determining the other digits.\n\n    With d = 4 we must have one interior sum equal to 7; the only way is  \n           c + d = 7 \u2003\u21d2\u2003c = 3.\n    Now a second interior sum must be 5; that can only be  \n           b + c = 5 \u2003\u21d2\u2003b = 2.\n    Finally  \n           a + b = a + 2 must be one of the remaining digits {1,3,4}.  \n           The only choice that keeps every digit within the given multiset\n           and avoids extra repetitions is a = 1 (because 1+2 = 3).\n\n    Thus the numerator is\n           x = abcd = 1 2 3 4 = 1234 ,\n    and the denominator is\n           y = 11x = 13574 .\n\n    Check of digits used:\n       numerator: 1,2,3,4\n       denominator: 1,3,5,7,4\n       multiset obtained: 1,1,2,3,3,4,4,5,7  \u2013 exactly the required set.\n\n7.

{"ID": 169, "Question": "Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.\nWe were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.\nAfter a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system.

{"ID": 189, "Question": "A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.\nHow fast can the man run?", "Hint": "You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.", "Human Solution": "Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.\nFeel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.

{"ID": 247, "Question": "The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.\nHe said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?", "Hint": "Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations", "Human Solution": "The observations given are :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nFrom observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.\nLet us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.\nFrom observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.\nHence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.\nIf it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.\nThis means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.\nNow the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3.

{"ID": 5, "Question": "Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.\nSince the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13.

{"ID": 10, "Question": "After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.\nWhat is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?", "Hint": "The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.\nOf course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.", "Human Solution": "First, we start with 5^5 coconuts.

When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem.

{"ID": 15, "Question": "I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.\n\"How old are you Tammy?\"\n\"I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.\"\n\"How old is your Mum now?\"\n\"There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.\"\nAssuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?", "Hint": "Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework", "Human Solution": "Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.\nSolution:\nx = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born\nFrom Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.\nGoing back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.

Make all four ages divisors of z = 30\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAt Tony\u2019s birth the four ages that must divide 30 are\n\n       Tommy :  y = d = 10,               (already OK)\n       Timmy :  k,\n       Tammy :  3k \u2013 To,\n       Tracey:  Tr \u2013 To.\n\nHence k and (3k \u2013 To) and (Tr \u2013 To) must divide 30.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nStep 5.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.\n\"That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?\"\nBill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?", "Hint": "1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Human Solution": "Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.

{"ID": 63, "Question": "Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.\nEileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.\nNow, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of \"off\".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.\n\"I know that voice!  C'mon down.\"\n\"Who is it?\" Eileen prodded.\n\"Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?\"\nEileen shrugged.  \"C'mon down, Jay,\" Patty called into the leaves.\n\"Why should I?\"\n\"I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.\"\n\"Is that the new Sinatra CD?\"\n\"No, it's the world's greatest snack.\"\n\"I'm hungry, too!\" the other voice whined.\n\"Who's up there with you?\"  Patty asked.\n\"I'll bet I know!\" Eileen called.  \"It's obvious!\"\nPatty's face lit up in realization.  \"Robin!\" they laughed together.\nA pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.\n\"But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,\" Eileen added.\n\"That's okay,\" Robin said.  \"Does it have to be percentages?\"\n\"There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?\"\n\"We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.\"\n\"What are those?\"\n\"You know what a perfect number is?\"\n\"Sure,\" Patty interjected, \"a number equal to the sum of its divisors.\"\n\"Great,\" Jay continued.  \"Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.\"\nPatty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.\n\"So, what do you have for four people?\" Patty encouraged.\n\"I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?\"\n\"I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?\"\n\"1184 and 1210.\"\n\"That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.\"\n\"Well, how about an aliquot sequence?\"\n\"Okay.  How does it taste?\" Patty asked.\n\"Can you hum a few bars?\" Eileen offered at the same time.\nRobin laughed.  \"No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.\"\nEileen and Patty understood.  \"So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?\"\n\"Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.\"\n\"Well, do you have any of those handy?\"\n\"It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?\"\n\"Sure.\"  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  \"At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.\"\nJay and Robin shared a glance.  \"Robin, is your homework still in your pack?\"\n\"It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.\"\nTen minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.

{"ID": 64, "Question": "The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with \"rock\", 2 points with \"scissors\", and 1 point with \"paper\".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one \"throw\", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.\nThe players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.\nKnowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?", "Hint": "(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.\n(2) This is a \"zero-sum\" game: what one player wins, the other loses.\n(3) The game is \"symmetric\": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.\n(4) The game is \"open\": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.", "Human Solution": "Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.\nMethod:\nTo avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.\n(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.\n(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.\n(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.\n(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.\nWith these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.\nSo, we're looking to mix our \"throws\" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation\nE = 0*R -3*S +1*P\nwhere\nE = expected payoff\nR = proportion of rocks\nS = proportion of scissors\nP = proportion of paper\nAgainst an all-paper opponent:\nE = -1*R + 2*S -0*P\nAgainst someone running with scissors all the time:\nE = 3*R + 0*S -1*P\nWe know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.

{"ID": 65, "Question": "The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nAssume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.

In this case, the two players who would be required to drink milk through their noses would each have had a hand consisting of a joker and two 8s, 9s, 10s, jacks, queens and kings.

The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.\nSo: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.\nThe problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales.

What \u201cweighing with a balance\u201d really means  \n   \u2022  We may put the unknown object on either pan.  \n   \u2022  We may put each weight on either pan.  \n   \u2022  Hence a weight can act with a sign +1 (opposite the object), \u20131 (same side as the object) or 0 (not used).  \n   \u2022  So every integer weight we can measure is a signed sum of the available weights whose coefficients are \u20131, 0, 1.\n\n2.  The classical way to obtain every signed sum from 1 up to a certain limit with the fewest weights is to let the\n    weights grow by successive powers of 3.  \n    Reason: if the available weights are  \n          1, 3, 9, \u2026 , 3\u207f  \n    then the largest weight still not representable after the first k weights is  \n          1 + 3 + 9 + \u2026 + 3\u1d4f = (3\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 \u2013 1)/2.  \n    Adding the next power 3\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 extends the range exactly as far as is possible with one more weight, so the list  \n          1, 3, 9, \u2026 is optimal (this is the classical \u201cbalanced\u2013ternary\u201d argument).\n\n3.  How many powers of 3 are needed to reach one mass (121 stone)?  \n       (3\u2070 + 3\u00b9 + 3\u00b2 + 3\u00b3 + 3\u2074) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121.  \n    That already reaches the required upper limit, so no higher power of 3 is needed.\n\n4.  Therefore a minimal set of weights is  \n       1-stone, 3-stone, 9-stone, 27-stone, 81-stone,  \n    five weights in all.\n\n5.  Checking minimality  \n    With only four weights the best we could do is  \n          1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 < 121,  \n    so four weights cannot possibly suffice.  Hence five weights are not only sufficient but also necessary.\n\n6.  How to use them (example)  \n    Suppose we want to weigh 58 stone.  Write 58 in balanced ternary:  \n          58 = 81\u00b7(\u20131) + 27\u00b71 + 9\u00b71 + 3\u00b70 + 1\u00b71.  \n    Place the 81-stone weight on the same pan as the object (sign \u20131) and the 27-, 9- and 1-stone weights on the opposite pan (sign +1).  Both pans then balance:  \n          object + 81 = 27 + 9 + 1  \u21d2 object = 58.\n\nThus the chief\u2019s advisers could replace the bulky \u201c10 lumps and 11 stones\u201d by just five weights while still being able to measure any whole number of stone from 1 to 121.\n\nFinal answer: Five weights of 1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone and 81 stone are sufficient and minimal.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}

{"ID": 92, "Question": "You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?\n(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)", "Hint": "ere is the profit made on each size (found using the information in the first few sentences):\nSmall: $0.75\nMedium: $1.00\nLarge: $1.75\nX-large: $2.00", "Human Solution": "(1): m=4s\n(2): m > l > x > s\n(3): 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650, divided by 25 gives...\n(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186\n(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186\nCan s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.\nCan s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.\nNow we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.\nSubstituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7\nWe know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).\nIf x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.\nIf x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.\nIf x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.\nThis proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.\nSubstituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.\nNow we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.\nThe solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10.

Every coin must stay in the \u201c7-sets\u2019\u2019 an odd number of times  \nIf k is even, say k = 2r, the total addition equals  \n        (\u03c7_{S\u2081}+\u2026+\u03c7_{S_{2r}})            (because 2r\u00b7J = 0 in F\u2082).  \nTo reach J we therefore need  \n        \u03c7_{S\u2081}+\u2026+\u03c7_{S_{2r}} = J.                   (\u2605)\n\nEquation (\u2605) means that each coin occurs in an odd number of the sets\nS\u2081,\u2026,S_{2r}; in particular every coin occurs at least once.  \nWith |S_i| = 7 this gives the rough lower bound\n\n        7k  \u2265  100  \u21d2  k \u2265 15.\n\nCoupling this with the parity condition \u201ck even\u2019\u2019 gives\n\n        k \u2265 16.

Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nIn a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).

Arrange the times.\n\n   \u2022 Fix a convenient basic time for Charles, say 100 minutes a stage\n     \u21d2 total time for Charles = 14 \u00d7 100 = 1400 minutes.\n\n   \u2022 Make the future champion ride 99 minutes every stage\n     \u21d2 total = 14 \u00d7 99 = 1386 minutes (14 minutes faster than Charles).\n\n   \u2022 For each of the remaining 98 riders do this:\n       \u2013 In the 13 stages in which he beats Charles let him be\n         one second (=1\u204460 min) faster than Charles:  99 min 59 s.\n       \u2013 In the single stage in which Charles beats him let him have\n         a mishap that costs one extra hour: 160 min.\n\n     Then for such a rider\n\n        total time = 13 \u00d7 (99 min 59 s) + 160 min\n                   = 1299 min 47 s + 160 min\n                   = 1459 min 47 s,\n\n     which is 59 min 47 s slower than Charles.\n\n   All 98 of these riders therefore end up with a larger accumulated time than Charles\n   even though each of them beat him in 13 of the 14 individual stages.\n\n4.  What is the best overall place Charles can possibly achieve?\n\n   \u2022 He cannot finish first because there are only 98 \u201cplaces-behind-Charles\u201d available and\n     the champion must always be in front of him.\n\n   \u2022 Because 98 riders can be made slower than Charles in the way described, the best overall\n     position he can reach is second.\n\nAnd that is exactly what happened: by spreading those 98 \u201cbad\u201d stages among the 98 riders,\nCharles ends the race with a better total time than everybody except the one consistently\nfaster rider (the champion), even though he never finished higher than 93rd in any\nindividual stage.\n\nFinal answer: Charles could be second overall because the seven riders who finished behind him in each of the 14 stages can be different riders every time, allowing him to outride 98 different opponents on at least one stage each; by making their single bad stage much slower than Charles\u2019s steady time, all 98 of them accumulate more total time, leaving only one rider\u2014the champion\u2014ahead of him.", "Status": true, "Correct": NaN, "correctness": "1", "model_bruteforce": "0"}
{"ID": 147, "Question": "The Boldavian navy has a rigorous training program.  In order to graduate from the naval academy, cadets must enter a pool and fight sharks.  Today, a group of cadets was tested.  Each cadet put on his mask, snorkel, and two flippers; and armed himself with a knife.  Then the cadets jumped into the pool.  The sharks were then released from their pens.  After 10 minutes of gruelling hand-to-fin combat, all of the sharks were killed.  Miraculously, none of the cadets were killed.  Exiting the pool, the cadets began to haul the shark bodies out of the water.  The dead sharks were soon lying in a row.  One of the cadets noted that during the fight, there were 4 times as many cadets in the water as there were sharks.  A second cadet then stated that the number of legs they now had was equal to the square of the number of sharks.  A third said that the number of cadet legs was 14 more than the total number of cadet and shark heads.  How many sharks were killed?", "Hint": "Set up systems of equations; notice that legs could be lost (\"they now had\")", "Human Solution": "7 sharks were killed.\nSince there were 4 times as many cadets, there were 28 cadets.

In fact, each shark had bitten off one leg from each of 7 cadets.  This explains the shortage of legs, since 28 cadets should have had 56 legs, not 49.

{"ID": 189, "Question": "A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.\nHow fast can the man run?", "Hint": "You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.", "Human Solution": "Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.\nFeel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.

{"ID": 194, "Question": "Difficult Danny has acquired his nickname (and some other, less polite nicknames) due to the fact that, whenever he buys anything, he insists upon paying the exact amount, with precisely 100 pieces of currency. Danny wanted an xCube365 (it lasts 365 days before programmatically disabling itself, so that a new one must be purchased), the highly coveted gaming system that had just been released. It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?", "Hint": "First, see if there is a denomination that is not used. If so, figure out which denomination that is", "Human Solution": "Can at least one of each denomination be used? That totals $186 with only 6 bills, plus at least $94 with the rest of the bills. This is too high. Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.\nIf a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities. So $100 bill is the denomination that is not used. We now know that at least one of each of the other bills is used. That totals $86 with 5 bills, leaving 95 bills to make the other $144.\nThere are only 4 ways to make $144 with these denominations, which are listed in order from $1 bills to $50 bills in each of these sets: {84,10,1,0,0}, {89,1,5,0,0}, {89,3,2,1,0}, {94,0,0,0,1}. Adding in one of each bill, which we have already determined, gives {85,11,2,1,1}, {90,2,6,1,1}, {90,4,3,2,1}, {95,1,1,1,2}. {1,1,1} is the only triplet here that can make a true multiplication sentence: 1 x 1 = 1.

So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.\nAll multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.\nIf you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.\nTo prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.\na*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =\n9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .\n9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.\nThe smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111.

{"ID": 247, "Question": "The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.\nHe said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?", "Hint": "Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations", "Human Solution": "The observations given are :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nFrom observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.\nLet us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.\nFrom observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.\nHence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.\nIf it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.\nThis means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10).
