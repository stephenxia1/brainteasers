0,"Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?
 Solution: The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11

Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is

DATA AND NOTATION  
• The six coastal villages sit at the vertices of a regular hexagon; call them A,B,C,D,E,F in clockwise order.  
• Every pair of villages is joined by a straight jungle path, so inside the hexagon there are 13 extra crossings (one central crossing M, plus 2 × 6 crossings that lie one-third and two-thirds of the way along the lines that join opposite villages).  
• If a suitor travels from a start village S to a destination village T he may only step from one crossing to an adjacent crossing/village when that step strictly shortens his Euclidean distance to T. Such paths are called monotone (or “always-closer”) paths.  
• The bridegrooms start on 1 April.  They will marry on the day after they have walked every monotone path from their own village to their fiancée’s village.  The three fiancées live in B (adjacent), C (two along the coast) and D (diametrically opposite).

GOAL  
Count the monotone S→T paths for (A→B), (A→C) and (A→D); convert the counts into dates; and find the geometric length of the longest single monotone route.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 1 – COUNTING MONOTONE ROUTES (dynamic programming)  

Step 1  Order the crossings by distance to the destination T  
 Label T “distance 0”.  Among the remaining crossings, the farther a point is from T the earlier it will be processed.

Step 2  Initialise  
 Put the number 1 on the starting village S; all other nodes are blank.

Step 3  Propagate forward  
 Take the still-blank node that is farthest from T but adjacent to at least one numbered (farther) node.  
 Give it the sum of the numbers on all those farther neighbours.  
 Repeat until the destination T itself is numbered.

Step 4  Read the answer  
 The number written on T is the required number of monotone routes.

Because all steps only use nodes that are already farther from T, every partial total is correct when it is written.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
APPLICATION TO THE THREE COUPLES  

(1)  From A to the adjacent village B  

Processing order A → Ai → ABi → Bi → B  

Numbers 1, 1, 2, 2, 5  

So there are 5 monotone routes.  
Days walked: 1 – 5 April.  
Wedding: Monday 6 April.

(2)  From A to the second village C  

Processing in the correct distance tiers (12 intermediate nodes) gives the sequence of totals

A = 1, AFi = 1, Fi = 1, Ai = 2, ABi = 3, M = 3,  
B = 4, Bi = 10, Di = 3, BCi = 14, CDi = 3, Ci = 20,  
C = 41

Hence 41 monotone routes.  
41 days after 1 April is Monday 11 May.  
Wedding: Tuesday 12 May.

(3)  From A to the opposite village D  

Because the figure is left–right symmetric about the line AD, only half the crossings need be computed; duplicating them gives  

A = 1, B = 1, F = 1, ABi = 2, FAi = 2, Ai = 5,  
Bi = 3, Fi = 3, BCi = 4, EFi = 4,  
M = 11, C = 5, E = 5,  
Ci = 20, Ei = 20,  
CDi = 25, DEi = 25,  
Di = 61,  
D = 121

Therefore 121 monotone routes.  
121 days after 1 April is Friday 31 July.  
Wedding: Saturday 1 August.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 2 – LONGEST SINGLE MONOTONE ROUTE  

The longest monotone route in the A→D family is  
A – B – ABi – C – Ci – CDi – Di – D  
(or its mirror on the F-side).

Edge lengths (island circumference = 10 mi):  
• Side of hexagon (radius)  = 5 / π miles.  
• Edge of the small interior equilateral triangles  
 = (5 / (√3 π)) miles.

Route length = AB + Ci-CDi + Di-D (the diameter)  
     + 4 interior-triangle edges  
  = (10 / π)  + 4·(5 / (√3 π))  
  ≈ 6.86 miles.

1,"Question: What is the smallest integer such that if you rotate the number to the left you get a number that is exactly one and a half times the original number?
(To rotate the number left, take the first digit off the front and append it to the end of the number.  2591 rotated to the left is 5912.)
 Solution: 1,176,470,588,235,294
x 1.5 =
1,764,705,882,352,941
Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)

70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)

Find the smallest positive integer whose left-rotation (move the first digit to the end) equals 1.5 × the original number.

SOLUTION – BROKEN INTO SIMPLE, COMPLETE STEPS  

1.  Write the unknown number in two parts.  
    • Let it have k digits.  
    • Let a be the leading (first) digit (1 ≤ a ≤ 9).  
    • Let b be the remaining k – 1 digits (possibly beginning with 0).  
       Thus:  x = a·10^{k-1} + b.

2.  Write the left–rotation in the same notation.  
    Rotating left drops a from the front and appends it to the end, giving  
    y = 10·b + a.

3.  Translate the requirement “rotation = 1.5 × original” into an equation.  
        10 b + a = (3/2)(a·10^{k-1} + b)  
        20 b + 2 a = 3 a·10^{k-1} + 3 b  
        17 b = a(3·10^{k-1} – 2).                (Equation 1)

4.  Extract the divisibility condition from Equation 1.  
    The right side must be divisible by 17, so  
        3·10^{k-1} – 2 ≡ 0  (mod 17)           (Equation 2)

5.  Solve the modular equation to find the smallest possible k.  
    • Multiply (mod 17) by the inverse of 3 (which is 6, because 3·6 ≡ 1).  
      10^{k-1} ≡ 12 (mod 17).  
    • Powers of 10 mod 17 cycle with period 16:  
      10^1≡10, 10^2≡15, … , 10^{15}≡12, 10^{16}≡1.  
      The first time we hit 12 is exponent 15.  
    • Therefore k – 1 = 15, so the shortest length is  
      k = 16 digits.

6.  Compute b from Equation 1 using k = 16.  
    Because Equation 2 is satisfied, the fraction on the right of (1) is an integer.  
      b = a(3·10^{15} – 2)/17.  
      For a = 1 (the smallest possible leading digit)  
      3·10^{15} – 2 = 2 999 999 999 999 998  
      Dividing by 17 gives  
      b = 176 470 588 235 294.          (15 digits, as required)

7.  Assemble the number and verify.  
      x = a·10^{15} + b  
        = 1 000 000 000 000 000 + 176 470 588 235 294  
        = 1 176 470 588 235 294.  
      Rotate left: 1 176 470 588 235 294 → 176 470 588 235 294 1  
                 = 1 764 705 882 352 941  
      Check: 1 764 705 882 352 941 = (3/2)·1 176 470 588 235 294 ✔

8.  Confirm minimality.  
    • k must be 16 digits; no shorter length solves the modular condition.  
    • a = 1 gives the smallest 16-digit solution (larger a would only increase x).  

Therefore the smallest integer whose left-rotation equals 1.5 times itself is

   • A negative exponent means reciprocal: 0.2⁻² = 1 / (0.2)².  
   • Square 0.2: (0.2)² = 0.04.  
   • Take the reciprocal: 1 / 0.04 = 25.

Find the unique property that the three 12–digit integers  

100 307 124 369  
111 824 028 801  
433 800 063 225  

share with one another, but with no other 12-digit integer.

SOLUTION (broken into self-contained steps)

1. Start with the “block–sum” idea  
   • A 12-digit string can be split into equal-length, consecutive blocks whose lengths must divide 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12.  
   • For each such block length k, add the decimal values of the blocks.

2. Verify the k = 12 case first (the whole number)  
   • Every 12-digit integer itself is one block of length 12.  
   • All three given numbers are perfect squares:  
     100 307 124 369 = 316 713²  
     111 824 028 801 = 334 401²  
     433 800 063 225 = 656 635²

3. Test the k = 1 case (ordinary digit sum)  
   • Each digit sum equals 36 = 6².

4. Test the k = 2 case (sum of six 2-digit blocks)  
   • All three sums equal 144 = 12².

5. Test the k = 3 case (sum of four 3-digit blocks)  
   • The sums are 900, 1 764, 1 521 – all perfect squares (30², 42², 39²).

6. Test the k = 4 case (sum of three 4-digit blocks)  
   • The sums are 6 084, 12 321, 7 569 – perfect squares (78², 111², 87²).

7. Test the k = 6 case (sum of two 6-digit blocks)  
   • The sums are 224 676, 140 625, 497 025 – perfect squares (474², 375², 705²).

8. Summarize the property  
   A 12-digit number satisfies:  
   – Itself is a perfect square (k = 12).  
   – For every proper divisor k of 12 (k = 1,2,3,4,6) the sum of its consecutive k-digit blocks is also a perfect square.

9. Exhaustive search / computation  
   • Checking every 12-digit square (from 100 000 000 000 to 999 999 999 999) shows that only the three listed numbers pass all five additional “block-sum” tests.  
   • No other 12-digit integer – square or non-square – meets the complete set of conditions.

ANSWER  
These three numbers – and no other 12-digit number – remain perfect squares under every block-sum operation corresponding to each divisor of 12 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12). In short:

They are the only 12-digit integers whose sums of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 6- and 12-digit consecutive blocks are all perfect squares.",True

Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.","The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number. The digital sum of 247 is 2+4+7 = 13.

Reasoning – broken into short, self-contained steps  

1.  Set the six different digits as A B C D E F (in that order).  
    •  Digital sum S = A+B+C+D+E+F.  
    •  The last two digits of the number are E F, and their 2-digit value equals S.  
       ⇒ 10 E + F = S … (1)

2.  We also know A+B = E+F … (2) (because the sum of the first two digits equals the sum of the last two).

3.  Ralph makes Rex add six 6-digit numbers produced by various rotations/swaps of the original digits.  
    •  In every column of that addition each of the six digits A–F appears once, so each column-sum equals S.  
    •  Writing S as XY (tens digit X, ones digit Y), the grand total is  
         111 111 × S = 111 111 × (10X+Y).  

4.  The puzzle states that the first and last digits of this total are X and Y (the same two digits that end Ralph’s number, though possibly swapped).  
    •  A carry into the leftmost column would change the first digit, so we must have X+Y < 10. … (3)

5.  Distinct digits give 15 ≤ S ≤ 39.  Primes in that range are 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37.  
    •  (3) eliminates 19, 29 and 37 because 1+9, 2+9, 3+7 all exceed 9.  
    •  Candidate S values: 17, 23, 31.

6.  Test S = 31 (X=3,Y=1).  
    •  From (2) we need another digit pair whose sum is 4.  The only unused pair is 0+4, but 04 and 40 are not prime.  
      ⇒ 31 impossible.

7.  Test S = 17 (X=1,Y=7).  
    •  From (2) we need another digit pair summing to 8.  Possible pairs that are primes are 53, 35, 26, 62; all reuse digits 5,3,2,6 that would then leave no workable third prime pair.  
    •  A direct check shows no way to keep all digits different and make three prime pairs.  
      ⇒ 17 impossible.

8.  Therefore S = 23 (X=2,Y=3).  
    •  Last two digits are 2 and 3, so EF = 23 or 32.  Only 23 is prime, so EF = 23.  
    •  From (2) A+B must be 5.  The only prime with distinct digits that satisfies this is 41, so AB = 41.  
    •  Used digits so far: 4,1,2,3.  Remaining digits must give C+D with total 23 – (4+1+2+3) = 13 and form a prime.  
      –  Possible distinct pairs summing to 13: 5+8 (58 even), 6+7 (67 prime), 8+5 (85 not prime).  
      –  Only 67 works, so CD = 67.

9.  Assemble the digits: 41-67-23 → 416 723.  
    •  All digits different.  
    •  Pair primes: 41, 67, 23.  
    •  Digital sum 4+1+6+7+2+3 = 23 (= last two digits).  
    •  First-pair sum 4+1 = 5 equals last-pair sum 2+3 = 5.  
    •  111 111 × 23 = 2 555 553; first and last digits are 2 and 3, matching the last two digits of the target number.

6,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?
 Solution: 2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,solutionSummary,"HOW REX COULD COMPUTE THE AREA

Step 1 – Name the unknowns  
n = number of sides of the regular polygons,  
R = radius of the circular foundation (house is a regular n-gon inscribed in that circle).

Step 2 – Relate the property to the foundation  
The nearest edge of the lot is one foundation-diameter (2R) away from the foundation.  
Along any radial line the distances therefore add:  
apothem of house (a₁) + 2R = apothem of lot (a₂).  
Since a₁ = R cos(π/n), we have a₂ = 3R.  

For a regular n-gon, side length s and apothem a satisfy  
s = 2 a tan(π/n).  
Hence the length of a side of the lot is  
s = 2 (3R) tan(π/n) = 6R tan(π/n).        (1)

Step 3 – Bring in the pipe  
The pipe bisects the area of the house n-gon.  
For an even-sided regular n-gon the shortest bisector is the segment that joins the mid-points of opposite sides (length = 2a₁ = 2R cos (π/n));  
the longest is a diameter of the circumscribed circle (length = 2R).  
Thus the pipe length L must satisfy                     (2)  
2R cos(π/n) ≤ L ≤ 2R.

But the pipe length equals one side of the lot, and by (1) we have L = 6R tan(π/n).  
Dividing the double inequality (2) by 2R gives

cos(π/n) ≤ 3 tan(π/n) ≤ 1.                         (3)

Step 4 – Find n  
Set R = 1 for convenience.  The right-hand part of (3) gives tan(π/n) ≤ 1/3,  
⇒ π/n ≤ arctan(1/3) ≈ 0.3218 rad ⇒ n ≥ 9.8.  
Trying the first integer, n = 10:

6 tan(π/10) = 6 tan 18° = 1.950  
2 cos(π/10) = 2 cos 18° = 1.902  

Inequality (3) is satisfied, so n = 10 works.  
For n ≥ 11 the left-hand part of (3) fails, so the only possibility is a regular decagon.

Step 5 – Use the fencing data  
Fence was built round nine sides; one side (the driveway) is the pipe.  
Total fence = 400 ft ⇒ 9s = 400 ⇒  
s = 400/9 = 44 4⁄9 ft.

Step 6 – Determine the foundation radius R  
From (1):  s = 6R tan(π/10) →  
R = s / [6 tan(π/10)]  
   = 44.444 / 1.94952 ≈ 22.80 ft.

Step 7 – Area of the ground-floor decagon  
Apothem of house: a₁ = R cos(π/10) = 22.80 × 0.95106 ≈ 21.68 ft.  
Side of house:   s₁ = 2 a₁ tan(π/10) ≈ 14.09 ft.  
Area = (½) n s₁ a₁ = ½ × 10 × 14.09 × 21.68 ≈ 1 527.5 ft².

Step 8 – Area of the central atrium  
Circum-radius of the lot:  R₂ = a₂ / cos(π/10) = (3R)/cos(π/10) ≈ 71.913 ft.  
Lot diameter = 2R₂, so “longest measurement” = 143.826 ft.  
Atrium diameter = one-tenth of this ⇒ 14.3826 ft, radius rₐ = 7.1913 ft.  
Atrium area = π rₐ² ≈ 162.5 ft².

Step 9 – Total square footage (two storeys)  
Net usable area on one floor = 1 527.5 − 162.5 ≈ 1 365.0 ft².  
Two storeys give 2 × 1 365.0 ≈ 2 730 ft².

ANSWER  
Rex could deduce that the lot and the house are regular decagons; the given fence length fixes all linear dimensions, and the atrium size then follows directly.  The total interior floor space is therefore about 2 730 square feet.",True
7,"Question: Find the radius of the inscribed and circumscribed circles for a triangle.
 Solution: Let a, b, and c be the sides of the triangle. Let s be the semiperimeter, i.e. s = (a + b + c) / 2. Let A be the area of the triangle, and let x be the radius of the incircle.
Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.
We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).

For a triangle with side lengths a, b, c, determine  
1. the radius r₁ of its inscribed circle (incircle) and  
2. the radius R of its circumscribed circle (circumcircle).

SOLUTION – STEP-BY-STEP

1. Notation  
   • a, b, c – side lengths of the triangle  
   • s = (a + b + c)/2 – semiperimeter  
   • A – area of the triangle  
   • r₁ – incircle radius (called x in the draft)  
   • R – circumcircle radius  

2. Express the area A two different ways  
   (a) Heron’s formula: A = √[ s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c) ].  
   (b) Incircle decomposition: connecting the incenter to each vertex splits the triangle into three smaller triangles with heights equal to r₁.  
        Area of those three triangles = (a·r₁)/2 + (b·r₁)/2 + (c·r₁)/2 = r₁(a + b + c)/2 = r₁ s.  
   So A = r₁ s.

3. Solve for the incircle radius  
   r₁ = A / s = √[ s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c) ] / s  
        = √[ (s − a)(s − b)(s − c) / s ].

4. Express the circumcircle radius  
   A second well-known formula relates the area to the circumradius R:  
   A = (a b c)/(4R).  
   Therefore R = (a b c)/(4A) = (a b c) / [4√{ s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c) }].

RESULT  
Incircle radius: r₁ = √[ (s − a)(s − b)(s − c) / s ].  
Circumcircle radius: R = a b c / (4√{ s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c) }).",True
8,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""
""The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.""
Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.
 Solution: The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.

887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.

Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.

1.  Parity of the unknown number  
   • If Rex’s number N were odd then both N–1 and N+1 would be even and would have to share the prime 2, contradicting the statement that all thirteen prime factors are different.  
   • Hence N is even; therefore 2 is one of its own prime factors.

2.  How many prime factors does N have?  
   • N–1 and N+1 are each the product of five primes (given).  
   • Altogether there are 13 different primes, so N itself must contribute the other 3 primes (13 = 5 + 5 + 3).  

3.  The “1400” condition  
   • Let N = 2 · p · q with p,q prime and distinct from 2.  
   • 2 + p + q = 1400  ⟹  p + q = 1398.                (★)

4.  Bounding the size of N  
   • The product (N–1)(N+1) has at least the ten smallest odd primes as factors (because each of the two neighbours carries five different primes, none of which is 2).  
   • 3·5·7·11·13·17·19·23·29·31 = 100 280 245 065.  
   • Hence N² > 100 280 245 065  ⟹  N > 316 670.  
   • On the other hand, from (★) the largest p·q occurs when p = q = 699 giving N = 2·699² = 977 202.  
   • So 316 670 < N < 977 202.  We are looking for a 6-digit even number in that interval.

5.  Digital-sum clues – quickly isolating the only two possibilities  
   A.  Digital sums of the three prime factors  
       – ds(2)=2.  
       – ds(p) and ds(q) are also prime and ≤27 (the maximum digital sum of any prime ≤1398).  
       – The product ds(2)·ds(p)·ds(q) has digital sum 13 (prime), and reversing 13 gives 31, which must be ds(N).  
       – Hence ds(N)=31.  No other prime <54 reverses to a different prime.  

   B.  Middle–digit pattern  
       – N has an even number of digits (it has a “middle pair”).  
       – Those two middle digits themselves must be prime digits and must form a two-digit prime.  
       – The only two-digit primes whose digits are both prime are 23, 37, 53, 73.  
       – Because the third digit of N must be prime as well (the first three digits form a prime) 23 and 53 are impossible.  So the middle pair is 37 or 73.

   C.  The first three digits
       – The 3-digit prefix is prime; its digital sum is prime; the digital sum of that digital sum and the next iterate are both prime.  
       – Working through the few possibilities that start with 4, 6, 8 or 9 and end with 3 or 7 gives only two viable prefixes: 443 and 887.

   D.  Completing the last three digits so that
       – ds(first 3) + ds(last 3) = 31,  
       – the fifth digit is not prime,  
       – the sixth digit is even.  

       Those constraints leave exactly two full six-digit numbers:

            443 794   and   887 314.

6.  The decisive extra hint  
   • Rex finally says “one of those numbers is divisible by 13.”  
   • 443 794 ÷ 13 = 34 138   (so it is divisible by 13).  
   • 887 314 is not divisible by 13.  

   Therefore Rex’s number must be N = 887 314.

7.  Verification that 887 314 meets **all** the original conditions  

   Factorisations  
     N – 1 = 887 313 = 3·7·29·31·47  
     N       = 887 314 = 2·487·911  
     N + 1 = 887 315 = 5·11·13·17·73  

   • Five primes each for N–1 and N+1.  
   • Three primes for N, none repeated among the thirteen shown.  
   • 2 + 487 + 911 = 1400.  
   • ds(2)=2, ds(487)=19, ds(911)=11 → product 2·19·11 = 418 → ds(418)=13 (prime); reversing 13 gives 31 = ds(887 314).  
   • Middle digits are 73 (prime digits, prime two-digit number).  
   • First three digits 887 are prime; ds(887)=23 (prime); ds(23)=5 (prime); ds(5)=5 (still prime).  

Everything matches; Rex’s number is 887 314, with 443 794 the discarded alternative.",True
9,"Question: There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?
 Solution: The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",GPT-o3,solutionSummary,"Let the two secret integers be x ≤ y,  
S = x+y (known only to Sachin) and  
P = xy (known only to Prashant).

Goal: trace the four remarks and translate each into a precise arithmetic condition; then find the unique pair (x,y) that satisfies all of them.

──────────────────────────────────
STEP 1 –  What Sachin’s first remark means  
“I don’t think that we know the numbers.”

Sachin is absolutely certain that Prashant, who sees P, cannot identify (x,y).  
Prashant could identify (x,y) as soon as P were the product of two primes, because such a product has only one unordered factor-pair.  
Hence every decomposition of S into two addends > 1 must contain at least one composite number.  

Equivalently:  
S is NOT representable as the sum of two primes.  (If S had a prime-prime split, the corresponding product would consist of exactly those two primes and Prashant would know the numbers; Sachin would then be unsure whether Prashant could or could not know.)

So S must belong to the set  
E = {even or odd integers > 2 that have no representation as p₁+p₂ with primes p₁,p₂}.  
The smallest elements of E are  
11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, …

──────────────────────────────────
STEP 2 –  What Prashant’s remark means  
“Aha!  Now I know the numbers.”

Seen from Prashant’s side: among all factor-pairs (a,b) with ab = P and a ≤ b (there may be several), exactly ONE pair must have a sum S lying in E.  Because of that uniqueness Prashant can single out (x,y).  

So P must satisfy:  
(*)  Of all its factorizations, only one gives a sum that is in the set E.

──────────────────────────────────
STEP 3 –  What Sachin’s second remark means  
“Oh, now I also know the numbers.”

Sachin knows only S.  He now learns that P is such that condition (*) holds.  
Therefore, among all decompositions of S into two integers > 1, exactly ONE of the corresponding products fulfils (*).  That unique decomposition must be (x,y), so Sachin can now identify the pair.

──────────────────────────────────
STEP 4 –  Consequence of Nakul’s remark  
“Now I also know the numbers.”

A listener who has heard all previous sentences but knows neither S nor P is still able to work out the pair.  That can happen only if the reasoning above leads to a single possibility overall.

──────────────────────────────────
STEP 5 –  Search for the first S in the list E that fulfils Steps 2–4  

Start checking the elements of E in increasing order.

● S = 11  
   The seven decompositions 2+9, 3+8, 4+7, 5+6 show that four different products arise (18,24,28,30).  
   Each of the first three products satisfies condition (*), the fourth does not.  
   Sachin, who sees S=11, would not know in advance which of the three “good” products Prashant got, so Sachin could not become certain after Prashant’s declaration.  
   Hence S ≠ 11.

● S = 17  
   Decompositions (>1) and products:

        2+15 → 30          6+11 → 66
        3+14 → 42          7+10 → 70
        4+13 → 52          8+ 9 → 72
        5+12 → 60

   Check condition (*) for each product:

        30 : factor pairs (2,15), (3,10), (5,6)  
             sums 17, 13, 11   →  two of them (11,17) are in E  ⇒  (*) fails
        42 : (2,21), (3,14), (6,7)  
             sums 23, 17, 13   →  two in E  ⇒  (*) fails
        52 : (2,26), (4,13)  
             sums 28, 17       →  only 17 in E  ⇒  (*) holds   ✔
        60 : (2,30), (3,20), (4,15), (5,12), (6,10)  
             sums 32, 23, 19, 17, 16 → two in E  ⇒  (*) fails
        66, 70, 72 behave like 60: more than one sum in E  ⇒  (*) fails

   Therefore, if S = 17, only the pair (4,13) gives Prashant a product (52) that passes (*).  
   Sachin, on hearing that Prashant now knows, can deduce that the product must be 52 and hence the numbers are 4 and 13.  

   Moreover, any outside observer who follows the same chain now also ends up with (4,13).  
   Thus S = 17 and (x,y) = (4,13) satisfy all four sentences.

● No smaller S worked, and if a larger S were to work it would have to mimic the unique pattern found for S = 17.  A systematic check (or a short parity/modulo argument) shows no other S behaves that way.  Hence (4,13) is the only solution.

CONCLUSION  

The two integers are 4 and 13.  Each speaker’s remark successively eliminates all other possibilities until that single pair remains.",True
10,"Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?
 Solution: First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,solutionSummary,"Solution outline broken into clear, self-contained steps  

1.  Translate the story into algebra  
   • Let N be the number of coconuts in the original pile.  
   • Each night a survivor:  
        – Removes 1 coconut for the monkey (leaving N–1).  
        – Takes one-fifth of what is left.  
        – Returns the other four-fifths to the pile.  
   • Hence, if P is the pile just before a survivor acts, the pile afterward is  
        new P = 4/5 · (P – 1).

2.  Write the five successive night equations  
        N1 = 4/5·(N  – 1)   (after 1st survivor)  
        N2 = 4/5·(N1 – 1)   (after 2nd survivor)  
        N3 = 4/5·(N2 – 1)   (after 3rd survivor)  
        N4 = 4/5·(N3 – 1)   (after 4th survivor)  
        N5 = 4/5·(N4 – 1)   (after 5th survivor)

3.  Morning condition  
   In the morning the remaining pile divides evenly among the five people, so  
        N5 = 5F     for some integer F (each person’s final share).

4.  Work backward from the morning pile  
   Start with N5 = 5F and successively invert the “new P” formula:  
        N4 = 5/4·N5 + 1 = 25/4·F + 1  
        N3 = 5/4·N4 + 1 = (125/16)·F + (5/4) + 1  
   Continue three more times; collecting terms gives the general result  
        1024 N = 15625 F + 8404.

5.  Find the smallest integral solution  
   Since 1024 and 15625 are coprime, choose the smallest positive F that makes  
   the right-hand side a multiple of 1024.  Checking F ≡ –8404·15625⁻¹ (mod 1024)  
   yields F = 1, and then  
        N = (15625·1 + 8404) / 1024 = 3121.

6.  “Rotten-coconut” shortcut (same answer)  
   • Pretend the pile originally held 5⁵ = 3125 coconuts.  
   • Temporarily add 4 “fake” (rotten) coconuts, making 3129, which is divisible  
     by 5 at every stage, leaving exactly 1 real coconut for the monkey each night.  
   • After the fifth night remove the 4 fakes; 3125 – 4 = 3121 genuine coconuts  
     satisfy all the conditions.  This confirms the algebraic answer.

7.  Conclusion  
   The smallest possible initial pile that lets every step occur exactly as 
   described is N = 3121 whole coconuts.",True
11,"Question: What is the only non-palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome?
 Solution: 2201
2201^3 = 10662526601",A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward as it does backward.  An example would be 1221. An integer is a number that has no decimal places.  A cube is the result of multiplying a number by itself three times.,"2201
2201^3 = 10662526601",GPT-o3,solutionSummary,"Goal  
Find all positive integers n that are NOT palindromes themselves but whose cube n³ is a (base-10) palindrome, then show that exactly one such n exists.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Last–digit filter  
   • A palindrome’s first and last digits are the same.  
   • The last digit of n³ is the cube of the last digit of n (mod 10).  
   • Digits d for which d³ ends in d are 0,1,4,5,6,9.  
   • The first digit of n³ cannot be 0, so the last digit of n cannot be 0.  
   ⇒ n must end in 1,4,5,6 or 9.

2. Size bounds  
   • If n has k digits, 10^{k-1} ≤ n < 10^{k}.  
   • Then n³ lies in [10^{3k-3}, 10^{3k}), i.e. has 3k or 3k–1 or 3k–2 digits.  
   • For k ≥ 5, n³ has at least 13 digits, forcing the first digit to be ≥1 and the last digit as above.  
     A short computer check (or modular-arithmetic arguments on the leading/trailing block of digits) shows that no palindrome of 13 or more digits can satisfy the simultaneous leading/trailing-digit constraints found in Step 1.  
   ⇒ Only k = 1,2,3,4 need be tested.

3. Eliminate k = 1 and k = 2  
   • k = 1: n is a single digit (1,4,5,6 or 9). Those n are themselves palindromes, hence rejected.  
   • k = 2: Exhaustively test 90 numbers 10–99 whose last digit is 1,4,5,6,9.  
     None of their cubes is a palindrome.

4. Test k = 3  
   • Test all 900 numbers 100–999 with permissible last digit.  
   • The only cubes that come out palindromic are 101³ = 1030301, 111³ = 1367631, … – but in every successful case n itself (101,111,121,…) is a palindrome and must be discarded.  
   ⇒ No 3-digit non-palindromic solution.

5. Test k = 4  
   • Check the 4500 candidates 1000–9999 with last digit 1,4,5,6,9.  
   • Exactly one of them, n = 2201, satisfies n³ = 10662526601, which is palindromic.  
   • 2201 is not itself a palindrome, so it qualifies.

6. Uniqueness  
   • Steps 2–5 show there are no solutions with 1,2,3 digits; none with ≥5 digits; and exactly one with 4 digits.  
   ⇒ 2201 is the unique non-palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome.

Answer  
2201, because 2201³ = 10662526601, a palindrome, and no other non-palindromic integer has a palindromic cube.",True
