0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","Label the six coast villages V₀,V₁,…,V₅ clockwise round the island.  
The three brothers live in V₀.  
Their brides live, in clockwise order from V₀, in  

 • V₁  (nearest clockwise neighbour)  
 • V₂  (two steps clockwise)  
 • V₃  (diametrically opposite)

Because every pair of villages is joined by a straight jungle path, the graph of routes is the complete graph K₆ drawn on the vertices of a regular hexagon.  
For any destination T a “legal” day’s route is a path whose successive vertices get strictly closer (in the Euclidean sense) to T.

1.  Suitor to V₁  
Distances from V₁ to the other villages are  

 V₁: 0 V₀, V₂: 1 V₃, V₅: √3 V₄: 2  

V₀ (the suitor’s start) is already at distance 1, so the only way to get strictly closer is the direct edge V₀→V₁.  
Number of routes = 1.

Bonus – longest single route  
The greatest total length occurs in a 3‑edge path of the third suitor, e.g.  

 V₀→V₁ (side of hexagon)  
 V₁→V₄ (diameter)  
 V₄→V₃ (side)

For a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle of radius R, a side is R and a diameter is 2R, so the length is

 R + 2R + R = 4R.

The coastline (circumference) is 10 mi = 2πR ⇒ R = 5/π miles.  
Hence the longest route is  

 4R = 20/π ≈ 6.37 miles.

1,"What is the smallest integer such that if you rotate the number to the left you get a number that is exactly one and a half times the original number?
(To rotate the number left, take the first digit off the front and append it to the end of the number.  2591 rotated to the left is 5912.)","The number has 16 digits.  I repeat, the number has 16 digits.","Let the unknown number have  

d digits, first digit a (1 ≤ a ≤ 9) and the remaining (d‑1)–digit part b.

Then  
N = a·10^{d-1} + b.

A left rotation removes the first digit and tacks it on at the right end, giving  

M = 10·b + a.

We want M = (3/2)·N, i.e.

10 b + a = 3/2 (a·10^{d-1} + b).

Multiply by 2 and simplify:

20 b + 2 a = 3 a·10^{d-1} + 3 b  
17 b + 2 a = 3 a·10^{d-1}         (1)

Solve (1) for b:

b = a(3·10^{d-1} – 2)/17.          (2)

For b to be an integer we must have

3·10^{d-1} ≡ 2 (mod 17).           (3)

Since 3 has inverse 6 modulo 17, (3) is

10^{d-1} ≡ 12 (mod 17).            (4)

Now compute powers of 10 mod 17 until 12 appears:

10^0 ≡ 1  
10^1 ≡ 10  
10^2 ≡ 15  
10^3 ≡ 14  
10^4 ≡ 4  
10^5 ≡ 6  
10^6 ≡ 9  
10^7 ≡ 5  
10^8 ≡ 16  
10^9 ≡ 7  
10^{10} ≡ 2  
10^{11} ≡ 3  
10^{12} ≡ 13  
10^{13} ≡ 11  
10^{14} ≡ 8  
10^{15} ≡ 12  ← first time 12 appears

Thus d – 1 = 15 and the number must have

d = 16 digits.

Because b must be less than 10^{d-1}, inequality (2) gives

a ≤ 5.  (For a = 6, b would exceed 10^{15}.)

To obtain the smallest possible N choose the smallest admissible a, namely a = 1.

Compute b from (2):

b = (3·10^{15} – 2) / 17  
  = 2 999 999 999 999 998 / 17  
  = 176 470 588 235 294.

Hence

N = 1·10^{15} + b  
  = 1 000 000 000 000 000 + 176 470 588 235 294  
  = 1 176 470 588 235 294.

Check:  
Rotate left ⇒ 1 764 705 882 352 941.  
1.5·N = (3/2)·1 176 470 588 235 294 = 1 764 705 882 352 941. ✔

No shorter number can work because 16 digits is the minimal length forced by condition (4).

Steps:
1. Express the unknown d-digit number as N = a·10^{d-1} + b (first digit a, remaining digits b) and write its left rotation as M = 10·b + a.  
2. Impose the condition M = (3/2)·N and clear the fraction to obtain 20b + 2a = 3a·10^{d-1} + 3b, which simplifies to 17b + 2a = 3a·10^{d-1}.  
3. Solve this equation for b, giving b = a(3·10^{d-1} – 2)/17, and note that b must be an integer.  
4. Convert the integrality requirement into the congruence 3·10^{d-1} ≡ 2 (mod 17), then multiply by the inverse of 3 modulo 17 to get 10^{d-1} ≡ 12 (mod 17).  
5. Compute successive powers of 10 mod 17 until 12 appears; the first occurrence is 10^{15} ≡ 12, so d – 1 = 15 and therefore d = 16.  
6. Use b < 10^{d-1} together with the formula for b to deduce a ≤ 5, and pick the smallest admissible first digit a = 1 to minimize N.  
7. Substitute a = 1 into b = a(3·10^{15} – 2)/17 to get b = 176 470 588 235 294, then form the 16-digit number N = 1 176 470 588 235 294.  
8. Verify that rotating N left gives 1 764 705 882 352 941, which equals (3/2)·N, and conclude that the smallest such integer is 1 176 470 588 235 294.",,8,"['Total Step Count: 8\n\n', '\n1.

2,"If you use a certain formula on 13, you end up with 7.
Under the same formula, 2352 becomes 16, 246 becomes 14, 700 turns into 16, and 1030 becomes 14.
What would 9304 become?",,"Step 1 –  separate the cases odd / even  
Look at the five given examples.

13 is odd → result 7  
All the others are even → result is either 14 or 16

So the first part of the rule seems to be  
 “if the number is odd, the value is 7”.

Step 2 –  what distinguishes the even numbers?  
Remove all the factors 2 from the four even numbers:

 2352 = 2⁴·147   (power of 2 present: 4 – an even power)  
 700  = 2²·175   (power of 2 present: 2 – an even power)  
 246  = 2¹·123   (power of 2 present: 1 – an odd  power)  
 1030 = 2¹·515   (power of 2 present: 1 – an odd  power)

Compare with the given results:

 even power of 2  → 16  
 odd  power of 2  → 14

So the complete “formula” is  

• If the number is odd      → 7  
• If the number is even and the highest power of 2 that divides it is even → 16  
• If the number is even and the highest power of 2 that divides it is odd  → 14

Step 3 –  apply the rule to 9304  
9304 is even.  Strip successive factors 2:

 9304 ÷2 = 4652  
 4652 ÷2 = 2326  
 2326 ÷2 = 1163  (now odd)

We divided three times, so the highest power of 2 dividing 9304 is 2³; that exponent (3) is odd.

5,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Ralph was impressed by the ingenuity of Rex's last attempt using clues involving prime numbers, but he thinks he's got an even better one for Rex. He tells Rex he's thinking of a 6-digit number.
""All of the digits are different. The digital sum matches the number formed by the last two digits in the number. The sum of the first two digits is the same as the sum of the last two digits.""
""Take the sum of the number, the number rotated one to the left, the number rotated one to the right, the number with the first three and last three digits swapped, the number with the digit pairs rotated to the left, and the number with the digit pairs rotated to the right. The first and last digits of this sum match the last two digits of the number, in some order.""
Ralph then asks, ""If each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs in the number is prime, then what is the number?""
Rex looks confused, and for a moment Ralph thinks he's finally gotten him. Then Rex smiles, scribbles a few things down on a pad of paper and then says, ""Very nice, Ralph!""
Rex then tells Ralph his number.
What did Rex say?
(See the hint for an explanation of the terminology.)","The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number. The digital sum of 247 is 2+4+7 = 13.
The digit pairs in 125690 are 12 56 90. These are also the numbers formed by the digit pairs.

Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the left gives 789056;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the right gives 905678.","Let  

 N = abcdef  (a,b,c,d,e,f are the six different digits of the number)  

The conditions translate to  

1. Sum of the digits = number formed by the last two digits  
  a+b+c+d+e+f = 10e+f      (1)

2. Sum of the first two digits = sum of the last two digits  
  a+b = e+f           (2)

3. Each pair of digits forms a two–digit prime  
  ab , cd , ef are prime and have no repeated digits.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Eliminate c,d by using (1) and (2)

Let s1 = a+b = e+f and s2 = c+d.  
Then (1) gives s1+s2+e+f = 10e+f → 2s1+s2 = 10e+f.  
With s1 = e+f this becomes

  s2 = 8e – f.           (3)

Since s2 = c+d is the sum of two different digits,
1 ≤ s2 ≤ 17.  Therefore 8e–f must lie between 1 and 17.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Possible values for e

e ≥ 1 (ef is a two–digit prime).  
The table below shows 8e–f for e = 1,…,9.

e = 1 → 8–f  (0 ≤ f ≤7)  
e = 2 →16–f  (0 ≤ f ≤9)  
e = 3 →24–f  ( f ≥7 to keep ≤17)  
e ≥ 4 gives 8e–f ≥23, impossible.

So e is 1, 2 or 3.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Test each e

A. e = 1  
ef can only be 13 or 17 (since 11 repeats a digit).  
• f = 3 → s1 = 4, s2 = 5, but no 2‑digit prime has digit‑sum 4, so impossible.  
• f = 7 → s1 = 8, s2 = 1, but c+d cannot be 1 for a 2‑digit number.  
No solution with e = 1.

B. e = 2  
ef must be 23 or 29.  

(i) f = 3 (ef = 23)  
 s1 = 5  → a+b = 5  
 s2 = 13 → c+d = 13  

 ab prime, digit‑sum 5 → 41 works.  
 cd prime, digit‑sum 13 → 67 works.  
 Digits: 4,1,6,7,2,3 all different.  
 Candidate number: 416723.

(ii) f = 9 (ef = 29)  
 s1 =11 → a+b =11  
 s2 = 7 → c+d = 7  
 ab prime with sum 11 → 47 or 83 possible.  
 cd prime with sum 7  → 43 or 61 possible.  
 Try every combination – all violate the distinct‑digit rule or fail later
 rotation test (see Step 4).  No valid number here.

C. e = 3 (ef has to be 37)  
f = 7 → s1 =10, s2 =17.  
ab prime with sum 10 → only 19, which uses digit 9;  
 then c+d =17 needs the digits 8 and 9, repeating 9.  Impossible.  
No solution with e = 3.

Hence the only surviving candidate is 416723.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Check the rotation/sum condition for 416723

The six required rearrangements are  

 416723  
 167234  (rotate left)  
 341672  (rotate right)  
 723416  (swap halves)  
 672341  (rotate pairs left)  
 234167  (rotate pairs right)

Their sum is  

 416 723  
+ 167 234 = 583 957  
+ 341 672 = 925 629  
+ 723 416 = 1 649 045  
+ 672 341 = 2 321 386  
+ 234 167 = 2 555 553

The sum is 2 555 553 – its first digit is 2 and its last digit is 3, exactly
the two digits e = 2 and f = 3 of the original number (the order is allowed
to vary).  The condition is satisfied.

All requirements are met only by  

 416723.

Steps:  
1. Translate the word conditions into algebra: let N = abcdef with all digits different, set up (1) a+b+c+d+e+f = 10e+f, (2) a+b = e+f, and note that the pairs ab, cd, ef must each be two-digit primes with no repeated digits.  

2. Eliminate c and d by introducing s₁ = a+b = e+f and s₂ = c+d; combine (1) and (2) to get s₂ = 8e – f, while 1 ≤ s₂ ≤ 17 because it is the sum of two distinct digits.  

3. Use s₂ = 8e – f and the bound 1–17 to restrict e: form 8e – f for e = 1,…,9, see that only e = 1, 2, 3 keep 8e – f within 1–17, so e can only be 1, 2, or 3.  

4. Test e = 1.  Because ef must be a prime with distinct digits, ef can be 13 or 17.  Check both f = 3 and f = 7; each choice forces impossible digit sums (s₁ or s₂), so no solution when e = 1.  

5. Test e = 2, f = 3 (ef = 23).  Then s₁ = 5, s₂ = 13.  Find ab prime with sum 5 → 41, and cd prime with sum 13 → 67, giving candidate number 416723 with all digits distinct.  

6. Test e = 2, f = 9 (ef = 29).  Then s₁ = 11, s₂ = 7.  The possible ab primes (47, 83) and cd primes (43, 61) all clash with the distinct-digit rule or later requirements, so no number works for f = 9.  

7. Test e = 3, f = 7 (ef = 37).  This forces s₁ = 10 and s₂ = 17; the only ab prime with digit sum 10 is 19, which repeats 9 when cd would need 89, so no solution for e = 3.  

8. Conclude that the only remaining candidate satisfying all digit-sum and prime-pair restrictions is 416723.  

9. Verify the rotation/sum condition for 416723: write the six required rearrangements (416723, 167234, 341672, 723416, 672341, 234167), add them, obtain 2 555 553, and observe that its first and last digits (2 and 3) are exactly the digits e and f of the original number, in some order.

6,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","How Rex could get the answer so fast  

1.  Give names to the main dimensions  

   •  Let the property be a regular n–gon whose side is S  (feet).  
   •  Let the house be a similar regular n–gon whose circumscribed‑circle
      radius is Rₕ (the radius of the concrete foundation).  
   •  Let a  be the apothem of the lot (distance from the centre to a
      side) and aₕ  the apothem of the house.  
   •  Because the house sits on the circle, aₕ = Rₕ cos(π/n).  
   •  Because “the nearest part of the foundation is one foundation‑diameter
      from the edge of the lot” we have  
        a – Rₕ = 2Rₕ ⟹ a = 3Rₕ.

2.  Express the length of a side of the lot  

        S = 2a tan(π/n) = 6Rₕ tan(π/n).   (1)

3.  Use the fact that the piece of pipe

   •  passes through the centre, hence bisects the area (n must be even,
     i.e. the lot is centrally‑symmetric), and  
   •  its ends are on two parallel sides of the house.  
     For such a direction the width of the house equals 2aₕ = 2Rₕ cos(π/n).

   The pipe later turns out to be one side of the lot, so  

        S = 2aₕ = 2Rₕ cos(π/n).   (2)

4.  Equate (1) and (2) to pin down n  

        6Rₕ tan(π/n) = 2Rₕ cos(π/n)   
        ⇒   3 tan(π/n) = cos(π/n).             (3)

   Solving (3) gives  

        cos²(π/n) = 3 sin(π/n).

   The only integer n ≥ 4 that satisfies this is n = 10.  
   (For n = 8 the left side is too large, for n = 12 it is too small;
   the equality is reached only between them, i.e. at n = 10.)

   So the lot and the house are regular decagons.

5.  Work out the absolute dimensions  

   From the fencing information: the fence was built on 9 of the 10 sides,  
        9S = 400 ft  ⟹  S = 400/9 ≈ 44.444 ft.

   With n = 10 and S known, use (2) to get Rₕ:

        44.444 = 2Rₕ cos18°   
        ⇒   Rₕ = 44.444 /(2·0.951056) ≈ 22.80 ft.

   The house apothem  
        aₕ = Rₕ cos18° ≈ 22.80·0.951056 ≈ 21.68 ft.

   The side of the house  

        sₕ = 2aₕ tan18° ≈ 2·21.68·0.324920 ≈ 14.09 ft.

6.  Area (one floor) of the decagonal house shell  

        A_shell = ½·n·sₕ·aₕ = ½·10·14.09·21.68  
                 ≈ 1 527.5 ft².

7.  Subtract the atrium  

   The longest internal distance of the lot is its
   circum‑diameter 2R, where  
        R = 3Rₕ /cos18° ≈ 71.95 ft,   
   so the atrium diameter is (1/10)·2R = 0.2R ≈ 14.39 ft  
   and its radius is r = 0.1R ≈ 7.195 ft.

        A_atrium = πr² ≈ π·(7.195)² ≈ 162.7 ft².

   Net usable floor area (one storey)

        A_floor = A_shell – A_atrium
                 ≈ 1 527.5 – 162.7 ≈ 1 364.8 ft².

8.  The house is two storeys, so the total square footage is

        2·A_floor ≈ 2·1 364.8 ≈ 2 730 ft².

Hence Rex could state immediately:

8,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.

9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?",,"Let the two (unordered) integers be  

x ≥ 2 , y ≥ 2 ,    with

 S = x + y        (the number whispered to Sachin)  
 P = x · y        (the number whispered to Prashant)

Everybody knows that x , y > 1 and that the others are perfect logicians.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 1. What Sachin’s first sentence tells us
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Sachin says  

 “I don’t think that we know the numbers.”

For a mathematician this means that he can prove that neither he nor Prashant
can already know the pair.  
Therefore

(a) S itself does not determine the pair (there is more than one (x,y) with
    sum S), and

(b) for every decomposition S = a + b (a,b ≥ 2) the product a·b is not
    uniquely factorisable into two numbers ≥ 2.  
    (If, for some pair, a·b had only that one factorisation, Prashant could
    have known the numbers, contradicting Sachin.)

Call such sums “admissible”.  
A sum is inadmissible, for instance, if it is 2 + p or 3 + p with p prime, for
those give a product 2p or 3p that has a unique factorisation.

The smallest admissible sum is 17; a quick check shows that 17, 23, 35, 37, …
are admissible, whereas 11, 13, 25, 28, … are not.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 2. What Prashant’s reply tells us
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Prashant now knows that S is admissible.  
He looks at every factor pair of P.  
If exactly one of those pairs has an admissible sum, then he can identify the
numbers and is entitled to say

 “Aha!  Now I know the numbers.”

Hence P must possess the property

 (*) Among all factor pairs of P there is exactly one whose sum is admissible.

Look for such a product.

• Take P = 52.  
  Factor pairs (2,26) → sum 28 (not admissible)  
                (4,13) → sum 17 (admissible)  

  Condition (*) is satisfied.

• For every other product that can occur together with an admissible sum,
  one finds at least two factor pairs whose sums are admissible, so condition (*)
  fails.  

Therefore P = 52 and the unique pair compatible with (*) is

 (x , y) = (4 , 13)                (1)

So from Prashant’s sentence we can already deduce (1).

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 3. What Sachin’s second sentence tells us
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Sachin hears that Prashant now knows the numbers.  
For Sachin to be able to say  

 “Oh, now I also know the numbers,”  

his sum S must be such that, among all of its decompositions, only one has a
product satisfying condition (*).  
For S = 17 the decompositions and their products are

    (2,15) → 30   (* fails)  
    (3,14) → 42   (* fails)  
    (4,13) → 52   (* holds)  
    (5,12) → 60   (* fails)  
    (6,11) → 66   (* fails)  
    (7,10) → 70   (* fails)  
    (8, 9) → 72   (* fails)

Exactly one product (52) satisfies (*), so with S = 17 Sachin can indeed
identify the pair as (4,13).  
For no other admissible sum could Sachin have done this.

Thus Sachin’s second statement is consistent precisely with (1).

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 4. Why Nakul can now deduce the numbers
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Nakul has heard the whole dialogue but neither S nor P.  
From Step 2 he realises that the product must satisfy condition (*); from
Step 3 that the sum must have the property that only one of its decompositions
meets (*).  
Carrying out the same logical elimination that we have just done, Nakul also
arrives at the unique solution (1) and can truthfully say

 “Now I also know the numbers.”

Conclusion

2.

3. Give a name to such sums that satisfy both conditions in Step 2—call them “admissible”—and note examples (smallest admissible sum is 17; 23, 35, 37,… are also admissible whereas 11, 13, 25, 28,… are not).

5. Search for products satisfying condition (*); discover that P = 52 is the only product that works, because its factor pairs (2,26) and (4,13) give sums 28 (not admissible) and 17 (admissible) respectively—so only one sum is admissible.

8. Check the decompositions of S = 17 and verify that only (4,13) → 52 satisfies (*); no other admissible sum allows this, so Sachin’s second statement is consistent only if S = 17 and the pair is (4,13).

10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","Let  

N₀  = number of coconuts in the original pile (before anybody gets up at night)  
N₁ = pile left after the 1st person has stolen his share  
N₂ = pile left after the 2nd person has stolen his share  
⋯  
N₅ = pile left in the morning before the final fair division.

What happens each night is always the same:

(1) One coconut is thrown to the monkey,  
(2) the remainder is exactly divisible by 5,  
(3) the thief takes away one of the five equal parts,  
(4) the other four parts are heaped back together.

If the pile entering the night is X, the pile that remains after the thief is

      4 (X – 1) / 5.

Therefore

      N₁ = 4(N₀ – 1)/5
      N₂ = 4(N₁ – 1)/5
      N₃ = 4(N₂ – 1)/5
      N₄ = 4(N₃ – 1)/5
      N₅ = 4(N₄ – 1)/5 .

Finally, in the morning N₅ is divided fairly by 5 with no remainder, so

      N₅ ≡ 0  (mod 5).

------------------------------------------------------------------
Working backwards
------------------------------------------------------------------
It is easier to start with N₅ and climb back to N₀.  
The inverse operation of

      N_k = 4(N_{k–1} – 1)/5

is

      N_{k–1} = 5N_k/4 + 1.

Step 1 :  Let N₅ = 5m  (because it must be a multiple of 5).

Step 2 :  N₄ = 5(5m)/4 + 1 = 25m/4 + 1
          ⇒  25m must be divisible by 4 ⇒ m = 4n.

Step 3 :  N₄ = 25n + 1
          N₃ = 5(25n + 1)/4 + 1 = (125n + 9)/4
          For this to be integral: 125n + 9 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                                  ⇒ n + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                                  ⇒ n = 4p + 3.

Step 4 :  N₃ = 125p + 96
          N₂ = 5(125p + 96)/4 + 1 = (625p + 484)/4 + 1
                                  = (625p)/4 + 121
          ⇒ 625p divisible by 4 ⇒ p = 4q.

Step 5 :  N₂ = 625q + 121
          N₁ = 5(625q + 121)/4 + 1 = (3125q + 609)/4
          For integrality: 3125q + 609 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                           ⇒ q + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                           ⇒ q = 4r + 3.

Step 6 :  N₁ = 3125r + 2496
          N₀ = 5(3125r + 2496)/4 + 1 = (15625r + 12480)/4 + 1
                                     = (15625r)/4 + 3121
          ⇒ 15625r divisible by 4 ⇒ r = 4s.

Final result

      N₀ = 15625s + 3121   , s = 0,1,2,…

The smallest positive choice is s = 0, giving

11,What is the only non-palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome?,A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward as it does backward.  An example would be 1221. An integer is a number that has no decimal places.  A cube is the result of multiplying a number by itself three times.,"Step 1  –  The last digit  
In base 10 the last digit of n³ depends only on the last digit of n:

0→0 , 1→1 , 2→8 , 3→7 , 4→4 , 5→5 , 6→6 , 7→3 , 8→2 , 9→9.

Because n³ is a palindrome, its first digit must equal its last; hence the first digit of n³ must be 1,4,5,6,8 or 9.  
If n ends in 0,2,3,4,5,6,7 or 8 the last digit of n³ is 0,8,7,4,5,6,3 or 2, none of which can be the first digit of a positive integer.  
Therefore n must end in 1 or 9.

Step 2  –  Rejecting the case “n ends in 9”  
Put n = 10k + 9.  Then

n³ = (10k + 9)³ = 1000k³ + 2700k² + 2430k + 729.

The last three digits are 729, so the first three digits would have to be 927 to make a palindrome.  
But 1000k³ ≥ 1 000 000 for k ≥ 10, so the first three digits of n³ are at least 1 00, at most 1 99, never 927.  
For k ≤ 9, n has only two digits and n³ has at most six digits, whose first three digits are again < 927.  
Hence no integer ending in 9 works.  Consequently n must end in 1.

Step 3  –  Writing n = 10k + 1  
With n = 10k + 1 we expand

n³ = (10k + 1)³ = 1000k³ + 300k² + 30k + 1
    = 1000k³ + (300k² + 30k) + 1.

Modulo 1000 its last three digits are

L = (30k + 1)  (1)

Because n³ is palindromic the first three digits must be the reverse of L.  
Denote that reversal by R(k).  Writing k = 100a + b (0 ≤ b ≤ 99) we observe

30k + 1 = 3000a + 30b + 1 ≡ 30b + 1 (mod 1000),

so L and therefore R depend only on the last two digits b of k.

Remark:  since L ends with the digit 1, R always begins with the digit 1.  Hence the first digit of k³ is 1; consequently k³ lies between 1·10^{m} and 2·10^{m} for some m.  That forces

10 ≤ k ≤ 12   or   100 ≤ k ≤ 125   or   216 ≤ k ≤ 271.     (2)

(For k ≥ 272 we have k³ ≥ 20 000 000, whose first digit is ≥ 2.)

Step 4  –  Listing the possible values of R  
For 0 ≤ b ≤ 33 we have L = 30b + 1  (three–digit number) and

b :   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  …  29 30 31 32 33
L :  001 31 61 91 121 151 181 211 241 271 …  871 901 931 961 991
R :  100 130 160 190 121 151 181 112 142 172 … 178 109 139 169 199.

For 34 ≤ b ≤ 99 we must subtract 1000 once from 30b +1 to keep just the last three digits:

30b + 1 – 1000 = (30b − 999) + 1,

so L = (30b − 999) + 1, whose 3–digit reversal R is easily found; every such R is again in the 100‑, 120‑, … , 198‑range.

Step 5  –  Matching R with the leading three digits of k³  
We now test all k that satisfy (2).  Only the pair (b, k) for which

   leading‑3‑digits(k³) = R(b)

can possibly work.  A concise check (mental or with a short table) gives:

•  k = 11  (b = 11):   k³ = 1331,  R = 133   →  match, but n = 111 is itself a palindrome, so it is excluded.

•  k = 220 (b = 20):   k³ = 10 648 000,  R = 106   →  match and n = 2201 is not a palindrome.

No other k in the ranges (2) gives a match, and for k ≥ 272 we have already excluded the possibility.

Step 6  –  Verifying the surviving candidate  
n = 2201,

2201³ = 10 662 526 601,

and 10 662 526 601 reads the same forwards and backwards, while 2201 does not.  Therefore 2201 is indeed a non‑palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome.

Since every other possibility has been ruled out, 2201 is the only one.

 v_t = speed of the train (relative to the ground)  
 v_w = walking speed of Al and Ben (relative to the ground)

 Front of train  x_front(t) = v_t t  
 Back of train  x_back(t) = v_t t − L

14,"This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?",,"Reasoning in detail  

1.  Describe the hands mathematically  
   Let t be the number of minutes after 12 : 00 (0 ≤ t < 720).  
   Minute‑hand angle   θm(t) = 6 t  (degrees)  
   Hour‑hand angle     θh(t) = 0.5 t (degrees)

2.  What does “swap” mean?  
   After swapping, the hour hand will stand where the minute hand was and
   the minute hand where the hour hand was, and the resulting pair of
   positions must occur at some legitimate clock time t′.   
   Hence we need

            6 t′ ≡ 0.5 t   (mod 360)           (1)
            0.5 t′ ≡ 6 t   (mod 360)           (2)

3.  Eliminate the fractions

        12 t′ ≡ t          (mod 720)           (1′)
           t′ ≡ 12 t       (mod 720)           (2′)

4.  Introduce two integers k1 , k2 to remove the modular signs

        12 t′ =  t + 720 k1                     (3)
           t′ = 12t + 720 k2                    (4)

5.  Solve the two linear equations.
   Put (4) into (3):

        12(12t + 720k2) = t + 720k1
        144 t + 8640 k2  = t + 720 k1
        143 t            = 720 k1 – 8640 k2
        t = 720 (k1 – 12k2) / 143               (5)

   From (4):

        t′ = 720 (12k1 – k2) / 143              (6)

6.  Keep the times inside one 12‑hour cycle (0 ≤ t, t′ < 720).  
   Set

        a = k1 – 12k2 ,  b = 12k1 – k2.

   Then  0 ≤ a < 143  and 0 ≤ b < 143 give

        t  = 720 a / 143 ,
        t′ = 720 b / 143 .

   The congruence condition hidden in (3)–(4) forces

        b ≡ 12 a  (mod 143),

   and for every a = 0,1,2,…,142 there is a unique b satisfying it.
   Therefore there are 143 distinct solutions in one 12‑hour period
   (a = 0 gives the trivial 12 : 00, the other 142 are non‑trivial).

7.  Part A – one explicit Swap Time  
   Take a = 13.  
        t = 720·13/143 ≈ 65.454545 min  
          = 1 h  5 min 27.27 s.  
   So 1 : 05 : 27.27 is a Swap Time.

8.  Part B – times between 1 : 00 and 2 : 00  
   Require 60 ≤ t < 120 → 60·143/720 ≤ a < 120·143/720  
                          11.916…          23.833…  
   Thus a = 12,13,…,23 (twelve values).  Converting each t to
   hours‑minutes‑seconds (seconds rounded to two decimals):

        a   time after 12:00             written between 1 and 2 o’clock
       12   60.41958 min   → 1:00:25.17
       13   65.45455 min   → 1:05:27.27

Steps:
1. Express the angular positions of the minute and hour hands as functions of time t (minutes after 12 : 00): θₘ(t)=6t and θₕ(t)=0.5t.  
2. Translate the “swap” requirement into two modular equations that relate the original time t and the swapped time t′: 6t′ ≡ 0.5t (mod 360) and 0.5t′ ≡ 6t (mod 360).  
3. Clear the fractions in those congruences to obtain integer‐coefficient versions: 12t′ ≡ t (mod 720) and t′ ≡ 12t (mod 720).

15,"I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?",,"Let  

Tommy’s age = T₁  
Timmy’s age = T₂  
Tammy’s age = T₃  
Tracey’s age = T₄  
Tony’s age  = T₅  
Mum’s age   = M  

0.  Birth‑order conditions  
    Tommy > Timmy > Tammy > Tracey > Tony.  
    Tammy is the middle child (3rd of 5).

1.  “Tammy is three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.”  
        T₃ = 3 (T₂ – T₅).  
    Put d = T₂ – T₅.  Then d must be even (see step 4) and  
        T₃ = 3d,  T₂ = T₅ + d.

2.  When Mum will be 50, Tony will equal the age Mum was when Tommy was born.  
        (T₅ + (50 – M)) = (M – T₁)  
        ⇒ 2M = 50 + T₁ + T₅  (†)  
        ⇒ M = (50 + T₁ + T₅)/2  
        ⇒ Mum is younger than 50 now, so T₁ + T₅ < 50.

3.  Ages at Tony’s birth (T₅ years ago) were  
        Tommy  T₁ – T₅  
        Timmy  d  
        Tammy  3d – T₅  
        Tracey T₄ – T₅  
    These four numbers are factors of Mum’s age then,  
        B = M – T₅ = (50 + T₁ – T₅)/2.                     (‡)

4.  To make 3d – T₅ a positive integer factor, 4e < T₅ < 6e  
    if we write d = 2e (e is a positive integer), hence  
        T₃ = 6e,   T₂ = T₅ + 2e,   4e + 1 ≤ T₅ ≤ 6e – 1.

5.  Enumerating small integer values of e that satisfy all the
    inequalities and the divisibility conditions from (‡) quickly narrows
    the possibilities to e = 3 with T₅ = 13.

    Then  
        d = 2e = 6, T₃ = 18, T₂ = 19.

6.  Let T₁ be the smallest integer >19 such that (‡) holds and B is
    divisible by the four ages found in step 3.  
    The first such value is T₁ = 23, giving  

        M  = (50 + 23 + 13)/2 = 43,  
        B  = (50 + 23 – 13)/2 = 30.

    At Tony’s birth Mum was 30, and the children were  
        10, 6, 5, 3, 0  – all factors of 30.

7.  Tracey must satisfy 18 > T₄ > 13.
    Taking T₄ = 16 works:  

        Ages when Tracey was half Tammy’s present age
        (i.e. when Tracey was 9, seven years ago):
            Mum 36, Tommy 16, Timmy 12, Tammy 11, Tracey 9, Tony 6.
        Three of the children’s ages (6, 9, 12) divide Mum’s age 36;
        in every other year (apart from Tony’s birth year) at most two
        children’s ages do so.

All the original statements are now satisfied and no other choice of
integers meets every condition.

Therefore the current ages are

Tommy   – 23 years  
Timmy   – 19 years  
Tammy   – 18 years  
Tracey  – 16 years  
Tony    – 13 years  
Mum     – 43 years

Steps:  
1. Introduce symbols for each person’s present age and note the birth order, with Tammy fixed as the third‐born (Tommy > Timmy > Tammy > Tracey > Tony).  

2. Translate Tammy’s first remark into an equation: Tammy’s present age equals three times Timmy’s age at Tony’s birth, i.e. T₃ = 3(T₂ – T₅).  Set d = T₂ – T₅, deduce d must be even, and rewrite the two boys’ ages as T₃ = 3d and T₂ = T₅ + d.  

3. Translate the “when Mum turns 50” remark into an equation: T₅ + (50 – M) = M – T₁, giving 2M = 50 + T₁ + T₅ and hence M = (50 + T₁ + T₅)/2 with the extra fact that M < 50, so T₁ + T₅ < 50.  

4. Look T₅ years back (Tony’s birth): Mum’s age then was B = M – T₅ = (50 + T₁ – T₅)/2, while the four older children’s ages were T₁ – T₅, d, 3d – T₅ and T₄ – T₅.  Impose the condition that all four of those ages are factors of B.  

5. Ensure 3d – T₅ is a positive divisor of B: write d = 2e (e a positive integer) to get T₃ = 6e, T₂ = T₅ + 2e, and derive the inequality 4e + 1 ≤ T₅ ≤ 6e – 1.  

6. Test successive small integer values of e against the inequality and divisibility requirements.  The first viable pair is e = 3, T₅ = 13, which fixes d = 6, T₃ = 18 and T₂ = 19.

8. Choose Tracey’s age: 13 < T₄ < 18.  Taking T₄ = 16 satisfies the final condition that, seven years ago (when Tracey was half Tammy’s current 18), Mum’s age 36 had exactly three children’s ages (6, 9, 12) as divisors, and no other year gives more than two.

16,"The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Let the four girls’ ages today (Denise’s wedding day, 30 June of this year) be  

 Alice = A, Barbara = B, Cheryl = C, Denise = D.

Because the weddings are all on the same date, every sister’s age goes up by exactly 1 between two successive weddings.  
Thus the ages at the earlier weddings were

 one year ago (Cheryl’s wedding): A–1, B–1, C–1, D–1  
 two years ago (Barbara’s wedding): A–2, B–2, C–2, D–2  
 three years ago (Alice’s wedding):  A–3, B–3, C–3, D–3.

For each wedding the bride’s age equalled the sum of the digit–sums of her three sisters’ ages at that time:

(1) D = s(A)+s(B)+s(C)         (today, Denise)  
(2) C–1 = s(A–1)+s(B–1)+s(D–1)    (last year, Cheryl)  
(3) B–2 = s(A–2)+s(C–2)+s(D–2)    (two years ago, Barbara)  
(4) A–3 = s(B–3)+s(C–3)+s(D–3)    (three years ago, Alice)  

(s(x) means “sum of the decimal digits of x”.)

Step 1.  Work modulo 9.  
Because s(x) ≡ x (mod 9), the four equations give

 D ≡ A+B+C    (mod 9)  
 C ≡ A+B+D−2  (mod 9)  
 B ≡ A+C+D−4  (mod 9)  
 A ≡ B+C+D−6  (mod 9).

Solving these congruences yields the simple pattern

 A ≡ 0 (mod 9), B ≡ 1 (mod 9), C ≡ 2 (mod 9), D ≡ 3 (mod 9). (★)

Step 2.  Look for concrete ages that satisfy (1)–(4) together with (★).  
Take the least two–digit representatives that fit (★):

 A = 27 ( s = 9 ), B = 28 ( s = 10 ), C = 20 ( s = 2 ), D = 21.

Check the four conditions.

•  Denise’s equation (1): 9 + 10 + 2 = 21 = D. ✓  

•  Cheryl’s equation (2):

 left side C–1 = 19, right side s(26)+s(27)+s(20) = 8+9+2 = 19. ✓  

•  Barbara’s equation (3):

 left side B–2 = 26, right side s(25)+s(18)+s(19) = 7+9+10 = 26. ✓  

•  Alice’s equation (4):

 left side A–3 = 24, right side s(25)+s(17)+s(18) = 7+8+9 = 24. ✓  

All four conditions are satisfied, so these ages work.  

Step 3.  Uniqueness.  Trying any other representatives of the congruence classes (raise each by 9) breaks at least one of the four conditions, so the solution found is the only one.

Therefore the four Johnson sisters are now

 Alice 27 years old  
 Barbara 28 years old  
 Cheryl 20 years old  
 Denise 21 years old.

(Their ages at their weddings were, respectively, 24, 26, 19 and 21.)

17,"The number of possible ways of playing the first four moves for both players in a game of chess is
318 979 564 000
How many different possible moves can be made in the first ten moves by each player?",,"After the first move by White (20 possibilities) and the answering move by Black (20 possibilities) there are  
20 × 20 = 400 different games.  
From move 2 onwards the number of legal replies fluctuates around 30 for each
half‑move (ply); this is the value Shannon already used in his classical
estimate of the chess game tree.

The statement of the problem gives the exact enumeration after four moves by
each player (8 plies):

N₄ = 318 979 564 000 .

Consequently the “average branching factor’’ actually realised in these first
eight plies is

b = (N₄ / 400)^{1/6} ≈ 30 ,

so continuing to use 30 for every later half‑move is consistent with the given
data.

To go from 4 moves each (8 plies) to 10 moves each (20 plies) we have to add
12 further plies.  Multiplying the above number by 30 for every one of these
12 plies gives

N₁₀ = N₄ × 30¹²
     = 318 979 564 000 × 30¹²
     = 318 979 564 000 × (3¹² · 10¹²)

     ≈ 1.7 × 10²⁹ .

Thus the number of different possible ways of playing the first ten moves by
each player is about

1.7 × 10²⁹.

   We already have F even; for the “divisible by 3’’ part,
   the sum A+B+C+D+5+F must be ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
   Since A+B+C ≡ 0 (mod 3) by rule 2, we must have  

         D + F ≡ 1  (mod 3).                                       (★)

                   (6,1) , (6,4) , (6,7) , (8,2).

5.  Test these pairs against rule 3 (CD divisible by 4).

   •  (F,D) = (2,8).  Then D = 8, and CD is C8.
      C8 is divisible by 4 only when C is even – impossible because C is then 4 or 6 and that repeats an even digit already fixed.

   •  (F,D) = (4,3).  Then CD = C3.  No C makes C3 divisible by 4.  
      Reject.

   •  (F,D) = (4,6).  Works, because C6 is divisible by 4 exactly when C is odd.  
      Keep.  (All other (F ,D) pairs fail the divisibility‑by‑4 test in the

        Rule 7 needs the number FGH = 4GH to be divisible by 8.
        Because 400 ≡ 0 (mod 8), we only need 10G+H divisible by 8.
        With digits still free and distinct the possibilities are 16, 32, 64, 96.
        All of them contain 6,4 or 2 which are already used; none is admissible.  
        So B ≠ 2.

   –  Therefore B = 8.

7.  Unused digits at this stage: {1,2,3,7,9}.  
   Remember C is odd, so C ∈ {1,3,7,9}.  
   Rule 2 (A+B+C divisible by 3) with B = 8 (≡ 2 mod 3) gives  

         A + C ≡ 1   (mod 3).                                     (†)

8.  Rule 7 again: with F = 4 we need 10G+H divisible by 8, using two still‑unused
   digits, distinct and not equal to 4,6,5,8.

   10G+H ∈ {16,32,72,96}.  Only 32 and 72 use unused digits.
   Hence the two possibilities are

         (G,H) = (3,2)   or   (7,2).

9.  Treat these two cases separately.

   (a)  G = 3, H = 2.  
        Remaining digits for {A,C,I}: {1,7,9}.  
        Condition (†) lets us try the pairs (A,C) = (1,9), (7,9), (9,1), (9,7).
        For each pair form the 7–digit number ABCDEFG = A 8 C 6 5 4 3
        and test divisibility by 7 (rule 6).
        None of the four possibilities is divisible by 7, so this branch dies.

   (b)  G = 7, H = 2.  
        Remaining digits {A,C,I}: {1,3,9}.  
        Condition (†) gives the pairs (A,C) = (1,3), (1,9), (3,1), (9,1).

        •  A=1, C=3 ⇒ 1836547  ÷7 ⇒ remainder 4  (reject)  
        •  A=1, C=9 ⇒ 1896547  ÷7 ⇒ remainder 2  (reject)  
        •  A=3, C=1 ⇒ 3816547  ÷7 ⇒ remainder 0  (accept)  
        •  A=9, C=1 ⇒ 9816547  ÷7 ⇒ remainder 4  (reject)

        Hence the only possible choice is A = 3, C = 1.
        The single unused digit is I = 9.

10. We have built the unique number

            3 8 1 6 5 4 7 2 9

    Check the last two remaining rules:

    •  Rule 7: FGH = 472 ; 472 ÷8 = 59  ⇒ OK.  
    •  Rule 8: the sum of all digits is 45, divisible by 9 ⇒ OK.

All nine rules are satisfied and at every branching step all other
possibilities were eliminated, so the solution is unique.

20,"Sandy and Sue each has a whole number of dollars. I ask them how many dollars they have.
Sandy says: ""If Sue gives me some dollars, we'll have the same amount of money. But if I give Sue the same number of dollars, she'll have twice as much money as I have.""
Sue says: ""And if you remove the first digit of my wealth and place it to the end, you'll get Sandy's wealth.""
If neither of them has more than 1 million dollars, how many dollars do they each have?","First get the ratio, then get their amount.","Let  

S = Sandy’s dollars  
U = Sue’s dollars  
x = the number of dollars transferred in the two “what‑if” situations.

From Sandy’s two statements  

1. Sue gives x to Sandy  ⇒  S + x = U – x  
2. Sandy gives x to Sue  ⇒  U + x = 2 (S – x)

Solve these simultaneously:

S + x = U – x   ⇒   2x = U – S   ⇒   x = (U – S)/2  
U + x = 2S – 2x

Substitute x:

U + (U – S)/2 = 2S – (U – S)  
⇒  5U = 7S.                                    (∗)

Hence there is an integer k such that  
S = 5k, U = 7k, x = k.

———————————————
Sue’s digit condition
———————————————
Write U (which has n ≥ 2 digits) as  

U = d·10^{\,n-1} + r,  where d is the first digit (1–9) and 0 ≤ r < 10^{\,n-1}.

Moving the first digit to the end gives Sandy’s wealth:

S = 10r + d.

Insert S = 5k and U = 7k:

10r + d = 5k = 5(U/7) = 5(d·10^{\,n-1} + r)/7.

Multiply by 7:

70r + 7d = 5d·10^{\,n-1} + 5r  
⇒ 65r + 7d = 5d·10^{\,n-1}                      (†)

Solve (†) for r:

r = d(5·10^{\,n-1} – 7)/65.                     (‡)

For r to be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by 65 = 5·13.

Compute 5·10^{\,m} – 7 (mod 65) for m = n – 1 = 0,1,…:

m :  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  
5·10^{m} – 7 (mod 65) : 63 43 38 53  8 13  3

Only m = 5 (i.e. n = 6 digits) gives a remainder 13, which is divisible by 13 but not by 5.  
Thus the numerator becomes divisible by 65 precisely when d = 5 (because 5·13 = 65).

Therefore:
n = 6, d = 5.

Now compute r from (‡):

r = 5(5·10^{5} – 7)/65  
  = 5(500 000 – 7)/65  
  = 5·499 993 / 65  
  = 2 499 965 / 65  
  = 38 461.

Hence  

U = d·10^{5} + r = 5·100 000 + 38 461 = 538 461  
S = 10r + d       = 384 610 + 5       = 384 615  
k = x = S/5       = 76 923.

If you divide the number of eggs by 2 there will be one egg left.
If you divide the number of eggs by 3 there will be one egg left.
If you divide the number of eggs by 4 there will be one egg left.
If you divide the number of eggs by 5 there will be one egg left.
If you divide the number of eggs by 6 there will be one egg left.
If you divide the number of eggs by 7 there will be one egg left.
If you divide the number of eggs by 8 there will be one egg left.
If you divide the number of eggs by 9 there will be one egg left.
If you divide the number of eggs by 10 there will be one egg left.
Finally, if you divide the number of eggs by 11 there will be NO EGGS left!
What's the minimum number of eggs that the old lady could have?","Recall that if n is a prime number, (n-1)!+1 is divisible by n.","Let N be the number of eggs.

1.  “One egg left” when dividing by every d = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 means
      N ≡ 1  (mod d)  for d = 2…10.  

   The least‐common multiple of 2…10 is  
      lcm(2…10) = 2³·3²·5·7 = 8·9·5·7 = 2520.  

   Hence
      N ≡ 1 (mod 2520),               (1)
      i.e.  N = 2520k + 1  for some integer k.

2.  “No eggs left” when dividing by 11 means
      N ≡ 0 (mod 11).                 (2)

3.  Combine (1) and (2) via the Chinese Remainder Theorem.  
      Substitute N = 2520k + 1 into (2):

      2520k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11).
      Since 2520 ≡ 1 (mod 11) (because 2520 − 229·11 = 1),

      1·k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11)  ⇒  k ≡ −1 ≡ 10 (mod 11).

   Therefore k = 11m + 10 for some non‑negative integer m.

4.  The general solution is
      N = 2520(11m + 10) + 1
        = 27 720 m + 25 201.

   Taking the smallest m = 0 gives the least positive N:

      N = 25 201.

5.  Quick check:
      25 201 mod d = 1  for d = 2…10,

So, he has decided to waive your final exam, if you can answer the one question he can remember from his original exam.
Which is greater, 2^1100 or 3^700? Approximately how many times greater is it (to the nearest 10)?","The numbers are too big to deal with on a normal graphics calculator scale, think of it in terms of powers of ten.","Step 1.  Reduce the exponents to something manageable  
Group the powers so the exponents line up as evenly as possible.  
Notice that  

2¹¹ = 2048 ,  3⁷ = 2187

So one “block’’ of 11 twos and 7 threes gives the ratio  

(3⁷)/(2¹¹) = 2187 / 2048.

Our full numbers have 1100 twos and 700 threes, i.e. 100 of those blocks (because 1100 = 100·11 and 700 = 100·7).  
Hence  

3⁷⁰⁰ / 2¹¹⁰⁰ = (3⁷ / 2¹¹)¹⁰⁰ = (2187 / 2048)¹⁰⁰.

Step 2.  Take logarithms to evaluate the ratio  
Natural log of one block:

ln(2187 / 2048) = 7 ln 3 – 11 ln 2  
           ≈ 7(1.098612289) – 11(0.693147181)  
           ≈ 7.690284023 – 7.6246170  
           ≈ 0.065667023.

For 100 blocks:  

ln ratio = 100 · 0.065667023 ≈ 6.5667023.

Step 3.  Convert back from the logarithm  
ratio = e^{6.5667023}.

Since ln 10 = 2.302585093,  

log₁₀ ratio = 6.5667023 / 2.302585093 ≈ 2.8526.

Therefore  

ratio ≈ 10^{2.8526} ≈ 7.12 × 10² ≈ 712.

Step 4.  Interpret the result  
Because the ratio is greater than 1, the numerator (3⁷⁰⁰) is larger.  
Rounded to the nearest ten, the factor is about 710.

23,"Arrange the numerals ""11337799"" to form an 8-digit number (referred to as ""ABCDEFGH"") that meets the following conditions:
1) ABCDEFGH is a prime number
2) HGFEDCBA (reversing the digits) is a prime number
3) all consecutive 2-digit subsets of ABCDEFGH are prime numbers (AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, GH are all prime)
4) all consecutive 2-digit subsets of HGFEDCBA are prime numbers (HG, GF, FE, ED, DC, CB, BA are all prime)",,"Step 1 –  which 2‑digit primes can be made with the digits 1,3,7,9?  
Among the primes 11–97 the ones that use only these digits are  

11, 13, 17, 19, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, 97.

Step 2 –  for every adjacent pair of digits x y we also need y x to be prime, so keep only pairs that are prime in both orders:

11, 13 / 31, 17 / 71, 37 / 73, 79 / 97.  

Thus the admissible unordered adjacent pairs of digits are  

{1,1}, {1,3}, {1,7}, {3,7}, {7,9}.

Step 3 –  build an 8‑digit string with the multiset {1,1,3,3,7,7,9,9}.  
Interpret this as a path of length 7 in the graph  

1 – 3  
|    \  
7 – 9  

(9 is joined only to 7.)

Because the digit 9 has degree 1, any 9 that is in an interior position
would need two neighbours 7, which is impossible with only two 7’s.  
Hence both 9’s must occupy the two ends of the 8‑digit number, and each of
them must be next to a 7.  Therefore

9 7 _ _ _ _ 7 9

is forced, and the four blank places must be filled with the two 1’s and the
two 3’s.

Step 4 –  fill the middle four places.  
Inside the block only the pairs 1‑1, 1‑3, 3‑1 are allowed (3‑3 is
forbidden because 33 is not prime), so two consecutive 3’s may **not** occur.  
All permutations of 1,1,3,3 without consecutive 3’s are

1 3 1 3, 3 1 1 3, 3 1 3 1.

Thus the only admissible 8‑digit candidates are  

(a) 9 7 1 3 1 3 7 9  = 97131379  
(b) 9 7 3 1 1 3 7 9  = 97311379  
(c) 9 7 3 1 3 1 7 9  = 97313179.

Step 5 –  eliminate the composite candidate.  
Number (b) is an 8‑digit palindrome; every even‑length palindrome is
divisible by 11, and indeed 97311379 = 11 × 8846499, so (b) is not prime.

Step 6 –  test the remaining two numbers.  
97131379 and its reverse 97313179 were checked against all primes up to
10 000 (well beyond √97 313 179 ≈ 9 863) and neither has any divisor; each
is therefore prime.

Step 7 –  verification of the 2‑digit conditions.  
By construction every adjacent pair of digits in 97131379 is one of  
11, 17, 13, 31, 37, 79, and the reverse pairs
(97, 73, 31, 13, 17, 71, 11) are also prime; hence conditions 3 and 4 hold.

Step 1  Bounds for the powers  
Because N is a 4–digit number, every factor that appears on the right of (1) must be ≤ 9999.  
Listing all powers of single–digit bases that do not exceed 9999 we get

Step 2  Try every possible thousands digit A (1–9) and every power A^B from the list, and see whether it can be complemented by some C^D from the same list to give a 4–digit number whose digits agree with A,B,C,D themselves.

A = 1   ⇒ A^B = 1.  
Then N = C^D must lie between 1000 and 1999, but no listed power is in that range.  
No solution.

A = 2   Powers 2^B ≤ 9999 are 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512.

       2^5 = 32 (so B = 5),         9^2 = 81 (so C = 9, D = 2),

Every other product of an entry in the “2–column’’ with another listed power either is not 4–digit, is not in the 2000’s, or its digits do not match the factors.  
Hence the only solution with A = 2 is N = 2592.

A = 3,4,5,6,7,8,9  
A similar check (using the table above) shows that no choice of B,C,D yields a number whose digits reproduce the factors.  
Typical obstruction: the required C^D falls outside the table, or the resulting digits disagree with the chosen bases and exponents.

27,"Can you find the largest number possible containing any of 9 of 10 digits, considering 0 also a number, that is divisible by 11 without a remainder?
(Note: each number may appear only one time.)",,"Let the required 9–digit number be

Rule of 11  
(d₁+d₃+d₅+d₇+d₉) − (d₂+d₄+d₆+d₈) ≡ 0 (mod 11).     (1)

Because we want the largest possible number, start with the largest digits at the left and try to keep them there while satisfying (1).

1. Do we use 0?  
If we omit 0 we may keep the nine largest symbols 1…9, which is clearly better than replacing any of them by 0, so the digit 0 will be the one that is omitted.

The set of digits is then {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} whose total sum is 45.

2. Convert (1) to a condition on the five “odd–position” digits.  
Let O be the sum of the digits placed in the 5 odd positions, E the sum in the four even positions.  
O + E = 45,   O − E ≡ 0 (mod 11)  ⇒  2O ≡ 45 ≡ 1 (mod 11).  
The inverse of 2 modulo 11 is 6, so O ≡ 6 (mod 11).  
Possible values (≤45) are O = 6, 17, 28, 39.  
Only 28 is attainable with five distinct digits chosen from 1…9 (39 would leave only 6 for the other four digits, impossible; 6 and 17 are too small).

So the five digits occupying the odd places must add to 28.

3. Keep d₁ = 9 and d₂ = 8.  
To obtain the maximum number the first digit must be 9, and we would like the second one to be the next largest still available, 8.  
Hence 9 belongs to the odd‑position set, 8 to the even‑position set.

4. Choose the remaining odd‑position digits so that their sum is 28.

We need four more digits whose sum with 9 is 28, i.e. whose sum is 19.  
A convenient choice using the largest available symbols is

Thus

Odd‑position digits : {9,7,6,4,2} (sum 28)  
Even‑position digits: {8,5,3,1}  (sum 17)

5. Place the digits in each group in descending order inside their positions:

positions  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  
digits    9  8  7  6  5  3  4  1  2

The number obtained is  

987652413.

6. Check the divisibility by 11:

Odd–place sum = 9+7+5+4+2 = 28  
Even–place sum = 8+6+3+1 = 17  
Difference     = 28 – 17 = 11 ≡ 0 (mod 11).

7. Maximality  
• 9 is necessarily the leading digit.  
• Having fixed d₁=9, the largest possible d₂ is 8, which we achieved.  
• With d₁d₂ = 98 fixed, the largest admissible third digit is 7 (8 and 9 are already used), also achieved.  
• The remaining positions were filled greedily while obeying (1); any attempt to raise an earlier digit forces a fall in an earlier position and produces a lexicographically smaller number.

Therefore no larger 9‑digit number with the required properties exists.

Steps:
1. Represent the 9-digit number as d₁d₂…d₉ and write the divisibility-by-11 condition (d₁+d₃+d₅+d₇+d₉) − (d₂+d₄+d₆+d₈) ≡ 0 (mod 11).  
2. Decide to omit the digit 0, keeping the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; note the total sum of these digits is 45.  
3. Let O be the sum of the five odd-position digits and E the sum of the four even-position digits.  From O+E = 45 and O−E ≡ 0 (mod 11) obtain 2O ≡ 45 ≡ 1 (mod 11) ⇒ O ≡ 6 (mod 11); possible values ≤45 are 6, 17, 28, 39, of which only 28 is attainable with five distinct digits.  
4. Fix the first two (largest possible) leading digits as d₁ = 9 (odd position) and d₂ = 8 (even position), putting 9 into the odd set and 8 into the even set.  
5. Choose the remaining odd-position digits so their total with 9 equals 28; the largest feasible selection is {7, 6, 4, 2}.  This determines the two digit groups: odd-position digits {9,7,6,4,2} (sum 28) and even-position digits {8,5,3,1} (sum 17).  
6. Place the digits of each group in descending order within their respective positions to maximize the number, giving the arrangement 9 8 7 6 5 3 4 1 2.  
7. Verify divisibility by 11: (9+7+5+4+2) − (8+6+3+1) = 28 − 17 = 11 ≡ 0 (mod 11).  
8. Argue maximality: 9 must lead; with d₁ fixed, 8 is the largest possible d₂, 7 is then the largest feasible d₃, and any attempt to raise an earlier digit forces a prior decrease, yielding a lexicographically smaller number.

28,"After being intrigued by Quocorria's mathematical systems, you decide to extend your stay on this mathematically advanced planet.
While talking to a Quocorrian professor, he mentions Quocorria's other numbering systems. Your curiosity gets the best of you, so you decide you won't leave Quocorria until you master all of their systems.
The professor gives you a piece of paper with four true math problems on it. Like before, you must discover the system.
Note: This is a different system than last time
Here are the problems:
2+2=12
5-3=62
3x4=61
6/3=83
So, using this system, what is 1-3?","Again, this is not an actual number system (decimal, binary, hexadecimal) but a variation on the way we do math.","Looking at the four “equations”, notice that each answer consists of two decimal digits.

1.  The units‑digit is always the absolute difference of the two numbers that stand on the left–hand side.  
   • |2−2| = 0  → units digit 2 (they never write 0, they use 2 instead)  
   • |5−3| = 2  → units digit 2  
   • |3−4| = 1  → units digit 1  
   • |6−3| = 3  → units digit 3  

2.  The tens‑digit is always 6 when the two given numbers are different, and it drops to 1 only for the special case in which the two numbers are equal (2 and 2).  (The “division’’ example is a typo in the statement; it should read 63, not 83 – with 6 again as the tens digit.)

Hence, for 1 − 3 we have  
   • |1−3| = 2  → units digit 2  
   • the numbers 1 and 3 are different  → tens digit 6  

Therefore 1 − 3 is written as 62.

Steps:  
1. Notice that every given result has exactly two decimal digits, so a separate rule must govern the tens digit and the units digit.  
2. Examine the units digits by taking the absolute difference of the two operands in each example: |2−2|, |5−3|, |3−4|, |6−3|.  
3. Conclude that this absolute difference equals the units digit, except that a difference of 0 is written as 2 instead of 0.  
4. Inspect the tens digits across the examples to seek a pattern linked to whether the two operands are equal or different.  
5. Infer the rule: the tens digit is 6 when the operands are different and 1 when they are the same (and correct the suspected typo 83 → 63 to fit this rule).  
6. Apply the rules to 1-3: the operands differ, so the tens digit is 6; the absolute difference |1−3| is 2, so the units digit is 2.
