0,"Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?
 Hint: To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.

Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,,True
1,"Question: What is the smallest integer such that if you rotate the number to the left you get a number that is exactly one and a half times the original number?
(To rotate the number left, take the first digit off the front and append it to the end of the number.  2591 rotated to the left is 5912.)

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)
10,15 (2,3)
So the five smallest numbers with this property are:
1176470588235294
2352941176470588
3529411764705882
4705882352941176
5882352941176470
Notice that 2352941176470588 can be rotated TWICE, yielding 1.5 times the number each time since the 4->6->9 n digits are in order.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let  

N  = d₁·10¹⁵ + A                (1)  

where  
• d₁ is the first digit (1 ≤ d₁ ≤ 9),  
• A is the 15–digit block formed by the remaining digits d₂…d₁₆  
  (0 ≤ A < 10¹⁵).  

After one left–rotation we obtain  

N′ = A·10 + d₁.                (2)

The condition in the problem is  

N′ = 3/2 · N .                 (3)

------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Translate the condition into an equation  

Substitute (1) and (2) into (3):

A·10 + d₁ = 3/2 ( d₁·10¹⁵ + A )

Multiply by 2 to clear the denominator:

20A + 2d₁ = 3d₁·10¹⁵ + 3A

17A + 2d₁ = 3d₁·10¹⁵

17A = d₁ ( 3·10¹⁵ – 2 ).      (4)

------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Note a useful divisibility fact  

Compute 3·10¹⁵ – 2 modulo 17.  
Because 10¹⁶ ≡ 1 (mod 17), we have 10¹⁵ ≡ 10⁻¹ ≡ 12 (mod 17).  
Hence  

3·10¹⁵ – 2 ≡ 3·12 – 2 ≡ 36 – 2 ≡ 34 ≡ 0  (mod 17).

So 3·10¹⁵ – 2 is divisible by 17.  
Let  

K = (3·10¹⁵ – 2)/17 = 176 470 588 235 294.     (5)

------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Solve for A  

From (4) and (5):

A = d₁ · K .                                    (6)

------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Impose the size restriction on A  

We need 0 ≤ A < 10¹⁵.  Since K ≈ 1.76×10¹⁴,

d₁·K < 10¹⁵  ⇒  d₁ < 10¹⁵ / K ≈ 5.66.

Hence d₁ can only be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  
Among these, d₁ = 1 gives the smallest integer.

For d₁ = 1,

A = 1·K = 176 470 588 235 294.                 (7)

------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Form the 16–digit number  

N = d₁ followed by A  
  = 1 176 470 588 235 294  
  = 1 176 470 588 235 294.  

------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Verify  

Rotate left: 1 176 470 588 235 294  →  176 470 588 235 2941.  
Compute 1.5 × N:

(3/2)·1 176 470 588 235 294 = 1 764 705 882 352 941,

which is exactly the rotated number 176 470 588 235 2941.

Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let

  Distinct digits summing to 13 that form a prime CD: only 67 (CD = 67).  
  Now A + B = E + F = 5.  Two distinct digits summing to 5 that form a prime AB: 41 (AB = 41).  
  Digits are all different, so the candidate number is

   N = 41 67 23 = 416723.

•  F = 9 → C + D = 7  
  Possible prime CDs are 61 or 43, but in every attempt AB cannot be made a prime of digit–sum 11 with unused digits.  
  No solution here.

Case E = 3 :  C + D + F = 24.  
EF can be 31 (F = 1) or 37 (F = 7).  Only F = 7 is feasible, giving C + D = 17.  
The only prime CD is 89, but then A + B = 10 cannot be made a prime with unused digits.  
So E = 3 impossible.

Hence the only possible number is  

  N = 416723.

Final answer: 416723",True
6,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?
 Hint: A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.

Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,,True
7,"Question: Find the radius of the inscribed and circumscribed circles for a triangle.
 Hint: Try to use the area of the triangle",Try to use the area of the triangle,"Let a, b, and c be the sides of the triangle. Let s be the semiperimeter, i.e. s = (a + b + c) / 2. Let A be the area of the triangle, and let x be the radius of the incircle.
Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.
We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).
The radius of the circumscribed circle is given by R = abc/4A.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Let the triangle have side lengths  

 a , b , c

1.  Express the area in two different ways.

   • With the inradius r: Δ = r · s (the area is “base × height/2” taken around the entire perimeter).

   • With the circumradius R: Δ = abc / (4R) (from the Law of Sines: a = 2R sin A, etc.).

2.  Solve each formula for the desired radius.

   Inradius  
  r = Δ / s.

   Circumradius  
  R = abc / (4Δ).

3.  If you prefer the radii only in terms of a, b, c, eliminate Δ with Heron’s formula  
  Δ = √[ s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c) ].

   Then  

  r = √[ (s − a)(s − b)(s − c) / s ],

  R = abc / [ 4 √{ s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c) } ].
