0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 12

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)
10,15 (2,3)
So the five smallest numbers with this property are:
1176470588235294
2352941176470588

5,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Ralph was impressed by the ingenuity of Rex's last attempt using clues involving prime numbers, but he thinks he's got an even better one for Rex. He tells Rex he's thinking of a 6-digit number.
""All of the digits are different. The digital sum matches the number formed by the last two digits in the number. The sum of the first two digits is the same as the sum of the last two digits.""
""Take the sum of the number, the number rotated one to the left, the number rotated one to the right, the number with the first three and last three digits swapped, the number with the digit pairs rotated to the left, and the number with the digit pairs rotated to the right. The first and last digits of this sum match the last two digits of the number, in some order.""
Ralph then asks, ""If each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs in the number is prime, then what is the number?""
Rex looks confused, and for a moment Ralph thinks he's finally gotten him. Then Rex smiles, scribbles a few things down on a pad of paper and then says, ""Very nice, Ralph!""
Rex then tells Ralph his number.
What did Rex say?
(See the hint for an explanation of the terminology.)","The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number. The digital sum of 247 is 2+4+7 = 13.
The digit pairs in 125690 are 12 56 90. These are also the numbers formed by the digit pairs.
Rotating 123456 one to the left gives 234561;
Rotating 123456 one to the right gives 612345;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the left gives 789056;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the right gives 905678.","416723
Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 9  

Steps:  
1. Label the digits A B C D E F.  Adding the six rearrangements  
   (ABCDEF, BCDEFA, FABCDE, DEFABC, CDEFAB, EFABCD) puts every one of the six digits in each column once, so every column adds to the digital sum S = A+B+C+D+E+F.  Writing S as the two-digit number XY, the grand total is XXXXXX0 + YYYYYY; its leading and trailing digits will be X and Y only when X+Y < 10.  

2. Because all digits are distinct, S lies between 15 (0+1+2+3+4+5) and 39 (4+5+6+7+8+9).  Each of the three two-digit blocks of the final number must be prime, so S itself must be prime; in this range the primes are 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37.  

3. The extra condition X+Y < 10 removes 19, 29, 37, leaving possible digital sums 17, 23, 31.  

4. Try S = 31 (XY = 31).  Then X+Y = 4, so both the first-two-digit pair and the last-two-digit pair must sum to 4 without repeating digits.  The only unused pair 0 + 4 cannot make a prime, so S ≠ 31.  

5. Try S = 17 (XY = 17).  To total 17 while containing 1 and 7 the six distinct digits would have to be {0,1,2,3,4,7}.  The second required pair would need to sum to 8 (1+7), but no remaining distinct pair does so, hence S ≠ 17.  

6. Therefore S = 23 (XY = 23).  The last two digits are 23, and the first two digits must sum to 2+3 = 5.  

7. Distinct pairs summing to 5 are 05 and 14.  05 is disallowed because the number may not start with 0, while 41 is prime, so the first two digits are 41.  

8. The remaining two digits must sum to 23 − (4+1+2+3) = 13.  The unused digits that do so are 5 + 8 or 6 + 7; only 67 forms a prime, so the middle two digits are 67.

6,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 13  

Steps:  
1. Rex observes that to get the floor area he first needs to know how many sides the house has, and that the only usable length given is the pipe, which equals one side of the property polygon.  

2. From “closest edge of the property = diameter of the foundation,” he deduces the property is a similar regular polygon circumscribed about a circle whose radius is three times that of the house-foundation circle.  

3. He recalls the formulas for the longest and shortest area-bisecting chords in a regular n-gon (different for even and odd n).  

4. He writes the standard right-triangle relations for a regular n-gon:  
   a = r cos(π/n), r = a / cos(π/n), s = 2a tan(π/n).  

5. Setting the house-foundation radius to 1 lets him express one property side as 6 tan(π/n) (because the property apothem is 3).  

6. He imposes the bisector condition: Max(n) ≥ 6 tan(π/n) ≥ Min(n) and, using the even-n formulas (which bound the odd-n case), rewrites it as 2 ≥ 6 tan(π/n) ≥ 2 cos(π/n).  

7. Solving 2 ≥ 6 tan(π/n) gives n ≥ π/atan(1/3) ≈ 9.8; testing n = 10 satisfies the full inequality, so the building and the lot are regular decagons.  

8. Because the fence goes around 9 of the 10 sides, 400 ft = 9 s_prop, so each property side (and the pipe) is s_prop = 400/9 ≈ 44.444 ft.  

9. Using s_prop = 2 a_prop tan(π/10) he finds the property apothem a_prop ≈ 68.393 ft, then its circumradius r_prop = a_prop / cos(π/10) ≈ 71.913 ft; the house-foundation radius is r_house = r_prop / 3 ≈ 22.798 ft.  

10. For the house decagon: a_house = r_house cos(π/10) ≈ 21.682 ft and s_house = 2 a_house tan(π/10) ≈ 14.090 ft.  

11. House-decagon area = 10·(s_house a_house / 2) ≈ 1,527.5 ft².  

12. The atrium radius is r_prop / 10 ≈ 7.191 ft, so atrium area = π · 7.191² ≈ 162.47 ft².

8,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""

Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 11  
Steps:  
1. Note that n − 1, n, and n + 1 cannot share any prime factors; therefore n must be even (otherwise both neighbors would be divisible by 2), so 2 is one of n’s prime factors.  

2. Because the sum of n’s three prime factors equals 1400 and one of them is 2, the other two primes p and q satisfy p + q = 1398.  The product p q is maximized when p = q = 699, giving an upper bound n ≤ 2·699·699 = 977 202.  

3. Each of n − 1 and n + 1 is a product of five distinct primes, so (n − 1)(n + 1) is at least the product of the first ten odd primes, 100 280 245 065.  Taking the square root gives a lower bound n ≥ ≈316 670.  Hence 316 670 < n < 977 202.  

4. The digital sum of every prime factor of n is prime; one of these sums is 2 and the others, coming from primes between 227 and 1398, cannot exceed 27.  Thus the product of the three digital sums is at most 2·23·23 = 1058, whose own digital sum is < 27 and prime.  Reversing that two-digit prime must give the digital sum of n, so DS(n) is one of 13, 17, 31, 37; only 31 fits all later requirements, so DS(n) = 31.  

5. Because the “middle two digits” are the only prime digits, n must have an even number of digits (hence six).  Those two middle digits themselves form a two-digit prime made solely of prime digits, leaving only 37 or 73 as possibilities.  

6. Let the first three digits have digital sum S.  S must be prime, its digital sum DS(S) prime, and DS(DS(S)) prime, restricting S to 7, 11, 23.  S = 7 fails because 403 is composite, so S is 11 or 23; correspondingly the last three digits must have digital sum 20 (if S = 11) or 8 (if S = 23).  

7. Case S = 11: the first three digits must start with 4, 6, 8, 9, end with 3 or 7, and sum to 11, giving 407, 443, 623, 803.  Only 443 is prime.  With middle pair 37 or 73, the last three digits must start with 7, end with 4/6/8, sum to 20, and have a non-prime fifth digit; the sole option is 794.  Candidate number: 443 794.  

8. Case S = 23: the first three digits possibilities are 887 or 977.  977 is rejected because its second digit (7) would be a forbidden extra prime digit, leaving 887, which is prime.  With middle pair 37 or 73, the last three digits must start with 3, end with 4/6/8, and sum to 8; only 314 works.  Candidate number: 887 314.  

9. Ralph therefore has narrowed n to two possibilities: 443 794 and 887 314.  

10. Rex adds that one of these is divisible by 13; checking divisibility shows 443 794 = 13 × 34 138, so that candidate is ruled out.  

11. The remaining candidate, n = 887 314, is even, has prime factors 2·487·911 with digital sums 2,19,11 (each prime), DS(n)=31, and its neighbors factor as 887 313 = 3·7·29·31·47 and 887 315 = 5·11·13·17·73, giving five unique primes on each side and altogether 13 distinct primes—matching every stated condition.

Because the sum of n’s three prime factors equals 1400 and one of them is 2, the other two primes p and q satisfy p + q = 1398.

9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?",,"The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Here, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is 52.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""

2. Observe that if the product whispered to Prashant were below 12 then it would have a unique factor-pair of integers > 1, so Prashant would already know the numbers; hence eliminate all such products and, indirectly, the sums that would produce them.  

3. Compile the “candidate–sum list’’: 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, … (all numbers not expressible as a sum of two primes).

10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 9

Steps:
1. Note that 5^5 = 3125 is the smallest number that can be divided exactly by 5 five times, so use it as a convenient starting candidate for the coconut pile.  
2. Declare 4 of those 3125 coconuts “rotten’’ and set them aside; the remaining 3121 coconuts will now leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, providing the required “extra’’ coconut for the monkey.

12,"In ""4+4+4+4=1!"" it was shown that just using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can form all the numbers from 0 to 9 using exactly four 4's.
For example: 7 = 4 + 4 - 4/4
Now if you add the operations square root, factorial, and exponent, what is the first number counting up from zero that can't be formed? How can each number be formed?
You may use parentheses, but you may not combine fours to make 44 or 444.
(An exponent is raising a number to the power of another number such as 4^4 = 256; a factorial is the product of all the integers from 1 to the integer such as 4! = 1x2x3x4 = 24.)",The first number that can't be formed is 39.,"The first number that can't be formed is 39. This isn't proved, so maybe you can figure out how to form 39.
There are several ways to form most of the numbers, here are some for the numbers 0 to 9 using just addition, subtract, multiplication and division:
0 = 4+4-4-4 = (4-4)*4+4
1 = (4/4)*(4/4) = (4*4)/(4*4) = (4+4)/(4+4) = (4/4)/(4/4)
2 = (4/4)+(4/4) = (4*4)/(4+4) = 4/((4+4)/4)

4 = (4-4)*4+4
5 = (4*4+4)/4

8 = 4+4+4-4 = (4/4)*4+4 = ((4+4)/4)*4 = 4*4-4-4
9 = 4+4+4/4
Here are some ways to form the numbers from 10 to 38 using the additional operators:
10 = 4+4+4-SQRT(4)
11 = 4!/SQRT(4)-4/4
12 = 4*(4-4/4)

14,"This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?",,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
To find all Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00, set i = 1 and check all values of j.
j = 0, s = 25.17482517, time = 1:00:25.17

Steps:  
1. Observe that any moment when the two hands coincide (e.g., 12:00, 1 :05 :27 .27…, etc.) remains unchanged if the hands are swapped; therefore all 11 “coincident-hand” times each 12-hour cycle are automatically Swap Times, with noon given as an example.  

2. Introduce variables: let H be the hour-hand angle (degrees from 12) and M the minute-hand angle. Note that the dial is divided into 12 equal 30-degree sectors.  

3. Express the “ordinary valid time” condition (Rule 1): within a given hour indexed by i (0–11), the hour-hand angle equals the starting sector plus the fraction traced by the minute hand, giving  
 H = 30·i + M/12.  

4. Express the additional “swap” condition (Rule 2): for a time to stay valid after exchanging the hands, the minute-hand angle must play the same role with respect to some sector j, giving  
 M = 30·j + H/12.  

5. Substitute the Rule 1 expression for H into Rule 2, simplify, and isolate M:  
 M = 30·j + 5i/2 + M/144 → (143/144) M = 30·j + 5i/2 →  
 M = (144/143)(30·j + 5i/2), with i, j = 0…11.  

6. Convert this angle to elapsed seconds within the current hour. Because the minute hand sweeps 360° in 3600 s (0.1°/s),  
 s = 10 M = 10·(144/143)(30·j + 5i/2).  

7. Specialize to the hour between 1 :00 and 2 :00 by setting i = 1 and letting j range from 0 to 11.  

8. Evaluate the formula for each j to obtain the 12 Swap Times in that interval (rounded to the hundredth of a second):

Observe that any moment when the two hands coincide (e.g., 12:00, 1 :05 :27 .27…, etc.) remains unchanged if the hands are swapped; therefore all 11 “coincident-hand” times each 12-hour cycle are automatically Swap Times, with noon given as an example.  \n\n2.

Express the additional “swap” condition (Rule 2): for a time to stay valid after exchanging the hands, the minute-hand angle must play the same role with respect to some sector j, giving  \n\u2003M = 30·j + H/12.  \n\n5.

15,"I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?",,"Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 13

Steps:
1. Set up the variables  
   • x = Mum’s age when she had Tommy (also Tony’s age when Mum turns 50)  
   • y = Tommy’s age when Tony was born  
   • z = Mum’s age when Tony was born  

2. Translate the “When Mum turns 50 …” clue into an equation: 2x + y = 50.

3. Note the relationship at Tony’s birth: x = z – y, and y must divide z because each child’s age then was a factor of Mum’s age.

4. Combine the two equations to obtain 2z = 50 + y.

5. Find integer pairs (z, y) with y|z that satisfy 2z = 50 + y; the only possibilities are (26, 2) and (30, 10).

6. Discard (26, 2) because 26 has too few factors; accept (30, 10).  
   ⇒ Mum was 30 and Tommy 10 when Tony was born.

7. Enumerate the remaining factors of 30 to give the other children’s possible ages at Tony’s birth:  
   • Timmy = 6, 5, or 3  
   • Tammy = 5, 3, or 2  
   • Tracey = 3, 2, or 1  

8. Use “Tammy is three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born” to turn those possibilities into Tammy’s current-age options: 18, 15, or 9.

9. Apply the next clue: the only other year with >2 child-age factors was when Tracey was half Tammy’s present age. Only Tammy = 18 makes Tracey half-age an integer (9), so Tammy is now 18.

10. In that second special year Tracey was 9, so Tony’s age then could be 6, 7, or 8, making Mum 36, 37, or 38.

11. Check which of those Mum-ages has >2 child-age factors; only 36 works.  
    ⇒ That year corresponds to Tony age 6 and Tracey age 3 at Tony’s birth.

12. Summarize ages at Tony’s birth: Mum 30, Tommy 10, Timmy 6, Tammy 5, Tracey 3, Tony 0.

16,"The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8

Steps:
1. Observe that any integer is congruent to the sum of its digits modulo 9 and label the sisters’ present ages a (Alice), b (Barbara), c (Cheryl), d (Denise).  
2. Translate each wedding-year condition into four congruences:  
   d ≡ a+b+c, c–1 ≡ (a–1)+(b–1)+(d–1), b–2 ≡ (a–2)+(c–2)+(d–2), a–3 ≡ (b–3)+(c–3)+(d–3) (all mod 9).  
3. Solve the system to get the present ages modulo 9: a ≡ 0, b ≡ 1, c ≡ 2, d ≡ 3 (mod 9).  
4. Shift three years back to Alice’s wedding, giving residues a–3 ≡ 6, b–3 ≡ 7, c–3 ≡ 8, d–3 ≡ 9 (mod 9).  
5. Examine feasible ages with those residues and realistic digit sums; the only workable choice is a–3 = 24 (digit-sum 7 + 8 + 9), so Alice is now 27.  
6. Move to Barbara’s wedding two years ago: Alice was 25, Cheryl’s residue forces a digit sum 9, Denise’s residue forces a digit sum 10 (reject the literal age 10 case), giving Barbara = 26 then and therefore 28 now.  
7. Consider Cheryl’s wedding last year with Alice 26 and Barbara 27; Denise’s residue allows digit sums 2 or 11. The 11 case leads to contradictions, so digit sum 2 is chosen, yielding Cheryl = 19 then and, consequently, Cheryl 20 and Denise 21 now.

Sandy says: ""If Sue gives me some dollars, we'll have the same amount of money. But if I give Sue the same number of dollars, she'll have twice as much money as I have.""
Sue says: ""And if you remove the first digit of my wealth and place it to the end, you'll get Sandy's wealth.""

Then X+Z=Y-Z and 2(X-Z)=Y+Z. Solving this we get X=5Z and Y=7Z.
According to Sue's statement, let A be the first digit of Sue's wealth, B be the remaining digits, and n be the number of digits, then Y=A*10^(n-1)+B and X=10B+A.

7*(10B+A)=5*(A*10^(n-1)+B)

Which is greater, 2^1100 or 3^700? Approximately how many times greater is it (to the nearest 10)?","The numbers are too big to deal with on a normal graphics calculator scale, think of it in terms of powers of ten.","3^700 is greater, by approximately 710 times (711.0220569 to be exact).
To start, one must realize these numbers are too big to deal with by hand. So, one must use exponents and the ""log"" function on a calculator.
2^1100=10^a
2^x=10^1
log(10)/log(2)=x
3.321928095=x
1100/x=331.1329952
2^3.321928095=10^1
2^(331.132995*3.321928095)=10^(331.132995*1)
2^1100=10^331.132995
Now that we know what 2^1100 equals, apply the same concept to 3^700.

3^(333.9848783*2.095903274)=10^(333.9848783*1)

2^1100=10^331.1379952
3^700=10^333.9848783
Obviously, 3^700 is greater. To figure out how much greater, requires a little more work, but not much.
First, subtract the exponents.
333.9848783-331.1379952

1. Recognize that the numbers are far too large to handle directly and decide to compare them by rewriting each as a power of 10 using common (base-10) logarithms.

34,"I just drilled straight through the center of a solid sphere, resulting in a 6cm long cylindrical hole. What is the volume remaining in the sphere?
Here are some formulas you may find useful:
Volume of sphere = (4/3)Pi(r^3)
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
Volume of cylinder = Pi(R^2)H
r = radius of sphere
h = height of cap
R = radius of hole (the cap and the cylinder share this radius)
H = height of cylinder (6cm)
The portion of the sphere that was removed can be thought of as a cylinder with a cap at both ends. A cap is flat on one side (touching the cylinder) and spherical on the other side (the original surface of the sphere)."," for a hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras, R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Hint for an easy solution:
Assume there is a real answer. Therefore, the answer does not depend on the radius of the hole (R). Use whatever value is easiest.","The volume is exactly 36Pi cm^3 (about 113.1 cm^3).
Hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras: R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Thus, R^2=r^2-(H/2)^2 and H=6, so R^2=r^2-9.
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
(replace R^2 and h with values computed above)

= (1/6)Pi(4r^3-18r^2+54)
= (2/3)Pi(r^3)-3Pi(r^2)+9Pi
Volume of cylinder = Pi(R^2)H
(replace R^2 with value computed above, and H with given value of 6)

Volume of sphere remaining = sphere - 2 caps - cylinder

= 36Pi
Easy solution:
Assume the hole is infinitely small (i.e. a radius of 0). Then, the volume of the cylinder (and the volume of the caps) is 0. The height of the cap is 0, so the radius of the sphere (r) is 3cm (half of the length of the cylindrical hole). Thus:

Steps:  
1. Relate the sphere’s diameter to the hole-and-cap assembly: 2r = H + 2h (with H = 6 cm), giving h = r − 3.  
2. Use the right-triangle cross-section through the hole: R² + (H/2)² = r², so R² = r² − 9.  
3. Write the general formula for the volume of one spherical cap: V_cap = (1/6) π (3R² + h²) h.  
4. Substitute R² = r² − 9 and h = r − 3 into V_cap and simplify the polynomial inside the parentheses.  
5. Finish the algebra to obtain V_cap = (2/3) π r³ − 3 π r² + 9 π.

8. Form the expression for material removed: 2 V_cap + V_cyl.  
9. Subtract that removal from the whole sphere: V_sphere − (2 V_cap + V_cyl), perform the cancellations, and obtain V_remaining = 36 π cm³.  
10. Provide an alternative “easy” viewpoint: let the hole’s radius approach zero so the cylinder and caps vanish.

35,"Mr. Math, or Sane, was hired by Nortel to design the dimensions for their building. He decided to make the building an open cylindrical area inscribed in a perfect cube.
But a tragic incident caused Sane to become sick and not be able to communicate! The only dimension that he had written down was for the corner office, 16 by 8 meters (which extends to the edge of the open area).
The construction workers can not start over now, as they've already begun building. But if they want to finish the Nortel building in time, they will need to know the final dimension of the perfect cube and cylinder! Can anyone here help them?
Alternate: If the construction workers became ambitious and decided to make all the offices out of solid wood, approximately how much would it cost them at $10 per m^3?",Formulate an equation where the hypotenuse of the two squared unknown distances will equal the radius of the building.,"Formulate an equation where the hypotenuse of the two squared unknown distances will equal the radius of the building.
(Since our answer only needs two dimensions, we will convert them into square (building), circle (open area), and rectangle (corner office).
[The Pythagorean theorem will solve for the root of the radius]
Let a represent the length of the rectangle, then x-a be the radius of the circle minus the length of the rectangle, same to b (to width of the rectangle):
a^2 + b^2 = x^2
(x - a)^2 + (x - b)^2 = x^2
x^2 = (x - 16)(x - 16) + (x - 8)(x - 8)
[Use foil to expand the brackets]
x^2 = (x^2 - 16x - 16x + 256) + (x^2 - 8x - 8x + 64)
x^2 = 2x^2 - 48x + 320
[Order as a quadratic equation]
x^2 - 48x + 320 = 0
[Factor the equation using the quadratic formula with X excluded]
Let a equal 1, b equal 48, and c equal 320 as temporary variables in the factoring equation:
x = -b{+/-}[b^2 - 4ac]^1/2 / 2a
x = -48{+/-}[2304 - 1280]^1/2 / 2
x = -48{+/-}32 / 2
x = -40    and     x = -8
[Input those numbers into the now factored equation]
(x - 40)(x - 8) = 0
If the radius were 8, then that would mean the corner office would end up extending into the circular area (because the corner office is 16 x 8).
Therefore, the diameter of the cylinder or the dimensions of the building must be 40 * 2 (radius x 2) to make 80m x 80m.
Alternate: The volume of the building is expressed by:
v = l * w * h
But remember, since the cylinder is open space, we need to figure it too.
The volume of the cylinder is expressed by:
v = pi(r^2) * h
Therefore, the volume of solid wood is the volume of the building less the empty area:
v = [l * w * h] - [pi(r^2) * h]
v = [80 * 80 * 80] - [pi(40^2) * 80]
v ~= 512 000 - 402124

Take 12³ = 1728 = 2⁶·3³; the minimal multiset of digits giving this product is {3, 8, 8, 9}, and the smallest number from these digits is 3889.  \n6. Compare the candidates: 3889 (for 1728) is smaller than 5558 (for 1000), and cubes larger than 12³ will only need at least as large digits or more of them, so the minimal original number is 3889.']"
42,"One day, a frustrated math teacher lost his patience with his students' non-stop chatting. Thus, he decided to give the ultimate hard problem:
Find the only positive integer number less than 20,000 that is also a sum of three positive integers, all containing exactly 7 factors.
There was a steady silence. Can you break the silence by figuring it out?","For the prime factorization of positive integer x, we get
x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:
[K(sub 1) + 1][K(sub 2) + 1]...
For example, the prime factorization of 228 is (2^2)(3^1)(19^1). 228 has 12 factors, since (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12.","16,418.
First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage. The only way to get 7 as the number of factors is 1 x 7. So the prime factorization of any number with 7 factors is n^6 times x^0, where n and x are both primes. But if you look, x^0, for all nonzero values of x, is 1! So, any number with exactly 7 factors must be a prime raised to the sixth power. This yields 2^6 +3^6+5^6 = 16418. Any prime 7 or greater to the sixth power is greater than 20,000.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 9

-has no zero
-has all different digits
-starts and ends with a single-digit prime or single-digit square number
-each pair of consecutive digits is a square or prime

The largest squime has at most eight digits, since it cannot contain
8 or 0. If we use 2, it must come first because no square or

46,"Patty O'Furniture, Kurt, & Rod were walking downtown when they spotted a forlorn friend staring at a small object in her hand.  She was propped against a wall, one foot off the ground.
""I know her,"" Patty said.  ""She looks like she could use some help.  I think she broke a heel off her shoe.""
Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.
""This is my sole sister,"" the girl groaned, ""with the obvious name.""
Kurt looked blank.  After a few seconds, Rod's face lit up.
""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""
""Right,"" she grumbled, ""and it tastes like recycled history essays?""
The three grinned broadly at her.  ""Try one,"" Kurt said, proffering one of the shrink-wrapped torpedoes.
Eileen shifted some of her weight back to the toe of the damaged right shoe and tentatively accepted the Rnkfurer.  She unwrapped it, took one bite, and saw her ecstatic grin reflected on the faces of the other three.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""We were about to go order more tomorrow.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""
Eileen got it right away.  ""So we each get 25 of them, and have 25% of the total.""
Rod grinned.  ""That's cheating.  We use different numbers.""
""Oh, all right.""  She thought for a few seconds.  ""So you can do it a few ways for two people, round off for three, but we couldn't do it for four.""
""Really?""  Rod wasn't as quick with the enlarged problem.  ""I'm not surprised, but that means we'll just have to buy in pairs.""
""Or change the rules a little,"" Eileen added.
""How so?""  Kurt was ready to do almost anything that would get a Rnkfurer refill.
""Well, how about if Kurt buys twice as many as Rod's percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt's percentage ...""
Kurt looked hopeful, Patty was expectant, and Rod's analytical gears were grinding.
""It's a big order, but we could do it,"" he finally declared.

Eileen	15
TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 12

1. Assign variables: let E, P, K, R be the numbers of Rnkfurers for Eileen, Patty, Kurt, and Rod; let T = R+K+P+E be the total.  

2. Translate the rule “Kurt buys twice as many as Rod’s percentage, Patty twice Kurt’s percentage, Eileen twice Patty’s percentage” into equations in terms of percentages of the total:  
  2·100·R/T = K, 2·100·K/T = P, 2·100·P/T = E.  

3. Rearrange each equation to isolate the earlier quantity:  
  R = K·T/200, K = P·T/200, P = E·T/200.  

4. Observe that the same multiplier T/200 links successive quantities and name it F; i.e. F = T/200.  
  Thus P = E·F, K = E·F², R = E·F³, and T = E(1 + F + F² + F³).  

5. Because each quantity equals four times a (proper) percentage, E + P + K < 200, so  
  E(1 + F + F²) < 200.  

6. Rule out F ≤ 1 (“cheating”), giving F > 1, which in turn implies K > P > E and E < 200/3.  

7. From E(1 + F + F²) < 200 derive an upper bound F ≤ 13.  

8. Impose integrality: F = numerator/denominator, K must be a multiple of the numerator², E a multiple of the denominator³; denominators of interest are at most 4 (because 4³ = 64 keeps E small enough).  

9. Perform a brute-force search over all rational F with numerator 1–13 and denominator 1–4 that satisfy both the inequality and the integrality conditions.  

10. Find that the only viable factor is F = 3 (numerator 3, denominator 1) together with the minimal integer E = 15.

47,"The knight left Breadland, and went to a neighboring kingdom named Cakeland. Cakeland is much similar to Breadland, but unlike Breadland, Cakeland is 12x4. Cakelanders like cake, as well as Breadlanders like bread.
The knight was on a square of Cakeland, he wanted to visit each square of Cakeland exactly once, and return to the square he was originally on. Each step, the knight moved to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but the queen can't reach.
The knight thought that since Cakeland has an even number of squares, he could achieve his goal this time.
However, the knight still failed.

48,"You are a scenery creator for plays and you have just been asked to create the Balcony for Romeo and Juliet.
The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The balcony is like so in order for the spot light (that shines at a 45 degree angle to the roof) will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony.
Pine is cheap at exactly $1 per 5000cm^3, tax included.
Exactly how much money will you spend to build the balcony?
Conversions:
100cm = 1m
2.54cm = 1inch","If the floor of the balcony is 4 meters from the ground, and the room is 7 meters, then the floor is 3 meters from the spotlight. If the spot light shines at a 45 degree angle and the spot light will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony, then the radius of the balcony floor will be 3 meters (if the hypotenuse of a triangle is at a 45 degree angle to the y axis (and the side x is 90 degrees to the side y), the side x will always equal the side y and the remaining side will be the hypotenuse of those [the rules of an isosceles triangle]).","[SEE HINT]
Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:
let a represent the height of the room, then b represent the height of the balcony off the floor, then f represent the thickness of the balcony floor, then r represent a-b or the radius of the balcony floor, then h represent the height of the fence.
V = {[pi(a-b)^2]f + [pi(r)h + pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h]}

Using this basic information and your imagination, determine the maximum number of rings that could be housed inside another ring with four, five, six and seven times the diameter.","I would say ""go and chop down your trees"" but Greenpeace people might sue me.","For 4D (four times the diameter) ring, place the 2D ring exactly at the center inside 4D, and you will have donut-shaped empty space with a width of a D ring, around the 2D. The number of rings to be fit in this vacancy, R, is determined from the formula
R < (n - 1)*pi

This formula is derived from the fact that the circumference of a polygon with R sides (made up by connecting all the nucleus of the rings in the donut area) is always smaller (actually is inscribed in) than the locus of the donut area. This locus is, of course, neither the donut's outer nor inner ring, but the one in between those two.

55,"There was a famous mathematician named Karl Friedrich Gauss. When he was young, he entered Gotinga University. One day he met an old professor, and spoke to him. They chatted, and the professor asked Gauss about his age.
Gauss said: ""The cube and the fourth power of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
The professor said: ""Very good. It's good coincidence because the square and the cube of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
How old was Gauss, and how old was the professor?","Eliminate the impossibilities, such as their ages can't end with 0.","Their ages can't end with 0, 1, 5 or 6, and must be either a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 9 minus 1 because the sum of its square and its cube or its cube and its fourth power is divisible by 9.

After which, Car 1 reached point B in another 9 hrs, and Car 2 reached point A in another 4 hrs. If both the cars maintained a constant speed throughout the journey, and the speed of Car 1 was 36 miles/hr(mph), then what was the speed of Car 2?",,"54 miles/hr.
Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).

They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.

""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.  What are the four quantities in the sequence?",You can leave out numbers that are primes (sum of proper divisors is 1) or the product of two primes (sum of divisors will be less than 100).  This will shorten your search somewhat.,"108, 172, 136, and 134.
Method:
This one really requires a brute-force approach.  The sigma function (sum of a number's divisors) does not lend itself to 3rd-order analysis (3 numbers past the first one).  Most of the remaining numbers will leave the 100-200 range on the first or second iteration.  I used a small computer program.  The only sequence that stays in bounds for 4 terms is the one given.

64,"The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with ""rock"", 2 points with ""scissors"", and 1 point with ""paper"".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one ""throw"", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.

Knowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?","(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.
(2) This is a ""zero-sum"" game: what one player wins, the other loses.
(3) The game is ""symmetric"": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.
(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 10  
Steps:  
1. Apply general game-theoretic reasoning: in a zero-sum, symmetric game an optimal mixed strategy can be public and still guarantees its user a fixed expected payoff.

3. Assign variables to the desired mixed strategy: R = probability of Rock, P = probability of Paper, S = probability of Scissors.  
4. Compute the expected payoff versus an opponent who always plays Rock: E = 0·R – 3·S + 1·P.

65,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
Assume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.

67,"Jack and Jill are climbing down a vertical wall.  They both use ropes hanging from the ceiling of a huge room.  They start at the same time from the top of the wall which is 16 meters tall.  The race is divided into two stages; the first 8 meters and the last 8 meters.  A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.

Jacks moves 0.8 meters vertically in each step movement:

Replacing A by the diagonally crossed distance, B by the distance between Jack's feet and C by the vertically climbed distance:

C = 0.8 m
Jill moves 1 meter vertically in each hop.

Steps:  
1. Use the Pythagorean theorem on Jack’s 1 m diagonal step with a 0.6 m horizontal spread to find his vertical drop per step: √(1² – 0.6²) = 0.8 m.  

2. Treat Jill’s 1.57 m hop as a half-circumference arc (½ · π · D); solving 1.57 · 2 = π · D gives D = 1 m, so Jill’s vertical drop per hop is 1 m.  

3. Simulate the first 1.5 min (three 15-s actions each):  
   – Jack: 3 steps → 3 × 0.8 = 4.8 m.  
   – Jill: 3 hops → 3 × 1 = 6 m and begins her 1-min rest.

   – Jack makes 4 more steps during Jill’s rest → +3.2 m, reaching 8 m.  
   – Jill is still at 6 m.  
   – Jill loses the first stage, incurs a 0.5-min penalty, and Jack now starts his own 1-min rest.

""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""
Assuming everything has integer weights, what were the two types of weights that Joseph suggested?",Try it out with small numbers. What is the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of 3s and 4s? The answer is 5. Try it out with other numbers. You'll find a pattern eventually.,"The two weights are 11 and 13.
If you played around with the hint, you'll realize that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of Xs and Ys is equal to (X-1)(Y-1) - 1.
We are told that the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of a combination of the two weights is 119.
Thus,
119 = (x-1)(y-1) - 1
120 = (x-1)(y-1)
From here, we only have to list 120's factors: (1,120), (2,60), (3,40), (4,30), (5,24), (6,20), (8,15), (10,12).  There are 8 possible combinations.
However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.
Try it out. You can't make 119 using only 11s and 13s but you can make 120 and above using only 11s and 13s.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 6

72,"You are on a bus with just two other mathematicians when you overhear them talking.
The first mathematicians says, ""I have a positive integer number of children, whose ages are positive integers. The sum of their ages is the number of this bus, while the product is my own age.""
The other person replies, ""How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?""
""No, you could not.""
""Aha! At last, I know how old you are!""
Apparently the second mathematician had been trying to determine the first mathematician's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
The bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.","There are multiple possible age combinations for the mathematician's children that would result in the same age as well as the same bus number otherwise the second mathematician can determine the ages of the children given the first mathematician's age and number of children.
Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't — he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10.

1. Interpret the dialogue: the first mathematician’s statement implies that, for the correct bus number B, there must be at least one pair (A = product, N = number of children) for which two or more different collections of children’s ages all sum to B and have that same product A and same N, so that the ages cannot be pinpointed even when A and N are known.  

2. Observe that such ambiguity cannot occur with fewer than three children, so N ≥ 3 and therefore B ≥ 3; specifically rule out bus numbers 1 and 2.

Hence every bus number below the eventual answer is eliminated.

77,"I always remember the days when I was at high school, whiling away my time with my friends. Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.
Considering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?
He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.",,"Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24
This is for 12 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =
24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.
Now let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.
Here H can take values from 0 to 23.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 0 to 7 i.e., 8 values, for H = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 0 to 5 i.e., 6 values, for H = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 0 to 4 i.e., 5 values, for H = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 10+10+8+6+5 = 39

We work exclusively with square cakes. The cakes come in sizes that are meant to be divided into a square number of square pieces. Each portion comes decorated with an ""X"" stretching to its corners, which makes it easy to cut the usual square pieces and also offer half and quarter portions.
These markings also help on Wednesday when we savor the previous week's success by dividing a cake equally amongst ourselves. Even when a good week deserves a 64-portion cake, we can each ceremonially make a single standard cut (straight and perpendicular to the plate), and we each go home with a single piece of cake.

Each triangular piece would have as its base one unit of the perimeter; the other two sides would be formed by cuts to the center of the cake.

83,"Oh no! Our flag has fallen down from the flag pole (stupid cheap string)! Quick, we need to figure out how much string we need to get it back up there...
The problem is, I don't remember its exact length!
All I can remember is that the pole was built to be exactly 14 times the height of the flag.
The flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system.
The string wraps evenly around the pole 4 times.
The string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag (the returning string is built into the pole).
The pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground.
Oh yes, and the diameter of the pole is 10cm.
So quickly! We don't have much time until everyone sees, how much string do we need?
Conversions:
100cm = 1m
2.54cm = 1 inch","The string covers 12 meters of distance in 4 rotations.
Use the Pythagorean theorem.","If the pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground and the flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system, then the flag must be 1 meter high. If the string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag and the flag pole is 14 meters in height, then the string must cover 12 meters in total (14-1-1).
If the diameter of the pole is 10cm and the height covered is 12 meters (1200cm), then, unwrapped in to a rectangle, it would be pi(10) (since the circumference of a circle is pi{d}) by 1200 cm rectangle.
If the string wraps around in 4 even rotations, that means the rectangle divided on the y plane into 4 equal sections would represent one rotation per section. Finding the hypotenuse of each section (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) would then yield the distance covered per rotation.

a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2
Therefore, in 4 rotations it would be the above * 4.
The final equation is thus expressed as:
let a represent the total height of the pole, then f represent the height of the flag, then rot represent the number of rotations, then p represent the height of the pulley, then d represent the diameter of the pole
s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ ({1400-100-100}/4) ^ 2 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ 90 000 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 1206.561796
Therefore, the string covers approximately 1206.561796 cm in 12 meters when there are 4 even rotations.

Steps:  
1. Note that the pulley is 1 m above the ground and the flag’s height equals that ground-to-pulley distance, so the flag is 1 m tall.  
2. Because the string only runs from the pulley up to the flag’s lower edge, the vertical distance the string must cover is: pole height 14 m – pulley height 1 m – flag height 1 m = 12 m.  
3. Convert this vertical distance to centimetres for later consistency: 12 m = 1200 cm.  
4. Find the pole’s circumference from its diameter (10 cm): C = π·d = 10π cm.  
5. “Unwrap” the helical path into a rectangle: height 1200 cm (vertical) and width 10π cm (one full turn around the pole).  
6. Because the string makes 4 even wraps, divide the rectangle’s height into 4 equal sections: each section’s height is 1200 cm ÷ 4 = 300 cm.  
7. For one wrap, model the path as the hypotenuse of a right triangle with vertical side 300 cm and horizontal side 10π cm; use the Pythagorean theorem: length per wrap = √(300² + (10π)²).  
8. Multiply this single-wrap length by the number of wraps (4) to obtain total string length.

2) Examine the equation “# × $ = &$” with & = 1, so &$ lies between 11 and 17.  Testing the few possible products of two different digits in that range shows only 3 × 5 = 15 fits.  Hence # = 3 and $ = 5.

   • ? + > + @ = 15  
   • \ + ^ + 1 = 15

4) From the first two equations, the four symbols \, >, ^ and % must be taken from {6, 7, 8, 9}, the only pairs that can sum to 15.  Thus each of those four digits appears exactly once.  

5) Use \ + ^ + 1 = 15 ⇒ \ + ^ = 14.  The only pair from {6, 7, 8, 9} that sums to 14 is {6, 8}.  Therefore \ and ^ are 6 and 8 in some order.  

6) Consequently the remaining two digits {7, 9} from the same set must be > and %, also in some order.  

7) The only unused digits now are 2 and 4, so ? and @ must be {2, 4} with ? + @ = 6.  

8) Apply ? + > + @ = 15.  Since ? + @ = 6, we get 6 + > = 15 ⇒ > = 9 (thereby fixing % = 7).  

9) Substitute > = 9 in \ + > = 15 to find \ = 6.  

10) With \ = 6 and \ + ^ = 14, deduce ^ = 8, confirming % = 7.

The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.

92,"You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?
(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)","ere is the profit made on each size (found using the information in the first few sentences):

(2): m > l > x > s
(3): 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650, divided by 25 gives...
(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186
(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186
Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.

Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.

You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).

95,"What three-digit number when doubled is, by value, one more than the value of the same three digits when reversed?
If this is too easy, go for extra points included with hint.","A wrongheaded guess would say 123, because 123 * 2 = 321 + 1.  The title hints you can easily go on to find for a ten-digit number that otherwise has same characteristics.","Answer-
397.
397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.
102?  Is 204 = 201 + 1?  No.
103?  Is 206 = 301 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds even.]
396?  Is 792 = 693 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds again.]
The answer given is the only one that passes.
As for extra points, an infinite number of 9's can be added between the 3 and the 7 without spoiling the major characteristics.

Steps:  
1. Represent the unknown three–digit number as 100a + 10b + c and translate the condition “double it equals the reversal plus 1” into the equation  
   (100a + 10b + c)·2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.  
2. Expand and collect like terms to obtain the single linear Diophantine relation  
   199a + 10b – 98c – 1 = 0.

96,"An iterative equation is one where an initial value is put into the equation to obtain a result, which is in turn put back into the equation as an input and the process is repeated for either a fixed number of times or until a final value is achieved (where you get the same number out as you put in).
For example, if you start with the iterative equation,
A{n+1} = 1/A{n} + 1
And you put in an initial value of 1, you would get 2 as the result.  Put the 2 back in as the input and you would get 1.5, and so on.

""Right you are! And how did you figure that out so quickly?"" Professor Gebra asked.
""You said the square of your ages when you and Professor Culus met had only three digits, so the oldest you could have been was 31. That means that there were only a few possible ages the two of you could have been. Those being (with the associated squares):

1. Note that the square of each professor’s age “when they met” has only three digits; therefore every possible age at that time must satisfy age² ≤ 999, i.e., age ≤ 31.  
2. Use the first clue (“the square of your age contained the same three digits as the square of my age, just in a different order”) to require two ages ≤ 31 whose squares are permutations of one another.  
3. Exhaustively list all such age pairs and their squares: (14, 31) → 196 & 961; (13, 31) → 169 & 961; (16, 25) → 256 & 625; (12, 21) → 144 & 441; (13, 14) → 169 & 196.

104,"Kurt & Rod were hanging around the window at school munching the last of their Rnkfurers hoard.  They spotted their neighbor lounging in the enclosed courtyard, looking hungry.
""Patty O'Furniture!  Good to see you!  Want a Rnkfurter?""
""A what?""
Kurt handed her the last he had.  She bit in, and her face lit up like a newly-coined metaphor.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""Rod and I were about to go order some more.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""  Patty's blank look bade him explain.  ""In our first batch, we got a total of 25 -- 20 for me, and 5 for Rod.  I had 20, and he had 20% of the total.""
""And you think you can do that for three people?  You get my percentage, and I get Rod's?  I don't think we can do it.""
Rod had been thinking about it, and rattled off three numbers to her.
""Those aren't right.  The last one isn't the right percentage; there's an added fraction.""
""So?  My mom says they're the same on her old phonograph speeds.""
Patty looked at Kurt, each waiting for the other to give an opinion.  Finally, she gestured at the empty wrapper in his hand.
""I'll round off a little for a week's supply of these.  Let's go!""
Since Rnkfurters come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, they had to leave 10 with the storekeeper to make the numbers work, but they got their munchies.
How many did each student get this time?","The old phonograph speeds were typically 16, 33-1/3, 45, and 78 RPM.","27 for Kurt, 30 for Patty, and 33 for Rod.
That's 30% for Kurt and 33-1/3% for Patty.
Method:
Let K, P, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, K+P+R.
Now, since Kurt's percentage equals Patty's quantity, we get
100*K/T = P.
Similarly,
100*P/T = R plus a fraction.  Now, look at the common factor, 100/T.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
K*F = P and P*F = R (plus a fraction),
and K*F^2 = R (plus a fraction).
The clue about the phonograph leaves us looking for a triple with 33 Rnkfurters for Rod, with Patty getting 33-1/3% (one-third) of the total.
P = T/3
P = (K+P+33)/3 -- remember, R=33
Now, combine this with 100*K/T = P, and a bit of algebra gives us the required answer.

Alternately, there are 11 triples that fit the factor requirement (courtesy of a short computer program), ranging from (19, 25, 32) to (2376, 96, 3).  The ones that total 10 less than a multiple of 25 are

Steps:
1. State variables: let K, P, R be the numbers of Rnkfurters for Kurt, Patty, Rod, and let the total be T = K + P + R.  
2. Translate the first requirement (“Kurt’s percentage equals Patty’s quantity”) into an equation: 100·K / T = P.  
3. Notice that the constant multiplier 100/T keeps re-appearing and name it F; thus F = 100/T and therefore K·F = P.  
4. Apply the same multiplier once more to link Patty to Rod, giving P·F = R (and hence also K·F² = R, up to any small remainder mentioned in the text).  
5. Use the phonograph-speed clue (33⅓ rpm) to infer that Rod should have 33 Rnkfurters and Patty should have 33⅓ % of the total, i.e. P = T/3.  
6. Substitute R = 33 into the total: T = K + P + 33, and write Patty’s one-third condition as P = (K + P + 33) / 3.  
7. Combine the equations P = (K + P + 33)/3 and 100·K / T = P, solve algebraically, and obtain K = 27, P = 30, T = 90.  
8. Verify that these numbers satisfy K·F = P and P·F = R with F = 100/90 = 10/9, and that 90 is 10 less than a multiple of 25 (so the trio must leave 10 with the storekeeper).  
9. (Alternate check) A computer search of all triples obeying the same factor rule narrows to three that are 10 short of a multiple of 25; the phonograph clue singles out the first—(27, 30, 33)—as the correct solution.

108,"In the equation FORTY+TEN+TEN=SIXTY, each letter represents a different digit. Can you figure out which letter is which digit?",Start from the last digits.,"First, there are ten different letters in this equation: E, F, I, N, O, R, S, T, X, Y. Therefore, every digit from 0 to 9 is used.
Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.
If T=8, then R=X+3, we can have R=6, X=3, or R=7, X=4.
If R=6, X=3, the remaining digits are 2, 4, 7, and again we can't choose S=F+1.
If R=7, X=4, the remaining digits are 2, 3, 6, where 3=2+1. Hence S=3, F=2.
Finally, the remaining digit 6 is for Y.

Steps:  
1. Note that the ten different letters (E, F, I, N, O, R, S, T, X, Y) must represent all ten digits 0-9.  
2. Because the last two columns read TY + EN + EN = TY, 2·EN must be a multiple of 100, so EN = 50, giving E = 5 and N = 0.  
3. Converting the thousands and hundreds columns yields the equation FOR + 2·T + 1 = SIX (the “+1” is the carry from doubling EN).  
4. Since 2·T + 1 < 20, SI can be at most FO + 2, forcing S = F + 1; with 0 already used, O must be 9 and I must be 1, so SI = FO + 2.  
5. From the hundreds column: R = X + (19 − 2·T). The unused digits are {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}.  
6. Test T = 6 ⇒ R = X + 7, impossible with the remaining digits; discard T = 6 (and anything smaller).  
7. Test T = 7 ⇒ R = X + 5, which forces (R, X) = (8, 3); leftover digits {2, 4, 6} cannot satisfy S = F + 1, so discard T = 7.

The unused digits are {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}.  \n6. Test T = 6 ⇒ R = X + 7, impossible with the remaining digits; discard T = 6 (and anything smaller).  \n7. Test T = 7 ⇒ R = X + 5, which forces (R, X) = (8, 3); leftover digits {2, 4, 6} cannot satisfy S = F + 1, so discard T = 7.  \n8. Test T = 8 ⇒ R = X + 3, giving two options: (R, X) = (6, 3) or (7, 4).  \n9. Option (6, 3) leaves {2, 4, 7} and fails S = F + 1; option (7, 4) leaves {2, 3, 6} with 3 = 2 + 1, so choose F = 2, S = 3, R = 7, X = 4.  \n10.

111,"Mad Ade was visiting his friend, computer tycoon and Olympic Kebab hurling champion, Mike Rohsopht.
He was there on Sunday and when the radio gave the time at the hour, Mad Ade noticed that the Madadian antique clock, designed by Madadian clock maker Arthur Minit (teaser #4891) was exactly 3 minutes slow.
""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Mike assured Mad Ade that his treasured Arthur Minit clock had not been adjusted nor fixed since his last visit.
What day of the week was Mad Ade's second visit?",,"The answer is 17 days and 3 hours later, which would have been a Wednesday.
This is the only other time in the same month when the two would agree at all.
In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.
Since the clock was not adjusted since the last visit, it's also possible that the radio time shifted by one hour due to a change to or from summer daylight saving time.  However, it turns out that the only additional possibilities that need to be considered are those of 4 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 12 hours 57 minutes, and 29 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 3 days 10 hours 57 minutes.  Without even considering the rules for when in the month the
clock is changed, these possible solutions are ruled out because we know that both visits were in the evening (""Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht"") and they involve times in a different part of the day.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 6  
Steps:  
1. Note the clock’s rate of error: it loses 7 minutes every real hour, i.e., 168 minutes every 24-hour day (2 h 48 m per day).  

2. Realize the condition for the clock to read correctly again: it was 3 minutes slow, so it must lose an additional 3 minutes, up to any whole 12-hour (720-minute) multiple; mathematically, required loss = 3 + 720k minutes for some integer k.  

3. Solve 7 t = 3 + 720k for the smallest positive real-time interval t (in hours).  Taking k = 1 gives 7 t = 723 ⇒ t = 103.2857… hr = 411 hr = 17 days 3 hr.  

4. Check the computation:  
   • 17 days lose 17 × 24 × 7 = 2 856 min = 47 h 36 m.  
   • Extra 3 hr loses 3 × 7 = 21 min.  
   • Total loss = 2 877 min = 47 h 57 m, which is 720 × 4 − 3; modulo 12 hr (720 min) this is +3 min, canceling the original −3 min, so the clock is exactly right.  

5. Convert the interval to a day of the week: 17 days after Sunday is Wednesday, and adding 3 hours still places the visit in the evening, so the second visit was on a Wednesday evening.  

6. Consider the possibility of a 1-hour radio-time shift (daylight-saving change).

We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.
Next we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x. If we add 10x on both sides, we get 22x=60, and dividing 22 from both sides yields x=60/22=30/11.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 5  
Steps:  
1. Take a vertical cross-section through the common axis of the cone and cylinder; this gives a large right triangle with height 12 and base 5 that represents the cone.  
2. Use the condition “diameter of the cylinder equals its height” to write the cylinder’s height as 2x when its radius is x.  
3. Draw the cylinder’s radius to the cone’s side; this creates a smaller right triangle inside the large one whose height is 12 − 2x and whose base is x.  
4. Set up a similarity proportion between the large and small triangles: 12/5 = (12 − 2x)/x.  
5. Solve the proportion: 12x = 60 − 10x → 22x = 60 → x = 60/22 = 30/11, so the cylinder’s radius is 30/11.",,5,"['Total Step Count: 5  \n', '  \n1.

1. Observe that the product “LIAR × S” is the four–digit number “RAIL,” so S×L must be a one-digit number (< 10).  Since S ≠ 1 (otherwise the product would not change the multiplicand), list the feasible ordered pairs (S, L) that meet S×L<10: (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2).

If you imagine you are facing a globe head on, you have the north pole at the top of the globe and the south pole at the bottom. Imagine a ""west pole"" and ""east pole"" to the left and right of the globe.
If you are at the north pole and turn left, you will walk through the ""west pole"" (right and you go through the ""east pole"")
If you walk on an axis from the north pole towards the south pole and make a left or right turn you will always walk through these imaginary east and west poles. So in the question 17.345 kilometers is irrelevant, only the turn.
(It also doesn't matter where you start on the planet, the distance at the end will still be the same.)
47.124 is approximately 3/4 of the circumference of this planet, which will leave you directly on the imaginary east pole. The distance is now the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle of side 10km.

2) Observe that the band is lengthened by 3 in. every minute, so the length at the beginning of the (n + 1)-st minute is Lₙ = 3 + 3n.  

3) Because the band stretches uniformly during each minute, the fraction of the band the spider occupies is preserved while the band grows; therefore  
  Sₙ₊₁ = (Sₙ + 1) · (Lₙ₊₁ / Lₙ),  
where Sₙ is the spider’s distance from the rod at the start of minute n.

136,"Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?

The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!",There are hints in the comments to triflers and in the title.,"80
To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion.

Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases.

141,"You have two identical ropes and three mice.  Each mouse bites off the rope at a different biting speed.  All three biting speeds are constant.
Mouse(A) bites off one rope in 60 minutes.
Mouse(B) bites off one rope in 90 minutes.
Mouse(C) bites off one rope in 180 minutes.
You do not have any time or distance measuring tools and the length of the rope is unknown.  How can you measure 75 minutes?",,"Mark the two ropes as Rope(A) and Rope(B).
1. Let Mouse(A) and Mouse(C) start biting off Rope(A) at the same time, starting each from  one end (moving in opposite directions).  At the same time, let Mouse(B) start biting off Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(A) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X = S(A) * 60, where S(A) is biting speed for Mouse(A) and X is Rope(A) length
X = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X is Rope(A) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(A)/S(C) = 3:1, which means that for each 3 units Mouse(A) will move, Mouse (C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(A) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(A) bites off three times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides Rope(A) length in to 4 units.
Mouse(A) bitten off portion = 3/4 X (where X is Rope(A) length)
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/4 X
Finding the time spent before Rope(A) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(A) needs  60 minutes to bite off X, How many minutes are needed to bite off 3/4 X?
Minutes needed = 3/4 * 60 = 45 minutes are needed to fully bite off Rope(A) by Mouse(A) and Mouse(C).  At that point in time, Mouse(B) would have bitten off exactly half the length of Rope(B) (needing 90 minutes to bite off the full rope), and needs an additional 45 minutes to bite off the remaining rope half.
2. Let Mouse(B) continue biting off Rope(B) and make Mouse(C) start biting off the other end of Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(B) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X/2 = S(B) * 90, where S(B) is biting speed for Mouse(B) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
X/2 = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(B)/S(C) = 2:1, which means that for each 2 units Mouse(B) will move, Mouse(C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(B) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(B) bites off two times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides the remaining half of Rope(B) length to 3 units.
Mouse(B) bitten off portion = 2/3 * X/2 = X/3
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/3 * X/2 = X/6
Finding the time spent before the remaining half of Rope(B) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(B) needs  90 minutes to bite off X, how many minutes are needed to bite off X/3?

145,How many trailing zeros are in the number 1000!?,,"The ! stands for factorial.  So, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!

Therefore the decrease in price after one year
= B - B(1-Y^2)
= B - B + B*Y^2

Hence after another year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 147.42 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y)

(since B(1-Y^2) is the price at the end of the previous year and           B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y) the price during the slowdown this year)
Therefore the decrease in price this year
= B(1-Y^2) - B(1-Y^2)^2
= B(1-Y^2)[1 - (1-Y^2)]
= B(1-Y^2)( Y^2) = 147.42    ... Equation 2
Dividing Equation 2 by Equation 1, we get
(1-Y^2) = 0.91 => Y^2 = 0.09
Substituting the above value of Y^2 in equation 1, we get
B*0.09 = 162
Hence B = 162/0.09 = 1800 Roka.

151,"In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.
On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.
About this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, ""Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.""
Knowing Junior, we asked, ""How big a headache is your math gonna give us?""
She answered, ""I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.""
Name the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.",Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.,"Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.
After labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, ""Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof. First, I mark a line from A to D.  This creates a trapezoid (trapezium in Britain) ABCD.  Next, I mark the lines EH, BG, and CF.  These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.""
The partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's. (The second and third cuts can be made in reverse order.)

When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.

The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:
v1 = 3 x h/180,
v2 = 2 x h/180,
v3 = 1 x h/180,

169,"Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.
We were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?",,"It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.
Hence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.
Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90. These 90 id's will not have a corresponding number when written in reverse order.
Secondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order. For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.
Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.

So, what is the password?","1. There are nine different letters in the troll's equation, so nine digits in total are used. Since no letter represent zero, the nine digits used are obvious - just not the letter each one represents.
2. This teaser requires some trial and error, but it can be minimized by looking at the two leftmost columns of the troll's equation.","The password is INLETS.
If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.
If N=5 and A=1, then E=9. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
If N=2 and A=4, then E=6. R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.
If N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.
If N=2, then since R cannot be 5, R=8, L=5, and I=7.
If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.
Since 1+S+T equals 5 or 15, S+T equals 4 or 14. If S+T=14, then S and T must be 5 and 9, or 6 and 8, in some order. But each of our three scenarios has a letter for at least one of 5 and 9, as well as one for 8. So S+T=4, S and T are 1 and 3 in some order, and O+S=12.
If S=1, then O=11. But since each letter represents only one digit, S=3, T=1, and O=9.
If N=5, then A=1. But since T=1, this cannot work.
If N=4, then I=9. But since O=9, this cannot work.

Steps:  
1. Look at the 1-units column (N + A = 7).  A carry of 1 must occur, so N + A = 6 and the carry makes the printed 7.  
   • This forces O + S = 11 or 12 and gives the two possible ordered pairs for {N , A}: {1,5} or {2,4}.  

2. Inspect the tens-of-thousands column (R + L = 3).  With one of the digits 1 or 2 already reserved for N or A, R + L cannot be 3, so a carry is required and R + L = 13.  
   • That same carry makes 1 + E + A = 11, hence E + A = 10.  

3. List the distinct non-zero pairs that sum to 13: {4,9}, {5,8}, {6,7}.  These are the only possibilities for {R , L}.  

4. Use E + A = 10 to test the N,A cases.  
   • (N = 1, A = 5) makes E = 5, a conflict with A, so discard.  
   • Keep the three viable cases: (N,A) = (5,1), (2,4) or (4,2).  

5. Move to the hundred-thousands column: 1 + I + R = 6 or 16, so I + R = 5 or 15.  
   • Because R can only be 5, 6, 7, or 8, I + R = 15 and R ≠ 5.  

6. Assign R , L , I for each surviving N,A case:  
   • If N = 5, A = 1 → take R = 7, L = 6, I = 8.

177,"Once an old man died, and in his Will he stated that all the pearls he kept in a little bag were to be distributed among his daughters. To make things fair, the distribution must be done in the following way:
The older girl should receive one pearl, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""
And so it was.

How many pearls did each girl get?","If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","There were 36 pearls.
There were 6 daughters.
Each daughter got 6 pearls.
The girl number x will have x pearls and a seventh of the rest. Since the last girl leaves no pearls in the bag, then when she takes her pearls the rest in the bag is zero (a seventh of nothing is nothing).
Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).

""Maybe; the next largest set is trivial.  50 Rnkfurers each, and then we'd each have the percentage the other guy got: 50% and 50 Rnkfurers each.""

Steps:  
1. Look at the equation DG × A = BA.  For the units digit to stay A after multiplying by A, the multiplier G must be 1 or 5.  If G were 5 then A would also have to be 5 in order to keep the units digit unchanged, but that would force F = 5 in the first line (FA × A = CF), violating the “all-different” rule.  Therefore G = 1 and A ≠ 5.  

2. Consider F × A = C, which must be a one-digit product of two unused digits.  With A ≠ 1,5, the only single–digit products of two distinct numbers available are  
 4 × 2 = 8, 2 × 4 = 8, 3 × 2 = 6, 2 × 3 = 6.  
Thus the four candidate triples (F,A,C) are (4,2,8), (2,4,8), (3,2,6) and (2,3,6).  

3. Test each triple in the first equation FA × A = CF:  
 42 × 2 = 84 (valid);  
 24 × 4 = 96 (contains 9, invalid);  
 32 × 2 = 64 (repeats 6 in both places, breaks “all-different” rule);  
 23 × 3 = 69 (contains 9, invalid).  
Only 42 × 2 = 84 works, so fix A = 2, F = 4, C = 8.  

4. Return to D1 × 2 = B2 (from DG × A = BA with G = 1, A = 2).  
Numerically, 2 × (10D + 1) = 20D + 2, so the tens digit B must be 2D.  
With digits still unused and distinct, the possibilities are  
 D = 2 → B = 4 (but 2 is already A),  
 D = 3 → B = 6,  
 D = 4 → B = 8 (but 4 is already F),  
 D = anything larger gives B ≥ 9, impossible.  
Hence D = 3 and B = 6.  

5. The remaining two unused digits are 5 and 7, and they must satisfy H × E = DH with D = 3.  Among all one–digit products that give a two–digit result whose tens digit is 3, only 5 × 7 = 35 fits.  Therefore H = 5 and E = 7.  

6. Collect the assignments:  
 G = 1, A = 2, D = 3, F = 4, H = 5, B = 6, E = 7, C = 8.

189,"A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8

3. Form the “meet at A” equation: equate train’s time to A (x / 80) and man’s time to A ((3/8 y) / z) to obtain z = 30y / x.  
4. Form the “meet at B” equation: equate train’s time to B ((x + y) / 80) and man’s time to B ((5/8 y) / z) to obtain z = 50y / ( x + y ).

6. Convert the man’s distance from A to a fraction of x: (3/8) y = (3/8)(2/3 x) = (1/4) x.  
7. Compare distances covered in the same time: in the interval the train travels x, the man travels (1/4) x, so the man’s speed is 1/4 of 80 kph, i.e., 20 kph.

190,"In a chess tournament conducted by the Romankachi World Chess Federation, every person played one game with every other person in the group. The total number of games that men played between themselves exceeded those played by men with women by 18. If there were 4 women on the tournament, totally how many games were played in the tournament?",,"Totally 120 games were played in the tournament.
Let N be the number of men in the tournament.
Then the number of games played by men between themselves
= N*(N-1)/2
The number of games played by men with women
= 4*N
(since there were 4 women in the tournament)
It is given that the total number of games that men played between themselves exceeded those played by men with women by 18.
Hence
N*(N-1)/2 - 4*N = 18
N*(N-1) - 8*N = 36
N*N - N - 8*N = 36
N^2 - 9*N - 36 = 0
Factorizing we get,
N^2 - 12*N + 3*N - 36 = 0
N*(N - 12) + 3*(N - 12) = 0
(N - 12)(N + 3) = 0
Hence N = 12 or -3 (not possible).
Hence the number of men in the chess tournament
= N = 12
Therefore the total number of people participating in the chess tournament = 12 + 4 = 16.

194,"Difficult Danny has acquired his nickname (and some other, less polite nicknames) due to the fact that, whenever he buys anything, he insists upon paying the exact amount, with precisely 100 pieces of currency. Danny wanted an xCube365 (it lasts 365 days before programmatically disabling itself, so that a new one must be purchased), the highly coveted gaming system that had just been released. It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?",,"Can at least one of each denomination be used? That totals $186 with only 6 bills, plus at least $94 with the rest of the bills. This is too high. Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.
If a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities. So $100 bill is the denomination that is not used. We now know that at least one of each of the other bills is used. That totals $86 with 5 bills, leaving 95 bills to make the other $144.
There are only 4 ways to make $144 with these denominations, which are listed in order from $1 bills to $50 bills in each of these sets: {84,10,1,0,0}, {89,1,5,0,0}, {89,3,2,1,0}, {94,0,0,0,1}.

Steps:  
1. Test the hypothesis that at least one of every denomination is used; this would already be 6 bills worth \$186, and adding the remaining 94 required bills would overshoot the \$230 total—so at least one denomination quantity must be 0.  

2. Observe that if two (or more) denominations were unused (quantity 0), then 0 × anything = 0 would give several different valid triplets, violating the “one and ONLY one triplet” requirement; therefore exactly one denomination must be unused.  

3. Check the possibility that \$100 bills are among the used denominations; the only bill-count/amount pairs that would then fit both the 100-bill and \$230 conditions still force two zero-quantities, contradicting Step 2, so \$100s must be the single unused denomination.  

4. Because \$1, \$5, \$10, \$20, and \$50 bills are all used at least once, an initial subtotal of \$86 with 5 bills is fixed, leaving 95 more bills that must add up to \$144.  

5. Solve the system x + y + z + u + v = 95 and 1x + 5y + 10z + 20u + 50v = 144 (x … v for \$1 to \$50 bills) to find the four feasible solutions: {84,10,1,0,0}, {89,1,5,0,0}, {89,3,2,1,0}, {94,0,0,0,1}.

On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table.

199,Lester has 40 kilograms of wheat. He has a simple balance and 4 weights of whole number denominations. The 4 weights are such that he is able to measure any whole number amount of wheat from 1 to 40 (no fractions). He can use a combination of two or more weights on any side of the balance as required. He can also use one weight on the left side and two or more weights on the right along with the wheat to weigh the required amount if necessary. What are the 4 weights Lester has?,,"The weights Lester uses are 1,3,9 and 27 kg.
For 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39 and 40 kg, he just needs to put the wheat on one side and the right combination of weights on the other side.
For 2, 8, 11, 26, 29, 35 and 38 kg he needs to put the wheat plus the 1 kg weight on one side and enough weights to make 1 more kg than he is trying to weigh up on the other side.
For 6, 7, 24, 25, 33, and 34 kg he needs to put the wheat plus the 3 kg weight on one side and enough weights to make 3 more kg than he is trying to weigh up on the other side.
For 5, 23, and 32 kg he needs to put the wheat plus the 1 and 3 kg weights on one side and enough weights to make 4 more kg than he is trying to weigh up on the other side.

201,"Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Snow, there lived the fair Princess Miyuki, who had always been fascinated by fairy tales and the stories of the wonders of the world. She believed that her sleeping, handsome prince was cursed to be one of the mummies in the pyramids of Egypt, and when she was done being Fantaghiro-saving-her-Romualdo, her prince would then build a beautiful palace as a monument of their love (which of course would be more beautiful than Taj Mahal) where both of them will live happily ever after...
So, you see, that's why Princess Miyuki had refused each and every love declaration or marriage proposal that came her way.
But of course, what's a story without the brave and wise heroic prince? Here comes Prince Hajikidama of the Marbles Kingdom. He's no mummy, but his brilliant(?) brain deduced that in order to win the princess' heart, he'd have to give her what she wanted most - her fantasy, and his token of understanding (her childish delusional nature).
In the end, labouring his mind's creativity department for all its worth, Prince Hajikidama decided that a 'Mountain of Love', reaching so high it collected the never-fallen-snow in Marbles Kingdom, might do the trick. That actually is a tetrahedral-shaped (pyramid with 4 equilateral triangular faces) crystallic marbles-made structure (like a giant pile of apples or oranges at a greengrocer's store) consisting of one marble crowning on the top layer, three on the next-to-top layer, six on the third layer, ten on the fourth layer, and so forth.

""My answer is right, and I want my three points!"" the blond one cried.
""But it's not the answer Mr. Collins left on the key!""
""He's wrong,"" the other one insisted.  ""My answer is right!""
Corman leaned over to whisper in Nora's ear, ""Does she need our help?""
""Yours, probably.  Mr. Collins is at a conference for the weekend, and Monette took his math class.  It looks like she handed back an exam.""
""I teach math.  Can I help?""
All three talked at once; Monette was as frustrated as the two students.  While they jabbered, Corman managed to read the problem in question:
""My house is built on a strangely-shaped lot, so my back yard is a right triangle with an area of 840 square feet.  Each of the three sides measures an integral number of feet.  If I want to stake my dog so that he can reach the entire yard, how long must his rope be?""
Monette finally pulled rank on the adolescents.  ""It's not really your problem, but I'd be glad of some help.  Mr. Collins marked their papers wrong; their answers don't match his.  The students *sound* right, but math was too long ago for me; I'm not sure.  To make matters worse, they don't even agree with each other.""
""I see,"" said Corman, playing for time while he mentally checked the answer on the key in Monette's trembling hand.  ""That's the answer Mr. Collins left you?""
""Yes,"" she began.
""The right answer is 8 feet shorter,"" the blond claimed.
""No, it's a lot longer,"" insisted the other.
Corman held up a hand for peace.  ""Actually, you *could* all be correct.""
""How can there be ... oh, it's one of those problems with an infinite number of right answers, because we're missing a clue?""
""Well, let me see your work.""  The students handed him their papers; he followed the algebra, nodding for almost a minute.
""Nice work.  You've found the only three right answers.""
""How can there be exactly three?  Usually, it's one, two, or infinity?""
""Usually, you're right.  Welcome to discrete math.  When you restrict things to whole numbers sometimes they don't work out so simply.""
How much rope did Mr. Collins really need?",Mr. Collins's answer key gives the actual dimensions of the yard; he didn't realize there were two other answers from the hints he gave.,"37 feet.
There are three triangles that fit the given hints, having sides
40, 42, 58
24, 70, 74
15, 112, 113
From the students' comments, we know that the Collins yard has the middle-sized hypotenuse.
A right triangle inscribes neatly into a semicircle, with the hypotenuse forming a diameter.  The shortest rope needed to reach all points is one staked at the midpoint of the hypotenuse, forming a radius of the circle.  74/2 = 37 feet.
The blond student found the first answer above, and would have used a rope of 29 feet.  The other student figured it at 113/2, or 56.5 feet.
Historical note:
Lewis Carroll searched for the answer to the basic mathematical problem, sent to him by a reader.  He found two right triangles with the same area, but couldn't discover a set of three.  Somewhat ironically, Carroll had found 20-21-29 and 12-35-37.

206,"Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 5

So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote an equation on a rock:

""Each letter in the equation represents a different digit,"" said the troll. ""The letters in the password represent 3651.""
So, what is the password?",,"The password is LENS.
Since SL-D=3 or (SL-1)-D=3 (meaning SL-D=4), and since the highest possible sum of two different one-digit numbers is 17, S must equal 1.
Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.
Suppose D=7. Then L is 0 or 1, and since S=1, L=0. A must be 1 or 2, but since S=1, A=2.
Suppose D=8. Then L is 1 or 2, and since S=1, L=2. A must be 2 or 3, but since L=2, A=3.
Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.
Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.
If D=7, then L=0. But since 10-7=3, D cannot be 7.
If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.
If E=4, then N=3. But if D=8, A=3, and if D=9, L=3 and A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=5, then since 1I-E=6, I=1. But since S=1, this cannot work.
If E=7, then I=3. But if D=8, then A=3, and if D=9, then L=3. So this cannot work.
If E=8, then I=4, and D cannot be 8. But if D=9, then A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=9, then N=8, and D cannot be 8 or 9. So this cannot work.
Therefore, E=6, N=5, and I=2. If D=8, then L=2, so D must equal 9. This means:
S=1, I=2, L=3, A=4, N=5, E=6, and D=9.

b) You have to walk 73 feet, 9 inches
Explanation
There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100, neither of which is prime.  (No, 1 is not prime.)  So you will walk in an expanding square with sides of length 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 feet.  This is a total of 1060 feet.

214,"Alec, Brett and Chris each purchased parts for their skateboards at the sports store. Alec and Brett wanted to build new skateboards, so they each needed to purchase a deck, trucks, bearings and wheels. Chris only needed new wheels. The store offers a 10% discount for purchases over $250, so the boys decided to pay for all the parts together to qualify for the discount. Altogether, the boys spent $266.40. The clues below reflect the price of the items before the discount is applied.
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
They each bought the same kinds of wheels. Together they spent $75 for the 3 sets of wheels. Each set contained 4 wheels.
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his. However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Brett spent $3 more on bearings than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
How much did each person spend?",,"Alec spent $113.40.
Brett spent $130.50.
Chris spent $22.50.
Component Alec Brett Chris Total
Deck $50 $45 $0 $95
Trucks 35 40 $0 75
Wheels 25 25 25 75
Bearings 16 35 $0 51
Total before discount $126 $145 $25 $296
less 10% discount $12.60 $14.50 $2.50 $29.60
Amount spent $113.40 $130.50 $22.50 $266.40
Explanation:
First find the original price of all the items combined. $266.40 is the price after the 10% discount was applied.
That means $266.40 is equal to 90% of the original price.
Write an equation and then cross multiply:
266.40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x   =   9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)
Let x = the amount Alec spent on trucks.
x + (x+5) = 75
2x + 5 = 75
2x = 70
x = 35
Alec spent $35 on trucks. Brett spent $5 more than Alec. Therefore, Brett spent $40 on trucks.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51
x + (2x + 3) = 51
3x + 3 = 51
3x = 48
x = 16
Alec's spent $16 on bearings.

How many tables and chairs should the factory produce per hour to yield the highest revenue, and what is that revenue?",,"The 10 saws can produce 600 minutes of work per hour (10 saws * 60 minutes).
The 6 lathes can produce 360 minutes of work per hour (6 lathes * 60 minutes).
The 18 sanding machines can produce 1080 minutes of work per hour (18 sanding machines * 60 minutes).
Let c be the number of chairs produced per hour and t the number of tables produced per hour.
The number of saws limit the combination of chairs and tables to 600=10c+5t.
The number of lathes limit the combination of chairs and tables to 360=5c+5t.
The number of sanding machines limit the combination of chairs and tables to 1080=5c+20t.
Next graph these three lines. It should be expected that the answer will lie on the intersection of two of these lines or to make all chairs or all tables. The intersection of the saw and sanding machine line occurs outside of how many chairs the lathe can make so this combination is not a viable answer. The saw and lathe lines cross at 48 chairs and 24 tables. The lathe and sanding machine lines cross at 24 chairs and 48 tables.

222,"Homer had always contemplated the size of the old oak tree in the field behind his house.  Standing 5 feet away from the 8 foot high fence in the back of the yard, he could just barely see the top leaves of the tree over the top of the fence.  He knew that the tree was 200 feet from the fence.  Homer was 6 feet tall, making his line of vision, 67 inches from the ground.
Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.","TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches
Tree height from eye level = TAN (25.80 deg) * 2460 inches = 1189 inches
Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.  With the measurement capabilities available to any lumberjack (or any average Homer) precise measurements are not possible.

All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.

240,"In the legendary land of Madadia, everything is wonderful. There is no inflation, so Madadian wonks (local currency 100 winks = 1 wonk) are constant in value.
Mad Ade's cousin Manic Martin works as an accountant in one of Madadia's leading accounting firms.
After his first year his salary was a straight 10,000 wonks, with which Manic Martin was quite happy. His manager was so impressed with his work he offered Manic Martin a wage rise.
Now this being Madadia, things are not always done as they are elsewhere, the wage rise was offered over a 17.5 year contract period, These contracts are immutably binding, and will still be paid to benefactors in the event of death or permanent disability.
Manic Martin has a choice of how to receive his raise.  The first option was for an immediate 5% raise to 10,500 wonks annually, with an additional 5% raise every 6 months. The second option was for an immediate 10% raise to 11,000 wonks annually, with an additional 10% raise every year. Manic Martin's salary, based upon his current annual, was paid bi-weekly.
Which deal would benefit Manic Martin the most?",,"The 5% semi-annual raise yields a higher return.
This may have been your first guess, but there is something odd about the answer. At the start of the problem, the 10% raise is earning more-  11,000 annually vs. 10,500. After the first year, the 5% option has earned 10,762 compared to 11,000.
What are the two options earning at the moment the contract closes, after 17.5 years? Surprisingly, the 5% option only realizes a little more than 55,160, compared to the 10% option which is still ahead with just under 56,000.
So where's the advantage in the 5% option? It hides in the second half of every year. Even in the first year, the 5% option makes more in the second six months than the 10% option. For the first few years, this is not enough to offset the difference. But cumulatively, over seventeen and a half years, 5% realizes a grand total of 390.27 more than the 10% option.

Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.

1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?",,"The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74
Lemp 47 94
Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Number of people who got in at the six stations - Number of people who got out at the six stations) =
227 - (364 - 182) =
227 - 182 =
45 people
Thus, I disappointed Tweeto by giving him the answer as 45 people.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 5

248,"Some time after 2 O' Clock, the angle made between the minute hand and the vertical (12) on a clock is double the angle made between the hour hand and the vertical (12). What time is it?",What is the rate of travel of each hand on a clock?,"2:24 The hour hand makes an angle of 72 degrees while the minute hand makes an angle of 144 degrees.
At exactly 2:00, the angle made by the hour hand is 60 degrees from vertical.  If you let x = the number of minutes past 2:00 that we are looking for, then the hour hand will be at:
60 degrees + x / 60 min* 30 degrees
where x/60 min is the fraction of a full hour that has past, and is therefore the fractional distance that the hour hand has moved closer to the 3.  The 30 degrees is the total angle between the 2 and the 3.
The final position of the minute hand will be:
x/30 min * 180 degrees
for the same reasoning as with the hour hand.
Since the minute hand will make twice the angle with vertical, you can set up the equation:
2*(60 + x / 60 * 30) = x / 30 * 180
Solving for x will give you 24 minutes.  The time will be 2:24.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 5
