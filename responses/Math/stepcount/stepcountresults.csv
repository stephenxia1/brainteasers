0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 12

1,"What is the smallest integer such that if you rotate the number to the left you get a number that is exactly one and a half times the original number?
(To rotate the number left, take the first digit off the front and append it to the end of the number.  2591 rotated to the left is 5912.)","The number has 16 digits.  I repeat, the number has 16 digits.","1,176,470,588,235,294

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)
10,15 (2,3)
So the five smallest numbers with this property are:

5,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Ralph was impressed by the ingenuity of Rex's last attempt using clues involving prime numbers, but he thinks he's got an even better one for Rex. He tells Rex he's thinking of a 6-digit number.
""All of the digits are different. The digital sum matches the number formed by the last two digits in the number. The sum of the first two digits is the same as the sum of the last two digits.""
""Take the sum of the number, the number rotated one to the left, the number rotated one to the right, the number with the first three and last three digits swapped, the number with the digit pairs rotated to the left, and the number with the digit pairs rotated to the right. The first and last digits of this sum match the last two digits of the number, in some order.""
Ralph then asks, ""If each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs in the number is prime, then what is the number?""
Rex looks confused, and for a moment Ralph thinks he's finally gotten him. Then Rex smiles, scribbles a few things down on a pad of paper and then says, ""Very nice, Ralph!""
Rex then tells Ralph his number.
What did Rex say?
(See the hint for an explanation of the terminology.)","The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number. The digital sum of 247 is 2+4+7 = 13.
The digit pairs in 125690 are 12 56 90. These are also the numbers formed by the digit pairs.
Rotating 123456 one to the left gives 234561;
Rotating 123456 one to the right gives 612345;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the left gives 789056;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the right gives 905678.","416723
Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 16

2. Write the six “configurations” Ralph told Rex to add: ABCDEF, BCDEFA, FABCDE, DEFABC, CDEFAB, EFABCD.  
3. Observe that in a column-wise addition of these six numbers each column contains all six digits, so every column sum equals the digital sum S = A+B+C+D+E+F.  
4. Denote that digital sum as the two-digit number XY (X is tens-digit, Y is ones-digit).  
5. Note that the grand total of the six numbers is equivalent to adding a string of X’s followed by a trailing 0 to a string of Y’s (i.e., XXXXXX0 + YYYYYY).  
6. Conclude that the first and last digits of this grand total will be X and Y only when no carry occurs into the hundreds place; that is, when X + Y < 10.  
7. Establish the possible size of S: with six distinct decimal digits its minimum is 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and maximum is 4+5+6+7+8+9 = 39.  
8. Restrict S further because each of the three two-digit “pairs” in the number must be prime; therefore S itself must be prime within 15–39, giving the candidates 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37.  
9. Apply X + Y < 10 to discard 19 (1+9), 29 (2+9) and 37 (3+7) since each violates the no-carry condition.  
10. Test S = 31: here X+Y = 3+1 = 4, so both the first and last digit sums must be 4. The only distinct unused pair that sums to 4 is 0 and 4, but 04 is not prime; hence S ≠ 31.  
11. The remaining viable sums are 17 and 23.  
12. For S = 17 the digit set must total 17; only {0,1,2,3,4,7} or {0,1,2,3,5,6} work. Because the number must end in 17, the other pair would have to sum to 8 (1+7) but no remaining distinct pair both sums to 8 and forms a prime, so S ≠ 17.  
13. Therefore S must be 23, making the last two digits 23.  
14. The sum of the first two digits must also be 2+3 = 5. The distinct pairs that sum to 5 are 0+5 and 1+4; the only prime choices from them are 05 (5) and 41 (41). A six-digit number cannot begin with 0, so the first two digits are 41.  
15. The remaining two digits must sum to 23 − (4+1) − (2+3) = 13; the only distinct pairs are 5+8 and 6+7. Of these, only 67 is prime, fixing the middle digits as 67.

6,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 13

Steps:
1. Observe that the only unknown needed to compute the house’s area is the number n of sides of the regular polygon; everything else can then be obtained from the one length Ralph supplied (the length of the pipe/one side of the lot).

2. Translate the statement “the closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation” into geometry: the property is a regular polygon circumscribed about a circle whose diameter is three times the foundation’s diameter, so every linear dimension of the lot‐polygon is three times the corresponding one of the house‐polygon.

3. Note two key equalities supplied by Ralph:  
   • The irrigation pipe is a straight segment that bisects the house’s area.  
   • The pipe’s length equals the length of one side of the property.  
   Thus that side length must be a possible area–bisecting chord of a regular n-gon inscribed in the foundation circle.

4. Recall the extreme lengths of an area-bisecting segment in a regular n-gon inscribed in a circle of radius r:  
   – Even n:  minimum = 2 a,  maximum = 2 r.  
   – Odd n:  minimum = 2 a,  maximum = r + a.  
   (a is the apothem.)  
   Also recall the basic relations for a regular n-gon:  
   a = r cos(π/n), s = 2 a tan(π/n).

5. Non-dimensionalise by setting the foundation radius r = 1.  Then the apothem of the lot is 3, so a lot side has length s_lot = 6 tan(π/n).  The requirement that this length be a valid bisector gives the double inequality  
   Max(n)  ≥  6 tan(π/n)  ≥  Min(n).

6. To be sure of not missing a solution, use the even-n bounds (2 r and 2 a) in that inequality:  
   2  ≥  6 tan(π/n)  ≥  2 cos(π/n).  
   From the left half,  tan(π/n) ≤ 1/3 ⇒ n ≥ π/atan(1/3) ≈ 9.8.  
   Testing n = 10 gives 2 > 1.95 > 1.90, so n = 10 works and the house is a regular decagon.

7. The lot has 10 sides, but only 9 are fenced; the 10th side (the gate) equals the pipe length.  Because 400 ft of fence covers 9 sides, each side of the lot (and the pipe) is 400/9 ≈ 44.444 ft.

8. Use s = 2 a tan(π/10) to get the lot apothem:  
   a_lot = s /(2 tan(π/10)) ≈ 68.393 ft,  
   and then the lot circumradius r_lot = a_lot / cos(π/10) ≈ 71.913 ft.

9. Since the lot’s circumradius is three times the house’s, the house (foundation) circumradius is  
   r_house = r_lot / 3 ≈ 22.798 ft.

10. Find the house apothem and side:  
    a_house = r_house cos(π/10) ≈ 21.682 ft,  
    s_house = 2 a_house tan(π/10) ≈ 14.090 ft.

11. Compute the area of the decagonal house footprint: ten congruent triangles of base s_house and height a_house give  
    A_house = 10 · (½ s_house a_house) ≈ 10 · 152.75 = 1,527.5 ft².

12. Determine the atrium size: the “longest measurement of the property” is the lot’s diameter 2 r_lot, so the atrium diameter is one-tenth of that and its radius is (2 r_lot)/10 ÷ 2 = r_lot/10 ≈ 7.191 ft.  Its area is  
    A_atrium = π (7.191)² ≈ 162.47 ft².

13. Subtract the atrium from the house floor, and double the result for two stories:  
    Total square footage = 2 · (A_house – A_atrium)  
                         ≈ 2 · (1,527.5 – 162.47)

8,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""
""The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.""
Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 12  
Steps:  
1. Since the two neighboring numbers cannot share any prime with the middle number, the middle number must be even (otherwise each neighbor would have to contain the factor 2).  Therefore the middle number has the factor 2 and the other two distinct prime factors must sum to 1400 − 2 = 1398 (because the total of the three prime factors equals 1400).  

2. Among two numbers whose sum is 1398 the greatest product is 699 × 699, giving a maximal value 2 × 699 × 699 = 977 202; this is an upper bound for the sought number.  

3. The neighbors each have five distinct prime factors.  The smallest possible product of 10 distinct odd primes is 3·5·7·11·13·17·19·23·29·31 = 100 280 245 065; taking its square-root gives ≈316 670, which is a lower bound for the middle number.  

4. Hence Rex’s number is an even six–digit integer between 316 670 and 977 202 inclusive; Ralph now looks for further restrictions rather than brute forcing that interval.  

5. The three prime factors have prime digital sums, one of which is 2.  For the other two factors (each between roughly 227 and 1398) the largest possible digital sum is 27, so the product of the three digital sums is at most 2 × 23 × 23 = 1058; the digital sum of this product must itself be prime and, because a digital sum cannot exceed 27 here, that prime is < 27.  Furthermore, reversing the digits of that prime gives a different prime which must equal the digital sum of the whole number.  The only primes below 54 that are different primes when reversed are 13, 17, 31, 37; only 31 can be a digital sum ≥ (three-digit minimum) and it reverses to 13 (also prime).  Thus the digital sum of Rex’s number is 31.  

6. The statement that “the middle two digits are its only prime digits and together form a two-digit prime” means the number must have an even number of digits, hence six digits, and the middle pair must be one of the two-digit primes composed solely of prime digits: 23, 37, 53, 73.  Because the first three digits must make a three-digit prime, its third digit cannot be 2 or 5, so the middle pair can only be 37 or 73.  

7. The sum of the first three digits is prime, and the digital sum of that sum (and once more) is also prime.  With a leading digit 4, 6, 8, or 9 the smallest first-three-digit value is 403, ruling out a digit sum of 5.  Further eliminating values whose next digital sum is composite removes 13, 17, 19, leaving possible digit sums 7, 11, 23 for the first three digits.  

8. If that sum were 7 the only admissible first three digits would be 403, but 403 = 13 × 31 is not prime, so the digit sum cannot be 7.  Therefore the digit sum of the leading triple is 11 or 23.  

9. Digit sum 11: the admissible first triples that start with 4, 6, 8, 9 and end in 3 or 7 are 407, 443, 623, 803.  Testing primality leaves only 443.  Because the middle pair must be 37 (to agree with digit 3 already present), the fourth digit is 7.  The last three digits must then start with 7, end with 4/6/8, and together sum to 20; the possibilities are 758, 776, 794.  The fifth digit may not itself be prime, eliminating 758 and 776, so 794 remains and yields the first candidate number 443 794.  

10. Digit sum 23: with the same positional constraints the only first triples are 887 or 977.  The second digit of 977 is prime (disallowed), while 887 is prime, so 887 is accepted.  The middle pair must now be 73 (to use the 3rd digit 7), forcing the last three digits to start with 3, end in 4/6/8, and give a total digit sum 8; only 314 works, producing the second candidate number 887 314.  

11. Thus Ralph narrows Rex’s number to the two possibilities {443 794, 887 314}.  

12. Rex adds that one of these numbers is divisible by 13; testing shows 443 794 = 13 × 34 138 while 887 314 is not divisible by 13.  Because none of the prime factors of Rex’s number can be 13 (the neighbors already use it), the divisible candidate is discarded and Rex’s number is 887 314.",,12,"['Total Step Count: 12  \n', '  \n1.

9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?",,"The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 10  
Steps:  
1. From Sachin’s first remark (“I don’t think that we know the numbers”) we deduce:  
   • The whispered sum cannot be written as the sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not be certain Prashant was ignorant.  
   • The product must be ≥ 12, because any product < 12 would be unique and would let Prashant know the numbers immediately.  

2. Collect every integer sum > 4 that is NOT expressible as the sum of two primes; this “Possible-Sum list” begins  
   11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, …  

3. Examine the first candidate sum, 11.  The pairs that give this sum are (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6) with products 18, 24, 28, 30 respectively.  

4. Test each of those products against Prashant’s knowledge:  
   • If the product were 18, 24 or 28, Prashant could uniquely back-compute the numbers and would announce success, leaving Sachin still with three possibilities—contradicting Sachin’s later certainty.  
   • If the product were 30, Prashant could not be sure.  
   Hence the sum cannot be 11; discard it.  

5. Move to the next candidate sum, 17.  Its possible pairs are  
   (2, 15), (3, 14), (4, 13), (5, 12), (6, 11), (7, 10), (8, 9)  
   with products 30, 42, 52, 60, 66, 70, 72.  

6. For each of those products, ask whether Prashant could become certain after hearing Sachin’s opening remark.  Only product 52 qualifies, because every other product can be factored in more than one way that keeps the sum inside or outside the Possible-Sum list.  

7. Product 52 factors as (2, 26) or (4, 13).  If the hidden numbers were (2, 26), the sum would be 28, which is not in the Possible-Sum list; Sachin could not have been sure Prashant was ignorant.  Therefore the numbers must be 4 and 13.  

8. After Prashant’s announcement, Sachin reviews the seven candidate products for sum 17 and sees that only 52 would have let Prashant reach certainty; hence Sachin now pinpoints the numbers as (4, 13), matching the conversation.  

9. Nakul, overhearing the entire exchange, can follow the same chain of deductions and arrives at the pair (4, 13) as well.  

10.

Test each of those products against Prashant’s knowledge:  \n   • If the product were 18, 24 or 28, Prashant could uniquely back-compute the numbers and would announce success, leaving Sachin still with three possibilities—contradicting Sachin’s later certainty.  \n   • If the product were 30, Prashant could not be sure.  \n   Hence the sum cannot be 11; discard it.  \n\n5.

For each of those products, ask whether Prashant could become certain after hearing Sachin’s opening remark.  Only product 52 qualifies, because every other product can be factored in more than one way that keeps the sum inside or outside the Possible-Sum list.  \n\n7. Product 52 factors as (2, 26) or (4, 13).  If the hidden numbers were (2, 26), the sum would be 28, which is not in the Possible-Sum list; Sachin could not have been sure Prashant was ignorant.  Therefore the numbers must be 4 and 13.  \n\n8. After Prashant’s announcement, Sachin reviews the seven candidate products for sum 17 and sees that only 52 would have let Prashant reach certainty; hence Sachin now pinpoints the numbers as (4, 13), matching the conversation.  \n\n9. Nakul, overhearing the entire exchange, can follow the same chain of deductions and arrives at the pair (4, 13) as well.  \n\n10.

10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 11

2. Declare 4 of those 3125 coconuts “rotten’’ and set them aside, leaving 3121 “good’’ coconuts that will actually be handled during each division.  
3. First survivor: with the 4 rotten coconuts off to the side, 3121 ÷ 5 leaves 624 each and 1 left over for the monkey; the survivor hides 624, then the 4 rotten coconuts are put back, raising the visible pile to 2500 = 5⁴.  
4. Second survivor: take the 4 rotten back off (visible pile again 2496), obtain the same 1-remainder division, hide a fifth, replace the 4 rotten, and the pile becomes 5³·5 = 5³ after that survivor is finished.  
5. Note that exactly the same “remove-4-rotten, divide, replace-4-rotten’’ manoeuvre works for the third, fourth, and fifth nighttime survivors, each time dropping the real pile one power of 5 lower while still satisfying the “one left for the monkey’’ requirement.  
6. After the fifth nighttime raid the pile (with the 4 rotten temporarily in it) is 5⁰·5 = 5, so when morning comes and the 4 rotten are finally left off to the side, the remaining 5 good coconuts divide evenly among the five people with no remainder.  
7. Because the 4 “rotten’’ coconuts never belong to anyone, the true initial pile is 5⁵ – 4 = 3121 good coconuts.

12,"In ""4+4+4+4=1!"" it was shown that just using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can form all the numbers from 0 to 9 using exactly four 4's.
For example: 7 = 4 + 4 - 4/4
Now if you add the operations square root, factorial, and exponent, what is the first number counting up from zero that can't be formed? How can each number be formed?
You may use parentheses, but you may not combine fours to make 44 or 444.
(An exponent is raising a number to the power of another number such as 4^4 = 256; a factorial is the product of all the integers from 1 to the integer such as 4! = 1x2x3x4 = 24.)",The first number that can't be formed is 39.,"The first number that can't be formed is 39. This isn't proved, so maybe you can figure out how to form 39.
There are several ways to form most of the numbers, here are some for the numbers 0 to 9 using just addition, subtract, multiplication and division:
0 = 4+4-4-4 = (4-4)*4+4
1 = (4/4)*(4/4) = (4*4)/(4*4) = (4+4)/(4+4) = (4/4)/(4/4)
2 = (4/4)+(4/4) = (4*4)/(4+4) = 4/((4+4)/4)

4 = (4-4)*4+4
5 = (4*4+4)/4
6 = 4+((4+4)/4)

8 = 4+4+4-4 = (4/4)*4+4 = ((4+4)/4)*4 = 4*4-4-4
9 = 4+4+4/4
Here are some ways to form the numbers from 10 to 38 using the additional operators:
10 = 4+4+4-SQRT(4)
11 = 4!/SQRT(4)-4/4
12 = 4*(4-4/4)

14,"This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?",,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
To find all Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00, set i = 1 and check all values of j.
j = 0, s = 25.17482517, time = 1:00:25.17

15,"I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?",,"Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 12  
Steps:  
1. Introduce variables: x = Mum’s age when Tommy was born (and Tony’s age when Mum turns 50); y = Tommy’s age when Tony was born; z = Mum’s age when Tony was born.  
2. Translate Tammy’s “when Mum turns 50” remark into the equation 2x + y = 50.  
3. Note that Tommy was born y years before Tony, so x = z − y, and that Tommy’s age y must be a factor of Mum’s age z (because all four children’s ages were factors when Tony was born).  
4. Combine the two relations to get 2z = 50 + y.  
5. Search integer solutions where y divides z, giving (z,y) = (26,2) and (30,10).  
6. Reject z = 26 because it has too few factors; keep z = 30, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.  
7. List the remaining factors of 30 for Timmy, Tammy, Tracey: Timmy = 6,5 or 3; Tammy = 5,3 or 2; Tracey = 3,2 or 1, leading to possible current ages for Tammy of 18, 15 or 9.  
8. Use the clue that “the only other year with more than two child-age factors of Mum’s age was when Tracey was half Tammy’s present age” to force Tammy’s current age to 18.  
9. Therefore Tracey was 9 in that second special year; work back to see Tracey was 3,2 or 1 when Tony was born, giving Tony ages of 6,7 or 8 and Mum ages of 36,37 or 38 in the second special year.  
10. Only Mum = 36 has enough factors and allows Tony ≥ 6, so Mum was 36 and Tony 6 in that year; hence Tracey was 3 when Tony was born.

16,"The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7  
Steps:  
1. Introduce variables a, b, c, d for the present ages of Alice, Barbara, Cheryl, and Denise and express the four wedding-day facts (one each year) as “bride’s age equals the sum of the digits of her three sisters’ ages.”  

2. Use the fact that any integer is congruent to the sum of its digits modulo 9 to translate those four facts into the system of congruences  
 d ≡ a + b + c (mod 9)  
 c – 1 ≡ (a – 1)+(b – 1)+(d – 1) (mod 9)  
 b – 2 ≡ (a – 2)+(c – 2)+(d – 2) (mod 9)  
 a – 3 ≡ (b – 3)+(c – 3)+(d – 3) (mod 9).  

3. Solve the congruences to get the present ages modulo 9:  
 a ≡ 0, b ≡ 1, c ≡ 2, d ≡ 3 (mod 9).  

4. Look three years back (Alice’s wedding): a – 3 ≡ 6, b – 3 ≡ 7, c – 3 ≡ 8, d – 3 ≡ 9 (mod 9).  Restrict each age so that its actual value and its digit sum match the same residue, rule out 0 or large numbers, and deduce Alice was 24 then, so Alice is now 27.  

5. Move to two years ago (Barbara’s wedding): with Alice now 25, deduce that Cheryl had digit-sum 9 (so was 18), Denise’s residue 1 forces her digit-sum to be 10 (she was 19), and hence Barbara had to be 26.  Therefore Barbara is now 28.  

6. Examine last year (Cheryl’s wedding): Alice 26 and Barbara 27 fix Denise’s residue at 2; the choice 11 for her digit-sum leads to contradiction, so her digit-sum was 2, giving Cheryl 19 then and establishing current ages Cheryl = 20 and Denise = 21.

Steps:  
1) Condition 4 (divisibility by 5) forces the fifth digit to be 5, so E = 5.  

2) Conditions 1, 3, 5 and 7 require the 2-digit, 4-digit, 6-digit and 8-digit prefixes to be even, so the digits in the even positions (B, D, F, H) must be even; consequently the remaining positions (A, C, G, I) are filled with the four odd digits 1, 3, 7, 9.  

3) From condition 3 (ABCD divisible by 4) the pair CD must be divisible by 4; from condition 7 (ABCDEFGH divisible by 8) and the fact that F is even, the pair GH must be divisible by 8.  Since C and G are odd, this forces D and H to be the two even digits 2 and 6 (order still unknown).  

4) Conditions 2 and 5 tell us that the digit–sums A + B + C, D + E + F and G + H + I are each multiples of 3.  

5) Case 1: assume D = 2.  The remaining even digits 4, 6, 8 must go to B, F, H; choosing H = 6 to keep GH divisible by 8 leaves B = 4 and F = 8.  

6) With B = 4, the requirement A + 4 + C ≡ 0 (mod 3) forces A and C to be 1 and 7 in some order, leaving G and I to be 3 and 9 in some order.  

7) GH must be divisible by 8, so G6 divisible by 8 implies G = 9 and I = 3.  

8) Check the 7-digit numbers 1472589 and 7412589 for divisibility by 7; neither works, so Case 1 (D = 2) is impossible.  

9) Therefore D = 6; the other even digits are fixed as F = 4, H = 2, B = 8.  

10) GH must now be divisible by 8, so G2 divisible by 8 gives two possibilities: G = 3 or G = 7.  

11) The sum A + 8 + C must be a multiple of 3, hence one of {A, C} is chosen from {1, 7} and the other from {3, 9}.
