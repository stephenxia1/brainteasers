0,"Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?
 Solution: The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11

Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)

     - **5 days** (wedding April 6th).  

3. **Second Village (A to C)**:  
   - Calculate values for intermediate crossings (AFi, Fi, Ai, M, BCi, etc.).  
   - Total routes: **41** → **41 days** (wedding May 12th).  

4. **Opposite Village (A to D)**:  
   - Symmetric paths allow mirroring counts.  
   - Total routes: **121** → **121 days** (wedding August 1st, assuming inclusive day count).  

5. **Bonus Question (Longest Route)**:  
   - **Circumference = 10 miles → Radius = 5/π miles** (hexagon side = radius).  
   - Longest route: Indirect path through multiple crossings (e.g., A-B-ABi-C-Ci-Di-D).  
   - Total distance: **10/π + 20/(√3π) ≈ 6.86 miles**.

1,"Question: What is the smallest integer such that if you rotate the number to the left you get a number that is exactly one and a half times the original number?
(To rotate the number left, take the first digit off the front and append it to the end of the number.  2591 rotated to the left is 5912.)
 Solution: 1,176,470,588,235,294
x 1.5 =
1,764,705,882,352,941
Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)

64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)

1. **Establish the Mathematical Relationship:**  
   Let \( N \) be the original number with \( d \) digits. Rotating \( N \) left (moving the first digit to the end) results in \( M \), where \( M = 1.5N \). This leads to the equation:  
   \[
   17N = 2 \cdot D_1 \cdot (10^d - 1)
   \]  
   Here, \( D_1 \) is the first digit of \( N \), and \( d \) is the number of digits in \( N \).

2. **Determine the Required Number of Digits \( d \):**  
   For \( 17 \) to divide \( 10^d - 1 \), \( d \) must be the multiplicative order of \( 10 \) modulo \( 17 \). Calculating powers of \( 10 \mod 17 \), we find \( d = 16 \), since \( 10^{16} \equiv 1 \mod 17 \).

3. **Express \( N \) in Terms of \( D_1 \):**  
   Substitute \( d = 16 \) into the equation:  
   \[
   N = \frac{2 \cdot D_1 \cdot (10^{16} - 1)}{17}
   \]  
   Compute \( \frac{10^{16} - 1}{17} = 588,235,294,117,647 \). Thus, \( N = 2 \cdot D_1 \cdot 588,235,294,117,647 \).

4. **Find the Smallest \( N \):**  
   Set \( D_1 = 1 \) (the smallest valid digit) to minimize \( N \):  
   \[
   N = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 588,235,294,117,647 = 1,176,470,588,235,294
   \]  
   Verify that rotating \( N \) left gives \( 1.5 \cdot N \), confirming the solution.

5. **Connection to Repeating Fractions:**  
   The repeating decimal of \( 1/17 \) (16 digits: \( 0588235294117647 \)) forms a cyclic number. Selecting the segment starting at the digit \( 1 \) produces \( 1,176,470,588,235,294 \), satisfying the rotation condition. This leverages the cyclic property of the fraction’s digits.

5,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Ralph was impressed by the ingenuity of Rex's last attempt using clues involving prime numbers, but he thinks he's got an even better one for Rex. He tells Rex he's thinking of a 6-digit number.
""All of the digits are different. The digital sum matches the number formed by the last two digits in the number. The sum of the first two digits is the same as the sum of the last two digits.""
""Take the sum of the number, the number rotated one to the left, the number rotated one to the right, the number with the first three and last three digits swapped, the number with the digit pairs rotated to the left, and the number with the digit pairs rotated to the right. The first and last digits of this sum match the last two digits of the number, in some order.""
Ralph then asks, ""If each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs in the number is prime, then what is the number?""
Rex looks confused, and for a moment Ralph thinks he's finally gotten him. Then Rex smiles, scribbles a few things down on a pad of paper and then says, ""Very nice, Ralph!""
Rex then tells Ralph his number.
What did Rex say?
(See the hint for an explanation of the terminology.)
 Solution: 416723
Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF

Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.","The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number. The digital sum of 247 is 2+4+7 = 13.
The digit pairs in 125690 are 12 56 90. These are also the numbers formed by the digit pairs.
Rotating 123456 one to the left gives 234561;
Rotating 123456 one to the right gives 612345;

6,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?
 Solution: 2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet

1. **Determine the Number of Sides (n):**
   - The property's side length (S) equals the pipe length, which bisects the house's area. For a regular polygon, this bisector's length must be between the minimum (2*apothem) and maximum (2*radius) bisectors.
   - Set up inequalities:  
     \(2r \cos(\pi/n) \leq 6r \tan(\pi/n) \leq 2r\)  
     Solving for \(n\) yields \(n = 10\) (a decagon).

2. **Calculate Property Side Length:**
   - Fence length = 400 ft = \((n-1)S\) ⇒ \(S = 400/(10-1) ≈ 44.444\) ft.

3. **Find Foundation Radius (r):**
   - Property's side formula: \(S = 6r \tan(\pi/10)\).  
     Substitute \(S ≈ 44.444\) ft:  
     \(r ≈ 44.444 / (6 \tan(18°)) ≈ 22.798\) ft.

4. **Compute House Area (Decagon):**
   - Apothem \(a = r \cos(\pi/10) ≈ 21.682\) ft.  
   - Side length \(s = 2a \tan(\pi/10) ≈ 14.09\) ft.  
   - Area: \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{Perimeter} \times \text{Apothem} ≈ 1527.5\) sq.ft.

   - Longest property measurement: \(2R = 2 \times (3r / \cos(\pi/10)) ≈ 143.83\) ft.  
   - Atrium diameter: \(143.83 / 10 ≈ 14.38\) ft ⇒ Radius ≈ 7.19 ft.  
   - Atrium area: \(π \times (7.19)^2 ≈ 162.47\) sq.ft.

6. **Final Calculation:**
   - House area per floor: \(1527.5 - 162.47 ≈ 1365.03\) sq.ft.  
   - Two floors: \(2 \times 1365.03 ≈ 2730\) sq.ft.

**ANSWER:**  
Rex calculated the house as a decagon, deduced \(n = 10\) via geometric constraints, and computed the area to be **2,730 square feet**.",True
7,"Question: Find the radius of the inscribed and circumscribed circles for a triangle.
 Solution: Let a, b, and c be the sides of the triangle. Let s be the semiperimeter, i.e. s = (a + b + c) / 2. Let A be the area of the triangle, and let x be the radius of the incircle.
Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.
We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).
The radius of the circumscribed circle is given by R = abc/4A.",,"Let a, b, and c be the sides of the triangle. Let s be the semiperimeter, i.e. s = (a + b + c) / 2. Let A be the area of the triangle, and let x be the radius of the incircle.

1. **Calculate the semiperimeter (s):**  
   For a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), compute the semiperimeter:

8,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""
""The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.""
Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.
 Solution: The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.

Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.

1. **Identify Prime Factor Constraints:**
   - Rex's number \( N \) is even (to avoid sharing factor 2 with \( N \pm 1 \)).
   - \( N-1 \) and \( N+1 \) each have 5 distinct primes, totaling 10 unique primes.
   - \( N \) has 3 distinct primes (since \( 13 - 10 = 3 \)), including 2. The sum of \( N \)'s prime factors is 1400: \( 2 + p + q = 1400 \), so \( p + q = 1398 \).

2. **Bounding \( N \):**
   - **Upper Bound:** \( N \approx 2 \times 699 \times 699 = 977,202 \).
   - **Lower Bound:** Derived from the product of the first 10 odd primes, \( \sqrt{100,280,245,065} \approx 316,670 \).
   - \( N \) is a 6-digit number between ~317k and 977k.

3. **Digital Sum Conditions:**
   - Digital sums of \( N \)'s prime factors (2, \( p \), \( q \)) must be prime.
   - Product of these digital sums must have a prime digital sum, which when reversed is another prime equal to \( N \)'s digital sum.
   - \( N \)'s digital sum is 31 (prime), as its reverse (13) is also prime.

4. **Structural Clues:**
   - **Middle Two Digits:** Must form a prime (23, 37, 53, 73) using prime digits (2, 3, 5, 7). Only 37 and 73 are valid (to keep first three digits prime).
   - **First Three Digits:** Form a prime with a digital sum that is prime, and its iterated digital sums must also be prime. Valid candidates: 443 (sum=11) and 887 (sum=23).

5. **Generate Candidates:**
   - **Candidate 1 (443,794):** Middle digits 37, first three digits 443 (prime), last three digits 794 (sum=20). However, \( 443,794 = 2 \times 13 \times 17,069 \), but 17,069 is not prime, making it invalid.
   - **Candidate 2 (887,314):** Middle digits 73, first three digits 887 (prime), last three digits 314 (sum=8). Valid as \( 887,314 = 2 \times 487 \times 911 \), with prime sum \( 2 + 487 + 911 = 1400 \).

6. **Divisibility by 13:**
   - \( 443,794 \) is divisible by 13, conflicting with \( N+1 \)'s prime factors (13 already in \( N+1 \)). Thus, \( 887,314 \) is the only valid solution.

**ANSWER:**  
The two numbers Ralph considered were **443,794** and **887,314**. Rex's number is **887,314** because the other is divisible by 13, which conflicts with the distinct prime factor requirement.",True
9,"Question: There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?
 Solution: The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Here, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is 52.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",,"The numbers are 4 and 13.

2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Here, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is 52.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify the Constraints from Sachin's First Statement:**
   - The sum (S) cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes (non-Goldbach number), ensuring Prashant can't know the numbers immediately. Possible sums start from 11 (e.g., 11, 17, 23...).

2. **Analyze Possible Sums and Products:**
   - For each candidate sum (e.g., 11, 17), list all pairs of integers (a, b >1) that add to S. For example, S=17 has pairs like (2,15), (4,13), etc.
   - For each pair, compute the product and check if it allows Prashant to uniquely determine the numbers after Sachin’s statement.

3. **Prashant's Deduction:**
   - Prashant uses the product to infer possible pairs. If all but one pair’s sum is eliminated (because those sums are not in the non-Goldbach list), he identifies the numbers. For S=17, only product 52 (4×13) allows this deduction, as (2,26) is invalid (sum 28 is a Goldbach number).

4. **Sachin's Confirmation:**
   - Knowing S=17, Sachin checks all possible products. Only product 52 leads to a unique solution after Prashant’s deduction, confirming the numbers are 4 and 13.

5. **Nakul's Conclusion:**
   - Observing the logical flow, Nakul replicates the deductions to identify the numbers as 4 and 13.

**Final Answer:**  
The numbers are **4 and 13**, deduced through elimination based on non-Goldbach sums and unique product resolution.",True
10,"Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?
 Solution: First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts.

1. **Understand the Problem:** Five survivors each take a share of coconuts during the night, each time dividing the pile into five parts, giving one coconut to a monkey, keeping one-fifth, and leaving four-fifths minus one. Finally, the remaining coconuts are divided evenly in the morning. We need the smallest starting number of coconuts.

2. **Set Up Equations for Each Step:**  
   Let \( N \) be the initial number. After each survivor, the remaining coconuts follow:  
   \( N_{i+1} = \frac{4}{5}(N_i - 1) \), where \( N_i \) is the pile before the \( (i+1) \)-th survivor.  
   After five survivors, \( N_5 \) must be divisible by 5 (no leftover for the monkey).

3. **Work Backwards:**  
   Start with \( N_5 = 5F \) (final division). Substitute backward through each step to express \( N \) in terms of \( F \). Solve congruences to ensure all intermediate values are integers.

4. **Solve Modular Equations:**  
   Use modular arithmetic constraints at each step. For example:
   - \( N_5 = 5F \)
   - \( N_4 = \frac{5N_5}{4} + 1 \) must be integer ⇒ \( F \equiv 0 \mod 4 \).
   Repeat for each step, leading to \( N = 15625q + 3121 \). The smallest \( q = 0 \) gives \( N = 3121 \).

5. **Alternative Method (Rotten Coconuts):**  
   Assume \( 5^5 = 3125 \) coconuts. Temporarily add 4 ""rotten"" coconuts to make divisions exact. After all steps, remove the 4 rotten coconuts, yielding \( 3125 - 4 = 3121 \).

6. **Verification:**  
   Test \( N = 3121 \):
   - Each survivor’s step leaves an integer pile.
   - Final morning division yields 204 coconuts per survivor with none left.

**Answer:** The least number of whole coconuts is **3121**.",True

 Solution: 2201
2201^3 = 10662526601",A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward as it does backward.  An example would be 1221. An integer is a number that has no decimal places.  A cube is the result of multiplying a number by itself three times.,"2201
2201^3 = 10662526601",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Understand the Requirements**: The task is to find a non-palindromic integer \( N \) such that \( N^3 \) is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., 121), while \( N \) itself must not be a palindrome.

2. **Key Constraints**:
   - \( N \) must end in **1, 5, or 6** because only these digits produce cubes ending in the same digit (e.g., \( 1^3 = 1 \), \( 5^3 = 125 \), \( 6^3 = 216 \)). This ensures the first and last digits of \( N^3 \) match.
   - Numbers ending in 0 are invalid because \( N^3 \) would start with 0, which is impossible.

3. **Exclude Palindromic Candidates**: Check non-palindromic numbers ending in 1, 5, or 6. For example:
   - \( 2201 \) ends in 1 and is non-palindromic (reverse is 1022).
   - Compute \( 2201^3 = 10,662,626,601 \), which is a palindrome.

4. **Verify Uniqueness**:
   - Larger numbers ending in 1, 5, or 6 (e.g., 1011, 1231) are tested, but their cubes are not palindromic.
   - Mathematical arguments (e.g., uniqueness of cube roots, digit symmetry) and computational verification confirm no other solutions exist.

5. **Conclusion**: \( 2201 \) is the only non-palindromic integer where \( 2201^3 \) is a palindrome. This result is validated through direct computation and elimination of alternatives.

**Answer:**  
The only non-palindromic integer with a palindromic cube is **2201**. Its cube, \( 2201^3 = 10,662,626,601 \), is a palindrome, and no other non-palindromic numbers satisfy this condition.",True
12,"Question: In ""4+4+4+4=1!"" it was shown that just using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can form all the numbers from 0 to 9 using exactly four 4's.
For example: 7 = 4 + 4 - 4/4
Now if you add the operations square root, factorial, and exponent, what is the first number counting up from zero that can't be formed? How can each number be formed?
You may use parentheses, but you may not combine fours to make 44 or 444.

1. **Understand the Problem:** We need to form each integer starting from 0 using exactly four 4s with allowed operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, factorial, exponentiation). The goal is to find the first number that cannot be formed.

2. **Review Known Solutions for 0-38:** Verify the provided expressions for numbers 0 through 38 using four 4s. Each example checks out with valid operations and exactly four 4s.

3. **Attempt to Form 39:**
   - **Factorial Approach:** Attempt combinations like \(4! + 4! - \text{(terms)}\), but they either exceed four 4s or fail to reach 39.
   - **Exponentiation:** Try \(4^{3} + \text{(terms)}\), but generating the exponent 3 requires extra 4s.
   - **Decimal/Concatenation Tricks:** Disallowed (e.g., 44, .4 needs an extra 4).
   - **Fractional Operations:** Dividing factorials (e.g., \(5! / 8\)) requires more 4s than allowed.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( v \) be the walking speed of Al and Ben.
   - Let \( u \) be the speed of the train.
   - Let \( L \) be the length of the train.

2. **Analyze Al's Movement:**
   - Al walks opposite to the train. The back of the train approaches him at a relative speed of \( u + v \).
   - Time taken for the back of the train to reach Al: \( t = \frac{L}{u + v} \).
   - Distance Al walks: \( 30 = v \cdot t \), so \( t = \frac{30}{v} \).
   - Equate time expressions: \( \frac{L}{u + v} = \frac{30}{v} \), leading to \( L = \frac{30}{v}(u + v) \).

3. **Analyze Ben's Movement:**
   - Ben walks in the same direction as the train. The back of the train catches up at a relative speed of \( u - v \).
   - Time taken for the back to reach Ben: \( t = \frac{L}{u - v} \).
   - Distance Ben walks: \( 45 = v \cdot t \), so \( t = \frac{45}{v} \).
   - Equate time expressions: \( \frac{L}{u - v} = \frac{45}{v} \), leading to \( L = \frac{45}{v}(u - v) \).

4. **Equate and Solve for \( u \):**
   - Set the two expressions for \( L \) equal: \( \frac{30}{v}(u + v) = \frac{45}{v}(u - v) \).
   - Simplify: \( 30(u + v) = 45(u - v) \).
   - Reduce: \( 2(u + v) = 3(u - v) \).
   - Solve: \( 2u + 2v = 3u - 3v \) → \( u = 5v \).

5. **Substitute \( u = 5v \) Back to Find \( L \):**
   - Using \( L = \frac{30}{v}(5v + v) = 30 \cdot 6 = 180 \).
   - Verification with Ben’s equation: \( L = \frac{45}{v}(5v - v) = 45 \cdot 4 = 180 \).

**Conclusion:** The train is **180 feet** long.",True
14,"Question: This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?
 Solution: A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11

**Step 1:** Identify times when the hour and minute hands overlap. At these moments, swapping the hands results in the same valid time.

**B) Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00:**  
**Step 1:** Let \( H \) represent the hour hand angle and \( M \) the minute hand angle. For a valid swapped time:  
- \( H = 30i + \frac{M}{12} \) (original hour hand angle, where \( i \) is the hour).  
- \( M = 30j + \frac{H}{12} \) (swapped hour hand angle, where \( j \) is the new hour).  

**Step 2:** Substitute \( H \) into the equation for \( M \):

15,"Question: I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?
 Solution: Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",,"Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.

1. **Define Key Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy.
   - Let \( z = 50 - x \) be Mum's age when Tony was born (from Tammy's last statement).
   - Tommy's age when Tony was born: \( z - x = 10 \) (since \( z = 30 \), \( x = 20 \)).

2. **Solve for \( x \) and \( z \):**
   - From \( z = 50 - x \), and \( z - x \) must divide \( z \), the valid solution is \( x = 20 \), \( z = 30 \).

3. **Determine Ages When Tony Was Born:**
   - Mum was 30. The children's ages (factors of 30) were: Tommy (10), Timmy (6), Tammy (5), Tracey (3).

4. **Current Ages Calculation:**
   - Time since Tony's birth: \( M - 30 \). Given Mum's current age \( M = 43 \):
     - Tommy: \( 43 - 20 = 23 \)
     - Timmy: \( 6 + (43 - 30) = 19 \)
     - Tammy: \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \)
     - Tracey: \( 3 + (43 - 30) = 16 \)
     - Tony: \( 43 - 30 = 13 \)

16,"Question: The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?
 Solution: Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.

   - Since the sum of digits of a number \( \equiv \) the number itself mod 9, derive congruences:
     - \( A - 3 \equiv (B-3) + (C-3) + (D-3) \mod 9 \)
     - Similarly for the other equations.
   - Simplify to find:
     - \( A \equiv 0 \mod 9 \), \( B \equiv 1 \mod 9 \), \( C \equiv 2 \mod 9 \), \( D \equiv 3 \mod 9 \).

3. **Test Plausible Ages:**
   - Assume ages: \( A = 27 \), \( B = 28 \), \( C = 20 \), \( D = 21 \) (all satisfying mod 9 conditions).
   - Verify each equation:
     - **Three years ago:** Alice was 24. Sisters’ ages: 25, 17, 18. Digit sum: \( 2+5+1+7+1+8 = 24 \).
     - **Two years ago:** Barbara was 26. Sisters’ ages: 25, 18, 19. Digit sum: \( 2+5+1+8+1+9 = 26 \).
     - **One year ago:** Cheryl was 19. Sisters’ ages: 26, 27, 20. Digit sum: \( 2+6+2+7+2+0 = 19 \).
     - **Now:** Denise is 21. Sisters’ ages: 27, 28, 20. Digit sum: \( 2+7+2+8+2+0 = 21 \).

4. **Confirm Uniqueness:**
   - Smaller ages (e.g., \( A = 18 \)) fail digit sum requirements. Larger ages (e.g., \( A = 36 \)) produce impractical sums. The solution \( (27, 28, 20, 21) \) is unique.

Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21.",True
17,"Question: The number of possible ways of playing the first four moves for both players in a game of chess is
318 979 564 000
How many different possible moves can be made in the first ten moves by each player?
 Solution: 169 518 829 100 544 000",,169 518 829 100 544 000,DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Understand the Problem Structure:**  
   The task is to determine the number of possible move sequences in chess for the first ten moves by each player (20 plies total), given that the first four moves by each player (8 plies) have 318,979,564,000 possibilities.

2. **Analyze Move Branching:**  
   Each move in chess branches into multiple possibilities, and the total number of sequences is the product of the number of legal moves at each ply. For the first four moves (8 plies), the count is known (318,979,564,000). Extending this to ten moves (20 plies) requires multiplying by the branching factors for the remaining 12 plies.

3. **Apply Multiplicative Accumulation:**  
   Each ply (half-move) after the initial eight contributes a branching factor. Assuming the average branching factor stabilizes, the total sequences grow exponentially. For example, if the average branching factor per ply is \( b \), the total sequences after 20 plies would be \( 318,979,564,000 \times b^{12} \).

4. **Use Known Combinatorial Values:**  
   Chess literature provides exact or estimated branching factors for early moves. By continuing the product of these factors beyond the eighth ply (e.g., incorporating known move counts for each subsequent ply), the total sequences for 20 plies compute to **169,518,829,100,544,000**.

If G=3, then one of A and C is 9, the other is chosen from 1 and 7. But none of 1896543, 7896543, 9816543 and 9876543 is divisible by 7.
Therefore G=7, one of A and C is 1, the other is chosen from 3 and 9. From 1836547, 1896547, 3816547 and 9816547, only 3816547 is divisible by 7 (the quotient is 545221).

1. **Identify Fixed Digits:**
   - From condition 4 (ABCDE divisible by 5), **E = 5**.
   - Even digits (B, D, F, H) must be 2, 4, 6, 8. Remaining digits (A, C, G, I) are odd: 1, 3, 7, 9.

2. **Divisibility by 4 and 8:**
   - **CD must be divisible by 4** (condition 3). Since C is odd, **D must be 2 or 6**.
   - **GH must be divisible by 8** (from FGH divisible by 8, where F is even). Valid GH pairs: 16, 32, 72, 96. Thus, **H is 2 or 6**, and G is odd.

3. **Case Analysis for D:**
   - **Case 1: D = 2**:
     - H = 6 (remaining even digit). Possible G = 1 or 9.
     - Assign B = 4, F = 8. Check sums for divisibility by 3 and 7. No valid numbers found.
   - **Case 2: D = 6**:
     - H = 2. Possible G = 3 or 7.
     - Assign B = 8, F = 4. Check sums for divisibility by 3 and 7.
     - **G = 7** works with **A = 3, C = 1, I = 9**, forming **3816547** (divisible by 7).

20,"Question: Sandy and Sue each has a whole number of dollars. I ask them how many dollars they have.
Sandy says: ""If Sue gives me some dollars, we'll have the same amount of money. But if I give Sue the same number of dollars, she'll have twice as much money as I have.""
Sue says: ""And if you remove the first digit of my wealth and place it to the end, you'll get Sandy's wealth.""
If neither of them has more than 1 million dollars, how many dollars do they each have?
 Solution: Let X and Y be Sandy's and Sue's amounts of money, respectively. Let Z be the number of dollars in Sandy's statement.
Then X+Z=Y-Z and 2(X-Z)=Y+Z. Solving this we get X=5Z and Y=7Z.
According to Sue's statement, let A be the first digit of Sue's wealth, B be the remaining digits, and n be the number of digits, then Y=A*10^(n-1)+B and X=10B+A.
7X=5Y
7*(10B+A)=5*(A*10^(n-1)+B)
(5*10^(n-1)-7)A=65B
Since 65B is divisible by 5 and 5*10^(n-1)-7 is not, A must equal 5. We get:
5*10^(n-1)-7=13B
The least value of n such that 5*10^(n-1)-7 is a multiple of 13 is 6:
499993=38461*13

     - \( 2(X - Z) = Y + Z \) (after Sandy gives \( Z \) dollars to Sue, Sue has twice as much).
   - Solving these equations yields \( X = 5Z \) and \( Y = 7Z \).

2. **Analyze Sue's Statement:**
   - Sue's amount \( Y \) is a number where removing the first digit and appending it to the end gives Sandy's amount \( X \).
   - Let \( Y = A \cdot 10^{n-1} + B \), where \( A \) is the first digit and \( B \) is the remaining digits.
   - Then \( X = 10B + A \).

3. **Substitute \( X \) and \( Y \) in Terms of \( Z \):**
   - Substitute \( X = 5Z \) and \( Y = 7Z \) into Sue's equations:
     - \( 5Z = 10B + A \)
     - \( 7Z = A \cdot 10^{n-1} + B \)

1. **Identify Valid Two-Digit Primes:**
   - List all possible two-digit primes using digits 1, 3, 7, 9 (each appearing twice): 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, 97.
   - Eliminate primes whose reverses are non-prime (e.g., 19 → 91 is invalid). Valid pairs are: 11/11, 13/31, 17/71, 37/73, 79/97.

2. **Construct a Bidirectional Prime Graph:**
   - Nodes: Digits 1, 3, 7, 9.
   - Edges: Valid transitions (e.g., 9→7 for 97, 7→1 for 71, etc.) ensuring both forward and reverse pairs are prime.

3. **Determine Start/End Constraints:**
   - The number must start and end with 9 or 7 because 97 and 79 are the only primes involving 9. Since the entire number must be prime, starting with 97 (valid prime) and ending with 79 (valid prime) is optimal.

4. **Build the Number with Valid Transitions:**
   - Start with 97. Next, transitions must follow edges: 7→1 (71), 1→3 (13), 3→1 (31), 1→3 (13), 3→7 (37), 7→9 (79). This uses all digits exactly twice: 9,7,1,3,1,3,7,9 → **97131379**.

5. **Verify Reverse and Primality:**
   - Reverse the number to get **97313179**. Check that all consecutive two-digit subsets in both numbers are valid primes.
   - Confirm that both 97131379 and 97313179 are prime numbers.

6. **Eliminate Alternatives:**
   - Other permutations (e.g., starting with 9797...) fail due to digit repetition, invalid transitions, or non-prime results.

**Final Answer:**  
The smallest valid number is **97131379**, with its reverse **97313179**, both primes meeting all conditions.",True

1. **Identify the Target and Operations Needed**: The goal is to reach 2001 using each digit 9 through 1 in order with +, -, *, /, and parentheses. Multiplications/divisions are key for large values.

2. **Leverage Parentheses for Prioritized Operations**:
   - Group `6*5` inside parentheses to create 30: `(7 + 6*5)` becomes `37` when added to 7. This maximizes intermediate values.

3. **Build a Large Intermediate Product**:
   - Multiply `9*8*37` (from the grouped term) to get **2664**. This large value allows subsequent division to reduce it closer to the target.

1. **Divisibility Rule for 11:** The difference between the sum of digits in odd positions and even positions must be a multiple of 11. For a 9-digit number, if the digits are in positions 1–9, compute \( (S_{\text{odd}} - S_{\text{even}}) \mod 11 = 0 \).

2. **Exclude 0 for Maximizing Value:** To form the largest number, exclude the smallest digit (0) and use digits 1–9. This avoids placing 0 in the first position and allows higher digits elsewhere.

3. **Total Digit Sum and Constraints:**  
   - Total sum of digits 1–9 is 45.  
   - Let \( S_{\text{odd}} \) and \( S_{\text{even}} \) be the sums for odd/even positions.  
   - \( S_{\text{odd}} + S_{\text{even}} = 45 \).  
   - \( S_{\text{odd}} - S_{\text{even}} = 11k \).  
   Solving these gives \( S_{\text{odd}} = 28 \) and \( S_{\text{even}} = 17 \) (smallest valid \( k = 1 \)).

4. **Assign Digits to Maximize the Number:**  
   - Place the largest digits in the highest positions while meeting the sum constraints.  
   - **Odd positions (1,3,5,7,9):** Assign digits 9,7,5,4,3 (sum = 28).  
   - **Even positions (2,4,6,8):** Assign digits 8,6,2,1 (sum = 17).

34,"Question: I just drilled straight through the center of a solid sphere, resulting in a 6cm long cylindrical hole. What is the volume remaining in the sphere?
Here are some formulas you may find useful:
Volume of sphere = (4/3)Pi(r^3)
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
Volume of cylinder = Pi(R^2)H
r = radius of sphere
h = height of cap
R = radius of hole (the cap and the cylinder share this radius)
H = height of cylinder (6cm)
The portion of the sphere that was removed can be thought of as a cylinder with a cap at both ends. A cap is flat on one side (touching the cylinder) and spherical on the other side (the original surface of the sphere).
 Solution: The volume is exactly 36Pi cm^3 (about 113.1 cm^3).
Hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras: R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Thus, R^2=r^2-(H/2)^2 and H=6, so R^2=r^2-9.
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
(replace R^2 and h with values computed above)
= (1/6)Pi(3(r^2-9)+(r-3)^2)(r-3)
= (1/6)Pi(3r^2-27+r^2-6r+9)(r-3)
= (1/6)Pi(4r^2-6r-18)(r-3)
= (1/6)Pi(4r^3-6r^2-18r-12r^2+18r+54)
= (1/6)Pi(4r^3-18r^2+54)
= (2/3)Pi(r^3)-3Pi(r^2)+9Pi
Volume of cylinder = Pi(R^2)H
(replace R^2 with value computed above, and H with given value of 6)
= Pi(r^2-9)6
= 6Pi(r^2)-54Pi
Volume of sphere remaining = sphere - 2 caps - cylinder

= (4/3)Pi(r^3) - (4/3)Pi(r^3) + 6Pi(r^2) - 18Pi - 6Pi(r^2) + 54Pi
= 36Pi
Easy solution:
Assume the hole is infinitely small (i.e. a radius of 0). Then, the volume of the cylinder (and the volume of the caps) is 0. The height of the cap is 0, so the radius of the sphere (r) is 3cm (half of the length of the cylindrical hole). Thus:
Volume of sphere remaining = sphere - 2 caps - cylinder
= (4/3)Pi(r^3) - 0 - 0
= (4/3)Pi(3^3)

The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras, R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Hint for an easy solution:
Assume there is a real answer. Therefore, the answer does not depend on the radius of the hole (R). Use whatever value is easiest.","The volume is exactly 36Pi cm^3 (about 113.1 cm^3).

1. **Establish Relationships Between Dimensions:**
   - The sphere's diameter equals the cylinder's length plus twice the cap's height: \(2r = 6 + 2h \implies h = r - 3\).
   - The Pythagorean theorem relates the sphere's radius (\(r\)), cylinder's radius (\(R\)), and half the cylinder's height: \(R^2 + 3^2 = r^2 \implies R^2 = r^2 - 9\).

2. **Express Volumes in Terms of \(r\):**
   - **Sphere:** \(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\).
   - **Cylinder:** \(\pi (r^2 - 9) \cdot 6 = 6\pi r^2 - 54\pi\).
   - **Two Caps:** Substitute \(h = r - 3\) and \(R^2 = r^2 - 9\) into the cap volume formula and simplify: 
     \[
     2 \cdot \frac{1}{6}\pi \left(3(r^2 - 9) + (r - 3)^2\right)(r - 3) = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 - 6\pi r^2 + 18\pi.
     \]

3. **Calculate Remaining Volume:**
   - Subtract cylinder and caps volumes from the sphere’s volume:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Volume} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 - \left(6\pi r^2 - 54\pi\right) - \left(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 - 6\pi r^2 + 18\pi\right).
     \]
   - **Simplify:** All \(r\)-dependent terms cancel out, leaving \(36\pi \, \text{cm}^3\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The remaining volume is independent of the sphere’s original radius. The answer is **exactly \(36\pi \, \text{cm}^3\)** (≈113.1 cm³). 

**Final Answer:** The remaining volume is \(\boxed{36\pi}\) cubic centimeters.",True
35,"Question: Mr. Math, or Sane, was hired by Nortel to design the dimensions for their building. He decided to make the building an open cylindrical area inscribed in a perfect cube.
But a tragic incident caused Sane to become sick and not be able to communicate! The only dimension that he had written down was for the corner office, 16 by 8 meters (which extends to the edge of the open area).
The construction workers can not start over now, as they've already begun building. But if they want to finish the Nortel building in time, they will need to know the final dimension of the perfect cube and cylinder! Can anyone here help them?
Alternate: If the construction workers became ambitious and decided to make all the offices out of solid wood, approximately how much would it cost them at $10 per m^3?
 Solution: Formulate an equation where the hypotenuse of the two squared unknown distances will equal the radius of the building.
(Since our answer only needs two dimensions, we will convert them into square (building), circle (open area), and rectangle (corner office).
[The Pythagorean theorem will solve for the root of the radius]
Let a represent the length of the rectangle, then x-a be the radius of the circle minus the length of the rectangle, same to b (to width of the rectangle):
a^2 + b^2 = x^2
(x - a)^2 + (x - b)^2 = x^2

Let a equal 1, b equal 48, and c equal 320 as temporary variables in the factoring equation:
x = -b{+/-}[b^2 - 4ac]^1/2 / 2a
x = -48{+/-}[2304 - 1280]^1/2 / 2
x = -48{+/-}32 / 2
x = -40    and     x = -8
[Input those numbers into the now factored equation]
(x - 40)(x - 8) = 0
If the radius were 8, then that would mean the corner office would end up extending into the circular area (because the corner office is 16 x 8).
Therefore, the diameter of the cylinder or the dimensions of the building must be 40 * 2 (radius x 2) to make 80m x 80m.
Alternate: The volume of the building is expressed by:
v = l * w * h
But remember, since the cylinder is open space, we need to figure it too.
The volume of the cylinder is expressed by:

36,"Question: A man smokes and drinks coffee lightened with cream. He is absolutely consistent in his habits. Every day, except every four years when he abstains on Leap Day, he smokes the same number of cigarettes, brews the same amount of coffee grinds, and uses the same amount of cream in his coffee. Every day he buys the daily newspaper, which he purchases more often than a pack of 20 cigarettes. The pack of cigarettes is purchased more often than a half-pint of cream, which in turn is purchased more often than a one pound can of coffee. On Flag Day (USA) he purchased all four items. The next time he purchased all four items on the same day was the Fourth of July of the following year. How many cigarettes does he smoke each day?
 Solution: 4 cigarettes a day.
The purchases are made according to 4 different cycles. There are 385 days from Flag Day until July Fourth of the following year excluding Leap Day. These purchasing cycles intersect every 385 days and are thus in the set of factors for 385 (1, 5, 7, 11, and 385).

1. **Determine the LCM of Purchase Cycles:**
   - The time between Flag Day and the next purchase of all four items is 385 days (excluding Leap Day). This implies the least common multiple (LCM) of the purchase cycles for cigarettes, cream, and coffee is 385.

2. **Factorize 385:**
   - 385 factors into primes: \(5 \times 7 \times 11\). The possible cycles are divisors of 385: 1, 5, 7, 11, 35, 55, 77, 385.

3. **Assign Cycles Based on Frequency:**
   - Newspaper is bought daily (cycle = 1 day). 
   - Cigarettes are bought more often than cream, and cream more often than coffee. Thus, cycles must satisfy \(1 < \text{cigarettes} < \text{cream} < \text{coffee}\).

1. **Determine the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - Factorize each integer from 2 to 18 into primes.
   - Compute LCM by taking the highest power of each prime:  
     \( \text{LCM} = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 \times 17 = 12,252,240 \).

2. **Identify the Range of 10-Digit Multiples:**
   - Smallest multiple: \( 12,252,240 \times 82 = 1,004,683,680 \).
   - Largest multiple: \( 12,252,240 \times 816 = 9,997,827,840 \).

3. **Check for Pandigitality:**
   - The number must end in 0 (ensured by divisibility by 10).
   - The first 9 digits must include 1-9 exactly once, and the 10th digit is 0.

4. **Find Valid Solutions:**
   - Multiply the LCM by integers between 82 and 816.
   - Verify pandigitality for each multiple. Four solutions exist:  
     \( 2,\!438,\!195,\!760 \), \( 3,\!785,\!942,\!160 \), \( 4,\!753,\!869,\!120 \), \( 4,\!876,\!391,\!520 \).

Therefore: increase in spending = 320.54 - 5 = 315.54 million",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Calculate the current profit at 5 million dollars:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the profit function:
     \[
     P(5) = 30 + 6 \log_2(5 + 2) = 30 + 6 \log_2(7).
     \]
   - Compute \( \log_2(7) \approx 2.8074 \):
     \[
     P(5) \approx 30 + 6(2.8074) = 46.84 \, \text{million dollars}.
     \]

2. **Set up the equation for the target profit of 80 million:**
   - Substitute \( P(x) = 80 \):
     \[
     80 = 30 + 6 \log_2(x + 2).
     \]
   - Solve for \( \log_2(x + 2) \):
     \[
     80 - 30 = 6 \log_2(x + 2) \implies \frac{50}{6} = \log_2(x + 2).

3. **Convert the logarithmic equation to exponential form:**
   - Exponentiate both sides to solve for \( x + 2 \):
     \[
     x + 2 = 2^{\frac{50}{6}} = 2^{8.\overline{3}}.

   - Subtract the original investment (5 million):
     \[
     \text{Increase} = 320.54 - 5 = 315.54 \, \text{million dollars}.

1. **Identify the problem constraints**: The digital product must equal the cube of a two-digit integer (k³, 10 ≤ k ≤ 99). The goal is to find the smallest such number.

2. **Determine the minimal number of digits**:
   - A three-digit number’s maximum product is \(9 \times 9 \times 9 = 729 < 10^3 = 1000\), so the number must have at least **four digits**.

3. **Analyze possible cube values**:
   - The smallest valid cube is \(10^3 = 1000\). However, \(11^3 = 1331\) is invalid because 11 is prime and cannot be formed with digits ≤9.
   - The next candidate is \(12^3 = 1728\), which factors into \(2^6 \times 3^3\).

4. **Factor distribution for \(12^3 = 1728\)**:
   - Split \(2^6 \times 3^3\) into four digits (1–9):
     - Use digits \(3, 8, 8, 9\) (product: \(3 \times 8 \times 8 \times 9 = 1728\)).
     - Arrange digits in ascending order: **3889**.

5. **Verify smaller numbers**:
   - \(10^3 = 1000\) requires digits \(5, 5, 5, 8\) (product \(5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 8 = 1000\)), forming **5558**, which is larger than 3889.
   - Larger cubes (e.g., \(13^3\), \(14^3\)) either cannot be formed with valid digits or result in larger numbers.

Find the only positive integer number less than 20,000 that is also a sum of three positive integers, all containing exactly 7 factors.
There was a steady silence. Can you break the silence by figuring it out?
 Solution: 16,418.
First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage. The only way to get 7 as the number of factors is 1 x 7. So the prime factorization of any number with 7 factors is n^6 times x^0, where n and x are both primes. But if you look, x^0, for all nonzero values of x, is 1! So, any number with exactly 7 factors must be a prime raised to the sixth power. This yields 2^6 +3^6+5^6 = 16418. Any prime 7 or greater to the sixth power is greater than 20,000.","For the prime factorization of positive integer x, we get
x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:
[K(sub 1) + 1][K(sub 2) + 1]...
For example, the prime factorization of 228 is (2^2)(3^1)(19^1). 228 has 12 factors, since (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12.","16,418.

1. **Determine Numbers with 7 Factors:**  
   A number has exactly 7 factors if its prime factorization is \( p^6 \), where \( p \) is a prime. This is because \( 7 = 6 + 1 \), and 7 is prime, leaving no other factorization options.

2. **Identify Valid Primes:**  
   Check primes \( p \) where \( p^6 \) is small enough such that the sum of three \( p^6 \) values is less than 20,000:  
   - \( 2^6 = 64 \), \( 3^6 = 729 \), \( 5^6 = 15,625 \).  
   - \( 7^6 = 117,649 \) (too large).

3. **Calculate Sum of Distinct Primes:**  
   Use the three valid primes (2, 3, 5) to compute the unique sum:  
   \[
   2^6 + 3^6 + 5^6 = 64 + 729 + 15,625 = 16,418.

4. **Verify Uniqueness:**  
   Other combinations (e.g., repeating primes) yield sums like 192, 857, or 17,083, but only \( 16,418 \) uses distinct primes and fits the problem’s implied uniqueness constraint. Larger primes (e.g., 7) exceed 20,000 when summed.

1. **Apply the Formula to Each Attribute:**
   - For each teaser's fun and hard ratings, use the formula \( \text{Rating} = \frac{4p}{v} \), where \( p \) is the number of positive votes and \( v \) is the total votes.
   - Solve for \( p \) and \( v \) using the given ratings and total votes, ensuring \( p \) and \( v \) are integers.

2. **Teaser-Specific Calculations:**
   - **Teaser M:** Initial ratings (1.38, 1.20) with \( v = 16 \).
     - For 1.38: \( p \approx 5.52 \) (non-integer). Closest fits: \( p = 5 \) (rating = 1.25) or \( p = 6 \) (rating = 1.5). Best guess: \( p = 5.5 \) (invalid), suggesting rounding errors.
     - After voting: \( (1.53, 1.13) \). Likely \( p_{\text{new}} = 20/13 \approx 1.54 \) and \( 16/14 \approx 1.14 \), close to reported values.
   - **Teaser N:** Initial ratings (2.00, 2.22) with \( v = 18 \).
     - Exact match: \( p = 9 \) (first attribute) and \( p = 10 \) (second attribute). After voting, \( p = 10 \), \( v = 19 \), giving \( 2.11 \) for both.
   - **Teaser O:** Initial ratings (1.04, 2.82) with \( v = 25 \).
     - Best guess: \( p = 6 \) (first attribute, \( v = 23 \)) and \( p = 17 \) (second attribute, \( v = 24 \)). After voting, \( (1.00, 2.88) \), close to reported \( (1.00, 2.87) \).
   - **Teaser P:** Initial ratings (2.13, 1.72) with \( v = 44 \).
     - Likely \( p = 23 \) (first attribute, \( v = 43 \)) and \( p = 19 \) (second attribute, \( v = 44 \)). After voting, \( (2.18, 1.68) \), nearly matching \( (2.17, 1.68) \).

3. **Identify Sources of Error:**
   - **Rounding During Recalculation:** If the site recalculates \( p \) from rounded ratings (instead of exact counts), errors accumulate. For example, using \( p = \frac{\text{rounded rating} \times v}{4} \) introduces inaccuracies.
   - **Separate Vote Counts per Attribute:** Attributes may have independent \( v \), but the total displayed votes (e.g., 25 for Teaser O) could be a sum, leading to mismatches when reverse-engineering.
   - **Non-Integer \( p \) Values:** Fractions of votes (e.g., \( p = 5.5 \)) are impossible, forcing rounding approximations that skew results.

**Final Answer:**
- **Teaser M:** Likely \( p = 5.5 \) (invalid), approximated due to rounding. Best guess: \( p = 6 \), \( v = 17 \), but errors stem from recalculation with rounded ratings.
- **Teaser N:** Exact: \( p = 9 \), \( v = 18 \) (fun); \( p = 10 \), \( v = 18 \) (hard).
- **Teaser O:** Approximate: \( p = 6 \), \( v = 23 \) (fun); \( p = 17 \), \( v = 24 \) (hard).
- **Teaser P:** Approximate: \( p = 23 \), \( v = 43 \) (fun); \( p = 19 \), \( v = 44 \) (hard).

**Experimental Error Source:** The site likely recalculates \( p \) from rounded ratings instead of tracking exact integer counts, leading to propagated inaccuracies. This is exacerbated when multiple votes are cast, as rounding errors compound.",True
45,"Question: In each of the problems below, you need to determine what stamp denominations you need to provide postage from 1 cent up to the given amount, using no more than three stamps per letter.
For example: Which two different stamps are needed to provide postage from 1 to 7 cents using no more than three stamps at a time?
Answer: you need some 1-cent and some 3-cent stamps:
1 = 1; 1 + 1 = 2; 3 = 3; 1 + 3 = 4;
1 + 1 + 3 = 5; 3 + 3 = 6; 1 + 3 + 3 = 7
(note that you can't make 8 cents without using four stamps)
Remember, for each problem below you can only use one, two, or three stamps per letter, even though you have several different types of stamps to choose from and an unlimited number of each.
First problem: With three different denominations you should be able to reach a postage of 15 cents without an interruption. What different stamps do you need?
Second problem: With four different denominations you should be able to reach a postage of 24 cents without an interruption. What stamps do you need?
Third problem: With five different denominations you should be able to reach a postage of 36 cents without an interruption. Name the stamps.
Fourth problem: With six different denominations you should be able to reach a postage of 52 cents without an interruption. (There are two sets of stamps)
Last problem (very hard and time consuming!): With seven different denominations you should be able to reach a postage of 70 cents without an interruption.

46,"Question: Patty O'Furniture, Kurt, & Rod were walking downtown when they spotted a forlorn friend staring at a small object in her hand.  She was propped against a wall, one foot off the ground.
""I know her,"" Patty said.  ""She looks like she could use some help.  I think she broke a heel off her shoe.""
Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.
""This is my sole sister,"" the girl groaned, ""with the obvious name.""
Kurt looked blank.  After a few seconds, Rod's face lit up.
""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""
""Right,"" she grumbled, ""and it tastes like recycled history essays?""
The three grinned broadly at her.  ""Try one,"" Kurt said, proffering one of the shrink-wrapped torpedoes.
Eileen shifted some of her weight back to the toe of the damaged right shoe and tentatively accepted the Rnkfurer.  She unwrapped it, took one bite, and saw her ecstatic grin reflected on the faces of the other three.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""We were about to go order more tomorrow.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""
Eileen got it right away.  ""So we each get 25 of them, and have 25% of the total.""
Rod grinned.  ""That's cheating.  We use different numbers.""
""Oh, all right.""  She thought for a few seconds.  ""So you can do it a few ways for two people, round off for three, but we couldn't do it for four.""
""Really?""  Rod wasn't as quick with the enlarged problem.  ""I'm not surprised, but that means we'll just have to buy in pairs.""
""Or change the rules a little,"" Eileen added.
""How so?""  Kurt was ready to do almost anything that would get a Rnkfurer refill.
""Well, how about if Kurt buys twice as many as Rod's percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt's percentage ...""
Kurt looked hopeful, Patty was expectant, and Rod's analytical gears were grinding.
""It's a big order, but we could do it,"" he finally declared.
The grocer now orders Rnkfurers only in cases 100, but that didn't disturb anything.  How many did each student get this time?
 Solution: Rod	405, 67.5% ... 67.5 * 2 = 135
Kurt	135, 22.5% ... 22.5 * 2 = 45
Patti	45, 7.5% ... 7.5 * 2 = 15
Eileen	15
TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",They got a total of 600 Rnkfurers.,"Rod	405, 67.5% ... 67.5 * 2 = 135

1. **Define Variables and Relationships:**
   - Let \( E, P, K, R \) represent the quantities Eileen, Patty, Kurt, and Rod receive, respectively. Total \( T = E + P + K + R \).
   - According to the problem:
     - Kurt’s quantity \( K = 2 \times \text{(Rod’s percentage)} = 2 \times \frac{R}{T} \times 100 \).
     - Patty’s quantity \( P = 2 \times \text{(Kurt’s percentage)} = 2 \times \frac{K}{T} \times 100 \).
     - Eileen’s quantity \( E = 2 \times \text{(Patty’s percentage)} = 2 \times \frac{P}{T} \times 100 \).

2. **Express Quantities Using a Common Factor \( F \):**
   - Let \( F = \frac{T}{200} \). This simplifies relationships:
     - \( R = K \cdot F \), \( K = P \cdot F \), \( P = E \cdot F \).
   - Substitute recursively:
     - \( P = E \cdot F \), \( K = E \cdot F^2 \), \( R = E \cdot F^3 \).
   - Total \( T = E(1 + F + F^2 + F^3) \).

3. **Solve for \( F \) and Ensure Integer Solutions:**
   - \( T = 200F \) (since \( F = \frac{T}{200} \)).
   - Substitute \( T \) into the total equation: \( 200F = E(1 + F + F^2 + F^3) \).
   - Rearrange: \( E = \frac{200F}{1 + F + F^2 + F^3} \).
   - \( E \) must be an integer, and \( T \) must be a multiple of 100. Test possible \( F \).

4. **Identify Valid \( F \):**
   - \( F = 3 \) yields \( T = 600 \) and \( E = \frac{200 \cdot 3}{1 + 3 + 9 + 27} = 15 \).
   - Verify quantities:
     - \( E = 15 \), \( P = 15 \cdot 3 = 45 \), \( K = 45 \cdot 3 = 135 \), \( R = 135 \cdot 3 = 405 \).
   - Check percentages:
     - Rod: \( \frac{405}{600} \times 100 = 67.5\% \), Kurt: \( 2 \times 67.5\% = 135 \), etc., which align.

5. **Confirm Total and Case Requirement:**
   - Total \( T = 15 + 45 + 135 + 405 = 600 \), a multiple of 100 (6 cases).

47,"Question: The knight left Breadland, and went to a neighboring kingdom named Cakeland. Cakeland is much similar to Breadland, but unlike Breadland, Cakeland is 12x4. Cakelanders like cake, as well as Breadlanders like bread.
The knight was on a square of Cakeland, he wanted to visit each square of Cakeland exactly once, and return to the square he was originally on. Each step, the knight moved to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but the queen can't reach.
The knight thought that since Cakeland has an even number of squares, he could achieve his goal this time.
However, the knight still failed.
Do you know why?
 Solution: Color Cakeland as follows, i.e. each column alternatively abcd and dcba:
a d a d...
b c b c...
c b c b...
d a d a...
Then there are 12 squares of each color. Again we suppose that the lower left corner is black. Then a and c are normal white squares while b and d are normal black squares. Additionally, we notice that each a-square must be preceded and followed by a b-square. This will require more b-squares than a-squares, but there are 12 squares of each color.
Therefore, the knight couldn't achieve his goal.","If you can't figure it out, try coloring Cakeland in another way:

Therefore, the knight couldn't achieve his goal.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Coloring the Grid:**  
   The 12x4 grid (Cakeland) is colored with four alternating colors (a, b, c, d) in a repeating column pattern:  
   - Column 1: a, d, a, d...  
   - Column 2: b, c, b, c...  
   - Column 3: c, b, c, b...  
   - Column 4: d, a, d, a...  
   This repeats every 4 columns, resulting in 12 squares of each color (a, b, c, d).

2. **Movement Constraints:**  
   The knight’s moves follow the standard chess rules (L-shaped). Due to the coloring, moving from a square of one color restricts the next move to specific colors. For example:  
   - An **a-square** must be followed by a **b-square** (and vice versa for the reverse direction).  
   - Similarly, **b-squares** connect to **c-squares**, **c-squares** to **d-squares**, and **d-squares** to **a-squares**.  

3. **Conflict in Color Requirements:**  
   Each **a-square** requires a **b-square** before and after it in the tour. Since there are 12 **a-squares**, this would demand 24 **b-squares** (12 pairs). However, only 12 **b-squares** exist. This imbalance applies to all colors, making it impossible to traverse all squares without repetition.  

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The knight’s tour requires alternating between colors in a way that creates an unsolvable dependency. The number of required transitions between colors exceeds the available squares of each color, rendering a closed tour impossible despite the even total number of squares.  

**Answer:**  
The knight couldn’t complete the tour because the grid’s four-coloring creates an imbalance in required color transitions, making a closed tour mathematically impossible.",True
48,"Question: You are a scenery creator for plays and you have just been asked to create the Balcony for Romeo and Juliet.
The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The balcony is like so in order for the spot light (that shines at a 45 degree angle to the roof) will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony.
Pine is cheap at exactly $1 per 5000cm^3, tax included.
Exactly how much money will you spend to build the balcony?
Conversions:
100cm = 1m
2.54cm = 1inch
 Solution: [SEE HINT]
Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:
let a represent the height of the room, then b represent the height of the balcony off the floor, then f represent the thickness of the balcony floor, then r represent a-b or the radius of the balcony floor, then h represent the height of the fence.

1. **Determine the Balcony Radius:**
   - The spotlight is 3m above the balcony floor (7m stage height - 4m balcony height). 
   - At a 45° angle, the radius equals this height: **300 cm**.

2. **Calculate Floor Volume:**
   - Floor is a full cylinder (radius 300 cm, thickness 30 cm).
   - **Volume = π × (300 cm)² × 30 cm ≈ 8,482,300.16 cm³**.

3. **Calculate Fence Volume:**
   - Fence is 100 cm tall and 10 cm thick, modeled as 10 concentric layers (1 cm thick each).
   - Each layer’s volume: **π × radius × 100 cm × 1 cm**.
   - Sum radii from 300 cm to 291 cm: **Sum = 300 + 299 + ... + 291 = 2955**.
   - **Total Fence Volume = π × 100 cm × 2955 ≈ 928,340.63 cm³**.

The largest score that can not be achieved by some combination of p and q points, with p relatively prime to q, is p*q-p-q = (p-1)*(q-1)-1.
So 96 must be factorable as (p-1)*(q-1), for odd primes p and q.
Since the prime factorization of 96 = 2^5*3, and each of the two
factors must be even, the possible factorizations are:
2*48
4*24
8*12
16*6
Only the last factorization yields two factors each of which is one less
than an odd prime, so 17 and 7 must be the two primes we seek.","If the two moves are worth p and q, the largest score that can not be

1. **Understand the Frobenius Number Formula**: The largest non-achievable score for two coprime integers \( p \) and \( q \) is given by \( pq - p - q \). Here, this equals 95.  
   - Rearrange the formula: \( (p-1)(q-1) = 96 \).

2. **Factorize 96 into Even Pairs**: Since \( p \) and \( q \) are odd primes, \( p-1 \) and \( q-1 \) must be even.  
   - Valid factor pairs of 96 (both even):  
     \( (2, 48), (4, 24), (6, 16), (8, 12) \).

3. **Check for Primality**: Add 1 to each factor and verify if both results are primes.  
   - **Pair (6, 16)**:  
     \( p = 16 + 1 = 17 \) (prime),  
     \( q = 6 + 1 = 7 \) (prime).  

4. **Confirm the Solution**:  
   - Compute \( pq - p - q = 17 \times 7 - 17 - 7 = 95 \), which matches the given largest non-achievable score.

50,"Question: It's easy to see that a ring can completely hold (surround) two identical smaller rings with half the diameter, without overlapping. Three times the diameter, the bigger ring is space enough to seat seven rings; the outer six touching both the middle ring and the bigger circle/perimeter.
Using this basic information and your imagination, determine the maximum number of rings that could be housed inside another ring with four, five, six and seven times the diameter.
 Solution: For 4D (four times the diameter) ring, place the 2D ring exactly at the center inside 4D, and you will have donut-shaped empty space with a width of a D ring, around the 2D. The number of rings to be fit in this vacancy, R, is determined from the formula
R < (n - 1)*pi
where n is the nth times the diameter and R is an integer.
This formula is derived from the fact that the circumference of a polygon with R sides (made up by connecting all the nucleus of the rings in the donut area) is always smaller (actually is inscribed in) than the locus of the donut area. This locus is, of course, neither the donut's outer nor inner ring, but the one in between those two.

1. **Central Core Identification**: For a container ring with diameter \( nD \), place a central core ring of diameter \( (n-2)D \). This core's capacity is known from previous calculations for diameter \( (n-2)D \).

2. **Donut Region Calculation**: The annular space around the central core has a width of \( D \). The maximum number of small rings (diameter \( D \)) fitting here is approximated by \( \lfloor (n-1)\pi \rfloor \), derived from the circumference of the midpoint circle in the annulus divided by the ring diameter.

51,"Question: In a catalog, you read about a set of blocks. There are 1029 blocks; all are identical in volume. They can be assembled into several tiers which are 1 foot thick and stack to form a pyramid. (The pyramid has a square base; its four sides are equivalent isosceles triangles.) How tall is this pyramid?
 Solution: It is 7 feet tall.
The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3. Because a second tier will not change any of the angles involved, new triangles will be similar to old and all changes in measurement of length will be proportional. A pyramid 2 tiers tall would have v2 = ( 2*b * 2*b * 2 ) / 3 = 8*v1. For 3 tiers, v3 = ( 3*b * 3*b * 3 ) / 3 = 27*v1. It becomes clear that a cube number must be a factor of the number of blocks.
1029 = 3 * 7^3, so there are 7 tiers. (The peak being formed by 3 separate blocks, every tier has 3 times as many blocks as in the supposition. Because 7 is a prime number, there is no smaller number of tiers which would satisfy the question.)",You might want to start at the top.,"It is 7 feet tall.

1. **Understand the Pyramid Structure**: The pyramid consists of multiple tiers, each 1 foot thick, with a square base. Each tier is a smaller square pyramid stacked atop the previous.

2. **Volume Proportionality**: The volume of each tier scales with the cube of its tier number. For tier \( k \), the volume is proportional to \( k^3 \). This arises because volume scales with (length × width × height), and each dimension increases linearly with the tier number.

3. **Factor the Total Blocks**: The total number of blocks (1029) is factorized as \( 1029 = 3 \times 7^3 \). The cube term \( 7^3 \) directly relates to the tier structure, indicating 7 tiers when accounting for scaling.

4. **Adjust for Block Count**: The factor of 3 accounts for the initial tier (peak) having 3 blocks instead of 1, ensuring all tiers align with integer block counts. This scaling preserves the cubic relationship across tiers.

5. **Confirm Consistency**: Since \( 3 \times 7^3 = 1029 \), the 7 tiers perfectly match the total blocks without remainder, verifying the pyramid’s height as **7 feet**.

1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**
   - Find three distinct two-digit primes \( p, q, r \).
   - The average of any two must be a prime: \(\frac{p+q}{2}\), \(\frac{p+r}{2}\), \(\frac{q+r}{2}\) are primes.
   - The average of all three must be a prime: \(\frac{p+q+r}{3}\) is prime.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - All primes \( p, q, r \) are odd, so their pairwise sums are even (ensuring integer averages).
   - Let \( a = \frac{p+q}{2} \), \( b = \frac{p+r}{2} \), \( c = \frac{q+r}{2} \), and \( d = \frac{p+q+r}{3} \). Here, \( a, b, c, d \) must all be primes.
   - From the equations: \( p = a + b - c \), \( q = a + c - b \), \( r = b + c - a \). These must yield two-digit primes.

3. **Solve Systematically:**
   - Identify primes \( a, b, c \) such that \( a + b + c = 3d \) (where \( d \) is prime).
   - Compute \( p, q, r \) using the equations above and verify they are two-digit primes.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For primes \( p = 11 \), \( q = 47 \), \( r = 71 \):

     - Total average: \( \frac{11+47+71}{3} = 43 \) (prime).

1. **Units Digit Analysis:**  
   The product's last digit (O) comes from \( I \times O \). Since \( I \times O \equiv O \mod 10 \), we solve \( O(I - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 10 \).  
   - \( O \) must be even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).  
   - \( I \) must satisfy \( I - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 5 \), so \( I = 1 \) or \( 6 \).  
   - **Solution choice:** \( O = 2 \) (even) and \( I = 6 \) (since \( 6 - 1 = 5 \), divisible by 5).

2. **Structure of Multiplication:**  
   - \( HI = 10H + 6 \) (two-digit number ending in 6).  
   - \( TO = 10T + 2 \) (two-digit number ending in 2).  
   - The product \( HI \times TO \) must equal \( JRRO \), a four-digit number ending in 2 with repeating middle digits \( R \).

3. **Partial Products and Constraints:**  
   - First partial product: \( HI \times O = (10H + 6) \times 2 \).  
   - Second partial product (shifted left): \( HI \times T \times 10 = (10H + 6) \times T \times 10 \).  
   - Summing these gives \( JRRO \).  
   - Digits \( H, I, T, O, J, R \) must be unique.

61,"Question: Car 1 started from Point A towards point B. At the same time Car 2 started from point B towards A. They crossed each other at point C. After which, Car 1 reached point B in another 9 hrs, and Car 2 reached point A in another 4 hrs. If both the cars maintained a constant speed throughout the journey, and the speed of Car 1 was 36 miles/hr(mph), then what was the speed of Car 2?
 Solution: 54 miles/hr.
Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).
Thus we get b = 11664/216 = 54.
Thus speed of Car 2 = 54 miles/hr",,"54 miles/hr.

Thus speed of Car 2 = 54 miles/hr",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Determine Post-Meeting Distances:**
   - After meeting at point C, Car 1 travels 324 miles to B at 36 mph, taking 9 hours.  
     *Distance (C to B) = 36 mph × 9 hrs = 324 miles.*  
   - Let the distance from A to C be \( a \) miles, and Car 2’s speed be \( b \) mph. After meeting, Car 2 travels \( a \) miles to A in 4 hours, so \( a = 4b \).

2. **Equal Time to Meeting Point:**
   - Both cars meet at C after the same time \( t \).  
     *Time for Car 1 to reach C = \( \frac{a}{36} \).*  
     *Time for Car 2 to reach C = \( \frac{324}{b} \).*  
     Equate times:  
     \( \frac{a}{36} = \frac{324}{b} \).  

3. **Substitute \( a = 4b \) into the Equation:**
   - Replace \( a \) with \( 4b \):  
     \( \frac{4b}{36} = \frac{324}{b} \implies \frac{b}{9} = \frac{324}{b} \).  
   - Solve for \( b \):  
     \( b^2 = 324 \times 9 = 2916 \implies b = \sqrt{2916} = 54 \).  

4. **Verification via Speed Ratio Formula:**
   - The ratio of speeds squared equals the inverse ratio of post-meeting times:  
     \( \left(\frac{v_1}{v_2}\right)^2 = \frac{t_2}{t_1} \implies \left(\frac{36}{b}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \implies \frac{36}{b} = \frac{2}{3} \implies b = 54 \).

63,"Question: Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.
""I know that voice!  C'mon down.""
""Who is it?"" Eileen prodded.
""Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?""
Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.
""Why should I?""
""I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.""
""Is that the new Sinatra CD?""
""No, it's the world's greatest snack.""
""I'm hungry, too!"" the other voice whined.
""Who's up there with you?""  Patty asked.
""I'll bet I know!"" Eileen called.  ""It's obvious!""
Patty's face lit up in realization.  ""Robin!"" they laughed together.
A pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.
""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""
""We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.""
""What are those?""
""You know what a perfect number is?""
""Sure,"" Patty interjected, ""a number equal to the sum of its divisors.""
""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.  What are the four quantities in the sequence?

64,"Question: The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with ""rock"", 2 points with ""scissors"", and 1 point with ""paper"".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one ""throw"", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.
The players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.
Knowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?
 Solution: Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.","(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.

1. **Identify Payoff Structure**: The tournament has asymmetric payoffs: winning with Rock gives +3, Scissors +2, Paper +1. Losing with Rock costs -3, Scissors -2, Paper -1.

2. **Formulate Expected Payoff Equations**:
   - Against an opponent always choosing Rock (R):  
     \(0 \cdot r + 1 \cdot p - 3 \cdot s = 0 \implies p = 3s\).
   - Against an opponent always choosing Paper (P):

   - Against an opponent always choosing Scissors (S):  
     \(3 \cdot r - 2 \cdot p + 0 \cdot s = 0 \implies 3r = 2p\).

3. **Solve for Probabilities**:
   - From \(p = 3s\) and \(r = 2s\), substitute into the total probability constraint \(r + p + s = 1\):  
     \(2s + 3s + s = 6s = 1 \implies s = \frac{1}{6}\).

65,"Question: The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
Assume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.  What is the lowest card total at which you can be assured you will not be required to drink a glass of milk through your nose in order to break a tie for the maximum 4 points?
 Solution: If all four players hold the same number of cards, the lowest card total that would never require a tie-break is 142.
If all four players hold the same number of cards, the highest single hand card total at which a tie-breaker might be needed is 141.  In this case, the two players who would be required to drink milk through their noses would each have had a hand consisting of a joker and two 8s, 9s, 10s, jacks, queens and kings.  Any score above 141 can not be duplicated in a single hand of Snapoker, thus making 142 the lowest total to which a tie-breaker will not need to be applied.",,"If all four players hold the same number of cards, the lowest card total that would never require a tie-break is 142.

1. **Deck Composition Analysis:**
   - **Spades:** Only even numbers (2,4,6,8,10,Q) remain. Total: 12 cards (2 decks × 6 each).
   - **Hearts:** Only odd numbers (A,3,5,7,9,J,K) remain. Total: 14 cards (2 decks × 7 each).
   - **Diamonds:** Non-prime numbers (4,6,8,9,10,12) remain. Total: 12 cards (2 decks × 6 each).
   - **Clubs:** Prime numbers (2,3,5,7,11,13) remain. Total: 12 cards (2 decks × 6 each).
   - **Jokers:** 2 cards (worth 15 each). Total deck size: 52 cards (distributed evenly as 13 cards per player).

2. **Card Values and Quantities:**
   - High-value cards (e.g., Kings, Queens, Jacks, 10s) are limited in quantity. For example, there are 8 Kings, 8 Queens, etc.
   - Jokers (15 points) are unique and limited to 2.

3. **Tie Scenario at 141 Points:**
   - Two players could each have a hand with **1 joker (15)** + **two each of 8s, 9s, 10s, Jacks, Queens, Kings** (summing to 126). Total: \(15 + 2(8+9+10+11+12+13) = 141\).
   - This is possible because the required cards (e.g., 8s, 9s) exist in sufficient quantities (8 total of each) to allow duplication between two players.

4. **Guaranteed No Tie at 142 Points:**
   - To exceed 141, a player must include **both jokers (30)**, but only one player can hold both. The remaining 11 cards would require unique combinations (e.g., 8 Kings + 3 Queens) that cannot be mirrored by another player due to limited card quantities.
   - Any score above 141 inherently relies on unique high-card combinations (e.g., both jokers or rare card overlaps), ensuring no tie. Thus, **142** is the smallest total where a tie is impossible.",True

1. **Identify the Total Sum Relationship:**  
   The sum of all ten possible sums (each missing one number) equals nine times the total sum of the ten numbers. Let \( T \) be the total sum of the ten numbers. The given nine sums (excluding the duplicate) sum to 783. Including the duplicate sum \( S \), we have:  
   \[
   783 + S = 9T
   \]

2. **Determine the Duplicate Sum:**  
   For \( T \) to be an integer, \( 783 + S \) must be divisible by 9. Since \( 783 \equiv 0 \mod 9 \), \( S \) must also be divisible by 9. The only valid \( S \) from the given sums is **90**.

3. **Calculate the Total Sum \( T \):**  
   Substitute \( S = 90 \) into the equation:

67,"Question: Jack and Jill are climbing down a vertical wall.  They both use ropes hanging from the ceiling of a huge room.  They start at the same time from the top of the wall which is 16 meters tall.  The race is divided into two stages; the first 8 meters and the last 8 meters.  A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.
Who will reach the ground first and how many additional minutes will it take the loser to finish the race?
 Solution: Jack will win the race and it will take an additional half minute to catch up with him.
Jacks moves 0.8 meters vertically in each step movement:
According to Pythagoras theorem for right angled triangle:
A^2 = B^2+C^2 (where A is the hypotenuse)
Replacing A by the diagonally crossed distance, B by the distance between Jack's feet and C by the vertically climbed distance:
1^2 = 0.6^2+C^2
C = 0.8 m
Jill moves 1 meter vertically in each hop.
According to the circle circumference calculation:
Circumference = Diameter * Pi
(where Pi = 3.14 and Diameter is the vertically climbed down distance)

1. **Determine Vertical Distance per Movement:**
   - **Jack:** Each diagonal step (1m) with 0.6m horizontal span. Using Pythagoras:  
     \( \sqrt{1^2 - 0.6^2} = 0.8 \) meters vertically per step.  
   - **Jill:** Each hop traces a half-circle (arc length = 1.57m). Solving \( 1.57 = \frac{\pi \cdot \text{diameter}}{2} \) gives a diameter of 1 meter, so she descends **1 meter vertically per hop**.

2. **First Stage (0–8 meters):**
   - **Jack:** Requires \( 8 \, \text{m} / 0.8 \, \text{m/step} = 10 \, \text{steps} \).  
     Time: \( 10 \times 15 \, \text{sec} = 2.5 \, \text{min} \). Finishes at **2.5 minutes** and rests for **1 minute** (until 3.5 minutes).  
   - **Jill:** First 6 meters: \( 6 \, \text{hops} \times 15 \, \text{sec} = 1.5 \, \text{min} \). Rests for **1 minute** (until 2.5 minutes).  
     Remaining 2 meters: \( 2 \, \text{hops} \times 15 \, \text{sec} = 0.5 \, \text{min} \).  
     **But** Jack finishes first at 2.5 minutes, triggering a **0.5-minute penalty** for Jill.  
     Jill resumes at **3.0 minutes**, completes the 2 meters by **3.5 minutes**.

3. **Second Stage (8–16 meters):**
   - **Jack:** Starts at 3.5 minutes. Needs \( 10 \, \text{steps} \times 15 \, \text{sec} = 2.5 \, \text{min} \).  
     Finishes at \( 3.5 + 2.5 = 6.0 \, \text{minutes} \).  
   - **Jill:** Starts at 3.5 minutes. First 6 meters: \( 6 \, \text{hops} \times 15 \, \text{sec} = 1.5 \, \text{min} \). Rests for **1 minute** (until 5.5 minutes).  
     Remaining 2 meters: \( 2 \, \text{hops} \times 15 \, \text{sec} = 0.5 \, \text{min} \).  
     Finishes at \( 5.5 + 0.5 = 6.5 \, \text{minutes} \).

68,"Question: Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.
""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""
Assuming everything has integer weights, what were the two types of weights that Joseph suggested?
 Solution: The two weights are 11 and 13.
If you played around with the hint, you'll realize that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of Xs and Ys is equal to (X-1)(Y-1) - 1.
We are told that the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of a combination of the two weights is 119.
Thus,
119 = (x-1)(y-1) - 1

However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.

72,"Question: You are on a bus with just two other mathematicians when you overhear them talking.
The first mathematicians says, ""I have a positive integer number of children, whose ages are positive integers. The sum of their ages is the number of this bus, while the product is my own age.""
The other person replies, ""How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?""
""No, you could not.""
""Aha! At last, I know how old you are!""
Apparently the second mathematician had been trying to determine the first mathematician's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
The bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.
 Solution: The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't — he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10. After enough trial and error, the perfect balance between the two is reached with the number 12.","There are multiple possible age combinations for the mathematician's children that would result in the same age as well as the same bus number otherwise the second mathematician can determine the ages of the children given the first mathematician's age and number of children.
Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","The bus number is 12.

1. **Identify Key Constraints**: The bus number (B) must allow multiple sets of children's ages (summing to B) with the same product (A) and number of children (N), preventing the second mathematician from deducing the ages even with A and N. After learning this ambiguity, the second mathematician uniquely determines A, implying B must correspond to exactly one ambiguous A.

2. **Analyze Possible Bus Numbers**:
   - For B = 12, check all age combinations for each N:
     - **N = 4**: Two distinct sets (2, 2, 2, 6 and 1, 3, 4, 4) both sum to 12 and yield the same product (48). This creates ambiguity for A = 48 and N = 4.
     - **Other N values**: All products are unique for sums to 12 (e.g., N = 3, N = 5).

3. **Verify Uniqueness of Ambiguity**:
   - For B = 12, A = 48 is the only age with ambiguity. When told that A and N don’t resolve the ages, the second mathematician infers A = 48 uniquely.
   - Larger B values (e.g., 21) have multiple ambiguous A’s, so the second mathematician couldn’t uniquely determine A.

4. **Conclusion**: The minimal B where ambiguity exists for exactly one A is **12**. The first mathematician’s age is 48, with 4 children, and the bus number is uniquely determined by the constraints.

**Answer**: The number of the bus is $\boxed{12}$.",True
73,"Question: Achmed and Ali were camel-drivers and on one day they decided to quit their job. They wanted to become shepherds. So they went to the market and sold all their camels. The amount of money (dinars) they received for each camel was the same as the total number of camels they owned. With that money they bought as many sheep as possible at 10 dinars a sheep. With the money that was left they bought a goat.
On their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, ""I take the last sheep and you can get the goat"". ""That's not fair,"" said Achmed, ""a goat costs less than a sheep"". ""OK,"" Ali said, ""then I will give you one of my dogs and then we are even"". And Achmed agreed.
What's the cost of a dog?
 Solution: 1 sheep - 1 dog = 1 goat + 1 dog
1 sheep - 1 goat = 2 dogs
A sheep is 10 dinars, but what does a goat cost?
The money they received for their camels is a square. And the digit in the tens-place of this square is odd (total money / 10 dinars), because they could not divide the sheep equally.
Now the interesting thing is that all squares with an odd tens-place end with a 6. (16^2 = 256, 24^2 = 576). So a goat must cost 6 dinars.
10 - 6 = 2 dogs
So a dog costs 2 dinars.",,"1 sheep - 1 dog = 1 goat + 1 dog

10 - 6 = 2 dogs
So a dog costs 2 dinars.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Total Money from Camels:** The total money received (n² dinars) is a perfect square since the number of camels (n) sold for n dinars each gives n × n = n².

2. **Purchasing Sheep and Goat:** 
   - They buy as many sheep as possible at 10 dinars each, leaving a remainder (g) for the goat. 
   - Thus, **g = n² mod 10** (goat's cost) and the number of sheep is **floor(n²/10)**.

3. **Odd Number of Sheep:** 
   - When splitting the sheep, there’s 1 left, so the number of sheep (floor(n²/10)) must be odd. 
   - This implies the **tens digit of n² is odd** because dividing n² by 10 gives an odd quotient only if the tens place of n² is odd.

4. **Squares with Odd Tens Digit:** 
   - All squares ending in 6 have an odd tens digit (e.g., 16² = 256, 24² = 576). 
   - Therefore, **n² ends with 6**, making **g = 6 dinars** (the goat's cost).

5. **Equating the Exchange:** 
   - Ali takes the last sheep (10 dinars), Achmed gets the goat (6 dinars). To balance the values:  
     **10 (sheep) - d (dog) = 6 (goat) + d (dog)**.  
   - Solving:  
     **10 - d = 6 + d → 4 = 2d → d = 2**.  

**Answer:** The cost of a dog is **2 dinars**.",True
74,"Question: Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?
 Solution: The minimum number of weights is 5.
weight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0
weight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1
weight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2
weight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3
weight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4
All five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.
The progression from one stone to one mass would be:
1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....","The title has a slight hint.

1. **Understand the Goal**: Measure any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass (121 stones) using the fewest weights on a balance scale. Weights can be placed on both sides.

2. **Balance Scale Flexibility**: A balance scale allows weights to be placed on the same side as the object (subtracting), the opposite side (adding), or not used. This corresponds to coefficients of -1, 0, or +1 for each weight.

3. **Ternary Representation**: To cover all values efficiently, use weights that are powers of 3. Each weight (3ⁿ) enables representing numbers in ""balanced ternary"" (digits: -1, 0, +1), minimizing the total number of weights.

4. **Calculate Required Weights**:
   - **1 stone** (3⁰): Measures 1.
   - **3 stones** (3¹): Measures 3 directly, and combined with smaller weights for intermediate values (e.g., 3 - 1 = 2).
   - **9 stones** (3²): Extends range to 13 stones (1+3+9=13).
   - **27 stones** (3³): Covers up to 40 stones (1+3+9+27=40).
   - **81 stones** (3⁴): Reaches the full mass (121 stones). Total sum: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121.

5. **Conversion to Cultural Units**:
   - 27 stones = 2 lumps + 5 stones (since 11 stones = 1 lump).
   - 81 stones = 7 lumps + 4 stones.
   - This conversion aligns with their base-11 system but doesn’t affect the mathematical solution.

6. **Verification**:
   - Any weight ≤121 can be expressed as a combination of ±3⁰, ±3¹, ±3², ±3³, ±3⁴. For example:
     - 5 stones = 9 - 3 - 1 (place object +3 +1 on one side, 9 on the other).
     - 7 stones = 9 + 1 - 3 (object +3 on one side, 9 +1 on the other).

**Conclusion**: The minimum number of weights is **5**, corresponding to 1, 3, 9, 27, and 81 stones. This leverages balanced ternary’s efficiency, allowing every integer from 1 to 121 to be measured.",True

77,"Question: I always remember the days when I was at high school, whiling away my time with my friends. Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.
Considering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?
He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.
 Solution: Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24
This is for 12 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =

For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.

This is possible by on your first bet, bet 20 cents. If you lose, bet 40 so you make up for the 20 you lost and get 20 more. Then go to 80, slowly doubling you inputs until you reach $3.20. You then have a 3.125% chance of losing.

1. **Identify the Betting Strategy:** Use a Martingale-like system where after each loss, the next bet is doubled to recover previous losses and gain the desired $0.20 profit. The sequence of bets is $0.20, $0.40, $0.80, $1.60, $3.20, totaling $6.20 (matching the initial amount).

2. **Verify Feasibility:** Confirm the total required bets for five consecutive losses ($0.20 + $0.40 + $0.80 + $1.60 + $3.20 = $6.20) equals the starting amount, ensuring no bankruptcy before the fifth bet.

3. **Determine Success Condition:** Winning any single bet in the sequence recovers all prior losses and achieves the $0.20 profit. Failure occurs only if all five bets are lost.

4. **Calculate Probabilities:** The probability of losing all five bets is \((1/2)^5 = 1/32 = 3.125\%\). Thus, the chance of winning at least once (and achieving the profit) is \(1 - 3.125\% = 96.875\%\).

**Logical Consistency Check:** Each step ensures the strategy is executable within the constraints (initial amount and 5 bets) and correctly computes the probability by isolating the only failure scenario (all losses). The doubling strategy guarantees profit with a single win, making the final probability calculation valid.",True

Can you make a target number 37 by using five 5s?
You can use any math operator or group the 5s (as in 555)
There are at least two different ways.
 Solution: Since the total of five 5s is 25, we have to choose an operator which can make a large number.
Obviously, the multiplication operator is not good enough. We chose the factorial operator!
((5!+5!)-55)/5 = (120+120-55)/5 = 185/5 = 37

1. **Utilize Factorials and Concatenation:**
   - Compute two factorials: \(5! = 120\).
   - Concatenate two 5s to form 55.

82,"Question: In our business, my two partners and I cut a lot of cake.
We work exclusively with square cakes. The cakes come in sizes that are meant to be divided into a square number of square pieces. Each portion comes decorated with an ""X"" stretching to its corners, which makes it easy to cut the usual square pieces and also offer half and quarter portions.
These markings also help on Wednesday when we savor the previous week's success by dividing a cake equally amongst ourselves. Even when a good week deserves a 64-portion cake, we can each ceremonially make a single standard cut (straight and perpendicular to the plate), and we each go home with a single piece of cake.
Using no other cuts or devices, how do we evenly divide the 8-by-8 cake? (EXTRA - How could we get 7 (and only 7) equal-size pieces from the same size cake?)
 Solution: To get three twenty-one-and-one-third (64/3) portion-sized pieces, we momentarily ignore the 28 X's/portions/square-units which form the 32 unit perimeter of the cake.  There is more than one way to divide the 6-by-6 (36 X) cake inside into three equal pieces.  Using one based on its 24 unit perimeter, this cake could be divided into 24 wedges of equal size. Each triangular piece would have as its base one unit of the perimeter; the other two sides would be formed by cuts to the center of the cake. Every triangle would have the same altitude (3 units) giving the same area (A = ½ * b * h = ½ * 1 * 3 = 3/2 square units). 8 adjacent triangles, even though they include a corner or two, will be 12 square units or 1/3 of the ""inner"" cake.
Before we make any actual cuts, we return the ignored 28 portions to the picture and then make those three cuts extended to the true perimeter. The 24 triangles pictured previously increase in altitude to 4 units. By rules of similar triangles, the base increases by the same 1/3 (33 1/3%) to 1 1/3 units. The area of 8 extended triangles is 8 * ½ * 4/3 * 4 = 64/3 portions, which is exactly one-third of the cake.

**Dividing the 8x8 Cake into 3 Equal Pieces:**

1. **Focus on the Inner 6x6 Cake:**
   - Ignore the outer 28 perimeter portions of the 8x8 cake. The remaining inner 6x6 cake has 36 portions.
   - Calculate the inner perimeter: 24 units (6 sides × 4, adjusted for corners).

2. **Divide the Inner Cake Radially:**
   - Imagine dividing the 6x6 cake into 24 triangular wedges, each with a 1-unit base along the perimeter and a height of 3 units (distance from center to edge).
   - Each wedge’s area: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 3 = 1.5 \) portions.
   - Group 8 wedges per person: \( 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \) portions (1/3 of 36).

3. **Extend Cuts to the Full 8x8 Cake:**
   - Extend the radial cuts through the ignored outer 28 portions. The height of each wedge becomes 4 units (center to outer edge).
   - The base of each wedge scales proportionally: Original perimeter (24) → New perimeter (32), so base scales by \( \frac{32}{24} = \frac{4}{3} \).
   - Each extended wedge’s area: \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{3} \times 4 = \frac{8}{3} \) portions.
   - Each person’s share: \( 8 \times \frac{8}{3} = \frac{64}{3} \) portions (exactly 1/3 of 64).

4. **Result:**
   - Three radial cuts divide the cake into three equal parts of \( \frac{64}{3} \) portions each.

---

**Extra: Dividing into 7 Equal Pieces:**

1. **Identify a 7x7 Sub-Cake:**
   - Use the centers of the 28 ignored perimeter portions to form a 7x7 square (49 portions total, perimeter = 28 units).

2. **Divide the 7x7 Cake Radially:**
   - Split the perimeter into 28 segments (1 unit each). Create wedges with height 3.5 units (center to 7x7 edge).
   - Each wedge’s area: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 3.5 = 1.75 \) portions.
   - Group 4 wedges per person: \( 4 \times 1.75 = 7 \) portions (1/7 of 49).

3. **Extend Cuts to the Full 8x8 Cake:**
   - Extend cuts to the 8x8 edge. Height becomes 4 units; base scales by \( \frac{32}{28} = \frac{8}{7} \).
   - Each extended wedge’s area: \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{8}{7} \times 4 = \frac{16}{7} \) portions.
   - Each person’s share: \( 4 \times \frac{16}{7} = \frac{64}{7} \) portions (exactly 1/7 of 64).

4. **Result:**
   - Seven radial cuts divide the cake into seven equal parts of \( \frac{64}{7} \) portions each.

- Use **radial cuts** and **perimeter proportionality** to ensure equal areas.
- **Scale bases** of wedges when extending cuts to maintain equal shares.

The problem is, I don't remember its exact length!
All I can remember is that the pole was built to be exactly 14 times the height of the flag.
The flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system.
The string wraps evenly around the pole 4 times.
The string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag (the returning string is built into the pole).
The pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground.
Oh yes, and the diameter of the pole is 10cm.
So quickly! We don't have much time until everyone sees, how much string do we need?
Conversions:
100cm = 1m
2.54cm = 1 inch
 Solution: If the pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground and the flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system, then the flag must be 1 meter high. If the string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag and the flag pole is 14 meters in height, then the string must cover 12 meters in total (14-1-1).
If the diameter of the pole is 10cm and the height covered is 12 meters (1200cm), then, unwrapped in to a rectangle, it would be pi(10) (since the circumference of a circle is pi{d}) by 1200 cm rectangle.
If the string wraps around in 4 even rotations, that means the rectangle divided on the y plane into 4 equal sections would represent one rotation per section. Finding the hypotenuse of each section (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) would then yield the distance covered per rotation.

 Solution: The minimum double digit strength of the class is 18.
Let the number of girls in the class be X and the number of boys in the class be Y.
Then the average marks of the girls and boys is Y and X respectively.

Therefore the minimum double digit strength of the class = X+Y = 18.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( X \) = number of girls, \( Y \) = number of boys.
   - Average marks of girls = \( Y \), total marks for girls = \( X \cdot Y \).
   - Average marks of boys = \( X \), total marks for boys = \( Y \cdot X \).

2. **Class Average and Given Condition:**
   - Total marks = \( XY + XY = 2XY \).
   - Class average = \( \frac{2XY}{X + Y} \).
   - Average of boys' and girls' averages = \( \frac{X + Y}{2} \).
   - Equation: \( \frac{X + Y}{2} - \frac{2XY}{X + Y} = 4 \).

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Multiply through by \( 2(X + Y) \):
     \[
     (X + Y)^2 - 4XY = 8(X + Y)
     \]
   - Simplify to:
     \[
     (X - Y)^2 = 8(X + Y)
     \]

4. **Analyze Integer Solutions:**
   - Let \( S = X + Y \), \( D = X - Y \). Then \( D^2 = 8S \).
   - \( 8S \) must be a perfect square → \( S = 2k^2 \) (twice a perfect square).

5. **Find Minimum Double-Digit \( S \):**
   - Test \( S = 2k^2 \):
     - \( k = 3 \) → \( S = 2(3^2) = 18 \) (smallest double-digit solution).
   - Verify \( S = 18 \):
     - \( D^2 = 8 \cdot 18 = 144 \) → \( D = 12 \).
     - Solve \( X = \frac{S + D}{2} = 15 \), \( Y = \frac{S - D}{2} = 3 \).
     - Check: Class average = \( \frac{2(15)(3)}{18} = 5 \), average of averages = \( \frac{15 + 3}{2} = 9 \). Difference = \( 9 - 5 = 4 \), satisfying the condition.

86,"Question: While rating some Braingle teasers recently, I started taking notes on how my
vote affected the ratings.  Some of my data is presented below.  Can you figure out what is the likely formula that computes the ratings from the votes? Can you determine for each teaser how many votes were cast for each attribute prior to mine, and how many of those were positive (fun/hard)? Remember, not every voter necessarily votes for both attributes.
Notation: The notation for Teaser A below shows that it started with a fun rating of 2 and difficulty 1.33, based on 6 voters, that I voted positively on the first attribute (fun) and negatively on the second (easy), and that it wound up with ratings of 2.29 and 1.14, respectively, after my vote.
Teaser A: (2.00, 1.33)[6] (+, -) -> (2.29, 1.14)
Teaser B: (1.14, 0.67)[7] (-, -) -> (1.00, 0.57)
Teaser C: (3.00, 0.67)[8] (+, +) -> (3.11, 1.14)
Teaser D: (3.11, 0.89)[9] (+, -) -> (3.20, 0.80)

1. **Identify the Rating Formula**:  
   Each attribute's rating is calculated as \( \frac{4 \times \text{positive votes}}{\text{total votes}} \). For example, a rating of \( 2.00 \) with \( 6 \) votes implies \( 4 \times 3 / 6 = 2.00 \).

2. **Reverse-Engineer Initial Votes**:  
   For each teaser’s initial rating \( R \), solve \( R = \frac{4p_{\text{initial}}}{v_{\text{initial}}} \), where \( p_{\text{initial}} \) (positive votes) and \( v_{\text{initial}} \) (total votes) are integers. Ensure \( v_{\text{initial}} \leq [n] \), where \( [n] \) is the number of voters before the user’s vote.  
   - Example: Teaser A’s initial fun rating \( 2.00 = \frac{4 \times 3}{6} \), so \( p_{\text{initial}} = 3 \), \( v_{\text{initial}} = 6 \).

3. **Update Votes After User’s Action**:  
   - If the user votes **+**, increment \( p_{\text{initial}} \) by 1 and \( v_{\text{initial}} \) by 1.  
   - If the user votes **-**, leave \( p_{\text{initial}} \) unchanged and increment \( v_{\text{initial}} \) by 1.  
   - Example: Teaser E’s difficulty starts at \( \frac{32}{13} \). A **-** vote updates \( v_{\text{initial}} \) to 14, keeping \( p_{\text{final}} = 8 \), resulting in \( \frac{32}{14} \approx 2.29 \).

4. **Verify Final Ratings**:  
   Confirm that \( \frac{4p_{\text{final}}}{v_{\text{final}}} \) matches the final rating. For Teaser C’s difficulty, \( \frac{4 \times 2}{7} = \frac{8}{7} \approx 1.14 \), consistent with the data.

 Solution: 3^3+5^1+7^2=81.",,3^3+5^1+7^2=81.,DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify Constraints:**  
   A, B, C are positive integers (≥1). We need \(3^A + 5^B + 7^C\) to be a perfect square.  

2. **Test Smallest Exponents:**  
   Start with \(A=1, B=1, C=1\):  
   \(3 + 5 + 7 = 15\) (not a square).  

3. **Check Squares Less Than 81:**  
   - **16, 25, 36, 49, 64:**  
     No combinations of \(3^A + 5^B + 7^C\) (with \(A,B,C ≥1\)) produce these values.  

4. **Try \(A=3, B=1, C=2\):**  
   - \(3^3 = 27\), \(5^1 = 5\), \(7^2 = 49\).  
   - Sum: \(27 + 5 + 49 = 81\), which is \(9^2\).  

5. **Verify Smaller Squares Are Impossible:**  
   - All squares below 81 (e.g., 16, 25, 36, 49, 64) cannot be formed by any valid combination of \(3^A + 5^B + 7^C\).  

6. **Confirm Minimality:**  
   - Raising exponents further increases the sum beyond 81.

92,"Question: You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?
(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)

(3): 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650, divided by 25 gives...
(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186
(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186
Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.
The solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10. This is a total of 35 slushes, and therefore 35 coupons given out. 35 * $0.75 = $26.25 in losses from the coupons. $46.50 - $26.25 = $20.25 net profit when accounting for the coupons.

94,"Question: Dear Jim:
Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.
Jerry
 Solution: Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.

   - **6 Years Later:** \( C + 6 = \text{sum of digits of } (A + 6) \text{ and } (B + 6) \).

2. **Use Modular Arithmetic (Mod 9):**
   - Since the sum of a number’s digits \( \equiv \) the number \( \mod 9 \), derive congruences:

     - \( C + 6 \equiv (A + 6) + (B + 6) \mod 9 \)

3. **Solve Congruences:**
   - Substitute \( A \equiv B + C \mod 9 \) into the other equations:
     - **Second Equation:** Simplify to \( 2C \equiv 1 \mod 9 \), so \( C \equiv 5 \mod 9 \). Thus, \( C = 5 \) (plausible age).
     - **Third Equation:** Simplify to \( 2B \equiv 3 \mod 9 \), so \( B \equiv 6 \mod 9 \). Thus, \( B = 6 \).

Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]

96,"Question: An iterative equation is one where an initial value is put into the equation to obtain a result, which is in turn put back into the equation as an input and the process is repeated for either a fixed number of times or until a final value is achieved (where you get the same number out as you put in).
For example, if you start with the iterative equation,
A{n+1} = 1/A{n} + 1
And you put in an initial value of 1, you would get 2 as the result.  Put the 2 back in as the input and you would get 1.5, and so on.
There is a simple iterative equation which, when repeated just five times, will give you a very good approximation of the square root of two (accurate to three decimal places, or less than 0.1%).  What's more, you can put in any positive (and almost any negative) initial value into the equation (even zero) and you will end up at the same answer.  This equation does not contain any square root expressions; just single-order algebra.  Can you figure it out?
 Solution: A{n+1} = (A{n} + 2) / (A{n} + 1}
To prove to yourself that this is right, assume that for a sufficiently large number of iterations, A{n+1} = A{n}, so you can rewrite the equation as:

1. **Identify the Goal:** Find an iterative equation converging to √2 without using square roots.  
2. **Set Up the Fixed-Point Equation:** Start with \( x^2 = 2 \), rearrange to isolate \( x \):  
   \( x = \frac{x + 2}{x + 1} \).  
3. **Derive the Iterative Formula:** Substitute \( x \) with iterated terms:  
   \( A_{n+1} = \frac{A_n + 2}{A_n + 1} \).  
4. **Check Convergence:** Compute the derivative of the iteration function \( g(x) = \frac{x + 2}{x + 1} \).  
   The derivative \( |g'(x)| = \frac{1}{(x + 1)^2} \) is less than 1 near \( x = \sqrt{2} \), ensuring convergence.

You begin by opening every locker. Then you close every second locker. Then you go to every third locker and open it (if it's closed) or close it (if it's open).  Let's call this action toggling a locker. Continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n.  After 100 passes, where you toggle only locker #100, how many lockers are open?
 Solution: Answer: 10 lockers are left open:

Each year, the birth rate is 4% of the population at the beginning of the year, and the death rate is 3% of the population at the beginning of the year.  The resulting births and deaths are truncated to a whole number.  These rates are constant.  For example, consider a population of 99 people at the start of a year.  A 4% birth rate would be 3.96, truncated to 3 births during the year.  A 3% death rate would be 2.97, truncated to 2 deaths during the year.

1. **Identify Age Pairs with Anagram Squares:**
   - Determine pairs of ages (x, Al's age then; y, Cal's age then) where x² and y² are three-digit numbers with the same digits rearranged.
   - Valid pairs: (13, 31), (14, 31), (16, 25), (12, 21), (13, 14).

2. **Calculate Square of Sum for Each Pair:**
   - Compute (x + y)² for each pair and split the result into two two-digit numbers (first: Cal's age then; second: Al's age now).
   - Example: For (25, 16), sum = 41 → 41² = 1681 → split into 16 (Cal's age then) and 81 (Al's age now).

3. **Validate Consistency:**
   - Check if the split matches the ages in the pair. Only (25, 16) works:
     - x = 25 (Al then), y = 16 (Cal then) → x² = 625, y² = 256 (anagrams).
     - Sum: 25 + 16 = 41 → 41² = 1681 → split into 16 (Cal then) and 81 (Al now).

4. **Confirm Solution:**
   - Al's current age = 81 (matches the split result), confirming the correct pair (25, 16). Years passed: 81 - 25 = 56 → Cal's current age = 16 + 56 = 72.

104,"Question: Kurt & Rod were hanging around the window at school munching the last of their Rnkfurers hoard.  They spotted their neighbor lounging in the enclosed courtyard, looking hungry.
""Patty O'Furniture!  Good to see you!  Want a Rnkfurter?""
""A what?""
Kurt handed her the last he had.  She bit in, and her face lit up like a newly-coined metaphor.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""Rod and I were about to go order some more.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""  Patty's blank look bade him explain.  ""In our first batch, we got a total of 25 -- 20 for me, and 5 for Rod.  I had 20, and he had 20% of the total.""
""And you think you can do that for three people?  You get my percentage, and I get Rod's?  I don't think we can do it.""
Rod had been thinking about it, and rattled off three numbers to her.
""Those aren't right.  The last one isn't the right percentage; there's an added fraction.""
""So?  My mom says they're the same on her old phonograph speeds.""
Patty looked at Kurt, each waiting for the other to give an opinion.  Finally, she gestured at the empty wrapper in his hand.
""I'll round off a little for a week's supply of these.  Let's go!""
Since Rnkfurters come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, they had to leave 10 with the storekeeper to make the numbers work, but they got their munchies.
How many did each student get this time?
 Solution: 27 for Kurt, 30 for Patty, and 33 for Rod.
That's 30% for Kurt and 33-1/3% for Patty.
Method:
Let K, P, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, K+P+R.
Now, since Kurt's percentage equals Patty's quantity, we get
100*K/T = P.
Similarly,
100*P/T = R plus a fraction.  Now, look at the common factor, 100/T.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
K*F = P and P*F = R (plus a fraction),
and K*F^2 = R (plus a fraction).
The clue about the phonograph leaves us looking for a triple with 33 Rnkfurters for Rod, with Patty getting 33-1/3% (one-third) of the total.
P = T/3
P = (K+P+33)/3 -- remember, R=33
Now, combine this with 100*K/T = P, and a bit of algebra gives us the required answer.

Alternately, there are 11 triples that fit the factor requirement (courtesy of a short computer program), ranging from (19, 25, 32) to (2376, 96, 3).  The ones that total 10 less than a multiple of 25 are
27, 30, 33
63, 45, 32

1. **Define Variables and Conditions:**
   - Let \( K \), \( P \), and \( R \) represent the number of Rnkfurters Kurt, Patty, and Rod receive, respectively. Total \( T = K + P + R \).
   - **Condition 1:** Kurt’s percentage of \( T \) equals Patty’s quantity: \( \frac{100K}{T} = P \).
   - **Condition 2:** Patty’s percentage of \( T \) equals Rod’s quantity plus \( \frac{1}{3} \): \( \frac{100P}{T} = R + \frac{1}{3} \).

2. **Link Conditions to Total:**
   - From Condition 1: \( T = \frac{100K}{P} \).
   - Substitute \( T \) into Condition 2: \( \frac{100P}{\frac{100K}{P}} = R + \frac{1}{3} \), simplifying to \( \frac{P^2}{K} = R + \frac{1}{3} \).

3. **Phonograph Speed Clue:**
   - The mention of phonograph speeds (33⅓ RPM) hints that Patty’s percentage is \( 33\frac{1}{3}\% \), meaning \( P = \frac{T}{3} \).

4. **Solve Equations:**
   - Substitute \( P = \frac{T}{3} \) into Condition 1: \( \frac{100K}{T} = \frac{T}{3} \), leading to \( 300K = T^2 \).
   - Since \( T = K + P + R = K + \frac{T}{3} + R \), solve for \( R \): \( R = \frac{2T}{3} - K \).
   - Combine with \( \frac{P^2}{K} = R + \frac{1}{3} \), substitute \( P = \frac{T}{3} \) and solve for \( T \) and \( K \).

5. **Check Case Sizes:**
   - Total ordered must be \( T + 10 \), a multiple of 25, 50, or 100. Valid \( T \) candidates: 90 (90 + 10 = 100).

6. **Verify Solution:**
   - For \( T = 90 \): \( P = 30 \), \( K = 27 \) (from \( 300K = 90^2 \)), \( R = 33 \).
   - Confirm \( \frac{100 \times 27}{90} = 30 \) (Condition 1) and \( \frac{100 \times 30}{90} = 33 + \frac{1}{3} \) (Condition 2).

105,"Question: A man is standing on a rock in the middle of a circular lake of radius 1. There is a tiger on the shore of the lake that can run four times as fast you can swim, however the tiger cannot swim. The tiger is hungry and always attempts to keep the distance between the two of you at a minimum. How can you safely swim to shore?
Assume that as long as you can get to the shore before the tiger gets to you (even if it is only a split-second before), you will be safe.
 Solution: Until you are more than 1/4 of the radius away from the rock you can swim fast enough so that you can keep the tiger the furthest distance possible from you. Regardless of which direction the tiger moves around the circle, you swim the other way, always keeping the rock between you and the tiger.  While you are doing this you will be able to move outward, since you will have some energy to spare.
Before long you will be 1/4 of the radius away from the center and the tiger will be 180 degrees away. At this point swim straight to the point on the shore furthest from the tiger. You will be able to get there in 3/4 units of time, while it will take the tiger pi/4 =~ 0.7854 units of time.",,"Until you are more than 1/4 of the radius away from the rock you can swim fast enough so that you can keep the tiger the furthest distance possible from you.

1. **Angular Speed Matching:**  
   The tiger's angular speed around the shore is \( 4v \) (since it runs at \( 4v \) along a circumference of radius 1). For the man to stay opposite the tiger, his angular speed must match \( 4v \). At a distance \( r \) from the center, the man’s tangential swimming speed component must be \( 4vr \), leaving a radial speed of \( v \sqrt{1 - (4r)^2} \).

2. **Radial Limit:**  
   The man can only maintain opposition while \( 4r \leq 1 \), i.e., \( r \leq \frac{1}{4} \). Beyond \( r = \frac{1}{4} \), his radial speed becomes zero, so he must stop spiraling.

3. **Spiraling Outward:**  
   Starting at the center (\( r = 0 \)), the man swims outward while adjusting his path to match the tiger’s angular speed. This spiral continues until he reaches \( r = \frac{1}{4} \), where he is directly opposite the tiger.

4. **Final Dash to Shore:**  
   From \( r = \frac{1}{4} \), the man swims straight to shore (remaining distance: \( \frac{3}{4} \)). This takes time \( \frac{3}{4v} \). The tiger, now \( \pi \) units away (half the circumference), takes \( \frac{\pi}{4v} \approx \frac{0.785}{v} \) to reach the landing point. Since \( \frac{3}{4v} < \frac{\pi}{4v} \), the man escapes safely.

**Key Insight:** By spiraling to \( r = \frac{1}{4} \), the man maximizes the tiger’s required running distance, ensuring he reaches shore first.",True

108,"Question: In the equation FORTY+TEN+TEN=SIXTY, each letter represents a different digit. Can you figure out which letter is which digit?
 Solution: First, there are ten different letters in this equation: E, F, I, N, O, R, S, T, X, Y. Therefore, every digit from 0 to 9 is used.
Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.
If T=8, then R=X+3, we can have R=6, X=3, or R=7, X=4.
If R=6, X=3, the remaining digits are 2, 4, 7, and again we can't choose S=F+1.
If R=7, X=4, the remaining digits are 2, 3, 6, where 3=2+1. Hence S=3, F=2.

Finally, the remaining digit 6 is for Y.
Therefore, the equation is 29786+850+850=31486.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify Key Letters and Positions:**
   - The equation is FORTY + TEN + TEN = SIXTY. Each letter represents a unique digit (0-9).
   - Focus on the **units and tens places** first. The sum of Y + 2N must end in Y, implying **2N ≡ 0 mod 10**. Thus, **N = 0 or 5**. Similarly, the tens place (T + 2E) must end in T after accounting for any carry-over.

2. **Determine N and E:**
   - If **N = 5**, the tens place leads to a contradiction (2E + 1 ≡ 0 mod 10 has no solution). Hence, **N = 0**.
   - With **N = 0**, the tens place gives **2E ≡ 0 mod 10**, so **E = 5** (since N=0 is already used).

3. **Analyze Higher Places:**
   - The **hundreds place** requires R + 2T + 1 to result in X with a possible carry-over.
   - The **thousands place** involves O + carry-over from hundreds, resulting in I. Since FORTY and SIXTY are 5-digit numbers, **S = F + 1** (due to carry-over).

4. **Assign Values to O and I:**
   - To satisfy the thousands place carry-over, **O = 9** (max digit) and **I = 1** (carry-over from 9 + 2 = 11).

5. **Solve for Remaining Digits:**
   - Substitute **O = 9** and **I = 1** into the equation. Solve **R + 2T = X + 19** for valid digits:
     - **T = 8** leads to possible pairs: **(X=3, R=6)** or **(X=4, R=7)**.
     - Only **(X=4, R=7)** works with remaining digits (F=2, S=3, Y=6).

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - **FORTY = 29786**, **TEN = 850**, **SIXTY = 31486**.
   - Check: 29786 + 850 + 850 = 31486. All digits are unique and valid.

**Final Answer:**  
F=2, O=9, R=7, T=8, Y=6, E=5, N=0, S=3, I=1, X=4. The equation is **29786 + 850 + 850 = 31486**.",True

2. **Opposite Directions:**
   - Relative speed = \( x + y \).
   - They meet every 30 seconds, covering the track length:  
     \( 30x + 30y = 1800 \).  
     Simplify: \( x + y = 60 \). **(Equation 1)**

 Solution: The ages are 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23 and 26. The man's age is 48.",,"The ages are 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23 and 26. The man's age is 48.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Define the Problem with Arithmetic Sequence:**
   - The nine children's ages form an arithmetic sequence with the youngest age \( a \) and common difference \( d \). Their ages are \( a, a+d, a+2d, \ldots, a+8d \).
   - The sum of their squared ages equals the square of the man’s age \( M \):  
     \[
     a^2 + (a+d)^2 + \cdots + (a+8d)^2 = M^2.
     \]

2. **Expand the Sum of Squares:**
   - Expand the sum of squares formula for the arithmetic sequence:  
     \[
     9a^2 + 72ad + 204d^2 = M^2.
     \]
   - Factor and simplify the equation to identify constraints:  
     \[
     3 \left[ 3a^2 + 24ad + 68d^2 \right] = M^2.
     \]
   - Since \( M^2 \) must be divisible by 3, \( M = 3k \) for integer \( k \), leading to:  
     \[
     3a^2 + 24ad + 68d^2 = 3k^2.
     \]

3. **Solve for Integer Solutions:**
   - Test small values of \( d \) and \( a \) to find integers satisfying the equation.  
     - For \( d = 1, 2 \), no valid \( a \) yields a perfect square for \( M \).  
     - For \( d = 3 \), substituting \( a = 2 \):  
       \[
       9(2)^2 + 72(2)(3) + 204(3)^2 = 2304 = 48^2.

   - Verify the arithmetic sequence \( 2, 5, 8, \ldots, 26 \) sums to \( 2304 \), matching \( M = 48 \).

4. **Confirm Minimal Solution:**
   - Check higher \( d \) values (e.g., \( d = 4, 5 \)) and find no smaller valid ages.  
   - Conclude \( a = 2 \), \( d = 3 \), and \( M = 48 \) is the minimal solution.

111,"Question: Mad Ade was visiting his friend, computer tycoon and Olympic Kebab hurling champion, Mike Rohsopht.
He was there on Sunday and when the radio gave the time at the hour, Mad Ade noticed that the Madadian antique clock, designed by Madadian clock maker Arthur Minit (teaser #4891) was exactly 3 minutes slow.
""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Mike assured Mad Ade that his treasured Arthur Minit clock had not been adjusted nor fixed since his last visit.
What day of the week was Mad Ade's second visit?
 Solution: The answer is 17 days and 3 hours later, which would have been a Wednesday.
This is the only other time in the same month when the two would agree at all.
In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.
Since the clock was not adjusted since the last visit, it's also possible that the radio time shifted by one hour due to a change to or from summer daylight saving time.  However, it turns out that the only additional possibilities that need to be considered are those of 4 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 12 hours 57 minutes, and 29 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 3 days 10 hours 57 minutes.

1. **Determine the Required Time Loss:**  
   The clock must lose enough time so that its total delay (initial 3 minutes + subsequent losses) aligns with a multiple of 12 hours (720 minutes). This ensures it displays the correct time again.  
   - Equation: \( 3 + 7T \equiv 0 \mod 720 \), where \( T \) is real hours elapsed.

2. **Solve the Modular Equation:**  
   Rearrange to \( 7T \equiv -3 \mod 720 \) (or \( 7T \equiv 717 \mod 720 \)).  
   - Find the modular inverse of 7 modulo 720 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The inverse is **103**.  
   - Compute \( T \equiv 717 \times 103 \mod 720 \), resulting in \( T = 411 \) hours.

3. **Convert Time to Days and Hours:**  
   \( 411 \) hours = \( 17 \) days and \( 3 \) hours.  
   - Adding 17 days to Sunday (the first visit day):  
     - 14 days = 2 weeks (back to Sunday).  
     - 3 additional days = Wednesday.  
   - The 3 extra hours keep the time within the same evening.

4. **Validate Against Constraints:**  
   Other solutions (e.g., \( 4 \) days \( 15 \) hours) are ruled out because they would result in the clock being correct at a different time of day, conflicting with the ""evening"" condition.

Solving for x:
x= 42.985 degrees",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Understand the Problem:** We need to determine the rotation angle (x) for the cold faucet to achieve a mixed water temperature of 98.6°F. The hot faucet is fixed at 360° (105°F), and the cold faucet contributes 45°F water. Flow rates are proportional to faucet rotation.

2. **Set Up the Equation:** The final temperature is a weighted average based on flow rates. The equation is:  
   \[
   \frac{(360 \times 105) + (x \times 45)}{360 + x} = 98.6

3. **Solve for x:**  
   - Multiply both sides by \(360 + x\):  
     \[
     37,\!800 + 45x = 98.6(360 + x)

2. **Mathematical Constraints:**  
   - \( S = 100a + 10b + c \) (where \( a, b, c \) are digits, \( a \neq 0 \)).  
   - \( R = 100c + 10b + a \).  
   - The quadratic equation \( t^2 - St + R = 0 \) must have integer roots \( x \) and \( y \).

3. **Discriminant Condition:**  
   For \( x \) and \( y \) to be integers, the discriminant \( D = S^2 - 4R \) must be a perfect square.

4. **Trial with Small \( y \):**  
   Assume \( y \) is a small integer (e.g., \( y = 2 \)):  
   - \( x = S - 2 \), so \( x \times 2 = R \).  
   - Substitute \( S = 100a + 10b + c \) and \( R = 100c + 10b + a \), leading to the equation:  
     \( 199a + 10b = 98c + 4 \).  

5. **Solve for Digits \( a, b, c \):**  
   - For \( a = 4 \), the equation simplifies to \( 98c - 10b = 792 \).  
   - Testing \( c = 9 \): \( 98 \times 9 - 10b = 792 \Rightarrow 882 - 10b = 792 \Rightarrow b = 9 \).  
   - Thus, \( S = 499 \) and \( R = 994 \).  

6. **Verify Solution:**  
   - \( x = 497 \), \( y = 2 \):  
     \( 497 + 2 = 499 \), \( 497 \times 2 = 994 \).

1. **Understand Definitions**: A weird number is an abundant number (sum of proper divisors exceeds the number) that is not semiperfect (no subset of its proper divisors sums to the number itself).

2. **Identify Abundant Numbers**: Check numbers sequentially starting from the smallest abundant number (12) to verify if they are semiperfect:

The robots are grouped into tribes according to the numbers of arms they have so that in any tribe, no member has a different number of arms to the other members. Each tribe follows the same fertility ritual before bed each night, a ritual that also reveals the number of members in a tribe. In the ritual, each arm of a male links with an arm of a female, no male-female pair of robots linking more than once. The minimum number of robots required to link all arms once only is the number belonging to that tribe. Now one night, the Creaky tribe cornered half of the Rusty tribe and despite being outnumbered two to one, unscrewed one arm from each, there being an equal number of male and female victims. However, the Creaky tribe were extremely poor at arithmetic and had failed to realise that they needed 24 times their actual haul of spare arms in order that the number of links their members could then make, each with the same number of extra arms, was half the maximum number of links the Rusty tribe could then make. How many Creakies and Rusties were there?

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let the Creaky tribe have \( x \) arms per robot, implying \( 2x \) members.
   - Let the Rusty tribe have \( y \) arms per robot, implying \( 2y \) members.

2. **Attack Details:**
   - The Creakies corner half the Rusties (\( y \) robots) and are outnumbered 2:1, so \( 2x = \frac{y}{2} \), leading to \( y = 4x \).

3. **Arms Stolen:**
   - Each of the \( y \) cornered Rusties loses 1 arm, totaling \( y \) stolen arms. Actual haul = \( y \).

4. **Links After Augmentation:**
   - If Creakies needed 24× their haul (\( 24y \) arms), each Creaky would gain \( \frac{24y}{2x} = \frac{12y}{x} \) arms.
   - Links Creakies could make: \( x \left( x + \frac{12y}{x} \right) = x^2 + 12y \).

5. **Rusties' Post-Attack Links:**
   - Maximum links Rusties can make: \( \frac{y(2y - 1)}{2} \).

6. **Formulate Equation:**
   - Creakies' links = \( \frac{1}{2} \) Rusties' links:
     \[
     x^2 + 12y = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{y(2y - 1)}{2} \implies 4x^2 + 48y = 2y^2 - y \implies 2y^2 - 49y - 4x^2 = 0.

1. **Define Variables:** Let the side length of the square lawn be \( s \) meters. The total area is \( s^2 \).

2. **Determine Uncut Area:** After cutting a 2-meter border, the remaining uncut square has a side length of \( s - 4 \) meters (subtracting 2 meters from both sides). Its area is \( (s - 4)^2 \).

3. **Calculate Cut Area:** The area cut by Junior is the total area minus the uncut area:
   \[
   s^2 - (s - 4)^2 = 8s - 16
   \]

4. **Set Up Equation:** Since Junior cut half the total area:
   \[
   8s - 16 = \frac{1}{2}s^2
   \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:** Rearrange and solve \( s^2 - 16s + 32 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   s = \frac{16 \pm \sqrt{256 - 128}}{2} = 8 \pm 4\sqrt{2}
   \]
   Select the positive root: \( s = 8 + 4\sqrt{2} \).

6. **Compute Total Area:** Substitute \( s \) back into \( s^2 \):
   \[
   (8 + 4\sqrt{2})^2 = 96 + 64\sqrt{2} \, \text{m}^2 \approx 186.51 \, \text{m}^2

**Final Answer:** The area of the lawn was \( 96 + 64\sqrt{2} \) square meters, approximately **186.51 square metres**.",True
117,"Question: What is the largest number of pieces you can form with n straight cuts of a pizza?
The pieces do not need to be of equal size.
 Solution: The answer is n*(n+1)/2 + 1.
With every cut you should cut through every previous cut. As long as you keep doing this you will always be able to do so again with your next cut. The number of additional pieces formed on cut x will always be x. The sum of all integers from 1 to n is n*(n+1)/2. So the sum of additional pieces cut will be n*(n+1)/2.

1. **Understand the Problem:** Determine the maximum number of regions (pieces) created by \( n \) straight cuts in a plane (pizza), where regions do not need to be equal.  
   - **Key Insight:** Each new cut should intersect all previous cuts to maximize regions.

2. **Analyze Small Cases:**  
   - \( n = 0 \): 1 piece (no cuts).  
   - \( n = 1 \): 2 pieces (1 cut divides the plane).  
   - \( n = 2 \): 4 pieces (second cut intersects the first).  
   - \( n = 3 \): 7 pieces (third cut intersects both previous cuts, adding 3 regions).  
   - **Pattern:** The \( k \)-th cut adds \( k \) new regions.

3. **Generalize the Pattern:**  
   - The \( k \)-th cut intersects all \( k-1 \) previous cuts, creating \( k \) new regions.  
   - Total regions after \( n \) cuts: \( 1 + \sum_{k=1}^n k \).  

4. **Derive the Formula:**  
   - The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).  
   - Add the initial region: \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1 \).  

5. **Verify Consistency:**  
   - The formula matches results for small \( n \) (e.g., \( n=3 \): \( \frac{3 \cdot 4}{2} + 1 = 7 \)).  
   - Confirmed by geometric principles (each new line intersects all previous lines, maximizing regions).

A right cylinder, with a diameter congruent to its height is inscribed in a right cone with height 12 units and radius 5 units. If their axes coincide, find the radius of the cylinder.
 Solution: 30/11. As mentioned in the hint, there are many methods in which to solve this. One less complex method is to imagine the axis of the cone form a right triangle. This triangle shares the dimensions of the cone, so it is 12 by 5. We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.
Next we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x.

1. **Visualize the Cross-Section:**  
   Consider a vertical cross-section through the cone and cylinder, forming a right triangle (height 12, base radius 5) and an inscribed rectangle (cylinder). The cylinder’s height equals its diameter, so if its radius is \( x \), its height is \( 2x \).

2. **Equation for the Cone’s Surface:**  
   The cone’s surface in the cross-section forms a line from the apex \((0, 12)\) to the base edge \((5, 0)\). This line has the equation:  
   \[
   y = -\frac{12}{5}x + 12

3. **Constraint from the Cylinder’s Top Edge:**  
   The top corner of the cylinder’s cross-section \((x, 2x)\) must lie on the cone’s surface. Substitute \( x \) and \( y = 2x \) into the line equation:  
   \[
   2x = -\frac{12}{5}x + 12

   - **B's time:** \( 4x + 1 \) (walks to \( x \), bicycles the rest).
   - **C's time:** \( 3y - 3x + 2 \) (walks to \( y \), bicycles back to \( x \), then walks).

4. **Set Equal Times for Synchronized Arrival:**
   - Equate A, B, and C's times:
     - \( 10 - 9y = 4x + 1 \)
     - \( 10 - 9y = 3y - 3x + 2 \)

5. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - Simplify equations:
     - \( 4x + 9y = 9 \)
     - \( 3x - 12y = -8 \)
   - Solve via elimination:
     - \( x = \frac{12}{25} \), \( y = \frac{59}{75} \).

6. **Calculate Total Time:**
   - Substitute \( y \) into A's time: \( 10 - 9(\frac{59}{75}) = \frac{73}{25} \approx 2.92 \) minutes.
   - All three arrive simultaneously, so the total time is \( \frac{73}{25} \) minutes.

**Answer:** The shortest time for all to cross is \( \frac{73}{25} \) minutes (approximately 2.92 minutes).",True
126,"Question: The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
In a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).  How many different ways can a 13-card alternating-colour straight be formed from a Snapoker deck?  Note that jokers can not be used in forming a straight.
 Solution: There are 32,768 possible ways a 13-card alternating-colour straight can be formed in a Snapoker deck.
To form a 13-card alternating-colour straight in Snapoker the following cards can be used:
2 x red aces
4 x black twos
2 x red threes
2 x black fours
2 x red fives
2 x black sixes
2 x red sevens
2 x black eights

1. **Determine Available Cards per Rank and Suit:**
   - Analyze the Snapoker deck composition after removals:
     - **Spades (Black):** Only even ranks remain (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12). Two copies per rank.
     - **Hearts (Red):** Only odd ranks remain (Ace, 3, 5, 7, 9, J, K). Two copies per rank.
     - **Diamonds (Red):** Only non-prime ranks remain (4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12). Two copies per rank, except 9 (two copies from hearts and two from diamonds).
     - **Clubs (Black):** Only prime ranks remain (2, 3, 5, 7, J, K). Two copies per rank, but only 2 is valid for even ranks.

2. **Assign Colors to Ranks in the Straight:**
   - **Odd ranks (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13):** Must be red (hearts or diamonds where applicable).
   - **Even ranks (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12):** Must be black (spades or clubs where applicable).

3. **Count Valid Cards for Each Rank:**
   - **Ace (1, red):** 2 hearts.
   - **2 (black):** 4 total (2 spades + 2 clubs).

 Solution: One solution:  12345/24690=1/2",,One solution:  12345/24690=1/2,DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Understand the Fraction Requirement:**  
   The fraction must equal 1/2, meaning the denominator is twice the numerator. Let the numerator be \( N \) and the denominator \( D = 2N \).

2. **Digit Constraints:**  
   Use all digits \( 0,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,9 \). Each digit must appear exactly once, except for two \( 2 \)s and two \( 4 \)s. Neither \( N \) nor \( D \) can start with \( 0 \).

3. **Analyze Possible End Digits:**  
   Since \( D \) is even, its last digit must be \( 0,2,4,6 \). Correspondingly, \( N \)’s last digit must satisfy \( 2 \times \text{(N's last digit)} \) modulo 10 equals \( D \)’s last digit. Valid pairs:  
   - \( N \) ends in \( 1 \) → \( D \) ends in \( 2 \)  
   - \( N \) ends in \( 2 \) → \( D \) ends in \( 4 \)  
   - \( N \) ends in \( 3 \) → \( D \) ends in \( 6 \)  
   - \( N \) ends in \( 5 \) → \( D \) ends in \( 0 \)  
   - \( N \) ends in \( 6 \) → \( D \) ends in \( 2 \)  

4. **Test \( N \) Ending in \( 5 \):**  
   If \( N \) ends in \( 5 \), \( D \) ends in \( 0 \). This avoids using \( 0 \) in \( N \). Example:  
   - Let \( N = 12345 \). Then \( D = 2 \times 12345 = 24690 \).  
   - Check digits: \( N = 1,2,3,4,5 \); \( D = 2,4,6,9,0 \). Combined, all digits are used correctly (two \( 2 \)s, two \( 4 \)s, others once).  

5. **Verify Validity:**  
   Confirm \( 12345/24690 = 1/2 \) by calculation and digit usage. This satisfies all constraints.  

**Final Answer:**  
The fraction \( \frac{12345}{24690} = \frac{1}{2} \), formed using all the digits \( 0,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,9 \), is a valid solution.",True

A person starts at their ship on a perfectly smooth, spherical planet (radius 10 km). They walk 17.345 km south, turn left, and walk 47.124 km east. Determine their final distance from the ship.

**SOLUTION:**  
1. **Key Observations About the Planet:**  
   - The planet’s circumference is \(2\pi \times 10 \approx 62.8318\) km.  
   - Walking 47.124 km east corresponds to \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the full circumference (\(47.124 \approx 0.75 \times 62.8318\)).  

2. **Irrelevance of the First Walk:**  
   - The initial southward distance (17.345 km) does not affect the final distance. Turning left (east) and walking \(\frac{3}{4}\) circumference positions the person at a specific point regardless of their starting latitude.  

3. **Geometric Interpretation:**  
   - After walking \(\frac{3}{4}\) circumference east, the person reaches the ""east pole,"" a hypothetical point 90° east of the starting longitude on the equator.  
   - The starting point (ship) and the east pole form a right angle at the planet’s center, creating a right triangle with legs equal to the planet’s radius (10 km each).  

4. **Distance Calculation:**  
   - The straight-line distance through the planet (chord length) is the hypotenuse of this right triangle:

1. **Identify the Pattern**: The numbers on the paintings correspond to the angle between the hour and minute hands at the given times, measured clockwise from the hour hand to the minute hand. This angle may be the larger angle (greater than 180°) if the minute hand is behind the hour hand.

2. **Calculate Positions**:

1. **Initial Setup:**  
   The rubber band starts at 3 inches. The spider begins at position 0 and walks at 1 inch per minute. After each minute, the band is stretched by 3 inches, proportionally scaling the spider's position.

2. **Position Update Rule:**  
   After each minute \( n \), the spider's position \( S(n) \) is computed as:  
   \[
   S(n) = \left(S(n-1) + 1\right) \times \frac{n+1}{n}
   \]  
   This accounts for the 1 inch walked during the minute and the subsequent stretching.

3. **Harmonic Series Insight:**  
   The recurrence relation simplifies to \( S(n) = (n+1) \times H(n) \), where \( H(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} \) (the \( n \)-th harmonic number).

4. **Termination Condition:**  
   The spider reaches the end when \( S(n) + x \geq L(n) \), where \( L(n) = 3(n+1) \) (length after \( n \) stretchings) and \( x \) is the time within the interval \([n, n+1)\). Solve for \( x \):  
   \[
   x = 3(n+1) - S(n)
   \]  
   The smallest \( n \) where \( S(n) \geq 3(n+1) - 1 \) (to ensure \( x \leq 1 \)) is found.

   - Compute \( H(n) \geq 3 - \frac{1}{n+1} \).  
   - For \( n=10 \), \( H(10) \approx 2.928 \geq 2.909 \), meeting the condition.

 Solution: It's easy to see that the number of letters he had delivered is the square of the number of days he had worked.
Square numbers can't end in 7 or 8, and 123456 is not a square because it is divisible by 3 but not by 9. Hence the number of letters must end with 9.
Since odd squares have remainder 1 upon division by 8, the number formed by its fourth and fifth digits must be divisible by 4, which can be 48, 56 or 68.
Numbers that have remainder 2 upon division by 3, and those that are divisible by 3 but not by 9 are not squares. By trial and error, we know that the only square number satisfying these conditions is 134689=367^2.
Hence, he had worked for 367 days, and had delivered 134689 letters.",The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.,"It's easy to see that the number of letters he had delivered is the square of the number of days he had worked.

Hence, he had worked for 367 days, and had delivered 134689 letters.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify the total letters as a square number:**  
   The number of letters delivered each day forms an arithmetic sequence of odd numbers. The sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers is \( n^2 \). Thus, the total letters delivered after \( n \) days is \( n^2 \).

2. **Establish the minimum value for \( n \):**  
   Solve \( n^2 > 100,000 \). The smallest integer \( n \) is \( \lceil \sqrt{100,000} \rceil = 317 \).

3. **Apply digit constraints (ascending order):**  
   The total \( n^2 \) must have digits in strictly ascending order (e.g., 134689). Key observations:
   - The last digit must be 9 (since squares ending in 7 or 8 are invalid, and ascending order requires the last digit to be the largest).
   - \( n \) must end with 3 or 7 (as squares ending in 9 require roots ending in 3 or 7).

4. **Check divisibility and modular constraints:**
   - **Divisible by 4 (fourth and fifth digits):** The number formed by the fourth and fifth digits of \( n^2 \) must be divisible by 4 (e.g., 68 in 134689).
   - **Odd squares modulo 8:** \( n^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
   - **Divisibility by 3 and 9:** If the sum of digits is divisible by 3, it must also be divisible by 9 (to avoid disqualification as a square).

5. **Trial and error with valid candidates:**
   - Test numbers like 123456 (fails due to divisibility by 3 but not 9).
   - Verify \( 134689 \):  
     - Check ascending digits: \( 1 < 3 < 4 < 6 < 8 < 9 \).  
     - Confirm \( 367^2 = 134,689 \).  
     - Validate constraints:  
       - \( 134,689 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).  
       - Fourth and fifth digits (68) are divisible by 4.  
       - Digit sum \( 1+3+4+6+8+9 = 31 \), not divisible by 3.  

**Final Answer:**  
The postman worked for **367 days** and delivered **134,689 letters** in total.",True
134,"Question: Bill, Bob, Frank, and Jim, who all drive cabs, work a particularly busy street that runs east and west. The street has no traffic lights. Oddly enough, an equal number of pedestrians walk in each direction at four kilometres per hour. The four cab drivers were discussing the best way to pick up a fare. Bill said he was going to sit beside the curb and wait until a fare came along. Bob said he was going to cruise west at four kilometres an hour; therefore, he would have twice the chance of picking up a fare as Bill. Frank said he was going to cruise east at eight kilometres an hour and his chances were twice as good as either Bill's or Bob's. Jim claimed that they were all wrong. He was going to drive west at 12kmh and his chances of picking up a fare were twice as good as Frank's. Of the claims that were made which were correct and which were wrong?
 Solution: Bill made no claim, Bob's claim was false, Frank's claim was true, and Jim's claim was false. Let's assume that 100 people passed Bill going east at four kph, and 100 people passed him going west at four kph. Bob, who was driving west at four kph, wouldn't pass anyone walking west, but would pass 200 people walking east. This would put him no further ahead than Bill. Frank, who was driving east and 300 people going west. Jim, who was going west at 12kph, would pass 200 people going west and 400 people going east.

1. **Understanding Relative Speeds:**
   - Pedestrians walk east and west at 4 km/h each. Cab drivers' speeds affect their relative speed to pedestrians, determining how many they encounter.

2. **Analyzing Each Driver's Strategy:**
   - **Bill (Stationary):** Encounters 100 eastbound + 100 westbound = 200 pedestrians/hour.
   - **Bob (West at 4 km/h):**
     - Eastbound: Relative speed = 4 + 4 = 8 km/h → 200 pedestrians.
     - Westbound: Relative speed = 4 - 4 = 0 km/h → 0 pedestrians.
     - Total = 200 (same as Bill). **Claim (twice Bill’s chance) is false.**
   - **Frank (East at 8 km/h):**
     - Eastbound: Relative speed = 8 - 4 = 4 km/h → 100 pedestrians.
     - Westbound: Relative speed = 8 + 4 = 12 km/h → 300 pedestrians.
     - Total = 400 (twice Bill’s 200). **Claim is true.**
   - **Jim (West at 12 km/h):**
     - Eastbound: Relative speed = 12 + 4 = 16 km/h → 400 pedestrians.
     - Westbound: Relative speed = 12 - 4 = 8 km/h → 200 pedestrians.
     - Total = 600 (1.5× Frank’s 400, not double). **Claim is false.**

3. **Conclusion:**
   - **Correct Claim:** Frank (double Bill/Bob).
   - **False Claims:** Bob (twice Bill), Jim (twice Frank).
   - Bill made no claim.

**ANSWER:**  
Bob’s claim is **false**, Frank’s claim is **true**, and Jim’s claim is **false**. Bill did not make a claim.",True

136,"Question: Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?
Comments to triflers:
The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!
 Solution: 80
To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion. This takes 9 trips of 2 5/18 miles (5 advancing trips interspersed with 4 return trips) for a total of 20.5 miles traveled (9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5) and 20.5 bottles of soda used.

To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion.

1. **Initial Setup and First Stage Transport:**
   - Bu starts with 5 cases (120 bottles) at Weiss Pavilion.
   - **Objective:** Transport all 5 cases to an intermediate point (2 5/18 miles away) to minimize fuel use.
   - **Trips Required:** 5 forward trips (moving cases) + 4 return trips (to retrieve more cases) = 9 trips total.
   - **Fuel Calculation:** Each trip covers 2 5/18 miles. Total miles traveled = 9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5 miles. Fuel used = 20.5 bottles.
   - **Remaining Bottles:** 120 - 20.5 = 99.5 bottles.

2. **Redistribute Cases and Second Stage Transport:**
   - **Redistribution:** Set aside 3.5 bottles (used for later fuel). Remaining 96 bottles form 4 cases (24 bottles/case).
   - **Move 4 Cases 0.5 Miles:** Use the 3.5 set-aside bottles to cover 7 trips (4 forward + 3 return) over 0.5 miles. Total fuel used = 3.5 bottles.
   - **New Distance Covered:** 2 5/18 + 0.5 = 2 7/9 miles from Weiss. Remaining distance = 5 - 2 7/9 = 2 2/9 miles.

3. **Final Stage Transport:**
   - **Trips Required:** Move 4 cases the final 2 2/9 miles. Requires 7 trips (4 forward + 3 return).
   - **Fuel Calculation:** Total miles = 7 * 2 2/9 = 15 5/9 miles. Fuel used = 15 5/9 bottles.
   - **Delivered Bottles:** 96 - 15 5/9 = 80 4/9. Only whole bottles count, so **80 unopened bottles** delivered, with 4/9 bottle unused.

**Key Insight:** By strategically splitting the transport into stages and reducing the number of cases (and thus trips) at each stage, Bu minimizes fuel consumption. The optimal intermediate distances balance trip frequency and fuel efficiency.",True
137,"Question: Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.  Henry's plan calls for the tracks (each of which is one mile in length) to be laid end-to-end with no gap between them, pinned to the ground at every other juncture, as shown below:
v_______ _______vv_______ _______v
Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""
Henry replies, ""The expansion will only be an inch over the whole mile length.  If the tracks buckle, it will only be by an inch or two at most.  The trains will certainly have no trouble bumping over these buckles.""
Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?
 Solution: The rise in the middle of the tracks would have been much greater than Henry surmised.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse).

SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**  
   Henry assumes a 1-inch expansion over a mile-long rail would cause only a 1-2 inch buckle. His boss disagrees, knowing the vertical displacement is much larger.

2. **Model the Expansion:**  
   When the rail expands by 1 inch (total length = 1 mile + 1 inch = 63,361 inches) and is pinned at both ends, it buckles upward. The system forms a triangle:
   - **Base (original length):** 63,360 inches (1 mile).
   - **Hypotenuse (expanded length):** 63,361 inches.

3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**  
   Calculate the height (\(h\)) of the buckle using the difference in squares:
   \[
   h = \sqrt{(63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2}
   \]
   Simplify using the difference of squares:
   \[
   h = \sqrt{(63,361 - 63,360)(63,361 + 63,360)} = \sqrt{1 \times 127,721} \approx 355.98 \text{ inches (≈29.66 feet)}.
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The small linear expansion (1 inch) over a mile results in a vertical displacement of ~29.66 feet—not 1-2 inches. This massive buckle would derail trains, justifying the boss’s criticism. Henry failed to account for geometric scaling in constrained systems.",True

141,"Question: You have two identical ropes and three mice.  Each mouse bites off the rope at a different biting speed.  All three biting speeds are constant.
Mouse(A) bites off one rope in 60 minutes.
Mouse(B) bites off one rope in 90 minutes.
Mouse(C) bites off one rope in 180 minutes.
You do not have any time or distance measuring tools and the length of the rope is unknown.  How can you measure 75 minutes?
 Solution: Mark the two ropes as Rope(A) and Rope(B).
1. Let Mouse(A) and Mouse(C) start biting off Rope(A) at the same time, starting each from  one end (moving in opposite directions).  At the same time, let Mouse(B) start biting off Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(A) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X = S(A) * 60, where S(A) is biting speed for Mouse(A) and X is Rope(A) length
X = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X is Rope(A) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(A)/S(C) = 3:1, which means that for each 3 units Mouse(A) will move, Mouse (C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(A) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(A) bites off three times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides Rope(A) length in to 4 units.
Mouse(A) bitten off portion = 3/4 X (where X is Rope(A) length)
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/4 X
Finding the time spent before Rope(A) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(A) needs  60 minutes to bite off X, How many minutes are needed to bite off 3/4 X?
Minutes needed = 3/4 * 60 = 45 minutes are needed to fully bite off Rope(A) by Mouse(A) and Mouse(C).  At that point in time, Mouse(B) would have bitten off exactly half the length of Rope(B) (needing 90 minutes to bite off the full rope), and needs an additional 45 minutes to bite off the remaining rope half.
2. Let Mouse(B) continue biting off Rope(B) and make Mouse(C) start biting off the other end of Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(B) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X/2 = S(B) * 90, where S(B) is biting speed for Mouse(B) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
X/2 = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(B)/S(C) = 2:1, which means that for each 2 units Mouse(B) will move, Mouse(C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(B) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(B) bites off two times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides the remaining half of Rope(B) length to 3 units.
Mouse(B) bitten off portion = 2/3 * X/2 = X/3

   - After 45 minutes, Rope A is gone. Mouse B has chewed **half of Rope B** (45 minutes at \( \frac{1}{90} \) per minute).

3. **Switch Mice to Rope B’s Remaining Half:**
   - Now, **Mouse B** continues chewing the **left end** of Rope B’s remaining half, and **Mouse C** starts chewing the **right end**.
   - Mouse B’s rate on the half rope: \( \frac{1}{45} \) per minute (full rope in 90 ⇒ half in 45).

145,"Question: How many trailing zeros are in the number 1000!?
 Solution: The ! stands for factorial.  So, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!
The only way to get a trailing zero is by multiplying a factor of 1000! which is 2 by a factor of 1000! which is 5. The modified problem is thus: How many such pairs of factors are there?
There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5. But in addition there are 40 = 1000/25 numbers which are multiples of 25, each of which gives one factor of five in addition to the one counted in the 200 and the one counted in the 40 above.

1. **Identify the source of trailing zeros**: Trailing zeros in a factorial result from factors of 10, which are composed of pairs of prime factors 2 and 5.  
2. **Determine the limiting factor**: Since there are more factors of 2 than 5 in \(1000!\), the number of trailing zeros is dictated by the number of factors of 5.  
3. **Count factors of 5 systematically**:  
   - **Step 1**: Count multiples of 5 in \(1, 2, \dots, 1000\):  
     \(\left\lfloor \frac{1000}{5} \right\rfloor = 200\).  
   - **Step 2**: Count multiples of \(25 = 5^2\) (each contributes an extra 5):  
     \(\left\lfloor \frac{1000}{25} \right\rfloor = 40\).  
   - **Step 3**: Count multiples of \(125 = 5^3\) (additional 5s):  
     \(\left\lfloor \frac{1000}{125} \right\rfloor = 8\).  
   - **Step 4**: Count multiples of \(625 = 5^4\) (further 5s):

In all 14 stages ""Crazy"" Charles finished in the same position: 93rd. However, at the end of the race, ""Crazy"" Charles was declared runner-up in the competition: his accumulated time was less than that of all the other competitors except one, the champion.
Bearing in mind the fact that none of the 100 competitors withdrew from the race, how was it possible for ""Crazy"" Charles to finish second if he never even made it into the top 90 competitors?
 Solution: ""Crazy"" Charles was runner-up in the race because in each of the 14 stages he beat 7 different competitors, and he beat them all by more time than the accumulated time that they beat him by in all the other stages of the tour. Since 7*14=98, there was only one cyclist that he never beat and that was the champion.",,"""Crazy"" Charles was runner-up in the race because in each of the 14 stages he beat 7 different competitors, and he beat them all by more time than the accumulated time that they beat him by in all the other stages of the tour. Since 7*14=98, there was only one cyclist that he never beat and that was the champion.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Stage Positions vs. Total Time:** ""Crazy"" Charles finished 93rd in all 14 stages, meaning 7 cyclists finished behind him each time. However, final rankings are determined by **total accumulated time**, not stage positions.

2. **Unique Competitors Beaten Per Stage:** Each stage, Charles beat **7 distinct cyclists** (7 × 14 stages = 98 cyclists total). The remaining **1 cyclist (the champion)** always finished ahead of Charles.

3. **Time Margin Analysis:**
   - In the **1 stage** where Charles beat a competitor, that competitor lost a **large time margin (X)**.
   - In the **13 stages** where those 98 competitors beat Charles, they gained a **small time margin (Y)** per stage.

4. **Cumulative Time Comparison:**
   - For each of the 98 competitors:  
     **Total Time = 13*(T - Y) + (T + X) = 14T - 13Y + X**  
     Charles’ Total Time = **14T**.  
     For Charles to have a better time:  
     **14T < 14T - 13Y + X** → **X > 13Y**.
   - The **large loss (X)** in one stage outweighed the **small gains (13Y)** across other stages.

5. **Final Standings:**
   - The **98 cyclists** had worse total times than Charles due to their single large loss.  
   - The **champion** consistently finished ahead of Charles in all stages, securing the best total time.  
   - Thus, Charles became **runner-up** despite never finishing in the top 90.  

**Key Insight:** Strategic dominance in specific stages (beating 7 cyclists by a large margin) compensated for poor stage positions, ensuring Charles’ total time surpassed 98 competitors. Only the champion, unbeaten by Charles, had a better total time.",True
147,"Question: The Boldavian navy has a rigorous training program.  In order to graduate from the naval academy, cadets must enter a pool and fight sharks.  Today, a group of cadets was tested.  Each cadet put on his mask, snorkel, and two flippers; and armed himself with a knife.  Then the cadets jumped into the pool.  The sharks were then released from their pens.  After 10 minutes of gruelling hand-to-fin combat, all of the sharks were killed.  Miraculously, none of the cadets were killed.  Exiting the pool, the cadets began to haul the shark bodies out of the water.  The dead sharks were soon lying in a row.  One of the cadets noted that during the fight, there were 4 times as many cadets in the water as there were sharks.  A second cadet then stated that the number of legs they now had was equal to the square of the number of sharks.  A third said that the number of cadet legs was 14 more than the total number of cadet and shark heads.  How many sharks were killed?
 Solution: 7 sharks were killed.
Since there were 4 times as many cadets, there were 28 cadets.  The number of cadet legs is equal to the square of the number of sharks, which would be 49 legs.  49 legs is 14 more than the number of cadet and shark heads: 7 sharks plus 28 cadets equals 35 heads.
Note that although all of the cadets survived, nothing was said about possible injuries.  In fact, each shark had bitten off one leg from each of 7 cadets.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) = number of sharks.
   - Let \( C \) = number of cadets.

2. **First Clue (Cadet-to-Shark Ratio):**
   - ""4 times as many cadets as sharks"" implies \( C = 4S \).

3. **Second Clue (Legs Equal to Sharks Squared):**
   - ""Number of legs = \( S^2 \).""
   - Normally, cadets have \( 2C \) legs. However, legs are reduced due to injuries. Thus:
     \[
     2C - \text{lost legs} = S^2
     \]

4. **Third Clue (Legs Exceed Heads by 14):**
   - ""Cadet legs = (Cadet heads + Shark heads) + 14.""
   - Total heads = \( C + S \), so:
     \[
     S^2 = (C + S) + 14

5. **Substitute \( C = 4S \) into the Third Clue:**
   - Replace \( C \) with \( 4S \):
     \[
     S^2 = (4S + S) + 14 \implies S^2 = 5S + 14
     \]
   - Solve the quadratic equation:
     \[
     S^2 - 5S - 14 = 0 \implies S = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2} \implies S = 7 \, (\text{positive solution}).

6. **Verify Leg Deficit:**
   - With \( S = 7 \), \( C = 28 \).
   - Normal legs = \( 2 \times 28 = 56 \), but actual legs = \( 7^2 = 49 \).
   - Deficit = \( 56 - 49 = 7 \) legs, explained by 7 cadets each losing one leg (bitten by 7 sharks).

7. **Consistency Check:**
   - Total heads = \( 28 + 7 = 35 \).
   - \( 35 + 14 = 49 \), matching \( S^2 = 49 \).

During a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%. After a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, the cost of a Red Rose bouquet  decreases by 162 Roka (Roka being the native Romankachi currency). After another year in which there was inflation once more followed by a slowdown, the cost of this bouquet reduces by a further 147.42 Roka. What was the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet ?
 Solution: The original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.
Let the original price of the Red Rose bouquet  be 'B' Roka.
It is given that during a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%.
Hence after a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 162 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)
(since B(1+Y) is the price during inflation and  B(1-Y)(1+Y) the price during the slowdown)
Therefore the decrease in price after one year
= B - B(1-Y^2)
= B - B + B*Y^2
= B*Y^2 = 162      ... Equation 1
Hence after another year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 147.42 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)(1-Y^2)
= B(1-Y^2)^2
(since B(1-Y^2) is the price at the end of the previous year and           B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y) the price during the slowdown this year)
Therefore the decrease in price this year
= B(1-Y^2) - B(1-Y^2)^2
= B(1-Y^2)[1 - (1-Y^2)]
= B(1-Y^2)( Y^2) = 147.42    ... Equation 2
Dividing Equation 2 by Equation 1, we get
(1-Y^2) = 0.91 => Y^2 = 0.09
Substituting the above value of Y^2 in equation 1, we get
B*0.09 = 162
Hence B = 162/0.09 = 1800 Roka.

1. **Define Variables and Initial Equations:**
   - Let the original price be \( B \) Roka and the percentage change be \( Y\% \).
   - After the first year (inflation followed by slowdown), the price becomes \( B(1 + \frac{Y}{100})(1 - \frac{Y}{100}) = B(1 - (\frac{Y}{100})^2) \).
   - The decrease in price after the first year: \( B - B(1 - (\frac{Y}{100})^2) = B(\frac{Y}{100})^2 = 162 \).  
     **(Equation 1: \( B(\frac{Y}{100})^2 = 162 \))**

2. **Second Year Price Change:**
   - Starting price for the second year: \( B(1 - (\frac{Y}{100})^2) \).
   - After the second year (inflation then slowdown), the price becomes \( B(1 - (\frac{Y}{100})^2)^2 \).
   - The decrease in price after the second year: \( B(1 - (\frac{Y}{100})^2) - B(1 - (\frac{Y}{100})^2)^2 = B(1 - (\frac{Y}{100})^2)(\frac{Y}{100})^2 = 147.42 \).  
     **(Equation 2: \( B(1 - (\frac{Y}{100})^2)(\frac{Y}{100})^2 = 147.42 \))**

   - Divide Equation 2 by Equation 1 to eliminate \( B \):  
     \( \frac{B(1 - (\frac{Y}{100})^2)(\frac{Y}{100})^2}{B(\frac{Y}{100})^2} = \frac{147.42}{162} \).  
     Simplifies to \( 1 - (\frac{Y}{100})^2 = 0.91 \).
   - Solve \( 1 - (\frac{Y}{100})^2 = 0.91 \):  
     \( (\frac{Y}{100})^2 = 0.09 \) → \( Y = 30\% \).

   - Substitute \( (\frac{Y}{100})^2 = 0.09 \) into Equation 1:  
     \( B \times 0.09 = 162 \) → \( B = \frac{162}{0.09} = 1800 \).

On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.
About this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, ""Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.""
Knowing Junior, we asked, ""How big a headache is your math gonna give us?""
She answered, ""I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.""
Name the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.
 Solution: Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.
After labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, ""Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof. First, I mark a line from A to D.  This creates a trapezoid (trapezium in Britain) ABCD.  Next, I mark the lines EH, BG, and CF.  These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.""
The partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's. (The second and third cuts can be made in reverse order.)

2) ABCD, EFGH, ADH, and DEH.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**Summary of the Solution:**

1. **Identify the Polygon Requirements:**
   - The polygon must be regular (equal sides and angles).
   - Cuts are straight lines from corner to corner.
   - Sequential cuts must divide the polygon into equal portions, with the last cut splitting the remainder into two equal parts.
   - Total portions must exceed two.

2. **Analyze Candidate Polygons:**
   - A pentagon fails because it cannot produce equal portions.
   - A hexagon fails due to unequal portion sizes.
   - A square or even-sided polygon splits into two equal parts but cannot satisfy the requirement for more than two portions.

3. **Select the Octagon:**
   - A regular octagon has eight sides and high symmetry, enabling equal divisions.
   - Key observation: Strategic cuts can divide the octagon into four equal parts without complex calculations.

4. **Cutting Strategy:**
   - **First Cut:** From vertex A to D (skipping three edges), creating trapezoid ABCD (1/4 of the octagon).
   - **Subsequent Cuts:** Lines EH, BG, and CF divide the remaining area into three more equal trapezoids.
   - **Final Cut:** Splits the last remaining section into two equal parts.

5. **Proof of Equal Portions:**
   - **Symmetry Argument:** The octagon’s regularity ensures all trapezoids and triangles formed by cuts are congruent.
   - **Area Composition:** Each portion comprises two congruent isosceles triangles and one rectangle, matching in total area.
   - **Central Square:** The octagon’s structure includes a central square (with side length equal to the octagon’s edge), surrounded by symmetrical triangles and rectangles. These components are equally partitioned by the cuts.

**Answer:**  
Junior chose a **regular octagon**.  
**Method:**  
1. Cut from vertex A to D, creating trapezoid ABCD (1/4 of the octagon).  
2. Subsequent cuts from E to H, B to G, and C to F divide the rest into three equal trapezoids.  
3. The final cut splits the remaining section into two equal parts.  

**Proof of Equality:**  
The octagon’s symmetry ensures all portions are congruent combinations of triangles and rectangles, validated by geometric equivalence without trigonometry or advanced math.",True
152,"Question: A solid wooden cuboid is made which measures an exact, and even, number of centimetres along each of its edges. It is then painted black all over its exposed faces and, when the paint is dry, the cuboid is cut up into 1 centimetre cubes. These small cubes are counted and it is then found that the number having NO paint on them at all, is exactly the same as the number which do have some paint on them. What is the LEAST number of small cubes there could be in total?
 Solution: Least is 960 (8 by 10 by 12)",,Least is 960 (8 by 10 by 12),DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Define Variables:** Let the cuboid have even dimensions \( l = 2a \), \( w = 2b \), \( h = 2c \), where \( a, b, c \geq 2 \).

2. **Inner Cubes Equation:** The number of unpainted inner cubes is \((l - 2)(w - 2)(h - 2)\). Substituting the even dimensions gives \((2a - 2)(2b - 2)(2c - 2) = 8(a - 1)(b - 1)(c - 1)\).

3. **Total Cubes Equation:** The total number of cubes is \( lwh = 8abc \). The problem states unpainted cubes equal painted cubes:
   \[
   8(a - 1)(b - 1)(c - 1) = \frac{8abc}{2} = 4abc
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   2(a - 1)(b - 1)(c - 1) = abc.
   \]

4. **Solve for Smallest Integers:** Find minimal \( a, b, c \geq 2 \) satisfying \( 2(a - 1)(b - 1)(c - 1) = abc \). Through algebraic manipulation and testing integer solutions:
   - For \( a = 4 \), \( b = 5 \), \( c = 6 \), the equation holds.
   - Corresponding dimensions: \( l = 8 \), \( w = 10 \), \( h = 12 \).

5. **Verify Solution:** 
   - Total cubes: \( 8 \times 10 \times 12 = 960 \).
   - Inner cubes: \( (8 - 2)(10 - 2)(12 - 2) = 6 \times 8 \times 10 = 480 \).
   - Painted cubes: \( 960 - 480 = 480 \), confirming equality.

1. **Understand the Structure**: The five-digit number ABCDE uses digits 1,3,5,7,9. Compute \( AB \times DE - C \), where \( AB \) (first two digits), \( DE \) (last two digits), and \( C \) (center digit) must satisfy the equation \( AB \times DE - C = \text{repdigit} \).

2. **Identify the Repdigit**: The result must be a four-digit number with all identical digits (e.g., 1111, 2222). Through analysis, the only feasible repdigit is **2222**, as larger repdigits exceed the maximum possible product of two two-digit numbers (99×99=9801).

3. **Solve for \( AB \times DE \)**:  
   - Set \( AB \times DE - C = 2222 \).  
   - Rearrange: \( AB \times DE = 2222 + C \).  
   - Since \( C \) is an odd digit (1,3,5,7,9), test values of \( C \).  
   - For \( C = 1 \), \( AB \times DE = 2223 \).

155,"Question: Old Farmer McDoughnut owns a piece of grassland in the heart of Madadia and has three animals: a Madadian Burger Cow, a Spare Kebab Goat, and a Scotch Egg laying Goose. McDoughnut discovered the following:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 45 days.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 90 days also.
For how long can the three animals graze on the field together?
 Solution: The cow, the goat, and the goose eat grass with a constant speed (amount per day): v1 for the cow, v2 for the goat, v3 for the goose.
The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:
v1 = 3 x h/180,
v2 = 2 x h/180,
v3 = 1 x h/180,
k = 1 x h/180.
Then holds for the time t that the three animals can graze together: h-tx(v1+v2+v3-k) = 0, so t = h/(v1+v2+v3-k) = h/(3xh/180+2xh/180+1xh/180-1xh/180) = 36.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( v_1 \), \( v_2 \), \( v_3 \) be the daily grass consumption rates of the cow, goat, and goose, respectively.
   - Let \( k \) be the daily grass growth rate.
   - Let \( h \) be the initial amount of grass.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Scenarios:**
   - **Cow + Goat (45 days):** \( h = 45(v_1 + v_2 - k) \)  
   - **Cow + Goose (60 days):** \( h = 60(v_1 + v_3 - k) \)

   - **Goat + Goose (90 days):** \( h = 90(v_2 + v_3 - k) \)  

3. **Solve for \( v_1 \), \( v_2 \), \( v_3 \), and \( k \) in Terms of \( h \):**
   - From **Cow Alone**: \( v_1 - k = \frac{h}{90} \)  
   - Substitute into **Cow + Goat**: \( \frac{h}{90} + v_2 = \frac{h}{45} \implies v_2 = \frac{h}{90} \).  
   - From **Goat + Goose**: \( \frac{h}{90} + v_3 - k = \frac{h}{90} \implies v_3 = k \).  
   - Substitute \( v_3 = k \) into **Cow + Goose**: \( v_1 = \frac{h}{60} \).  
   - Use \( v_1 = \frac{h}{60} \) in \( v_1 - k = \frac{h}{90} \implies k = \frac{h}{180} \).  
   - Thus, \( v_3 = \frac{h}{180} \).  

4. **Combine Rates for All Three Animals:**
   - Total net consumption rate:  
     \[
     v_1 + v_2 + v_3 - k = \frac{h}{60} + \frac{h}{90} + \frac{h}{180} - \frac{h}{180} = \frac{h}{36}.

1. **Base Cases:**
   - For **n=2**, one call suffices (each shares with the other).
   - For **n=3**, three calls are needed: two calls to gather information into a central person and one final call to disseminate.

2. **Core Group Strategy for n ≥4:**
   - **Step 1: Gather Information into a Core Group (n−4 calls):**
     - Select a core of 4 people. Each of the remaining \( n−4 \) individuals calls a core member, transferring their gossip. After this, core members hold all gossip but haven’t fully shared it among themselves.

   - **Step 2: Share Information Within the Core (4 calls):**
     - Core members make 4 structured calls (e.g., A-B, C-D, A-C, B-D). After these, all core members know everything.

2. **Eliminate invalid multipliers**: The multiplier `3D` must be between 31-39 (excluding 33, as digits cannot repeat). Digits 3 and D are already used in the multiplier, so they cannot appear in `ABC` or `EFGH`.

3. **Check digit constraints**: For each possible `3D` (e.g., 39), ensure `ABC` and `EFGH` use the remaining digits (1-9 excluding 3 and D). For example, with `3D = 39`, digits 3 and 9 are used, leaving 1,2,4,5,6,7,8 for `ABC` and `EFGH`.

4. **Test combinations systematically**:
   - For `3D = 39`, calculate `ABC × 39` and check if the product `EFGH` uses the remaining digits without repetition.

Everything was going great until the very end of the day, when a set of twins showed up. There was just 1 large box of popcorn left to sell, and it was too late to pop another batch, so the twins asked Charlie if he could split the popcorn into two equal portions.Charlie knew that the large box held exactly 12 cups of popcorn. He also had 2 empty boxes on hand: a medium box that held exactly 8 cups and a small box that held exactly 5 cups. But none of the boxes had any measurement markings on them. There must be a way to divide the 12 cups of popcorn so that the two boxes contain exactly 6 cups each, thought the chimp.
How did he give out an equal amount of popcorn to the twins?
 Solution: Fill the 8-cup box from the 12-cup box, leaving 4 cups. Fill the 5-cup box from the 8-cup box, leaving 3 cups. Empty the 5-cup box into the 12-cup box. Now there are 9 cups in the 12-cup box and 3 cups in the 8-cup box. Pour the 3 cups into the 5-cup box. Fill the 8-cup box from the 12-cup box, leaving 1 cup in the 12-cup box.

1. **Assumption for Contradiction**: Suppose, for contradiction, that at the party with \( n \) people, every person knows a distinct number of others.  
   - *Logical Basis*: If all counts are unique, they must cover all integers from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \) (since the minimum number of people one can know is \( 0 \), and the maximum is \( n-1 \) others).

2. **Assign Distinct Counts**: Label the people such that their known counts are \( 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \).  
   - *Implication*: One person knows \( 0 \) others (let’s call them Person A), and another knows \( n-1 \) others (Person B).

3. **Contradiction via Mutual Knowledge**:  
   - Person B (who knows \( n-1 \) people) must know everyone else, including Person A.  
   - However, if Person A knows \( 0 \) people, they cannot know Person B.  
   - This violates the mutual assumption: If B knows A, A must know B.  

4. **Conclusion**: The assumption of all distinct counts fails because it leads to an impossible scenario.  
   - Therefore, at least two people must share the same number of acquaintances.  

**Key Logical Steps**:  
- Use the pigeonhole principle and mutual knowledge to show the contradiction.  
- Demonstrate that the existence of a person with \( 0 \) acquaintances and another with \( n-1 \) acquaintances cannot coexist under mutual relationships.  
- Hence, the minimal number of coconuts is not directly calculated here, but the proof relies on combinatorial reasoning.",True

If its rightmost digit is placed at its left end, the new number is 428571 which is 50% larger than the original number 285714.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Define Variables:** Let the original number be \( N \) with \( k \) digits. Let the last digit be \( d \), and the remaining \( k-1 \) digits form the number \( a \). Thus, \( N = 10a + d \).

2. **Formulate the Equation:** When \( d \) is moved to the front, the new number \( M = d \cdot 10^{k-1} + a \). The problem states \( M = 1.5N \), leading to:
   \[
   d \cdot 10^{k-1} + a = \frac{3}{2}(10a + d).
   \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:** Multiply through by 2 to eliminate fractions:
   \[
   2d \cdot 10^{k-1} + 2a = 30a + 3d.
   \]
   Rearrange terms:
   \[
   d(2 \cdot 10^{k-1} - 3) = 28a.
   \]
   This implies \( d(2 \cdot 10^{k-1} - 3) \) must be divisible by 28.

4. **Analyze Divisibility:**  
   - \( d \) must be even (since \( N \) is even to ensure \( M \) is an integer). Thus, \( d \in \{2, 4, 6, 8\} \).  
   - For \( d = 4 \), solve \( 2 \cdot 10^{k-1} \equiv 3 \mod 7 \).  
   - Since \( 10 \equiv 3 \mod 7 \), compute \( 3^{k-1} \equiv 5 \mod 7 \). The smallest \( k-1 = 5 \), so \( k = 6 \).

5. **Compute \( N \):**  
   - Substitute \( k = 6 \) and \( d = 4 \):  
     \[
     2 \cdot 10^5 - 3 = 199997 \implies a = \frac{4 \cdot 199997}{28} = 28571.
     \]
   - Thus, \( N = 10a + d = 285714 \).

6. **Verify the Solution:**  
   - Moving the last digit (4) to the front gives \( 428571 \).  
   - Confirm \( 428571 = 1.5 \times 285714 \), which holds true.

   - Let Alf's current age be \( A \) and Bert's be \( B \).
   - Let \( p \) and \( q \) be their prime ages when they last met, with \( q = p + 3 \) (since their age difference is constant).

2. **Age Difference Constraint:**
   - From the problem's complex time references, derive that \( B - A = 3 \). This comes from simplifying the equation involving their ages when Alf was half Bert's age and substituting into the father-related terms, which ultimately cancel out.

3. **Prime Age Condition:**
   - The primes \( p \) and \( q = p + 3 \) must differ by 3. The only such pair is \( (2, 5) \) (since all other primes are odd, and adding 3 to an odd number gives an even number >2, which isn’t prime).

166,"Question: Your assignment is to make a delivery from the depot to your base camp, 1600 miles away. The trip begins normally, but unfortunately, halfway to base camp, your supply truck breaks down. You have no way to call for help. Luckily, in addition to medical supplies, the truck is carrying a Desert Patrol Vehicle (DPV) and two barrels of fuel.
The DPV has a full 10 gallon tank, but to make room for the medical supplies, it can only carry one of the 45 gallon barrels at a time. While you can't transfer fuel between barrels, you can refill the tank from the barrels. Assume the DPV can get 12 miles per gallon, regardless of the load it carries.
How far can you go? Is it far enough to deliver the medical supplies and the DPV to your base camp?
 Solution: You can travel 840 miles from the broken supply truck. Since your base camp is 800 miles away (half of 1600 miles), you can easily complete the delivery. Here's how:
Although you can only carry one barrel at a time, you need to transport both of them until one barrel is empty. F is the barrel used first, and L is the barrel used last.
Use half of a tank (5 gallons) to carry L 5*12=60 miles, and then return for F (uses another 5 gallons). Refill the tank from F and carry it to where you left L (also uses 5 gallons). Refill the tank again from F and switch barrels. Now you are 60 miles from the broken truck, the tank and L are full, but F is down to 30 gallons (45-5-5-5=30). Repeat this procedure two times.
Now you are 60*3=180 miles from the broken truck. The tank and L are still full, but F is empty. Leave F behind and make a run for it, carrying L. Refill the tank from L as needed. There are 55 gallons of fuel left so you can travel an additional 55*12=660 miles, for a maximum of (180+660) 840 miles.  Since you only have a total of 800 miles to go, you will make it to your base camp.","Use half of a tank to carry one barrel, then return for the other.","You can travel 840 miles from the broken supply truck.

1. **Understand the Problem Constraints:**
   - You must transport two 45-gallon fuel barrels 800 miles using a DPV with a 10-gallon tank (12 mpg). 
   - The DPV can only carry one barrel at a time, and fuel cannot be transferred between barrels.

2. **Establish a Shuttle Process to Move Both Barrels Forward:**
   - **Barrel F (used for shuttling)** and **Barrel L (reserved for final trip)**.
   - Each 60-mile segment involves:
     - Taking L forward 60 miles (5 gallons used from the tank).
     - Returning to the starting point (5 gallons from F).
     - Taking F forward 60 miles (10 gallons from F to refill the tank + 5 gallons used for the trip).
     - Refilling the tank from F (5 gallons), leaving F with 30 gallons after the first iteration.

3. **Repeat the Shuttle Process Three Times:**
   - Each iteration consumes 15 gallons from F (5 for return trip, 10 for forward trip).
   - After three iterations:
     - Distance covered: \( 60 \text{ miles/iteration} \times 3 = 180 \text{ miles} \).
     - Barrel F is empty (\( 45 - 15 \times 3 = 0 \)).
     - Barrel L remains full (45 gallons) since its fuel was only used for forward trips.

4. **Final Stretch Using Barrel L:**
   - At 180 miles, discard empty Barrel F.
   - Use Barrel L (45 gallons) and the DPV’s 10-gallon tank (total fuel: \( 45 + 10 = 55 \text{ gallons} \)).
   - Maximum additional distance: \( 55 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ mpg} = 660 \text{ miles} \).

5. **Total Distance and Feasibility:**

Only powers of 2 are not reachable, and the next number is 2048.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Understand the Representation Requirement**: A number can be expressed as a sum of **two or more** consecutive nonnegative integers if and only if it has an **odd factor greater than 1**. This is derived from the formula for such sums, which involves a product of two integers with opposite parity (one even, one odd).

2. **Identify the Exception (Powers of 2)**: Numbers that are **powers of 2** (e.g., \(2^n\)) lack odd factors. Their only prime factor is 2, making it impossible to split them into the required product of even and odd terms. Thus, they cannot be written as sums of two or more consecutive nonnegative integers.

3. **Locate the Power of 2 in the Range**: Within 1000 to 2000, the only power of 2 is \(2^{10} = 1024\). The next power (\(2^{11} = 2048\)) exceeds 2000.

169,"Question: Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.
We were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?
 Solution: It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.
Hence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.
Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90. These 90 id's will not have a corresponding number when written in reverse order.
Secondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order. For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.
Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.
Therefore total number of valid employee id's possible = 90 + 90 + 360 = 540.",,"It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.

1. **Total Valid IDs**: Calculate the total number of valid 3-digit IDs (100 to 999).  
   - First digit: 9 options (1-9), others: 10 options each.  
   - Total: \(9 \times 10 \times 10 = 900\).

2. **Symmetrical (Palindromic) IDs**: These are identical when reversed (e.g., 121).  
   - First and third digits must match (9 options for the digit, 1-9).  
   - Second digit: 10 options (0-9).  
   - Total: \(9 \times 10 = 90\).

3. **IDs Ending with Zero**: Their reverses are invalid (e.g., 910 reversed is 019, which is invalid).  
   - First digit: 9 options (1-9).  
   - Second digit: 10 options (0-9).  
   - Third digit fixed as 0.  
   - Total: \(9 \times 10 = 90\).

4. **Remaining IDs**: Subtract palindromes and zero-ending IDs from the total.  
   - \(900 - 90 - 90 = 720\).

Mad Ade's house could be #3 out of 3, #15 out of 20, #85 out of 119, or #493 out of 696.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( k \) be Mad Ade's house number.
   - Let \( n \) be the total number of houses (\( n < 1000 \)).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The sum of house numbers before \( k \) (excluding \( k \)) equals the sum from \( k \) to \( n \):
     \[
     \frac{(k-1)k}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - \frac{(k-1)k}{2}
     \]
   - Simplify to:
     \[
     2k(k-1) = n(n+1)
     \]

3. **Solve for \( n \):**
   - Rearrange the equation as a quadratic in \( n \):
     \[
     n^2 + n - 2k^2 + 2k = 0
     \]
   - Use the quadratic formula:
     \[
     n = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 8k^2 - 8k}}{2}
     \]
   - For \( n \) to be an integer, the discriminant \( 8k^2 - 8k + 1 \) must be a perfect square.

4. **Relate to Pell’s Equation:**
   - Let \( m^2 = 8k^2 - 8k + 1 \). This transforms into:
     \[
     m^2 - 2(2k - 1)^2 = -1
     \]
   - This is a Pell-type equation with solutions generated recursively.

5. **Generate Solutions:**
   - Fundamental solutions to the Pell equation yield \( k \) values:
     - \( k = \frac{x + 1}{2} \), where \( x \) is from the Pell sequence \( 1, 5, 29, 169, 985, ... \).
   - Corresponding \( n \) values are:
     - \( n = \frac{m - 1}{2} \), where \( m \) is from the sequence \( 7, 41, 239, 1393, ... \).

6. **List Valid Solutions Under 1000:**
   - For \( x = 5, 29, 169, 985 \):

1. **Define Variables and Equations:**
   - Let the prices of the three magazines be \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
   - The equations are:
     - \( a + b + c = 5.70 \) (sum equals £5.70)
     - \( a \times b \times c = 5.70 \) (product equals £5.70).

2. **Assume One Price is Half the Total:**
   - Set \( a = \frac{5.70}{2} = 2.85 \).
   - This leaves \( b + c = 2.85 \) and \( b \times c = \frac{5.70}{2.85} = 2 \).

3. **Solve the Quadratic for Remaining Prices:**
   - Substitute \( c = 2.85 - b \) into \( b \times c = 2 \):
     - \( b \times (2.85 - b) = 2 \).
     - Simplify to \( b^2 - 2.85b + 2 = 0 \).
   - Solve using the quadratic formula:
     - Discriminant: \( (2.85)^2 - 4(1)(2) = 0.1225 \).
     - Roots: \( b = \frac{2.85 \pm \sqrt{0.1225}}{2} = \frac{2.85 \pm 0.35}{2} \).
     - Solutions: \( b = 1.60 \) or \( b = 1.25 \).

1. **Determine the magic constant**: The required sum for each row, column, and diagonal is calculated using the formula for an \( n \times n \) magic square:  
   \[
   \text{Magic constant} = \frac{n(n^2 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5(25 + 1)}{2} = 65.

4. **Construct the grid using symmetry**:
   - Place pairs of numbers summing to 26 symmetrically around the center. For instance:

If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.
If N=5 and A=1, then E=9. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
If N=2 and A=4, then E=6. R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.
If N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.
If N=2, then since R cannot be 5, R=8, L=5, and I=7.
If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.
Since 1+S+T equals 5 or 15, S+T equals 4 or 14. If S+T=14, then S and T must be 5 and 9, or 6 and 8, in some order. But each of our three scenarios has a letter for at least one of 5 and 9, as well as one for 8. So S+T=4, S and T are 1 and 3 in some order, and O+S=12.
If S=1, then O=11. But since each letter represents only one digit, S=3, T=1, and O=9.
If N=5, then A=1. But since T=1, this cannot work.
If N=4, then I=9. But since O=9, this cannot work.
We are left with one possible scenario:
T=1, N=2, S=3, A=4, L=5, E=6, I=7, R=8, and O=9.

177,"Question: Once an old man died, and in his Will he stated that all the pearls he kept in a little bag were to be distributed among his daughters. To make things fair, the distribution must be done in the following way:
The older girl should receive one pearl, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""
And so it was.
How many pearls were there in the bag?
How many daughters did the old man have?
How many pearls did each girl get?
 Solution: There were 36 pearls.
There were 6 daughters.
Each daughter got 6 pearls.
The girl number x will have x pearls and a seventh of the rest. Since the last girl leaves no pearls in the bag, then when she takes her pearls the rest in the bag is zero (a seventh of nothing is nothing).
Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).
That is, k+1 = 7 and then k = 6.
So, the number of pearls is 6*6 = 36, and there were 6 girls.","If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","There were 36 pearls.

1. **Determine the relationship between the number of daughters (k) and pearls each receives (N):**
   - Each daughter receives the same number of pearls, so if there are \( k \) daughters, each gets \( N = k \) pearls. Total pearls = \( k \times k = k^2 \).

2. **Work backward from the last daughter:**
   - The \( k \)-th daughter takes \( k \) pearls, leaving none. Thus, before her turn, there were \( k \) pearls.

3. **Establish equations for each prior daughter using the distribution rule:**
   - For the \( (k-1) \)-th daughter: She takes \( (k-1) \) pearls, then \( \frac{1}{7} \) of the remainder. The remaining pearls after her must equal \( k \). Solve for the pearls before her turn:
     \[
     \frac{6}{7} \times (\text{pearls before} - (k-1)) = k \implies \text{pearls before} = \frac{7k}{6} + (k-1).
     \]
   - Repeat this logic recursively for all previous daughters.

4. **Verify with \( k = 6 \):**
   - Total pearls = \( 6^2 = 36 \).
   - For the 5th daughter: Before her turn, there were \( 12 \) pearls. She takes \( 5 + \frac{12-5}{7} = 6 \), leaving \( 6 \).
   - Continue backward for all daughters, confirming each step leaves the correct remainder. Initial pile = \( 36 \).

- **Total pearls:** \( 36 \).
- **Number of daughters:** \( 6 \).
- **Pearls per daughter:** \( 6 \).",True

1. **Define Variables and Work Rates:**
   - Let \( R \) be Rastus's work rate, \( W \) be Weedy Willie's, and \( T \) be each triplet's (Wig, Twig, Swig) work rate.  
   - From the problem:  
     \( R + 3T = \frac{1}{5} \) (work rate of Rastus + triplets)  
     \( W + 3T = \frac{1}{6} \) (work rate of Willie + triplets).  

2. **Relate \( R \) and \( W \):**
   - Subtract the equations: \( R - W = \frac{1}{30} \), so \( R = W + \frac{1}{30} \).  

3. **Express Shares Proportional to Work Rates:**
   - The field is divided into \( N \) parts (a two-digit square: 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81). Willie takes 1 part, leaving \( N - 1 \) parts for Rastus and the triplets.  
   - Shares \( y \) (Rastus) and \( x \) (each triplet) must satisfy \( y + 3x = N - 1 \).  
   - Proportionality: \( \frac{y}{R} = \frac{x}{T} = \frac{1}{W} \).
