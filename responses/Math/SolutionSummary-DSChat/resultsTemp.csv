0,"Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?
 Solution: The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",DSChat,solutionSummary,"### Summary of the Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Problem Setup**
- There are **6 villages** (A, B, C, D, E, F) arranged in a **regular hexagon** on the coastline of a perfectly round island.
- Every pair of villages is connected by a straight path, resulting in **13 crossings** (including the center M).
- **Courtship rule**: A suitor must travel every possible route from his village to the father's village, where each step must bring him closer to the destination.

#### **Step 2: Identify the Three Brides' Villages**
- The brides' villages are the **first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise** from the suitor's village.  
  - If the suitor starts at **A**, the brides' villages are **B, C, D** (in order).

#### **Step 3: Count Routes for Each Suitor**
The number of routes from the suitor's village (A) to each bride's village (B, C, D) determines the wedding dates.

##### **Routes from A to B (Adjacent Village)**
1. **A → B (direct)**: 1 route.
2. **A → Ai → ABi → Bi → B**:  
   - Ai can only be reached from A (1 way).  
   - ABi can be reached from A and Ai (1 + 1 = 2 ways).  
   - Bi can only be reached from ABi (2 ways).  
   - B can be reached from A, ABi, and Bi (1 + 2 + 2 = 5 ways).  
   **Total routes: 5**  
   - Last trip: April 5th → Wedding: **April 6th**.

##### **Routes from A to C (Second Village)**
1. **A → C (direct)**: 1 route.  
2. **Via intermediate crossings (AFi, Fi, Ai, ABi, M, B, Bi, BCi, CDi, Ci)**:  
   - Assign values step-by-step (as in the solution).  
   - Final count: **41 routes**.  
   - Last trip: May 11th → Wedding: **May 12th**.

##### **Routes from A to D (Opposite Village)**
1. **A → D (direct)**: 1 route.  
2. **Via intermediate crossings (F, B, FAi, ABi, Ai, Fi, Bi, EFi, BCi, M, C, E, Ei, Ci, DEi, CDi, Di)**:  
   - Assign values step-by-step (mirror symmetry simplifies calculations).  
   - Final count: **121 routes**.  
   - Last trip: July 31st → Wedding: **August 1st**.

#### **Step 4: Bonus Question (Longest Route Length)**
- **Circumference = 10 miles** → **Radius = 5/π miles** (since circumference = 2πr).  
- The longest route is **A → B → ABi → C → Ci → CDi → Di → D** (or its mirror).  
- Breakdown:  
   - **A-B**: 5/π miles (side of hexagon = radius).  
   - **B-ABi-BCi-C**: Each segment is part of an equilateral triangle with height = radius/2 → side length = 5/(√3 π).  
   - **C-Ci-CDi-Di-D**: Similar logic.  
- **Total distance**:  
  \[
  \text{Diameter} + 4 \times \text{side of small triangle} = \frac{10}{\pi} + 4 \times \frac{5}{\sqrt{3} \pi} \approx 6.86 \text{ miles}.
  \]

### **Final Answer:**
- **Wedding Dates**: April 6th, May 12th, August 1st.  
- **Longest Route**: ~6.86 miles.  

### **Key Observations:**
1. The number of routes grows exponentially with distance (adjacent = 5, second village = 41, opposite = 121).  
2. The longest route involves detours through intermediate crossings, adding segments of smaller equilateral triangles.  
3. The solution relies on **dynamic programming** (counting paths step-by-step) and **symmetry** (mirroring crossings).  

This approach ensures correctness by systematically enumerating all valid paths while maintaining the ""always getting closer"" constraint.",True
1,"Question: What is the smallest integer such that if you rotate the number to the left you get a number that is exactly one and a half times the original number?
(To rotate the number left, take the first digit off the front and append it to the end of the number.  2591 rotated to the left is 5912.)
 Solution: 1,176,470,588,235,294
x 1.5 =
1,764,705,882,352,941
Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)

70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the smallest integer \( N \) such that rotating it left (moving the first digit to the end) gives \( 1.5N \). For example, if \( N = 1176470588235294 \), rotating it left gives \( 1764705882352941 \), which equals \( 1.5 \times 1176470588235294 \).

2. **Key Insight**: The solution involves finding a repeating fraction \( 1/p \) where the repeating block has \( p-1 \) digits. This property holds for prime \( p \) where \( p-1 \) is the smallest exponent for which \( 10^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p \). The first such prime is 7, but it doesn't yield a valid solution. The next prime is 17.

3. **Repeating Fraction for 1/17**: The repeating decimal for \( 1/17 \) is \( 0.\overline{0588235294117647} \), with a 16-digit repeating block. Each digit in the block corresponds to a unique position \( n \) (from 1 to 16) in the sequence of powers of 10 modulo 17.

4. **Digit-Position Mapping**: Assign each digit in the repeating block to its position \( n \) in the sequence of remainders when \( 10^n \) is divided by 17. For example:
   - The first digit (0) corresponds to \( n=1 \).
   - The second digit (5) corresponds to \( n=2 \), etc.

5. **Find Valid Pairs**: We need pairs where the digit at position \( n \) is followed by the digit at position \( 1.5n \). Since \( n \) must be even (to ensure \( 1.5n \) is integer), we check even \( n \) values:
   - For \( n=2 \), the next digit is at \( n=3 \).
   - For \( n=4 \), the next digit is at \( n=6 \).
   - For \( n=6 \), the next digit is at \( n=9 \).
   - For \( n=8 \), the next digit is at \( n=12 \).
   - For \( n=10 \), the next digit is at \( n=15 \).

6. **Construct the Number**: The smallest valid number is constructed by starting at \( n=2 \) (digit 1) and following the sequence of digits at positions \( 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 8, 12, 15, 7, 10, 2, \dots \). This yields the 16-digit number \( 1176470588235294 \).

7. **Verification**: Rotating this number left (moving the first '1' to the end) gives \( 1764705882352941 \), which equals \( 1.5 \times 1176470588235294 \).

8. **Generalization**: Other solutions can be found by starting at different even \( n \) values, but \( 1176470588235294 \) is the smallest.

The smallest integer satisfying the given condition is **1,176,470,588,235,294**.",True

9304 becomes 10010001011000, which has 9 zeros and 5 ones.",DSChat,solutionSummary,"SUMMARY:
1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find a formula that transforms given numbers (13, 2352, 246, 700, 1030) into their respective outputs (7, 16, 14, 16, 14). The goal is to apply the same formula to 9304.

2. **Look for Patterns**:
   - 13 → 7: 13 in binary is 1101 (3 ones, 1 zero). 3 × 2 + 1 × 1 = 7.
   - 2352 → 16: 2352 in binary is 100100110000 (3 ones, 7 zeros). 3 × 2 + 7 × 1 = 13 (does not match 16). This suggests the initial hypothesis is incorrect.
   - Revise the hypothesis: Count the number of zeros and ones in the binary representation, but assign different weights (e.g., 2 for ones, 1 for zeros).
     - 13 (1101): 3 ones (3 × 2 = 6) + 1 zero (1 × 1 = 1) → 7 (matches).
     - 2352 (100100110000): 4 ones (4 × 2 = 8) + 8 zeros (8 × 1 = 8) → 16 (matches).
     - 246 (11110110): 6 ones (6 × 2 = 12) + 2 zeros (2 × 1 = 2) → 14 (matches).
     - 700 (1010111100): 6 ones (6 × 2 = 12) + 4 zeros (4 × 1 = 4) → 16 (matches).
     - 1030 (10000000110): 3 ones (3 × 2 = 6) + 8 zeros (8 × 1 = 8) → 14 (matches).
   - The formula is confirmed: For a given number, convert it to binary, count the number of ones (weight = 2) and zeros (weight = 1), and sum them.

3. **Apply the Formula to 9304**:
   - Convert 9304 to binary: 10010001011000.
   - Count the digits: 9 zeros (9 × 1 = 9) and 5 ones (5 × 2 = 10).

3,"Question: Two 2s can be combined in many ways to express different numbers. Here are some!
2-2=0
2/2 = 1
.2 + 2 = 2.2
(2^2)! = 24  (4! means 4x3x2x1) (2^2 is 2 to the power of 2)
**CHALLENGE!**
Can you write an expression that has the value of exactly 5, using:
* two, and only two, 2s, and
* any mathematical symbols or operations?
You may not use any other numbers. The symbols used would be known by most high school maths students.
The hint below lists the symbols that are used in this solution. Even with that information, it is a worthy challenge!
Of course, other solutions may be possible! Solvers should write these in the Comments section.
 Solution: The square root of point 2 to the power of minus 2.
sqrt ( (.2)^(-2) )
.2^(-2) is the same as 1/0.04, i.e. 25

[Point 2 is usually written as 0.2, but .2 is also correct.]",DSChat,solutionSummary,"SUMMARY:
1. **Understand the constraints**: We must use exactly two 2s and no other numbers. We can use any mathematical operations or symbols known to high school students.
2. **Explore operations involving two 2s**: Consider basic operations (+, -, *, /, ^), factorials, square roots, decimals, and exponents.
3. **Use decimals and exponents**: The solution involves representing 0.2 (or .2) using one of the 2s, and then using an exponent with the other 2.
4. **Construct the expression**: 
   - First, write .2 (or 0.2) using one 2.
   - Raise .2 to the power of -2: (.2)^(-2) = 1/(.2)^2 = 1/0.04 = 25.
   - Take the square root of the result: sqrt(25) = 5.
5. **Verify the solution**: The expression sqrt((.2)^(-2)) uses exactly two 2s and evaluates to 5, satisfying all constraints.

Thus, the solution is:  
**sqrt((.2)^(-2)) = 5**
