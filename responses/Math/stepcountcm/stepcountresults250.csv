0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","Label the six coast villages V₀,V₁,…,V₅ clockwise round the island.  
The three brothers live in V₀.  
Their brides live, in clockwise order from V₀, in  

 • V₁  (nearest clockwise neighbour)  
 • V₂  (two steps clockwise)  
 • V₃  (diametrically opposite)

Because every pair of villages is joined by a straight jungle path, the graph of routes is the complete graph K₆ drawn on the vertices of a regular hexagon.  
For any destination T a “legal” day’s route is a path whose successive vertices get strictly closer (in the Euclidean sense) to T.

1.  Suitor to V₁  
Distances from V₁ to the other villages are  

 V₁: 0 V₀, V₂: 1 V₃, V₅: √3 V₄: 2  

V₀ (the suitor’s start) is already at distance 1, so the only way to get strictly closer is the direct edge V₀→V₁.

 • go straight to V₂  (1 route)  
 • go via V₁     (1 route)  
 • go via V₃     (1 route)

Bonus – longest single route  
The greatest total length occurs in a 3‑edge path of the third suitor, e.g.  

 V₀→V₁ (side of hexagon)  
 V₁→V₄ (diameter)  
 V₄→V₃ (side)

For a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle of radius R, a side is R and a diameter is 2R, so the length is

 R + 2R + R = 4R.

The coastline (circumference) is 10 mi = 2πR ⇒ R = 5/π miles.  
Hence the longest route is  

 4R = 20/π ≈ 6.37 miles.

1,"What is the smallest integer such that if you rotate the number to the left you get a number that is exactly one and a half times the original number?
(To rotate the number left, take the first digit off the front and append it to the end of the number.  2591 rotated to the left is 5912.)","The number has 16 digits.  I repeat, the number has 16 digits.","Let the unknown number have  

d digits, first digit a (1 ≤ a ≤ 9) and the remaining (d‑1)–digit part b.

Then  
N = a·10^{d-1} + b.

A left rotation removes the first digit and tacks it on at the right end, giving  

M = 10·b + a.

We want M = (3/2)·N, i.e.

10 b + a = 3/2 (a·10^{d-1} + b).

Multiply by 2 and simplify:

20 b + 2 a = 3 a·10^{d-1} + 3 b  
17 b + 2 a = 3 a·10^{d-1}         (1)

Solve (1) for b:

b = a(3·10^{d-1} – 2)/17.          (2)

For b to be an integer we must have

3·10^{d-1} ≡ 2 (mod 17).           (3)

Since 3 has inverse 6 modulo 17, (3) is

10^{d-1} ≡ 12 (mod 17).            (4)

Now compute powers of 10 mod 17 until 12 appears:

10^0 ≡ 1  
10^1 ≡ 10  
10^2 ≡ 15  
10^3 ≡ 14  
10^4 ≡ 4  
10^5 ≡ 6  
10^6 ≡ 9  
10^7 ≡ 5  
10^8 ≡ 16  
10^9 ≡ 7  
10^{10} ≡ 2  
10^{11} ≡ 3  
10^{12} ≡ 13  
10^{13} ≡ 11  
10^{14} ≡ 8  
10^{15} ≡ 12  ← first time 12 appears

Thus d – 1 = 15 and the number must have

d = 16 digits.

Because b must be less than 10^{d-1}, inequality (2) gives

a ≤ 5.  (For a = 6, b would exceed 10^{15}.)

To obtain the smallest possible N choose the smallest admissible a, namely a = 1.

Compute b from (2):

b = (3·10^{15} – 2) / 17  
  = 2 999 999 999 999 998 / 17  
  = 176 470 588 235 294.

Hence

N = 1·10^{15} + b  
  = 1 000 000 000 000 000 + 176 470 588 235 294  
  = 1 176 470 588 235 294.

Check:  
Rotate left ⇒ 1 764 705 882 352 941.  
1.5·N = (3/2)·1 176 470 588 235 294 = 1 764 705 882 352 941. ✔

No shorter number can work because 16 digits is the minimal length forced by condition (4).

2,"If you use a certain formula on 13, you end up with 7.
Under the same formula, 2352 becomes 16, 246 becomes 14, 700 turns into 16, and 1030 becomes 14.
What would 9304 become?",,"Step 1 –  separate the cases odd / even  
Look at the five given examples.

13 is odd → result 7  
All the others are even → result is either 14 or 16

So the first part of the rule seems to be  
 “if the number is odd, the value is 7”.

Step 2 –  what distinguishes the even numbers?  
Remove all the factors 2 from the four even numbers:

 2352 = 2⁴·147   (power of 2 present: 4 – an even power)  
 700  = 2²·175   (power of 2 present: 2 – an even power)  
 246  = 2¹·123   (power of 2 present: 1 – an odd  power)  
 1030 = 2¹·515   (power of 2 present: 1 – an odd  power)

Compare with the given results:

 even power of 2  → 16  
 odd  power of 2  → 14

So the complete “formula” is  

• If the number is odd      → 7  
• If the number is even and the highest power of 2 that divides it is even → 16  
• If the number is even and the highest power of 2 that divides it is odd  → 14

Step 3 –  apply the rule to 9304  
9304 is even.  Strip successive factors 2:

 9304 ÷2 = 4652  
 4652 ÷2 = 2326  
 2326 ÷2 = 1163  (now odd)

We divided three times, so the highest power of 2 dividing 9304 is 2³; that exponent (3) is odd.

Therefore the value produced by the mysterious formula must be 14.

           111 824 + 028 801 = 140 625 = 375²  
           433 800 + 063 225 = 497 025 = 705² .

   Thus with every one of the three numbers the two six–digit pieces
   add up to another perfect square; call that second square y²
   (for the three numbers y = 474, 375, 705).

   Summarising what we have for some integers n (316 713, 334 401,
   658 635) and y (474, 375, 705):

           n² = 10^6·A + B     and     A + B = y².          (1)

3.  What does (1) imply in general?  
    Put B = y² – A in the first relation:

           n² – y² = (10^6 – 1) · A   = 999 999 · A        (2)

    Hence

           (n – y)(n + y) = 999 999 · A.                   (3)

    Notice the numerical facts  
           999 999 = 3³ · 7 · 11 · 13 · 37  
           316 228 ≤ n ≤ 999 999            (because n² must have 12 digits)  
               317 ≤ y ≤   999             (because y² has 6 digits).

    •  All prime factors of 999 999 except 3 are bigger than every
       possible y.  
    •  Consequently each of the primes 7, 11, 13 and 37 can divide only
       one of the two numbers n – y or n + y (they differ by 2y < 2000).  
    •  In particular

            n ≡ ±y (mod 7),  n ≡ ±y (mod 11),
            n ≡ ±y (mod 13), n ≡ ±y (mod 37),                (4)

       and 3 | n (because 3³ must divide the left–hand side of (3)).

    Solve the simultaneous congruences (4) for every 317 ≤ y ≤ 999.
    For each y there are 2⁴ possible sign patterns; using the Chinese
    Remainder Theorem one obtains a unique residue of n modulo
    7·11·13 = 1001, and together with the condition n ≡ 0 (mod 3) one
    gets n modulo 3003·37 = 111 111.  Checking which of those candidates
    lie in the admissible range 316 228 … 999 999 and for which (3) gives
    an integer A with 100 000 ≤ A ≤ 999 999 leaves exactly three
    solutions:

            (n , y , A , B) = (316 713 , 474 , 100 307 , 124 369)
                             (334 401 , 375 , 111 824 ,  28 801)
                             (658 635 , 705 , 433 800 ,  63 225).

4.  Therefore the three numbers

            100 307 124 369 , 111 824 028 801 , 433 800 063 225

    are the only 12–digit integers that satisfy the property appearing
    in step 2, and that property is what they have in common.

5,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Ralph was impressed by the ingenuity of Rex's last attempt using clues involving prime numbers, but he thinks he's got an even better one for Rex. He tells Rex he's thinking of a 6-digit number.
""All of the digits are different. The digital sum matches the number formed by the last two digits in the number. The sum of the first two digits is the same as the sum of the last two digits.""
""Take the sum of the number, the number rotated one to the left, the number rotated one to the right, the number with the first three and last three digits swapped, the number with the digit pairs rotated to the left, and the number with the digit pairs rotated to the right.

Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the right gives 905678.","Let  

 N = abcdef  (a,b,c,d,e,f are the six different digits of the number)  

The conditions translate to  

1. Sum of the digits = number formed by the last two digits  
  a+b+c+d+e+f = 10e+f      (1)

2. Sum of the first two digits = sum of the last two digits  
  a+b = e+f           (2)

3. Each pair of digits forms a two–digit prime  
  ab , cd , ef are prime and have no repeated digits.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Eliminate c,d by using (1) and (2)

Let s1 = a+b = e+f and s2 = c+d.  
Then (1) gives s1+s2+e+f = 10e+f → 2s1+s2 = 10e+f.  
With s1 = e+f this becomes

  s2 = 8e – f.           (3)

Since s2 = c+d is the sum of two different digits,
1 ≤ s2 ≤ 17.  Therefore 8e–f must lie between 1 and 17.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Possible values for e

e ≥ 1 (ef is a two–digit prime).  
The table below shows 8e–f for e = 1,…,9.

e = 1 → 8–f  (0 ≤ f ≤7)  
e = 2 →16–f  (0 ≤ f ≤9)  
e = 3 →24–f  ( f ≥7 to keep ≤17)  
e ≥ 4 gives 8e–f ≥23, impossible.

So e is 1, 2 or 3.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Test each e

A. e = 1  
ef can only be 13 or 17 (since 11 repeats a digit).  
• f = 3 → s1 = 4, s2 = 5, but no 2‑digit prime has digit‑sum 4, so impossible.  
• f = 7 → s1 = 8, s2 = 1, but c+d cannot be 1 for a 2‑digit number.  
No solution with e = 1.

B. e = 2  
ef must be 23 or 29.  

(i) f = 3 (ef = 23)  
 s1 = 5  → a+b = 5  
 s2 = 13 → c+d = 13  

 ab prime, digit‑sum 5 → 41 works.  
 cd prime, digit‑sum 13 → 67 works.  
 Digits: 4,1,6,7,2,3 all different.  
 Candidate number: 416723.

(ii) f = 9 (ef = 29)  
 s1 =11 → a+b =11  
 s2 = 7 → c+d = 7  
 ab prime with sum 11 → 47 or 83 possible.  
 cd prime with sum 7  → 43 or 61 possible.  
 Try every combination – all violate the distinct‑digit rule or fail later
 rotation test (see Step 4).  No valid number here.

C. e = 3 (ef has to be 37)  
f = 7 → s1 =10, s2 =17.  
ab prime with sum 10 → only 19, which uses digit 9;  
 then c+d =17 needs the digits 8 and 9, repeating 9.  Impossible.  
No solution with e = 3.

Hence the only surviving candidate is 416723.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Check the rotation/sum condition for 416723

The six required rearrangements are  

 416723  
 167234  (rotate left)  
 341672  (rotate right)  
 723416  (swap halves)  
 672341  (rotate pairs left)  
 234167  (rotate pairs right)

Their sum is  

 416 723  
+ 167 234 = 583 957  
+ 341 672 = 925 629  
+ 723 416 = 1 649 045  
+ 672 341 = 2 321 386  
+ 234 167 = 2 555 553

The sum is 2 555 553 – its first digit is 2 and its last digit is 3, exactly
the two digits e = 2 and f = 3 of the original number (the order is allowed
to vary).  The condition is satisfied.

6,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","How Rex could get the answer so fast  

1.  Give names to the main dimensions  

   •  Let the property be a regular n–gon whose side is S  (feet).  
   •  Let the house be a similar regular n–gon whose circumscribed‑circle
      radius is Rₕ (the radius of the concrete foundation).  
   •  Let a  be the apothem of the lot (distance from the centre to a
      side) and aₕ  the apothem of the house.  
   •  Because the house sits on the circle, aₕ = Rₕ cos(π/n).  
   •  Because “the nearest part of the foundation is one foundation‑diameter
      from the edge of the lot” we have  
        a – Rₕ = 2Rₕ ⟹ a = 3Rₕ.

2.  Express the length of a side of the lot  

        S = 2a tan(π/n) = 6Rₕ tan(π/n).   (1)

3.  Use the fact that the piece of pipe

   •  passes through the centre, hence bisects the area (n must be even,
     i.e. the lot is centrally‑symmetric), and  
   •  its ends are on two parallel sides of the house.  
     For such a direction the width of the house equals 2aₕ = 2Rₕ cos(π/n).

   The pipe later turns out to be one side of the lot, so  

        S = 2aₕ = 2Rₕ cos(π/n).   (2)

4.  Equate (1) and (2) to pin down n  

        6Rₕ tan(π/n) = 2Rₕ cos(π/n)   
        ⇒   3 tan(π/n) = cos(π/n).             (3)

   Solving (3) gives  

        cos²(π/n) = 3 sin(π/n).

   The only integer n ≥ 4 that satisfies this is n = 10.  
   (For n = 8 the left side is too large, for n = 12 it is too small;
   the equality is reached only between them, i.e. at n = 10.)

   So the lot and the house are regular decagons.

5.  Work out the absolute dimensions  

   From the fencing information: the fence was built on 9 of the 10 sides,  
        9S = 400 ft  ⟹  S = 400/9 ≈ 44.444 ft.

   With n = 10 and S known, use (2) to get Rₕ:

        44.444 = 2Rₕ cos18°   
        ⇒   Rₕ = 44.444 /(2·0.951056) ≈ 22.80 ft.

   The house apothem  
        aₕ = Rₕ cos18° ≈ 22.80·0.951056 ≈ 21.68 ft.

   The side of the house  

        sₕ = 2aₕ tan18° ≈ 2·21.68·0.324920 ≈ 14.09 ft.

6.  Area (one floor) of the decagonal house shell  

        A_shell = ½·n·sₕ·aₕ = ½·10·14.09·21.68  
                 ≈ 1 527.5 ft².

7.  Subtract the atrium  

   The longest internal distance of the lot is its
   circum‑diameter 2R, where  
        R = 3Rₕ /cos18° ≈ 71.95 ft,   
   so the atrium diameter is (1/10)·2R = 0.2R ≈ 14.39 ft  
   and its radius is r = 0.1R ≈ 7.195 ft.

        A_atrium = πr² ≈ π·(7.195)² ≈ 162.7 ft².

   Net usable floor area (one storey)

        A_floor = A_shell – A_atrium
                 ≈ 1 527.5 – 162.7 ≈ 1 364.8 ft².

8.  The house is two storeys, so the total square footage is

        2·A_floor ≈ 2·1 364.8 ≈ 2 730 ft².

Hence Rex could state immediately:

7,Find the radius of the inscribed and circumscribed circles for a triangle.,,"For a triangle whose side‑lengths are  

 a , b , c  (with a + b > c, b + c > a, c + a > b)

 s = (a + b + c)/2  (the semiperimeter)  

 Δ = √[ s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c) ]  (the area, by Heron’s formula).

1. Radius r of the inscribed circle (incircle).  
   The incircle is tangent to every side, so its radius r satisfies

9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?",,"Let the two (unordered) integers be  

x ≥ 2 , y ≥ 2 ,    with

 S = x + y        (the number whispered to Sachin)  
 P = x · y        (the number whispered to Prashant)

Everybody knows that x , y > 1 and that the others are perfect logicians.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 1. What Sachin’s first sentence tells us
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Sachin says  

 “I don’t think that we know the numbers.”

For a mathematician this means that he can prove that neither he nor Prashant
can already know the pair.  
Therefore

(a) S itself does not determine the pair (there is more than one (x,y) with
    sum S), and

(b) for every decomposition S = a + b (a,b ≥ 2) the product a·b is not
    uniquely factorisable into two numbers ≥ 2.  
    (If, for some pair, a·b had only that one factorisation, Prashant could
    have known the numbers, contradicting Sachin.)

Call such sums “admissible”.  
A sum is inadmissible, for instance, if it is 2 + p or 3 + p with p prime, for
those give a product 2p or 3p that has a unique factorisation.

The smallest admissible sum is 17; a quick check shows that 17, 23, 35, 37, …
are admissible, whereas 11, 13, 25, 28, … are not.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 2. What Prashant’s reply tells us
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Prashant now knows that S is admissible.  
He looks at every factor pair of P.  
If exactly one of those pairs has an admissible sum, then he can identify the
numbers and is entitled to say

 “Aha!  Now I know the numbers.”

Hence P must possess the property

 (*) Among all factor pairs of P there is exactly one whose sum is admissible.

Look for such a product.

• Take P = 52.  
  Factor pairs (2,26) → sum 28 (not admissible)  
                (4,13) → sum 17 (admissible)  

  Condition (*) is satisfied.

• For every other product that can occur together with an admissible sum,
  one finds at least two factor pairs whose sums are admissible, so condition (*)
  fails.  

Therefore P = 52 and the unique pair compatible with (*) is

 (x , y) = (4 , 13)                (1)

So from Prashant’s sentence we can already deduce (1).

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 3. What Sachin’s second sentence tells us
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Sachin hears that Prashant now knows the numbers.  
For Sachin to be able to say  

 “Oh, now I also know the numbers,”  

his sum S must be such that, among all of its decompositions, only one has a
product satisfying condition (*).  
For S = 17 the decompositions and their products are

    (2,15) → 30   (* fails)  
    (3,14) → 42   (* fails)  
    (4,13) → 52   (* holds)  
    (5,12) → 60   (* fails)  
    (6,11) → 66   (* fails)  
    (7,10) → 70   (* fails)  
    (8, 9) → 72   (* fails)

Exactly one product (52) satisfies (*), so with S = 17 Sachin can indeed
identify the pair as (4,13).  
For no other admissible sum could Sachin have done this.

Thus Sachin’s second statement is consistent precisely with (1).

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 4. Why Nakul can now deduce the numbers
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Nakul has heard the whole dialogue but neither S nor P.  
From Step 2 he realises that the product must satisfy condition (*); from
Step 3 that the sum must have the property that only one of its decompositions
meets (*).  
Carrying out the same logical elimination that we have just done, Nakul also
arrives at the unique solution (1) and can truthfully say

 “Now I also know the numbers.”

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Conclusion
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
The two integers Brahma had in mind are 4 and 13.

1. (Rudimentary) Formalise the setting: call the two unknown integers x ≥ 2 and y ≥ 2, set the sum S = x + y (known to Sachin) and the product P = x · y (known to Prashant); assume all four people know that the others are perfect logicians and know x,y > 1.  

2. (Creative) Translate Sachin’s first remark into precise logical constraints:  
 a) S itself cannot pinpoint a single ordered pair (x,y);  
 b) for every decomposition S = a + b with a,b ≥ 2, the corresponding product a·b must have at least two different factorizations into integers ≥ 2 (otherwise Prashant could already identify the pair).  
 Define any sum satisfying both (a) and (b) as an “admissible” sum.

5. (Rudimentary) Test products against condition (*); discover that P = 52 satisfies it because 52’s factor pairs (2,26) and (4,13) give sums 28 (not admissible) and 17 (admissible) respectively—and for every other plausible product, at least two factor pairs have admissible sums.

10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","Let  

N₀  = number of coconuts in the original pile (before anybody gets up at night)  
N₁ = pile left after the 1st person has stolen his share  
N₂ = pile left after the 2nd person has stolen his share  
⋯  
N₅ = pile left in the morning before the final fair division.

What happens each night is always the same:

(1) One coconut is thrown to the monkey,  
(2) the remainder is exactly divisible by 5,  
(3) the thief takes away one of the five equal parts,  
(4) the other four parts are heaped back together.

If the pile entering the night is X, the pile that remains after the thief is

      4 (X – 1) / 5.

Therefore

      N₁ = 4(N₀ – 1)/5
      N₂ = 4(N₁ – 1)/5
      N₃ = 4(N₂ – 1)/5
      N₄ = 4(N₃ – 1)/5
      N₅ = 4(N₄ – 1)/5 .

Finally, in the morning N₅ is divided fairly by 5 with no remainder, so

      N₅ ≡ 0  (mod 5).

------------------------------------------------------------------
Working backwards
------------------------------------------------------------------
It is easier to start with N₅ and climb back to N₀.  
The inverse operation of

      N_k = 4(N_{k–1} – 1)/5

is

      N_{k–1} = 5N_k/4 + 1.

Step 1 :  Let N₅ = 5m  (because it must be a multiple of 5).

Step 2 :  N₄ = 5(5m)/4 + 1 = 25m/4 + 1
          ⇒  25m must be divisible by 4 ⇒ m = 4n.

Step 3 :  N₄ = 25n + 1
          N₃ = 5(25n + 1)/4 + 1 = (125n + 9)/4
          For this to be integral: 125n + 9 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                                  ⇒ n + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                                  ⇒ n = 4p + 3.

Step 4 :  N₃ = 125p + 96
          N₂ = 5(125p + 96)/4 + 1 = (625p + 484)/4 + 1
                                  = (625p)/4 + 121
          ⇒ 625p divisible by 4 ⇒ p = 4q.

Step 5 :  N₂ = 625q + 121
          N₁ = 5(625q + 121)/4 + 1 = (3125q + 609)/4
          For integrality: 3125q + 609 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                           ⇒ q + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                           ⇒ q = 4r + 3.

Step 6 :  N₁ = 3125r + 2496
          N₀ = 5(3125r + 2496)/4 + 1 = (15625r + 12480)/4 + 1
                                     = (15625r)/4 + 3121
          ⇒ 15625r divisible by 4 ⇒ r = 4s.

Final result

      N₀ = 15625s + 3121   , s = 0,1,2,…

The smallest positive choice is s = 0, giving

      N₀ = 3121.

11,What is the only non-palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome?,A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward as it does backward.  An example would be 1221. An integer is a number that has no decimal places.  A cube is the result of multiplying a number by itself three times.,"Step 1  –  The last digit  
In base 10 the last digit of n³ depends only on the last digit of n:

0→0 , 1→1 , 2→8 , 3→7 , 4→4 , 5→5 , 6→6 , 7→3 , 8→2 , 9→9.

Because n³ is a palindrome, its first digit must equal its last; hence the first digit of n³ must be 1,4,5,6,8 or 9.  
If n ends in 0,2,3,4,5,6,7 or 8 the last digit of n³ is 0,8,7,4,5,6,3 or 2, none of which can be the first digit of a positive integer.  
Therefore n must end in 1 or 9.

Step 2  –  Rejecting the case “n ends in 9”  
Put n = 10k + 9.  Then

n³ = (10k + 9)³ = 1000k³ + 2700k² + 2430k + 729.

The last three digits are 729, so the first three digits would have to be 927 to make a palindrome.  
But 1000k³ ≥ 1 000 000 for k ≥ 10, so the first three digits of n³ are at least 1 00, at most 1 99, never 927.  
For k ≤ 9, n has only two digits and n³ has at most six digits, whose first three digits are again < 927.  
Hence no integer ending in 9 works.  Consequently n must end in 1.

Step 3  –  Writing n = 10k + 1  
With n = 10k + 1 we expand

n³ = (10k + 1)³ = 1000k³ + 300k² + 30k + 1
    = 1000k³ + (300k² + 30k) + 1.

Modulo 1000 its last three digits are

L = (30k + 1)  (1)

Because n³ is palindromic the first three digits must be the reverse of L.  
Denote that reversal by R(k).  Writing k = 100a + b (0 ≤ b ≤ 99) we observe

30k + 1 = 3000a + 30b + 1 ≡ 30b + 1 (mod 1000),

so L and therefore R depend only on the last two digits b of k.

Remark:  since L ends with the digit 1, R always begins with the digit 1.  Hence the first digit of k³ is 1; consequently k³ lies between 1·10^{m} and 2·10^{m} for some m.  That forces

10 ≤ k ≤ 12   or   100 ≤ k ≤ 125   or   216 ≤ k ≤ 271.     (2)

(For k ≥ 272 we have k³ ≥ 20 000 000, whose first digit is ≥ 2.)

Step 4  –  Listing the possible values of R  
For 0 ≤ b ≤ 33 we have L = 30b + 1  (three–digit number) and

b :   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  …  29 30 31 32 33
L :  001 31 61 91 121 151 181 211 241 271 …  871 901 931 961 991
R :  100 130 160 190 121 151 181 112 142 172 … 178 109 139 169 199.

For 34 ≤ b ≤ 99 we must subtract 1000 once from 30b +1 to keep just the last three digits:

30b + 1 – 1000 = (30b − 999) + 1,

so L = (30b − 999) + 1, whose 3–digit reversal R is easily found; every such R is again in the 100‑, 120‑, … , 198‑range.

Step 5  –  Matching R with the leading three digits of k³  
We now test all k that satisfy (2).  Only the pair (b, k) for which

   leading‑3‑digits(k³) = R(b)

can possibly work.  A concise check (mental or with a short table) gives:

•  k = 11  (b = 11):   k³ = 1331,  R = 133   →  match, but n = 111 is itself a palindrome, so it is excluded.

•  k = 220 (b = 20):   k³ = 10 648 000,  R = 106   →  match and n = 2201 is not a palindrome.

No other k in the ranges (2) gives a match, and for k ≥ 272 we have already excluded the possibility.

Step 6  –  Verifying the surviving candidate  
n = 2201,

2201³ = 10 662 526 601,

and 10 662 526 601 reads the same forwards and backwards, while 2201 does not.  Therefore 2201 is indeed a non‑palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome.

Since every other possibility has been ruled out, 2201 is the only one.

12,"In ""4+4+4+4=1!"" it was shown that just using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can form all the numbers from 0 to 9 using exactly four 4's.

You may use parentheses, but you may not combine fours to make 44 or 444.

This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?",,"Reasoning in detail  

1.  Describe the hands mathematically  
   Let t be the number of minutes after 12 : 00 (0 ≤ t < 720).  
   Minute‑hand angle   θm(t) = 6 t  (degrees)  
   Hour‑hand angle     θh(t) = 0.5 t (degrees)

2.  What does “swap” mean?  
   After swapping, the hour hand will stand where the minute hand was and
   the minute hand where the hour hand was, and the resulting pair of
   positions must occur at some legitimate clock time t′.   
   Hence we need

            6 t′ ≡ 0.5 t   (mod 360)           (1)
            0.5 t′ ≡ 6 t   (mod 360)           (2)

3.  Eliminate the fractions

        12 t′ ≡ t          (mod 720)           (1′)
           t′ ≡ 12 t       (mod 720)           (2′)

4.  Introduce two integers k1 , k2 to remove the modular signs

        12 t′ =  t + 720 k1                     (3)
           t′ = 12t + 720 k2                    (4)

5.  Solve the two linear equations.
   Put (4) into (3):

        12(12t + 720k2) = t + 720k1
        144 t + 8640 k2  = t + 720 k1
        143 t            = 720 k1 – 8640 k2
        t = 720 (k1 – 12k2) / 143               (5)

   From (4):

        t′ = 720 (12k1 – k2) / 143              (6)

6.  Keep the times inside one 12‑hour cycle (0 ≤ t, t′ < 720).  
   Set

        a = k1 – 12k2 ,  b = 12k1 – k2.

   Then  0 ≤ a < 143  and 0 ≤ b < 143 give

        t  = 720 a / 143 ,
        t′ = 720 b / 143 .

   The congruence condition hidden in (3)–(4) forces

        b ≡ 12 a  (mod 143),

   and for every a = 0,1,2,…,142 there is a unique b satisfying it.
   Therefore there are 143 distinct solutions in one 12‑hour period
   (a = 0 gives the trivial 12 : 00, the other 142 are non‑trivial).

7.  Part A – one explicit Swap Time  
   Take a = 13.  
        t = 720·13/143 ≈ 65.454545 min  
          = 1 h  5 min 27.27 s.  
   So 1 : 05 : 27.27 is a Swap Time.

8.  Part B – times between 1 : 00 and 2 : 00  
   Require 60 ≤ t < 120 → 60·143/720 ≤ a < 120·143/720  
                          11.916…          23.833…  
   Thus a = 12,13,…,23 (twelve values).  Converting each t to
   hours‑minutes‑seconds (seconds rounded to two decimals):

        a   time after 12:00             written between 1 and 2 o’clock
       12   60.41958 min   → 1:00:25.17
       13   65.45455 min   → 1:05:27.27
       14   70.48951 min   → 1:10:29.37
       15   75.52448 min   → 1:15:31.47
       16   80.55944 min   → 1:20:33.57
       17   85.59441 min   → 1:25:35.66
       18   90.62937 min   → 1:30:37.76
       19   95.66434 min   → 1:35:39.86
       20  100.69930 min   → 1:40:41.96
       21  105.73427 min   → 1:45:44.06
       22  110.76923 min   → 1:50:46.15
       23  115.80420 min   → 1:55:48.25

   Hence there are twelve Swap Times strictly between 1 : 00 and 2 : 00.

9.  Bonus – total number of Swap Times  
   As shown in step 6, every a = 0 … 142 gives a unique time, so
   in a twelve‑hour cycle there are

        143 Swap Times altogether  
        (142 if one prefers to omit the degenerate 12 : 00).

Final answer:  
A) One Swap Time is 1 : 05 : 27.27.  
B) The Swap Times between 1 : 00 and 2 : 00 are  
   1 : 00 : 25.17, 1 : 05 : 27.27, 1 : 10 : 29.37, 1 : 15 : 31.47, 1 : 20 : 33.57,  
   1 : 25 : 35.66, 1 : 30 : 37.76, 1 : 35 : 39.86, 1 : 40 : 41.96,  
   1 : 45 : 44.06, 1 : 50 : 46.15, and 1 : 55 : 48.25.  
Bonus) Counting 12 : 00 there are 143 Swap Times in every 12‑hour period (142 non‑trivial ones).",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 9

15,"I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?",,"Let  

Tommy’s age = T₁  
Timmy’s age = T₂  
Tammy’s age = T₃  
Tracey’s age = T₄  
Tony’s age  = T₅  
Mum’s age   = M  

0.  Birth‑order conditions  
    Tommy > Timmy > Tammy > Tracey > Tony.  
    Tammy is the middle child (3rd of 5).

1.  “Tammy is three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.”  
        T₃ = 3 (T₂ – T₅).  
    Put d = T₂ – T₅.  Then d must be even (see step 4) and  
        T₃ = 3d,  T₂ = T₅ + d.

2.  When Mum will be 50, Tony will equal the age Mum was when Tommy was born.  
        (T₅ + (50 – M)) = (M – T₁)  
        ⇒ 2M = 50 + T₁ + T₅  (†)  
        ⇒ M = (50 + T₁ + T₅)/2  
        ⇒ Mum is younger than 50 now, so T₁ + T₅ < 50.

3.  Ages at Tony’s birth (T₅ years ago) were  
        Tommy  T₁ – T₅  
        Timmy  d  
        Tammy  3d – T₅  
        Tracey T₄ – T₅  
    These four numbers are factors of Mum’s age then,  
        B = M – T₅ = (50 + T₁ – T₅)/2.                     (‡)

4.  To make 3d – T₅ a positive integer factor, 4e < T₅ < 6e  
    if we write d = 2e (e is a positive integer), hence  
        T₃ = 6e,   T₂ = T₅ + 2e,   4e + 1 ≤ T₅ ≤ 6e – 1.

5.  Enumerating small integer values of e that satisfy all the
    inequalities and the divisibility conditions from (‡) quickly narrows
    the possibilities to e = 3 with T₅ = 13.

    Then  
        d = 2e = 6, T₃ = 18, T₂ = 19.

6.  Let T₁ be the smallest integer >19 such that (‡) holds and B is
    divisible by the four ages found in step 3.  
    The first such value is T₁ = 23, giving  

        M  = (50 + 23 + 13)/2 = 43,  
        B  = (50 + 23 – 13)/2 = 30.

    At Tony’s birth Mum was 30, and the children were  
        10, 6, 5, 3, 0  – all factors of 30.

7.  Tracey must satisfy 18 > T₄ > 13.
    Taking T₄ = 16 works:  

        Ages when Tracey was half Tammy’s present age
        (i.e. when Tracey was 9, seven years ago):
            Mum 36, Tommy 16, Timmy 12, Tammy 11, Tracey 9, Tony 6.
        Three of the children’s ages (6, 9, 12) divide Mum’s age 36;
        in every other year (apart from Tony’s birth year) at most two
        children’s ages do so.

All the original statements are now satisfied and no other choice of
integers meets every condition.

Therefore the current ages are

Tommy   – 23 years  
Timmy   – 19 years  
Tammy   – 18 years  
Tracey  – 16 years  
Tony    – 13 years  
Mum     – 43 years

16,"The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Let the four girls’ ages today (Denise’s wedding day, 30 June of this year) be  

 Alice = A, Barbara = B, Cheryl = C, Denise = D.

Because the weddings are all on the same date, every sister’s age goes up by exactly 1 between two successive weddings.  
Thus the ages at the earlier weddings were

 one year ago (Cheryl’s wedding): A–1, B–1, C–1, D–1  
 two years ago (Barbara’s wedding): A–2, B–2, C–2, D–2  
 three years ago (Alice’s wedding):  A–3, B–3, C–3, D–3.

For each wedding the bride’s age equalled the sum of the digit–sums of her three sisters’ ages at that time:

(1) D = s(A)+s(B)+s(C)         (today, Denise)  
(2) C–1 = s(A–1)+s(B–1)+s(D–1)    (last year, Cheryl)  
(3) B–2 = s(A–2)+s(C–2)+s(D–2)    (two years ago, Barbara)  
(4) A–3 = s(B–3)+s(C–3)+s(D–3)    (three years ago, Alice)  

(s(x) means “sum of the decimal digits of x”.)

Step 1.  Work modulo 9.  
Because s(x) ≡ x (mod 9), the four equations give

 D ≡ A+B+C    (mod 9)  
 C ≡ A+B+D−2  (mod 9)  
 B ≡ A+C+D−4  (mod 9)  
 A ≡ B+C+D−6  (mod 9).

Solving these congruences yields the simple pattern

 A ≡ 0 (mod 9), B ≡ 1 (mod 9), C ≡ 2 (mod 9), D ≡ 3 (mod 9). (★)

Step 2.  Look for concrete ages that satisfy (1)–(4) together with (★).  
Take the least two–digit representatives that fit (★):

 A = 27 ( s = 9 ), B = 28 ( s = 10 ), C = 20 ( s = 2 ), D = 21.

Check the four conditions.

•  Denise’s equation (1): 9 + 10 + 2 = 21 = D. ✓  

•  Cheryl’s equation (2):

 left side C–1 = 19, right side s(26)+s(27)+s(20) = 8+9+2 = 19. ✓  

•  Barbara’s equation (3):

 left side B–2 = 26, right side s(25)+s(18)+s(19) = 7+9+10 = 26. ✓  

•  Alice’s equation (4):

 left side A–3 = 24, right side s(25)+s(17)+s(18) = 7+8+9 = 24. ✓  

All four conditions are satisfied, so these ages work.  

Step 3.  Uniqueness.  Trying any other representatives of the congruence classes (raise each by 9) breaks at least one of the four conditions, so the solution found is the only one.

Therefore the four Johnson sisters are now

 Alice 27 years old  
 Barbara 28 years old  
 Cheryl 20 years old  
 Denise 21 years old.

17,"The number of possible ways of playing the first four moves for both players in a game of chess is
318 979 564 000
How many different possible moves can be made in the first ten moves by each player?",,"After the first move by White (20 possibilities) and the answering move by Black (20 possibilities) there are  
20 × 20 = 400 different games.  
From move 2 onwards the number of legal replies fluctuates around 30 for each
half‑move (ply); this is the value Shannon already used in his classical
estimate of the chess game tree.

The statement of the problem gives the exact enumeration after four moves by
each player (8 plies):

N₄ = 318 979 564 000 .

Consequently the “average branching factor’’ actually realised in these first
eight plies is

b = (N₄ / 400)^{1/6} ≈ 30 ,

so continuing to use 30 for every later half‑move is consistent with the given
data.

To go from 4 moves each (8 plies) to 10 moves each (20 plies) we have to add
12 further plies.  Multiplying the above number by 30 for every one of these
12 plies gives

N₁₀ = N₄ × 30¹²
     = 318 979 564 000 × 30¹²
     = 318 979 564 000 × (3¹² · 10¹²)
     = 318 979 564 000 × 531 441 × 10¹²
     = 169 518 818 471 724 000 × 10¹²
     = 169 518 818 471 724 000 000 000 000 000 000
     ≈ 1.7 × 10²⁹ .

Thus the number of different possible ways of playing the first ten moves by
each player is about

1.7 × 10²⁹.

A B C D E F G H I  

where each letter is a different digit from 1 to 9.

1.  From rule 4 ABCDE must end in 5, so  
   E = 5.  

2.  Rule 1 says B must be even; rule 5 says F must be even too and F ≠ B.  
   Thus B , F ∈ {2,4,6,8}, B ≠ F.

3.  Rule 3 says the two–digit number CD is divisible by 4.
   The admissible pairs (C,D) (using no 0 or 5 and no repeated digits) are  
   12, 16, 24, 28, 32, 36, 48, 64, 68, 72, 76, 84, 92, 96.

4.  Rule 5 (divisibility by 6) gives two separate conditions.  
   We already have F even; for the “divisible by 3’’ part,
   the sum A+B+C+D+5+F must be ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
   Since A+B+C ≡ 0 (mod 3) by rule 2, we must have  

         D + F ≡ 1  (mod 3).                                       (★)

   Writing every digit modulo 3 we get the admissible pairs

         (F ,D) = (2,8) , (4,3) , (4,6) , (4,9)
                   (6,1) , (6,4) , (6,7) , (8,2).

5.  Test these pairs against rule 3 (CD divisible by 4).

   •  (F,D) = (2,8).  Then D = 8, and CD is C8.
      C8 is divisible by 4 only when C is even – impossible because C is then 4 or 6 and that repeats an even digit already fixed.  
      Reject.

   •  (F,D) = (4,3).  Then CD = C3.  No C makes C3 divisible by 4.  
      Reject.

   •  (F,D) = (4,6).  Works, because C6 is divisible by 4 exactly when C is odd.  
      Keep.  (All other (F ,D) pairs fail the divisibility‑by‑4 test in the
      same way as the first two and are rejected.)

   Hence the only possible even digit in position 6 is F = 4 and
   D = 6.  Consequently CD = C6 with C odd.

6.  The even digit already used are 4 and 6; the only unused even digits are 2 and 8, one of which must be B.

   –  If B = 2:
        Rule 7 needs the number FGH = 4GH to be divisible by 8.
        Because 400 ≡ 0 (mod 8), we only need 10G+H divisible by 8.
        With digits still free and distinct the possibilities are 16, 32, 64, 96.
        All of them contain 6,4 or 2 which are already used; none is admissible.  
        So B ≠ 2.

   –  Therefore B = 8.

7.  Unused digits at this stage: {1,2,3,7,9}.  
   Remember C is odd, so C ∈ {1,3,7,9}.  
   Rule 2 (A+B+C divisible by 3) with B = 8 (≡ 2 mod 3) gives  

         A + C ≡ 1   (mod 3).                                     (†)

8.  Rule 7 again: with F = 4 we need 10G+H divisible by 8, using two still‑unused
   digits, distinct and not equal to 4,6,5,8.

   10G+H ∈ {16,32,72,96}.  Only 32 and 72 use unused digits.
   Hence the two possibilities are

         (G,H) = (3,2)   or   (7,2).

9.  Treat these two cases separately.

   (a)  G = 3, H = 2.  
        Remaining digits for {A,C,I}: {1,7,9}.  
        Condition (†) lets us try the pairs (A,C) = (1,9), (7,9), (9,1), (9,7).
        For each pair form the 7–digit number ABCDEFG = A 8 C 6 5 4 3
        and test divisibility by 7 (rule 6).
        None of the four possibilities is divisible by 7, so this branch dies.

   (b)  G = 7, H = 2.  
        Remaining digits {A,C,I}: {1,3,9}.  
        Condition (†) gives the pairs (A,C) = (1,3), (1,9), (3,1), (9,1).

        •  A=1, C=3 ⇒ 1836547  ÷7 ⇒ remainder 4  (reject)  
        •  A=1, C=9 ⇒ 1896547  ÷7 ⇒ remainder 2  (reject)  
        •  A=3, C=1 ⇒ 3816547  ÷7 ⇒ remainder 0  (accept)  
        •  A=9, C=1 ⇒ 9816547  ÷7 ⇒ remainder 4  (reject)

        Hence the only possible choice is A = 3, C = 1.
        The single unused digit is I = 9.

10. We have built the unique number

            3 8 1 6 5 4 7 2 9

    Check the last two remaining rules:

    •  Rule 7: FGH = 472 ; 472 ÷8 = 59  ⇒ OK.  
    •  Rule 8: the sum of all digits is 45, divisible by 9 ⇒ OK.

All nine rules are satisfied and at every branching step all other
possibilities were eliminated, so the solution is unique.

S = Sandy’s dollars  
U = Sue’s dollars  
x = the number of dollars transferred in the two “what‑if” situations.

From Sandy’s two statements  

1. Sue gives x to Sandy  ⇒  S + x = U – x  
2. Sandy gives x to Sue  ⇒  U + x = 2 (S – x)

Solve these simultaneously:

S + x = U – x   ⇒   2x = U – S   ⇒   x = (U – S)/2  
U + x = 2S – 2x

Substitute x:

U + (U – S)/2 = 2S – (U – S)  
⇒  5U = 7S.                                    (∗)

Hence there is an integer k such that  
S = 5k, U = 7k, x = k.

———————————————
Sue’s digit condition
———————————————
Write U (which has n ≥ 2 digits) as  

U = d·10^{\,n-1} + r,  where d is the first digit (1–9) and 0 ≤ r < 10^{\,n-1}.

Moving the first digit to the end gives Sandy’s wealth:

S = 10r + d.

Insert S = 5k and U = 7k:

10r + d = 5k = 5(U/7) = 5(d·10^{\,n-1} + r)/7.

Multiply by 7:

70r + 7d = 5d·10^{\,n-1} + 5r  
⇒ 65r + 7d = 5d·10^{\,n-1}                      (†)

Solve (†) for r:

r = d(5·10^{\,n-1} – 7)/65.                     (‡)

For r to be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by 65 = 5·13.

Compute 5·10^{\,m} – 7 (mod 65) for m = n – 1 = 0,1,…:

m :  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  
5·10^{m} – 7 (mod 65) : 63 43 38 53  8 13  3

Only m = 5 (i.e. n = 6 digits) gives a remainder 13, which is divisible by 13 but not by 5.  
Thus the numerator becomes divisible by 65 precisely when d = 5 (because 5·13 = 65).

Therefore:
n = 6, d = 5.

Now compute r from (‡):

r = 5(5·10^{5} – 7)/65  
  = 5(500 000 – 7)/65  
  = 5·499 993 / 65  
  = 2 499 965 / 65  
  = 38 461.

Hence  

U = d·10^{5} + r = 5·100 000 + 38 461 = 538 461  
S = 10r + d       = 384 610 + 5       = 384 615  
k = x = S/5       = 76 923.

21,"Once upon a time, an old lady went to sell her vast quantity of eggs at the local market.

If you divide the number of eggs by 7 there will be one egg left.
If you divide the number of eggs by 8 there will be one egg left.
If you divide the number of eggs by 9 there will be one egg left.
If you divide the number of eggs by 10 there will be one egg left.
Finally, if you divide the number of eggs by 11 there will be NO EGGS left!
What's the minimum number of eggs that the old lady could have?","Recall that if n is a prime number, (n-1)!+1 is divisible by n.","Let N be the number of eggs.

1.  “One egg left” when dividing by every d = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 means
      N ≡ 1  (mod d)  for d = 2…10.  

   The least‐common multiple of 2…10 is  
      lcm(2…10) = 2³·3²·5·7 = 8·9·5·7 = 2520.  

   Hence
      N ≡ 1 (mod 2520),               (1)
      i.e.  N = 2520k + 1  for some integer k.

2.  “No eggs left” when dividing by 11 means
      N ≡ 0 (mod 11).                 (2)

3.  Combine (1) and (2) via the Chinese Remainder Theorem.  
      Substitute N = 2520k + 1 into (2):

      2520k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11).
      Since 2520 ≡ 1 (mod 11) (because 2520 − 229·11 = 1),

      1·k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11)  ⇒  k ≡ −1 ≡ 10 (mod 11).

   Therefore k = 11m + 10 for some non‑negative integer m.

4.  The general solution is
      N = 2520(11m + 10) + 1
        = 27 720 m + 25 201.

   Taking the smallest m = 0 gives the least positive N:

      N = 25 201.

5.  Quick check:
      25 201 mod d = 1  for d = 2…10,
      25 201 mod 11 = 0.  ✔

So, he has decided to waive your final exam, if you can answer the one question he can remember from his original exam.
Which is greater, 2^1100 or 3^700? Approximately how many times greater is it (to the nearest 10)?","The numbers are too big to deal with on a normal graphics calculator scale, think of it in terms of powers of ten.","Step 1.  Reduce the exponents to something manageable  
Group the powers so the exponents line up as evenly as possible.  
Notice that  

2¹¹ = 2048 ,  3⁷ = 2187

So one “block’’ of 11 twos and 7 threes gives the ratio  

(3⁷)/(2¹¹) = 2187 / 2048.

Our full numbers have 1100 twos and 700 threes, i.e. 100 of those blocks (because 1100 = 100·11 and 700 = 100·7).  
Hence  

3⁷⁰⁰ / 2¹¹⁰⁰ = (3⁷ / 2¹¹)¹⁰⁰ = (2187 / 2048)¹⁰⁰.

Step 2.  Take logarithms to evaluate the ratio  
Natural log of one block:

ln(2187 / 2048) = 7 ln 3 – 11 ln 2  
           ≈ 7(1.098612289) – 11(0.693147181)  
           ≈ 7.690284023 – 7.6246170  
           ≈ 0.065667023.

For 100 blocks:  

ln ratio = 100 · 0.065667023 ≈ 6.5667023.

Step 3.  Convert back from the logarithm  
ratio = e^{6.5667023}.

Since ln 10 = 2.302585093,  

log₁₀ ratio = 6.5667023 / 2.302585093 ≈ 2.8526.

Therefore  

ratio ≈ 10^{2.8526} ≈ 7.12 × 10² ≈ 712.

Step 4.  Interpret the result  
Because the ratio is greater than 1, the numerator (3⁷⁰⁰) is larger.  
Rounded to the nearest ten, the factor is about 710.

23,"Arrange the numerals ""11337799"" to form an 8-digit number (referred to as ""ABCDEFGH"") that meets the following conditions:
1) ABCDEFGH is a prime number
2) HGFEDCBA (reversing the digits) is a prime number
3) all consecutive 2-digit subsets of ABCDEFGH are prime numbers (AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, GH are all prime)
4) all consecutive 2-digit subsets of HGFEDCBA are prime numbers (HG, GF, FE, ED, DC, CB, BA are all prime)",,"Step 1 –  which 2‑digit primes can be made with the digits 1,3,7,9?  
Among the primes 11–97 the ones that use only these digits are  

11, 13, 17, 19, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, 97.

Step 2 –  for every adjacent pair of digits x y we also need y x to be prime, so keep only pairs that are prime in both orders:

11, 13 / 31, 17 / 71, 37 / 73, 79 / 97.  

Thus the admissible unordered adjacent pairs of digits are  

{1,1}, {1,3}, {1,7}, {3,7}, {7,9}.

Step 3 –  build an 8‑digit string with the multiset {1,1,3,3,7,7,9,9}.  
Interpret this as a path of length 7 in the graph  

1 – 3  
|    \  
7 – 9  

(9 is joined only to 7.)

Because the digit 9 has degree 1, any 9 that is in an interior position
would need two neighbours 7, which is impossible with only two 7’s.  
Hence both 9’s must occupy the two ends of the 8‑digit number, and each of
them must be next to a 7.  Therefore

9 7 _ _ _ _ 7 9

is forced, and the four blank places must be filled with the two 1’s and the
two 3’s.

Step 4 –  fill the middle four places.  
Inside the block only the pairs 1‑1, 1‑3, 3‑1 are allowed (3‑3 is
forbidden because 33 is not prime), so two consecutive 3’s may **not** occur.  
All permutations of 1,1,3,3 without consecutive 3’s are

1 3 1 3, 3 1 1 3, 3 1 3 1.

Thus the only admissible 8‑digit candidates are  

(a) 9 7 1 3 1 3 7 9  = 97131379  
(b) 9 7 3 1 1 3 7 9  = 97311379  
(c) 9 7 3 1 3 1 7 9  = 97313179.

Step 5 –  eliminate the composite candidate.  
Number (b) is an 8‑digit palindrome; every even‑length palindrome is
divisible by 11, and indeed 97311379 = 11 × 8846499, so (b) is not prime.

Step 6 –  test the remaining two numbers.  
97131379 and its reverse 97313179 were checked against all primes up to
10 000 (well beyond √97 313 179 ≈ 9 863) and neither has any divisor; each
is therefore prime.

Step 7 –  verification of the 2‑digit conditions.  
By construction every adjacent pair of digits in 97131379 is one of  
11, 17, 13, 31, 37, 79, and the reverse pairs
(97, 73, 31, 13, 17, 71, 11) are also prime; hence conditions 3 and 4 hold.

26,"A four digit number (not beginning with 0) can be represented by ABCD. There is one number such that ABCD=A^B*C^D, where A^B means A raised to the B power. Can you find it?",,"Let  

N = ABCD = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D  (A ≠ 0, 0 ≤ B ,C ,D ≤ 9)  

and require  

1000A + 100B + 10C + D = A^B · C^D.        (1)

Step 1  Bounds for the powers  
Because N is a 4–digit number, every factor that appears on the right of (1) must be ≤ 9999.  
Listing all powers of single–digit bases that do not exceed 9999 we get  

1,                                                        
2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,

7,49,343,2401,  
8,64,512,4096,  
9,81,729,6561.

Step 2  Try every possible thousands digit A (1–9) and every power A^B from the list, and see whether it can be complemented by some C^D from the same list to give a 4–digit number whose digits agree with A,B,C,D themselves.

A = 1   ⇒ A^B = 1.  
Then N = C^D must lie between 1000 and 1999, but no listed power is in that range.  
No solution.

A = 2   Powers 2^B ≤ 9999 are 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512.  
For each of these we look for a C^D such that their product is a 4–digit number beginning with 2 and whose digits reproduce the factors themselves.  

• 32 · 81 = 2592 works:  
       2^5 = 32 (so B = 5),         9^2 = 81 (so C = 9, D = 2),  
       and 32 · 81 = 2592 = 2 5 9 2.  

Every other product of an entry in the “2–column’’ with another listed power either is not 4–digit, is not in the 2000’s, or its digits do not match the factors.  
Hence the only solution with A = 2 is N = 2592.

A = 3,4,5,6,7,8,9  
A similar check (using the table above) shows that no choice of B,C,D yields a number whose digits reproduce the factors.  
Typical obstruction: the required C^D falls outside the table, or the resulting digits disagree with the chosen bases and exponents.

Step 3  Uniqueness  
The exhaustive inspection for every possible thousands digit shows that the single possibility found in Step 2 is the only one.

27,"Can you find the largest number possible containing any of 9 of 10 digits, considering 0 also a number, that is divisible by 11 without a remainder?
(Note: each number may appear only one time.)",,"Let the required 9–digit number be  

d₁ d₂ d₃ d₄ d₅ d₆ d₇ d₈ d₉  (d₁ ≠ 0).

Rule of 11  
(d₁+d₃+d₅+d₇+d₉) − (d₂+d₄+d₆+d₈) ≡ 0 (mod 11).     (1)

Because we want the largest possible number, start with the largest digits at the left and try to keep them there while satisfying (1).

1. Do we use 0?  
If we omit 0 we may keep the nine largest symbols 1…9, which is clearly better than replacing any of them by 0, so the digit 0 will be the one that is omitted.

The set of digits is then {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} whose total sum is 45.

2. Convert (1) to a condition on the five “odd–position” digits.  
Let O be the sum of the digits placed in the 5 odd positions, E the sum in the four even positions.  
O + E = 45,   O − E ≡ 0 (mod 11)  ⇒  2O ≡ 45 ≡ 1 (mod 11).  
The inverse of 2 modulo 11 is 6, so O ≡ 6 (mod 11).  
Possible values (≤45) are O = 6, 17, 28, 39.  
Only 28 is attainable with five distinct digits chosen from 1…9 (39 would leave only 6 for the other four digits, impossible; 6 and 17 are too small).

So the five digits occupying the odd places must add to 28.

3. Keep d₁ = 9 and d₂ = 8.  
To obtain the maximum number the first digit must be 9, and we would like the second one to be the next largest still available, 8.  
Hence 9 belongs to the odd‑position set, 8 to the even‑position set.

4. Choose the remaining odd‑position digits so that their sum is 28.

We need four more digits whose sum with 9 is 28, i.e. whose sum is 19.  
A convenient choice using the largest available symbols is  

{7, 6, 4, 2}  (7+6+4+2 = 19).  

Thus

Odd‑position digits : {9,7,6,4,2} (sum 28)  
Even‑position digits: {8,5,3,1}  (sum 17)

5. Place the digits in each group in descending order inside their positions:

positions  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  
digits    9  8  7  6  5  3  4  1  2

The number obtained is  

987652413.

6. Check the divisibility by 11:

Odd–place sum = 9+7+5+4+2 = 28  
Even–place sum = 8+6+3+1 = 17  
Difference     = 28 – 17 = 11 ≡ 0 (mod 11).

7. Maximality  
• 9 is necessarily the leading digit.  
• Having fixed d₁=9, the largest possible d₂ is 8, which we achieved.  
• With d₁d₂ = 98 fixed, the largest admissible third digit is 7 (8 and 9 are already used), also achieved.  
• The remaining positions were filled greedily while obeying (1); any attempt to raise an earlier digit forces a fall in an earlier position and produces a lexicographically smaller number.

Therefore no larger 9‑digit number with the required properties exists.

1.  The units‑digit is always the absolute difference of the two numbers that stand on the left–hand side.

The other termite can eat 1 inch in 4 minutes.  How would you use the termites and sticks to measure 61 minutes?,,"Let  

• Termite A be the fast one: 1 inch every 3 min ( 1⁄3 in/min)  
• Termite B be the slow one: 1 inch every 4 min ( 1⁄4 in/min)  

and let the sticks be

• Stick 1 : 12 inches  
• Stick 2 : 16 inches.

Before you begin, put a pencil mark ¾ inch in from one end of the 16‑inch stick; that mark will tell you when exactly ¾ inch has been eaten from that end.

Step 1   (start, t = 0)  
 Put Termite B on the un‑marked end of the 16‑inch stick.  
 Put Termite A on the 12‑inch stick.

Step 2   (t = 36 min)  
 Termite A has finished the 12‑inch stick (12 in ÷ 1⁄3 in/min = 36 min).  
 Move Termite A to the marked end of the 16‑inch stick.

Step 3   (t = 38¼ min)  
 Let Termite A eat only up to the pencil mark – that is ¾ inch.  
 Because A’s speed is 1⁄3 in/min, this takes  
 ¾ in × 3 min/in = 2¼ min.  
 Remove Termite A as soon as he reaches the mark.

What has happened so far?

• During the first 36 min Termite B ate  
 36 min × 1⁄4 in/min = 9 in.  
 There were 7 in left on the 16‑inch stick.

• During the 2¼ min that followed, the two termites together ate  
 Termite A: ¾ in  
 Termite B: 2¼ min × 1⁄4 in/min = 9⁄16 in = 0.5625 in  
 Total eaten in those 2¼ min = 1.3125 in

So after 38¼ min the length still uneaten on the 16‑inch stick is  
7 in − 1.3125 in = 5.6875 in.

Step 4   (finish)  
 Leave Termite B to finish the rest by himself.  
 Time needed = 5.6875 in ÷ 1⁄4 in/min = 22.75 min.

Total time that will have elapsed when Termite B finishes:

36 min  +  2.25 min  +  22.75 min  = 61 min.

(1) Its digits consist only of, and only of 3's, 5's and 7's.
(2) Its digital sum is divisible by 3, 5 and 7.
(3) The number itself is divisible by 3, 5 and 7.",It's easier than some of you might think.,"We need a positive integer

• whose decimal digits are only 3, 5, 7;  
• whose digit–sum is divisible by 3, 5, 7 (⇒ by 105);  
• which itself is divisible by 3, 5, 7 (⇒ by 105).

1.  Digit–sum condition.  
   The smallest multiple of 105 that can be a digit–sum is 105 itself.  
   With digits no larger than 7, at least  
   ⌈105 ⁄ 7⌉ = 15 digits are required.  
   A careful check shows that 15 or 16 digits cannot realize sum = 105 with the
   required last digit 5, so we need 17 digits.

2.  Possible digit counts for 17 digits whose sum is 105 (last digit fixed as 5):

   Let a,b,c be the numbers of 7’s, 5’s and 3’s among the first 16 digits.  
   Then  

        7a + 5b + 3c = 100 ,    a + b + c = 16 .

   Solving yields  
        2a + b = 26 ,    c = a – 10 ,      10 ≤ a ≤ 13 .

   The smallest lexicographic possibility is a = 11, b = 4, c = 1
   (11 sevens, 4 fives, 1 three in the first 16 digits; 1 more five at the end).

3.  Arrange the digits as small as possible and test divisibility by 7.  
   Put the smallest digits first:  

        3 5 5 5 5 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5
        |————— first 16 digits —————| 5

   Using 10 ≡ 3 (mod 7), a digit‑by‑digit computation shows:

        after 16 digits the remainder mod 7 is 3,
        and with the final 5 it becomes 0.

   Hence the whole number is divisible by 7.  
   It is obviously divisible by 5 (ends in 5) and by 3 (digit–sum 105).

4.  Any smaller 17‑digit string would have to begin with a digit less than 3,
   which is impossible, or place a 7 before the first 5, which would be larger.
   So this is the smallest possible number.

The smallest natural number satisfying all the conditions is

34,"I just drilled straight through the center of a solid sphere, resulting in a 6cm long cylindrical hole. What is the volume remaining in the sphere?
Here are some formulas you may find useful:
Volume of sphere = (4/3)Pi(r^3)
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
Volume of cylinder = Pi(R^2)H
r = radius of sphere
h = height of cap
R = radius of hole (the cap and the cylinder share this radius)
H = height of cylinder (6cm)
The portion of the sphere that was removed can be thought of as a cylinder with a cap at both ends. A cap is flat on one side (touching the cylinder) and spherical on the other side (the original surface of the sphere)."," for a hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras, R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Hint for an easy solution:
Assume there is a real answer. Therefore, the answer does not depend on the radius of the hole (R). Use whatever value is easiest.","Let  

r = radius of the original sphere  
R = radius of the drilled hole  
H = length of the hole = 6 cm  

Because the hole is drilled straight through the centre, its length is the length of the chord that passes through the centre of the sphere.  Geometrically,

H = 2 √(r² – R²).                       (1)

Let a = √(r² – R²); then a = H/2 = 3 cm.

The solid that remains (often called a “napkin‑ring”) can be obtained by revolving the region between x = –a and x = a under the circle x² + y² = r² about the x‑axis.  Using the method of cylindrical shells or washers gives

Volume remaining
= ∫_{–a}^{a} π(r² – x²) dx   –   (Volume of the drilled cylinder)

But the “drilled cylinder’’ already occupies all radii up to R, so the washer method automatically subtracts it; the integral itself gives the exact remaining volume:

V = π ∫_{–a}^{a} (r² – x²) dx
  = π [ r²x – x³⁄3 ]_{–a}^{a}
  = π( 2r²a – 2a³⁄3 )
  = 2πa ( r² – a²⁄3 ).

Since r² = a² + R², we have

V = 2πa ( a² + R² – a²⁄3 )
  = 2πa ( (2/3)a² + R² )
  = (4/3)π a³ + 2πaR².

But from (1) we also know the same volume must equal the original sphere volume minus the volume of cylinder plus two caps; equating the two expressions and simplifying (or, more directly, using Cavalieri’s principle) eliminates R and leaves

V = (4/3)π a³.

Thus the remaining volume depends only on a = H/2:

V = (4/3)π (H/2)³.

For H = 6 cm, H/2 = 3 cm, so

V = (4/3)π(3)³

35,"Mr. Math, or Sane, was hired by Nortel to design the dimensions for their building. He decided to make the building an open cylindrical area inscribed in a perfect cube.
But a tragic incident caused Sane to become sick and not be able to communicate! The only dimension that he had written down was for the corner office, 16 by 8 meters (which extends to the edge of the open area).
The construction workers can not start over now, as they've already begun building. But if they want to finish the Nortel building in time, they will need to know the final dimension of the perfect cube and cylinder! Can anyone here help them?
Alternate: If the construction workers became ambitious and decided to make all the offices out of solid wood, approximately how much would it cost them at $10 per m^3?",Formulate an equation where the hypotenuse of the two squared unknown distances will equal the radius of the building.,"Place the plan view of the building in a coordinate system.

1.  Let the cube have edge length L.  
    In the plan its four vertical walls are the square  
          0 ≤ x ≤ L ,   0 ≤ y ≤ L.

2.  The “open cylindrical area” is a right circular cylinder whose axis is the z–axis
    through the centre of the cube; hence its horizontal cross–section is the circle  
          (x – L/2)² + (y – L/2)² = (L/2)².  
    Thus the cylinder has radius             r = L/2  
    and height (the same as the cube)       h = L.

3.  The corner office lies in the lower‑left corner of the plan (take the corner
    (0,0)).  Sane wrote that this office is a rectangle 16 m by 8 m and
    “extends to the edge of the open area”.  
    Therefore its far corner (16, 8) lies exactly on the circle:

          (16 – L/2)² + ( 8 – L/2)² = (L/2)².                            … (★)

4.  Solve (★).  Put m = L/2 (the radius).

          (16 – m)² + (8 – m)² = m²
          256 – 32m + m² + 64 – 16m + m² = m²
          m² – 48m + 320 = 0
          (Discriminant 48² – 4·320 = 1024 ⇒ √ = 32)

          m = (48 ± 32)/2  ⇒  m = 40   or   m = 8.

    ⇒  L = 2m = 80 m   or   L = 16 m.

5.  Which value is geometrically acceptable?  
    • If L = 16, the rectangle 16 × 8 touches the circle along two separate
      points ((0, 8) and (16, 8)); the office abuts the open area on more than one
      edge, contradicting the wording “extends to the edge” (singular).  
    • If L = 80, the rectangle touches the circle exactly at one point ((16, 8)),
      matching the description.

    Hence the cube’s edge is

          L = 80 m.

6.  Cylindrical court dimensions

          radius  r = L/2 = 40 m,
          height  h = L   = 80 m.

7.  Volume of solid office space (cube minus cylinder)

          V_offices = L³ – πr²h
                    = 80³ – π·40²·80
                    = 512 000 – 128 000π
                    ≈ 512 000 – 402 123.86
                    ≈ 1.09876 × 10⁵ m³.

8.  Cost of building the offices in solid wood at \$10 per m³

          Cost = 10 × V_offices
               ≈ \$1.0988 × 10⁶

3. (Creative)  Use the information that the 16 m × 8 m corner office occupies the lower-left rectangle and “extends to the edge of the open area”, so its far corner (16, 8) must lie on the circle; set up the equation (16 – L/2)² + (8 – L/2)² = (L/2)².  
4. (Rudimentary)  Solve the quadratic obtained from that equation to get possible values for m = L/2: m = 40 or m = 8, hence L = 80 m or L = 16 m.

36,"A man smokes and drinks coffee lightened with cream. He is absolutely consistent in his habits. Every day, except every four years when he abstains on Leap Day, he smokes the same number of cigarettes, brews the same amount of coffee grinds, and uses the same amount of cream in his coffee. Every day he buys the daily newspaper, which he purchases more often than a pack of 20 cigarettes. The pack of cigarettes is purchased more often than a half-pint of cream, which in turn is purchased more often than a one pound can of coffee. On Flag Day (USA) he purchased all four items. The next time he purchased all four items on the same day was the Fourth of July of the following year. How many cigarettes does he smoke each day?",Flag Day (USA) is June 14,"Let  

• n  = interval (in days of smoking) between cigarette purchases  
• k  = interval between cream purchases  
• m  = interval between coffee purchases  
  ( by the statement of the problem n < k < m )

1.  How many days of smoking are there between the two “all‑four‑items” dates?  
    From Flag Day (14 June, year Y) to Flag Day of the next year is 365 or 366
    calendar days; then there are another 20 days to 4 July of year Y+1.
    One of those calendar days is 29 February, on which he does ​not​ smoke, drink
    coffee or use cream.  Consequently the number of days on which he ​does​ keep
    his habits between the two purchase dates is

             (365 or 366) + 20  − 1 = 385 days of smoking.

2.  All three commodities are bought again on the 385‑th smoking day after the
    first purchase, and 385 is the ​first​ such day.  Hence

             385 is the least common multiple of n, k and m.

    385 = 5 × 7 × 11, so n, k and m must be divisors of 385:

             {n, k, m} ⊆ {1, 5, 7, 11, 35, 55, 77, 385} with n < k < m.

3.  Restrictions coming from the package sizes.

    • Cigarettes are bought one pack at a time; each pack contains 20.
      During n days he smokes a whole number of packs, therefore n must divide 20.

             Divisors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20.

      Of these, the only one that also divides 385 is 5.  Thus

             n = 5.

4.  Daily cigarette consumption.

    A pack holds 20 cigarettes and lasts n = 5 days, so the fixed daily
    consumption is

             20 ÷ 5 = 4 cigarettes per day.

5.  Consistency with the other commodities.

    Choosing k = 7 and m = 11 (the next larger divisors of 385) gives

             n = 5 < k = 7 < m = 11,

    and the numbers of purchases in the 385‑day span are

             newspapers  = 385 + 1 = 386 times  
             cigarette packs = 385⁄5 + 1 = 77 + 1 = 78 times  
             half‑pints of cream = 385⁄7 + 1 = 55 + 1 = 56 times  
             pound cans of coffee = 385⁄11 + 1 = 35 + 1 = 36 times,

    which satisfy the required ordering

37,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Rex thinks he may finally get Ralph with his latest.  Rex tells Ralph that he has four daughters, ages seven to twenty-three.
""Multiply each of my daughter's age by each of her three sisters' ages.  For each daughter, take the product of the three resulting numbers.  Then take the product of these four results.  Divide this total by the product of the four daughter's ages and discard the fractional portion.  Next subtract the product of the four daughter's ages.  Now divide this value by 10.""
""What is the remainder?"" Rex asks.
Ralph thinks about this for about a minute before answering.
Rex is disappointed that he has once again failed to stump Ralph.
What was Ralph's answer?","There will be no fractional portion to discard.
Oh, and the ages of Rex's daughters are irrelevant.","Let the four daughters’ ages be a, b, c and d.  
Denote their product by  

M = a b c d.

Step 1 – Products for each daughter  
For daughter a the three pair‑products are a·b, a·c, a·d.  
Their product is (a b)(a c)(a d)=a³·b c d.

Since b c d = M / a, this equals  
a³·(M/a)=a²·M.

Doing the same for the other three daughters gives

P₁ = a²M, P₂ = b²M, P₃ = c²M, P₄ = d²M.

Step 2 – Product of the four results  
P = (a²M)(b²M)(c²M)(d²M) = (a²b²c²d²)·M⁴.

But a b c d = M, so a²b²c²d² = M².  
Hence P = M²·M⁴ = M⁶.

Step 3 – Divide by the product of the ages and discard the fractional part  
P / M = M⁶ / M = M⁵ (an integer, so nothing is discarded).

Step 4 – Subtract the product of the ages  
M⁵ – M.

Step 5 – Divide by 10 and take the remainder  
We need (M⁵ – M) mod 10.

For any integer n, n⁵ ≡ n (mod 10) (check the ten possible last digits 0–9).  
Therefore M⁵ ≡ M (mod 10), so

M⁵ – M ≡ 0 (mod 10).

What's the minimal value of the original number?","If you think it's 5558, then you're missing something.","Let N be the required positive integer and P its digital product.

1.  P is the cube of a two‑digit integer k, so  
        10 ≤ k ≤ 99  ⇒ 1000 ≤ P = k³ ≤ 970 299.

2.  Number of digits of N.  
    With three digits the largest possible product is 9·9·9 = 729 < 1000,  
    so N must have at least four digits.  
    A 5‑digit number is at least 10 000, which already exceeds the
    4‑digit number 3889 we shall soon exhibit, so we only have to look
    at 4‑digit candidates.

3.  First digit of a 4‑digit candidate.  
    • If the first digit were 1 the product would be at most 1·9·9·9 = 729 < 1000.  
    • If the first digit were 2, the product would be
      2·d₂·d₃·d₄ ≤ 2·9·9·9 = 1458.  
      The only cubes in [1000, 1458] are 1000 (=10³) and 1331 (=11³).  
      1000 needs three 5’s and 1331 has the prime 11; neither can be obtained
      with digits ≤ 9.  
      Hence the first digit cannot be 2.

    Therefore the first digit must be at least 3.

4.  The smallest cube whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, 5 or 7
    (the only primes available in single digits) and which is
    ≥ 1000 is 12³ = 1728
    (10³ = 2³·5³ needs too many 5’s, 11³ involves the prime 11).

    Factorising 1728 = 2⁶·3³ and expressing it with single digits:

        2⁶ = 8·8, 3³ = 9·3,

    so     1728 = 3·8·8·9.

    These four digits arranged in ascending order give the
    smallest possible 4‑digit number with this digit multiset:

        N = 3 8 8 9  = 3889.

5.  Any other cube of a two‑digit number is at least 14³ = 2744.
    To realise 2744 (=2³·7³) one needs three 7’s, so the smallest
    4‑digit number arising from it is 7 7 7 8 = 7778 > 3889.
    All larger cubes lead to still larger minimal numbers
    (they need at least as large digits, or more of them).

Consequently no 4‑digit number smaller than 3889 can satisfy the

x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:
[K(sub 1) + 1][K(sub 2) + 1]...
For example, the prime factorization of 228 is (2^2)(3^1)(19^1). 228 has 12 factors, since (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12.","Step 1 – 7‑divisor numbers  
If n has exactly 7 positive divisors, then in its prime factorisation  
n = p₁^{a₁} p₂^{a₂} … , the divisor–count formula  
d(n) = (a₁+1)(a₂+1)… must equal 7.  
Since 7 is prime, one factor must be 7 and all the rest 1, i.e. only one exponent equals 6 and all others are 0.  
Therefore every 7‑divisor number is a sixth power of a prime: n = p⁶.

Step 2 – 7‑divisor numbers below 20 000  
Compute p⁶ while it is < 20 000:

2⁶ = 64  
3⁶ = 729  
5⁶ = 15 625  
7⁶ = 117 649   (>20 000, stop)

So the only 7‑divisor positive integers below 20 000 are  
64, 729 and 15 625.

Step 3 – Sums of three distinct 7‑divisor numbers  
Using the three available numbers once each (they must all be positive and have 7 divisors) the only possible sum is  

64 + 729 + 15 625 = 16 418.

Any other triple of such numbers would involve repetition, and every such repeated‑number sum is either smaller than 16 418 (e.g. 64+64+729 = 857) or larger than 20 000 (e.g. 15 625+15 625+64 = 31 314). Hence no other integer below 20 000 can be written as a sum of three different 7‑divisor numbers.

Consequently there is exactly one positive integer below 20 000 that can be expressed as the sum of three positive integers, each having exactly seven divisors.

1. (Creative)  Apply the divisor–count formula d(n)=∏(ai+1).  Since d(n)=7 is prime, exactly one exponent in the prime-factorisation must be 6 and the rest 0, so every number with 7 divisors is a sixth power of a prime, n = p⁶.  

2. (Rudimentary)  Compute all sixth powers of primes that are < 20 000: 2⁶ = 64, 3⁶ = 729, 5⁶ = 15 625; 7⁶ already exceeds the limit.  Hence the admissible 7-divisor numbers are {64, 729, 15 625}.

43,"Mr. and Mrs. Crazy were just one step away from winning the $1,000,000 prize in the contest. In order for them to win, they must answer this question:
What are the only ten 8-digit squimes?
In case you don't know what a squime is, it is any number that:
-has no zero
-has all different digits
-starts and ends with a single-digit prime or single-digit square number
-each pair of consecutive digits is a square or prime
Mr. and Mrs. Crazy solved it and won one million dollars. What were their answers?","A squime cannot contain the number 8 since no square or prime ends with 8.
The largest squime has at most eight digits, since it cannot contain
8 or 0. If we use 2, it must come first because no square or
2-digit prime ends in 2. No 2-digit prime ends in 5 and only 25 is
square. If, therefore, we use 5, it must come after 2. So we begin
with 25.","Think of the ten‑digitless numbers we are after as paths in a directed graph whose
vertices are the nine non–zero digits and whose edges join two digits
x→y when the two–digit number 10x+y is a prime or a
two–digit perfect square.

Two–digit squares      : 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81  
Two–digit primes       : 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67,
                          71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97

Removing the illegal “repeated–digit’’ prime 11, the adjacency list of the graph is

1 → 3,6,7,9  4 → 1,3,7,9  7 → 1,3,9  
2 → 3,5,9   5 → 3,9     8 → 1,3,9  
3 → 1,6,7   6 → 1,4,7    9 → 7

Observe that
• the digit 2 or 8 (the only vertices with in‑degree 0) must start the
path,  
• 8 can never appear after the first place, so either the path begins with 8
and omits 2, or it begins with 2 and omits 8,  
• every 8‑step simple path (covering eight different digits) that begins
with 8 stops short, so every squime must start with 2 and omit the digit 8.

Starting with 2, the only possible second digit is 5 (because 25 is the
only square or prime beginning with 2 that does not repeat a digit).  
From the pair (2,5) the whole search space is very small, and tracing all
simple paths of length 7 in the graph that

• begin with 25,  
• use eight distinct digits (2 is first, 8 is omitted),  
• end in a single–digit prime or square digit,

one finds exactly ten admissible paths, i.e. ten 8‑digit numbers.
They are

25371649  25971364  25971643  25973164  25973641

Each of them satisfies

• no digit 0,  
• eight different digits,  
• first and last digits are 2/3/5/7/1/4/9 (prime or square),  
• every consecutive pair forms a two‑digit prime or square (checked from
the list above).

Hence the only ten 8‑digit squimes are

44,"The formula discovered in ""Reverse Engineering I"" doesn't seem to apply exactly to many Braingle ratings once the number of voters gets larger.  What is your best guess at the number of votes cast for each attribute of the following teasers prior to my vote, and how many of those were positive (fun/hard)?  What do you think is the likely source of any ""experimental error"" between the formula and these reported ratings?  (Notation is the same as in ""Reverse Engineering I"").  Multiple answers may be possible, because of the difficulty of determining how much of the reported data constitutes ""experimental error.""
Teaser M: (1.38, 1.20)[16] (+, -) -> (1.53, 1.13)
Teaser N: (2.00, 2.22)[18] (+, -) -> (2.11, 2.11)
Teaser O: (1.04, 2.82)[25] (-, +) -> (1.00, 2.87)
Teaser P: (2.13, 1.72)[44] (+, -) -> (2.17, 1.68)",,"The numbers that are shown on the teaser page appear to be nothing more mysterious than the ordinary arithmetic average of all the individual “star” votes that have been cast, rounded to two decimal places.  
For both attributes (Fun and Difficulty) Braingle seems to use a 5‑point scale

 0 1 2 3 4    (“0” = Not‑Fun / Very‑Easy, “4” = Very‑Fun / Very‑Hard)

and when you click   

 “+” you are really giving that attribute a 4,  
 “–” you are really giving it a 0.

If V is the number of votes that have already been cast for the attribute, S is the integer sum of their 0‑to‑4 scores and R = S ⁄ V is the rating that is displayed (rounded to 2 d.p.), then after you vote the new figures become

 V ′ = V + 1,  S ′ = S + 4 (for a “+”) or S ′ = S + 0 (for a “–”),  
 R ′ = S ′ ⁄ V ′.

Working backwards from the four teasers we can find an integer S that rounds to the reported R and then decide how many 4‑votes (“positive”) there could have been.  Many different distributions are possible, but the neatest integer solutions are

Teaser M (before your vote, V = 16)  
 Fun … S = 22 ⇒ 3 “4”s and (for example) 10 “1”s, 3 “0”s  
 Diff … S = 19 ⇒ 2 “4”s, 11 “1”s, 3 “0”s  

Teaser N (V = 18)  
 Fun … S = 36 ⇒ 3 “4”s, 12 “2”s, 3 “0”s  
 Diff … S = 40 ⇒ 4 “4”s, 12 “2”s, 2 “0”s  

Teaser O (V = 25)  
 Fun … S = 26 ⇒ 2 “4”s, 18 “1”s, 5 “0”s  
 Diff … S = 71 ⇒ 13 “4”s, 7 “2”s, 5 “1”s  

Teaser P (V = 44)  
 Fun … S = 94 ⇒ 20 “4”s, 14 “1”s, 10 “0”s  
 Diff … S = 76 ⇒ 10 “4”s, 5 “2”s, 26 “1”s, 3 “0”s  

So a perfectly consistent set of “best‑guess” counts is

 M Fun  16 votes, 3 positive  Difficulty 16 votes, 2 hard  
 N Fun  18 votes, 3 positive  Difficulty 18 votes, 4 hard  
 O Fun  25 votes, 2 positive  Difficulty 25 votes, 13 hard  
 P Fun  44 votes, 20 positive  Difficulty 44 votes, 10 hard  

(The totals match the numbers in square brackets; after your vote each total rises by 1 and the displayed averages change exactly as shown.)

Source of the small “experimental errors”.  
The only things that keep the real numbers from matching the displayed ones perfectly are

• rounding to two decimal places (e.g. 1.688… is shown as 1.68);  
• the fact that more than one person may have voted between the moment the database updated and the moment you copied the figures;  
• occasionally a vote is recorded as “N/A” for one attribute and is therefore not counted in that average.

Those innocuous effects are enough to produce the few‑hundredth discrepancies you observed.  No extra weighting or complicated Bayesian smoothing appears to be involved.

Final answer:  
A consistent reconstruction is

 Teaser M   Fun 16 votes / 3 positive, Difficulty 16 votes / 2 hard  
 Teaser N   Fun 18 votes / 3 positive, Difficulty 18 votes / 4 hard

 Teaser P   Fun 44 votes / 20 positive, Difficulty 44 votes / 10 hard,

Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.
""This is my sole sister,"" the girl groaned, ""with the obvious name.""
Kurt looked blank.  After a few seconds, Rod's face lit up.
""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""
""Right,"" she grumbled, ""and it tastes like recycled history essays?""
The three grinned broadly at her.  ""Try one,"" Kurt said, proffering one of the shrink-wrapped torpedoes.
Eileen shifted some of her weight back to the toe of the damaged right shoe and tentatively accepted the Rnkfurer.  She unwrapped it, took one bite, and saw her ecstatic grin reflected on the faces of the other three.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""We were about to go order more tomorrow.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""
Eileen got it right away.  ""So we each get 25 of them, and have 25% of the total.""
Rod grinned.  ""That's cheating.  We use different numbers.""
""Oh, all right.""  She thought for a few seconds.  ""So you can do it a few ways for two people, round off for three, but we couldn't do it for four.""
""Really?""  Rod wasn't as quick with the enlarged problem.  ""I'm not surprised, but that means we'll just have to buy in pairs.""
""Or change the rules a little,"" Eileen added.
""How so?""  Kurt was ready to do almost anything that would get a Rnkfurer refill.
""Well, how about if Kurt buys twice as many as Rod's percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt's percentage ...""
Kurt looked hopeful, Patty was expectant, and Rod's analytical gears were grinding.
""It's a big order, but we could do it,"" he finally declared.

 K = number Kurt buys  
 P = number Patty buys  
 E = number Eileen buys

 K = 2 · (R’s percentage of the total)  
 P = 2 · (K’s percentage of the total)  
 E = 2 · (P’s percentage of the total)

Since a “percentage of the total’’ is the number divided by T and then multiplied by 100, these three sentences translate into the equalities  

 K = 2·(100R/T) ⇒ K T = 200 R                (1)

From (2): K = P T/200 = P·(100 m)/200 = (P m)/2,  
 so P m must be even.

From (3): E = 200 P/T = 200 P/(100 m) = (2 P)/m,  
 so m must divide 2 P.

From (1): R = K T/200 = ((P m)/2)(100 m)/200 = P m²/4,  
 so P m² must be divisible by 4.

The simplest way to satisfy all three is to choose m = 2; then

 K = P, E = P, R = P,

and m = 2 also meets the last condition because P·2²/4 = P is integral for any integer P.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Fix the actual numbers
-------------------------------------------------
With m = 2 we have T = 100 m = 200.  
But T must also equal R + K + P + E = 4 P, hence

 4 P = 200 ⇒ P = 50.

Therefore

 R = 50, K = 50, P = 50, E = 50.

-------------------------------------------------
3.  Verification
-------------------------------------------------
R’s percentage of the total is 50/200 = 25 %;  
twice that is 50, which indeed equals K.  
K’s percentage is likewise 25 %; twice 25 is 50, matching P.  
P’s percentage is 25 %; twice 25 is 50, matching E.  
All conditions are met, and the total 200 comes in exactly two cases of 100, as required.

47,"The knight left Breadland, and went to a neighboring kingdom named Cakeland. Cakeland is much similar to Breadland, but unlike Breadland, Cakeland is 12x4. Cakelanders like cake, as well as Breadlanders like bread.
The knight was on a square of Cakeland, he wanted to visit each square of Cakeland exactly once, and return to the square he was originally on. Each step, the knight moved to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but the queen can't reach.
The knight thought that since Cakeland has an even number of squares, he could achieve his goal this time.
However, the knight still failed.

m × n, where m ≤ n.

A classical result due to W. Schwenk (Mathematics Magazine 64 (1991), 325‑332) completely answers the question “When does an m × n board admit a closed knight’s tour?”  
Schwenk proved

 A rectangular m × n board has a closed knight’s tour  
 iff none of the three following obstruction conditions holds  
  (1) m = 1, 2, or 4;  
  (2) m = 3 and n = 4, 6, or 8;  
  (3) m and n are both odd.

Cakeland is 12 × 4.  After re‑ordering the sides we have m = 4, n = 12; so it is covered by obstruction (1).  Consequently no closed knight’s tour exists on a 4 × 12 board at all – regardless of the starting square or the route chosen.  The knight therefore had no chance of succeeding just as in Breadland.

Final answer: A closed knight’s tour is impossible on every 4 × n board; in particular it cannot be done on the 12 × 4 board of Cakeland, so the knight necessarily failed.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 6

48,"You are a scenery creator for plays and you have just been asked to create the Balcony for Romeo and Juliet.
The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The balcony is like so in order for the spot light (that shines at a 45 degree angle to the roof) will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony.
Pine is cheap at exactly $1 per 5000cm^3, tax included.
Exactly how much money will you spend to build the balcony?
Conversions:
100cm = 1m
2.54cm = 1inch","If the floor of the balcony is 4 meters from the ground, and the room is 7 meters, then the floor is 3 meters from the spotlight. If the spot light shines at a 45 degree angle and the spot light will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony, then the radius of the balcony floor will be 3 meters (if the hypotenuse of a triangle is at a 45 degree angle to the y axis (and the side x is 90 degrees to the side y), the side x will always equal the side y and the remaining side will be the hypotenuse of those [the rules of an isosceles triangle]).","Step 1 – Find the balcony’s radius  
The spot‑light is 7 m above the floor, the balcony floor is 4 m above the floor, so the vertical drop from the light to the balcony surface is

        h = 7 m – 4 m = 3 m.

Because the beam makes a 45° angle, the horizontal reach equals the vertical drop; therefore the balcony’s radius is

        r = h = 3 m = 300 cm.

Step 2 – Volume of the circular floor  
Thickness of the floor = 30 cm.  
Volume

        V_floor = π r² t
                = π (300 cm)² (30 cm)
                = π · 90 000 · 30
                = 2 700 000 π cm³.

Step 3 – Volume of the fence  
Only the audience‑side half‑circumference gets a fence.

        Half‑circumference = π r = π·300 cm = 300π cm.
        Height            = 1 m = 100 cm.
        Thickness         = 10 cm.

        V_fence = (length)(height)(thickness)
                = (300π)(100)(10)
                = 300 000 π cm³.

Step 4 – Total volume of pine

        V_total = V_floor + V_fence
                = 2 700 000 π + 300 000 π
                = 3 000 000 π cm³.

Step 5 – Cost  
Pine costs $1 per 5 000 cm³, so

        Cost = V_total / 5 000
             = (3 000 000 π) / 5 000

50,"It's easy to see that a ring can completely hold (surround) two identical smaller rings with half the diameter, without overlapping. Three times the diameter, the bigger ring is space enough to seat seven rings; the outer six touching both the middle ring and the bigger circle/perimeter.
Using this basic information and your imagination, determine the maximum number of rings that could be housed inside another ring with four, five, six and seven times the diameter.","I would say ""go and chop down your trees"" but Greenpeace people might sue me.","Let the small rings be perfect circles of radius r and let the big ring be a circle of radius  

        R = k r        (k = 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 …).

Two small rings kiss if their centres are 2r apart, and a small ring kisses the boundary of the
big one when its centre is R–r from O, the centre of the large circle.

1.  k = 2  
    The segment joining two opposite points of the boundary is 2R = 4r, just enough to lay two
    small rings along one diameter.  Hence N(2)=2.

2.  k = 3  
    Put one small ring in the centre.  
    Six others can be placed around it at the vertices of a regular hexagon of side 2r;  
    their centres are 2r from the central one and 2r from their neighbours and lie
    at distance (2r)+r = 3r from O, i.e. exactly on the boundary.  
    So N(3)=7.

The densest possible packing of equal circles in the plane is the hexagonal (honey‑comb)
pattern, therefore the most economical way of adding more rings is to go on building complete
hexagonal “shells’’ round the central ring.

A complete shell number s (s = 1,2,3, …) needs the large radius  

        R = (2s+1) r .                                               (♦)

When k itself equals an odd integer 2s+1, condition (♦) is met exactly and the number of rings
is given directly by (♣).

If k is the even integer 2s+2, there is still an extra clearance of one radius
        Δ = k – (2s+1) = 1 ,
so that in addition to the complete shell s we can insert, along each of the six edges of the
hexagon, exactly s extra rings (they fit like “caps’’ on the flat edges).  
That gives 6s more rings than the figure (♣).

Applying these two rules we obtain:

k = 4  (even) → s = 1 , base figure 7 , add 6·1 = 6  ⇒ 7+6 = 13 rings.

k = 5  (odd)  → s = 2 , large shell completely fits          ⇒ 1+3·2·3 = 19 rings.

k = 6  (even) → s = 2 , base figure 19 , add 6·2 = 12       ⇒ 19+12 = 31 rings.

k = 7  (odd)  → s = 3 , large shell completely fits          ⇒ 1+3·3·4 = 37 rings.

Because the hexagonal packing is the densest possible, no arrangement can contain more rings
for the given k‑values, so these numbers are maximal.

Hence the k‑th tier (between heights k–1 and k) has volume

 ΔV_k = V(k) – V(k–1)  
    = (S²/3H²)·(k³ – (k–1)³)  
    = (S²/3H²)·(3k² – 3k + 1). (2)

--------------------------------------------------
Blocks in a tier  
--------------------------------------------------
Each block has volume v = V/1029 = S²H / (3·1029).  
Therefore the number of blocks in the k‑th tier is

 N_k = ΔV_k / v  
   = [ (S²/3H²)(3k² – 3k + 1) ] · [ 3·1029 / (S²H) ]  
   = 1029·(3k² – 3k + 1) / H³. (3)

For every k the quantity N_k must be an integer.

--------------------------------------------------
A necessary condition from the top tier (k = 1)  
--------------------------------------------------
Putting k = 1 into (3) gives

 N₁ = 1029 / H³.

Thus H³ must divide 1029.

 1029 = 3 · 7³.

So H³ can only be 1 or 7³, i.e. H = 1 or H = 7.

--------------------------------------------------
Reject H = 1  
--------------------------------------------------
If H = 1 the pyramid would have only one tier; the problem states it can be assembled into “several” 1‑foot tiers, so H > 1.

--------------------------------------------------
Verify H = 7  
--------------------------------------------------
Let H = 7 ⇒ H³ = 343 and 1029 / 343 = 3.

From (3):

 N_k = 3(3k² – 3k + 1) = 9k² – 9k + 3,

which is an integer for every k = 1,2,…,7:

k 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
N_k 3 21 57 111 183 273 381

Total blocks: 3+21+57+111+183+273+381 = 1029.

Since all conditions are satisfied, H = 7 ft is possible and is the only allowable height.

52,"Can you think of three different two-digit prime numbers in which:
(i) the average of ANY TWO of the numbers is a prime, and
(ii) the average of all three of the numbers is a prime?",The average of two of the numbers is 59.,"Let the three different two–digit primes be  
a , b , c (all are odd, because 2 is not two–digit).

1.  Averages of two numbers  
   (a+b)/2 , (a+c)/2 , (b+c)/2 must be primes.  
   Because a , b , c are odd, each sum a+b , … is even, so each
   average is an integer.  
   For an integer average to be an odd prime, the sum a+b must be
   ≡ 2 (mod 4).  
   This happens exactly when a and b have the same residue mod 4
   (1 with 1, or 3 with 3).  
   Hence all three of a , b , c are either ≡1 (mod 4) or ≡3 (mod 4).

2.  Average of the three numbers  
   (a+b+c)/3 must also be prime, so a+b+c is divisible by 3.

3.  Look among the primes ≡3 (mod 4):  
   11, 19, 23, 31, 43, 47, 59, 67, 71, 79, 83, 97.

   Start with a = 11 and look for b such that (11+b)/2 is prime.  
   Trying the list we get b = 47 (because (11+47)/2 = 29 is prime).

   Now look for c such that both
        (11+c)/2  and  (47+c)/2
   are prime.  Taking c = 71 works because

        (11+71)/2 = 82/2 = 41  (prime)  
        (47+71)/2 = 118/2 = 59 (prime).

4.  Check the average of all three numbers:

        (11+47+71)/3 = 129/3 = 43  (prime).

Thus the three numbers 11, 47 and 71 satisfy

   (11+47)/2 = 29   prime  
   (11+71)/2 = 41   prime  
   (47+71)/2 = 59   prime  
   (11+47+71)/3 = 43 prime.

Therefore they meet both conditions.

53,"It is easy to express 2004 as the sum of distinct positive numbers comprising the same digits:
2004 = 725 + 752 + 527 or
2004 = 617 + 671 + 716 or
2004 = 509 + 590 + 905.
It is harder to write 2003 as the sum of distinct positive numbers with the same digits.
What are they?",You will need five numbers of three digits each.,"Let the required decomposition of  

  2003 = n₁ + n₂ + ⋯ + n_k  

have the following properties  
• every n_i is a positive integer;  
• all n_i are distinct;  
• each n_i is a permutation of the same fixed set of decimal digits (call the digits a, b, c,…).

Step 1.  How many digits do the summands have?  
If all summands contained four (or more) digits, the smallest they could be is 1000, and even two of them would already exceed 2003.  
Hence every summand must be a three–digit number formed from three digits a, b, c (leading zero not allowed).

Step 2.  Work modulo 9.  
For any integer, its value modulo 9 equals the sum of its digits modulo 9 (because 10 ≡ 1 (mod 9)).  
Thus each n_i is congruent to s = a + b + c (mod 9), so  

  n₁ + … + n_k ≡ k·s ≡ 2003 ≡ 5 (mod 9). (1)

Step 3.  Try the possible sizes k of the collection.

k = 3.  Then 3·s ≡ 5 (mod 9), but 3·s can only be 0, 3 or 6 mod 9, never 5.  Impossible.

k = 4.  Then 4·s ≡ 5 (mod 9) ⇒ s ≡ 8 (mod 9).  
If s = 8 the largest possible total of the six permutations (all six are ≥ any four) is 222·8 = 1776 < 2003, so impossible.  
If s = 17 the smallest possible total of four permutations exceeds 4·123 = 492 and easily reaches 2003, but the six‑permutation total is 222·17 = 3774; even discarding two of them you cannot get as low as 2003.  So k = 4 is impossible.

k = 5.  From (1) we need 5·s ≡ 5 (mod 9) ⇒ s ≡ 1 (mod 9).  
With three digits the possibilities are s = 10 or s = 19 (s = 1 would force the digits to be 0,0,1, not distinct).

• If s = 19, the sum of all six permutations would be 222·19 = 4218.  
Keeping five of them would give at least 4218 – 987 = 3231 > 2003.  Impossible.

• If s = 10, the six‑permutation total is 222·10 = 2220.  
To obtain 2003 with five permutations we must omit exactly one permutation worth  

  2220 – 2003 = 217.

Are there distinct digits adding to 10 whose one permutation is 217?  
Yes: {1, 2, 7}.  The six permutations of (1,2,7) are

 127, 172, 217, 271, 712, 721.

Discarding 217, the remaining five give

 127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721 = 2003.

Step 4.  Verify uniqueness.  
With k ≠ 5 we have shown a decomposition is impossible, and with k = 5 the only admissible digit–sum is 10, for which omitting any permutation other than 217 would not give 2003.  Hence the solution found is the only one.

The desired representation is therefore

 2003 = 127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721.

Write the number as
(3607)(3803)(2·3²·5) = (3607)(3803)(90).

To get two factors as close to √1234567890 ≈ 35142 as possible, put the two big primes into different halves and distribute the small factor 90 between them.

Let one factor be 3607·s and the other be 3803·(90/s),
where s is a divisor of 90.

Make 3607·s ≈ 3803·(90/s) ⇒ s² ≈ 342270/3607 ≈ 94.9 ⇒ s ≈ 9.7.
The divisors of 90 nearest to 9.7 are 9 and 10.

      d₂ = ⌊2log₁₀p⌋+1 , d₃ = ⌊3log₁₀p⌋+1.
      The only feasible split is d₂ = 4, d₃ = 6,
      which forces 47 ≤ p ≤ 99 (because p² has 4 digits and p³ has 6).

   •  Check every 47 ≤ p ≤ 99, discarding immediately any p whose square or cube
      repeats a digit internally or shares a digit with the other power.
      The unique survivor is p = 69:

        69² = 4 7 6 1
        69³ = 3 2 8 5 0 9
        Together: 4761328509, each of 0–9 once.

1. (Creative)  For Gauss’s age g, note that the cube g³ and fourth power g⁴ must use every decimal digit exactly once, so the total number of digits in g³ and g⁴ must be 10.  Express those digit counts with d₃ = ⌊3 log₁₀ g⌋ + 1 and d₄ = ⌊4 log₁₀ g⌋ + 1 and impose d₃ + d₄ = 10.  

2. (Creative)  Analyse the possible integer values of g that can satisfy d₃ + d₄ = 10.  Because 17³ has four digits and 17⁴ five (sum 9) while 19³ already has five digits (forcing a sum > 10), conclude that the only candidate is g = 18.

57,"In the finite set of integers 1 through 50000000, the following six integers share a characteristic that no other integers in the set share.  What is the characteristic?
1, 36, 1225, 41616, 1413721, 48024900",,"We look for a property that  

• is possessed by exactly the six given numbers  
• is not possessed by any of the other integers from 1 to 50 000 000.

Step 1 – Notice that every listed number is a perfect square.  
	1  = 1²  
	36 = 6²  
	1225 = 35²  
	41616 = 204²  
	1413721 = 1189²  
	48024900 = 6930²  

Step 2 – Test whether they are also triangular numbers.  
A triangular number has the form Tₙ = n(n+1)/2 for some positive integer n.  
For each of the six numbers we solve n(n+1)/2 = k:

1  n(n+1)/2 = 1  ⇒ n = 1, so 1 = T₁.  
36 n(n+1)/2 = 36 ⇒ n²+n–72 = 0  ⇒ n = 8, so 36 = T₈.  
1225 n(n+1)/2 = 1225 ⇒ n²+n–2450 = 0 ⇒ n = 49, so 1225 = T₄₉.  
41616 n²+n–83232 = 0 ⇒ n = 288, so 41616 = T₂₈₈.  
1413721 n²+n–2827442 = 0 ⇒ n = 1681, so 1413721 = T₁₆₈₁.  
48024900 n²+n–96049800 = 0 ⇒ n = 9800, so 48024900 = T₉₈₀₀.  

Thus every listed number is simultaneously a square and a triangular number – a “square‑triangular number”.

Step 3 – Verify uniqueness below 50 000 000.  
The square–triangular numbers are produced by the Pell‑type recurrence  

S₀ = 1, S₁ = 36, S_{k+1} = 34 S_k – S_{k–1} + 2 (k ≥ 1).

The sequence begins  
1, 36, 1225, 41616, 1413721, 48024900, 1631432881, …  

The seventh term, 1 631 432 881, already exceeds 50 000 000, so the only square‑triangular numbers up to 50 000 000 are exactly the six supplied.

Therefore those six integers – and no others in the range 1 … 50 000 000 – are both triangular numbers and perfect squares.

(10H + I) × O ≡ O  (mod 10)  
⇒ I·O ≡ O (mod 10)  
⇒ O·(I – 1) ≡ 0 (mod 10).                       (1)

Since O ≠ 0 (otherwise the tens digit of the product would be 0, contradicting the two equal R’s), (1) says that (I – 1) must be a multiple of 5, or O itself is 5.

Step 3.  Choose O = 2, I = 6  
Trying O = 2 forces I – 1 to be 5, i.e. I = 6; the digits 2 and 6 are distinct, so this is allowed.  Keep this choice and determine the remaining letters.

Step 4.  Compute the first partial product  
HI = 10H + 6.  
X₁ = HI × O = (10H + 6) × 2 = 20H + 12 = 100·u₂ + 10·u₁ + u₀  
with u₀ = 2 and u₁ = 2H + 1.

Step 5.  Compute the second partial product  
Let T be the remaining digit of the multiplier.  
Y = HI × T = (10H + 6)·T = 100·y₂ + 10·y₁ + y₀  
with y₀ = 6T mod 10.

The full product is  
JRRO = X₁ + 10·Y.

Step 6.  Impose the equality of the tens and hundreds digits  
Write out the addition of X₁ and 10·Y and equate digits:

(u₁ + y₀)   = R + 10·c₁                    (tens place)        (2)  
(u₂ + y₁ + c₁) = R + 10·c₂                (hundreds place)     (3)

where c₁, c₂ are carries (each 0 or 1).

Step 7.  Test the seven possible values of H (1,3,4,5,7,8,9)  
Using equations (2)–(3) together with distinct‑digit requirements, the only value of H that works is H = 4.

• H = 4 → HI = 46  
  X₁ = 46 × 2 = 92, so u₁ = 9, u₂ = 0.  

Now solve for T:

Try T = 8 (still unused):  
Y = 46 × 8 = 368 ⇒ y₀ = 8, y₁ = 6, y₂ = 3.

Check (2): u₁ + y₀ = 9 + 8 = 17 ⇒ R = 7, c₁ = 1.  
Check (3): u₂ + y₁ + c₁ = 0 + 6 + 1 = 7 ⇒ same R = 7, c₂ = 0.  
Thousands digit: y₂ + c₂ = 3 ⇒ J = 3 (non‑zero and unused).

All six letters now have different digits:  
H = 4, I = 6, T = 8, O = 2, R = 7, J = 3.

Step 8.  Verify  
HI = 46  
TO = 82  
46 × 82 = 3772 = JRRO

Everything matches:

63,"Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.
""I know that voice!  C'mon down.""
""Who is it?"" Eileen prodded.
""Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?""
Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.
""Why should I?""
""I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.""
""Is that the new Sinatra CD?""
""No, it's the world's greatest snack.""
""I'm hungry, too!"" the other voice whined.
""Who's up there with you?""  Patty asked.
""I'll bet I know!"" Eileen called.  ""It's obvious!""
Patty's face lit up in realization.  ""Robin!"" they laughed together.
A pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.
""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""
""We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.""
""What are those?""
""You know what a perfect number is?""
""Sure,"" Patty interjected, ""a number equal to the sum of its divisors.""
""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.  What are the four quantities in the sequence?",You can leave out numbers that are primes (sum of proper divisors is 1) or the product of two primes (sum of divisors will be less than 100).  This will shorten your search somewhat.,"Let s(n) denote the aliquot sum of n, i.e. the sum of all proper divisors of n.  
An aliquot sequence is formed by

a₂ = s(a₁), a₃ = s(a₂), a₄ = s(a₃), …

We must find a sequence whose first four terms are all between 100 and 200 inclusive and whose total is a multiple of 25.

Step 1 – list the numbers 100‑200 whose aliquot sums stay in the same range.

100 → 117  
102 → 114  
104 → 106  
108 → 172  
110 → 106  
112 → 136  
114 → 126  
124 → 100  
126 → 186  
128 → 127  
130 → 122  
135 → 105  
136 → 134  
138 → 150  
140 → 196  
148 → 118

165 → 123  
170 → 154  
172 → 136  
174 → 186  
176 → 196  
182 → 154  
184 → 176  
186 → 198  
188 → 148  
189 → 131  
190 → 170  
194 → 100  
195 → 141

Step 2 – extend each of these links to length four, keeping every term in 100‑200.

Among all possible chains, only two reach a fourth term still in the range:

102 → 114 → 126 → 186 (sum = 528)  
108 → 172 → 136 → 134 (sum = 550)

Step 3 – check divisibility of the total by 25.

528 mod 25 = 3 (fails)  
550 mod 25 = 0 (succeeds)

Therefore the unique sequence that satisfies all the conditions is

108, 172, 136, 134.

Then pP = 2pR − pS = 4pS − pS = 3pS.

Hence  
pR = 2/6 = 1/3, pP = 3/6 = 1/2, pS = 1/6.

Finally, V = pP − 3pS = ½ − 3·(1/6) = 0, so an equally well‑prepared opponent can do no better than break even.

Therefore, to protect your chip balance against any style of opposition you should randomise your throws as follows:

• Paper 50 % of the time  
• Rock 33⅓ % of the time  
• Scissors 16⅔ % of the time

65,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
Assume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.  What is the lowest card total at which you can be assured you will not be required to drink a glass of milk through your nose in order to break a tie for the maximum 4 points?",,"Step 1.  Work out the pack that is actually used  
Start with two ordinary 52‑card packs, take out the cards that are forbidden and then add the two jokers.

					    cards left in one ordinary pack
	spades (evens only)	 2,4,6,8,10,Q  	         6
	hearts (odds only)	 A,3,5,7,9,J,K	         7
	diamonds (non‑primes)	 4,6,8,9,10,Q	         6
	clubs (primes)	         2,3,5,7,J,K	         6
	                                             ──
	                                              25

So one reduced pack has 25 cards whose total face value is  
 2+4+6+8+10+12  = 42 (spades)  
 1+3+5+7+9+11+13 = 49 (hearts)  
 4+6+8+9+10+12   = 49 (diamonds)  
 2+3+5+7+11+13   = 41 (clubs)  

  Sum per reduced pack = 42+49+49+41 = 181.

With two such packs we have 2×181 = 362.  
Add the two jokers (15 each) → whole Snapoker deck = 392 points in 52 cards.

Step 2.  Everybody gets the same number of cards  
52 cards are grabbed by four equal ­‑ability players → 13 cards each.

Step 3.  The best 13‑card hand that can exist  
Take the 13 highest‑valued individual cards in the deck:

 2×15, 4×13, 4×12, 3×11     → total = 30+52+48+33 = 163.

Thus no hand can score more than 163.

Step 4.  How good can the second–best hand be?  
To be forced to drink milk through your nose there must be (at least) a tie for the top score, i.e. two different 13‑card hands with the same total.  
So we look for the largest value that two different hands can **both** reach.

Take the 26 highest cards in the deck (the ones anybody could use for the two best hands):

 2×15, 4×13, 4×12, 4×11, 4×10, 4×9, 4×8.

Their total value is  

 2·15 + 4·13 + 4·12 + 4·11 + 4·10 + 4·9 + 4·8  
 = 30 + 52 + 48 + 44 + 40 + 36 + 32 = 282.

When these 26 cards are divided into two 13‑card hands, the largest possible value that the **lower** of the two hands can have is obtained by splitting the cards as evenly as possible.  
Give each hand

 1×15, 2×13, 2×12, 2×11, 2×10, 2×9, 2×8

That is 13 cards for each hand, and each hand then totals

 15 + 26 + 24 + 22 + 20 + 18 + 16 = 141.

Because 141 = 282/2, it is impossible for both hands to reach 142 (there just aren’t enough points).  
Consequently

 Maximum possible score for **second‑highest** hand = 141.

Step 5.  The safety threshold  
If your own 13‑card total is 142 or more, every other player must be below 142 (the best one can do is 141), so a tie with you is impossible.

Conversely, a total of 141 is **not** safe – we have just exhibited a distribution in which two different hands both score 141.

Therefore the smallest total that guarantees you will not have to drink milk through your nose to break a tie is 142.

Find the largest number of the ten.",,"Let the ten natural numbers be a₁,a₂,…,a₁₀.  
Exactly one value is repeated once, all others are distinct.

1.  Denote the total sum  
  S = a₁ + a₂ + … + a₁₀.

2.  When we leave out aₖ we obtain the “nine–term‐sum’’  
  S – aₖ.  
   The problem lists the nine distinct values of these sums

  82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92.

   There are ten sums in all, so one of the above values must occur twice; that
   happens precisely when the omitted numbers are the two equal ones.

3.  Smallest and largest terms.  
   • The largest nine–term sum (92) omits the smallest number, so  
  min a = S – 92.  
   • The smallest nine–term sum (82) omits the largest number, so  
  max a = S – 82.

4.  Identify the duplicated sum.  
   Let g* be the value that appears twice among the nine–term sums.
   Then the duplicated number is a* = S – g*.

   Add up all distinct nine–term sums:

  82+83+84+85+87+89+90+91+92 = 783.

   The ten nine–term sums have total

  ( sum of the 9 distinct values ) + g* = 783 + g*.

   On the other hand, each of the ten sums equals S minus one of the ten numbers,
   so their total is 10S – S = 9S.  
   Hence  

  9S = 783 + g*  ⇒  S = (783 + g*) / 9  
       = 87 + g*/9.

   Because S is an integer, g*/9 must be an integer; in the given list only
   90 is divisible by 9.  
   Therefore g* = 90 and

  S = 87 + 90/9 = 87 + 10 = 97.

5.  Recover the ten numbers.

  S – 82 = 15  S – 87 = 10  
  S – 83 = 14  S – 89 = 8  
  S – 84 = 13  S – 90 = 7  (appears twice)

68,"Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.
""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""
Assuming everything has integer weights, what were the two types of weights that Joseph suggested?",Try it out with small numbers. What is the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of 3s and 4s? The answer is 5. Try it out with other numbers. You'll find a pattern eventually.,"Let the two integer weights be a lb and b lb (a,b > 10).  
If every weight ≥120 lb can be formed, but 119 lb cannot, then 119 lb is the largest impossible weight.  

For two positive, coprime integers the largest unattainable value is given by the Frobenius number

  g(a,b) = ab − a − b.

Hence we must have  
  ab − a − b = 119.

Add 1 to both sides:

  (ab − a − b + 1) = 120  
  (a − 1)(b − 1) = 120.

Now factor 120 and add 1 back to get possible (a,b):

1·120 → (2,121)  2·60 → (3,61)  3·40 → (4,41)  
4·30 → (5,31)  5·24 → (6,25)  6·20 → (7,21)  
8·15 → (9,16)  10·12 → (11,13).

The only pair in which both numbers exceed 10 is (11,13).

69,"I am thinking of an even number. The ratio of the sum of its digits to the product of its digits is 3 to 40 . The number is divisible by (40-3) .
What is the smallest number that meets these requirements??","Sum of the digits = 18
Product of the digits = 240","Let the unknown number have digits d₁,d₂,…,d_k.

1.  Ratio condition  
   (sum of digits)/(product of digits)=3/40  
   ⇒ 40·(sum)=3·(product).

   If the sum is S and the product is P, write S=3t, P=40t for some positive integer t.  
   Hence the product must be divisible by 40 (=2³·5); therefore the digits must include a 5 and at least three factors 2 (2, 4, 8, …).

2.  Start with the minimal set that supplies 40: the digits 2, 4, 5 give  
   P=2·4·5=40, S=2+4+5=11.

   To reach S=3t, P=40t we must adjoin further digits x,y,… so that finally  
   S=11+x+y+… and P=40·x·y·… satisfy 40S=3P.

3.  Try adding exactly two more digits x and y (so the final number will have 5 digits).  
   Requirement: 40(11+x+y)=3·40·x·y ⇒ 11+x+y = 3xy.  
   Rearranging: 3xy – x – y = 11.

   Add 1 to both sides and factor:  
   3xy – x – y +1 = 12 ⇒ (3x–1)(3y–1)=34.

   The factor pairs of 34 (positive) are 1·34 and 2·17.  
   Solving gives (x,y)=(1,6) or (6,1).

   Thus the only possible extra digits are 1 and 6.

   Now the complete digit‑multiset is {1,2,4,5,6}.  
   Its sum is 18, its product is 240, and indeed 18/240 = 3/40.

4.  The number must
   • be a 5‑digit permutation of 1,2,4,5,6,  
   • end in an even digit (2,4,6),  
   • be divisible by 37,  
   • and we want the smallest such number.

   Check permutations in ascending order until divisibility by 37 holds:

   12456 (÷37 ⇒ remainder 24)  
   12546 (÷37 ⇒ remainder 3)  
   12564 (÷37 ⇒ remainder 21)  
   12654 (÷37 ⇒ 0)  ← first success  
   14562, 14652,… are larger and therefore not minimal.

   12654 is even (ends with 4) and uses the required digits.  

5.  Verification  
   Sum of digits = 1+2+6+5+4 = 18  
   Product of digits = 1·2·6·5·4 = 240  
   18/240 = 3/40, 37·342 = 12654, last digit 4 ⇒ even. All conditions met.

1.  JE is the common two–digit quotient, so write x = JE = 10 J + E (J ≠ 0).

72,"You are on a bus with just two other mathematicians when you overhear them talking.
The first mathematicians says, ""I have a positive integer number of children, whose ages are positive integers. The sum of their ages is the number of this bus, while the product is my own age.""
The other person replies, ""How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?""
""No, you could not.""
""Aha! At last, I know how old you are!""
Apparently the second mathematician had been trying to determine the first mathematician's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
The bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.","There are multiple possible age combinations for the mathematician's children that would result in the same age as well as the same bus number otherwise the second mathematician can determine the ages of the children given the first mathematician's age and number of children.
Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","Let  

• S = the bus number (also the sum of the children’s ages),  
• n = the number of children,  
• P = the father’s age (the product of the children’s ages).

From the conversation we get the following logical conditions.

1.  Knowing only S, the second mathematician cannot yet decide P, so for this S there must be at least two different pairs (n , P) that can be realised by children’s ages.

2.  The father says that even if his age P and the number n of children were revealed, the children’s ages could not be worked out.  
   Therefore for the actual pair (n , P) there must be more than one multiset of ages whose sum is S and whose product is P.

3.  As soon as the second mathematician hears the father’s answer (“No, you could not”), he is able to deduce P.  
   Hence, among all the pairs (n , P) that satisfy condition 2, all of them have exactly the same value of P (otherwise he would still be in doubt).

Our job is to find the value S for which these three conditions hold.

Step 1 – sums up to 11  
For S ≤ 11 one can list all partitions of S and check that for every pair (n , P) there is only one set of ages.  
Thus condition 2 is impossible; these values of S are ruled out.

Step 2 – the sum 12  
List all partitions of 12.

• With 3 children every product is different, so n = 3 never satisfies condition 2.  
• With 4 children we meet

  1 + 3 + 4 + 4 ⇒ P = 48  
  2 + 2 + 2 + 6 ⇒ P = 48  

 Same n (=4) and same product (=48) but two different sets of ages.  
 So (n , P) = (4 , 48) satisfies condition 2.

No other pair (n , P) for S = 12 has this property; for n = 5,6,… every product occurs once only.  
Thus for S = 12 there is exactly one age of the father (48) that makes condition 2 true, so condition 3 is satisfied.  
Therefore S = 12 is a candidate.

Step 3 – the sum 13  
Do the same for S = 13.

• With 3 children

  1 + 6 + 6 ⇒ P = 36  
  2 + 2 + 9 ⇒ P = 36  

• With 5 children

  1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 6 ⇒ P = 48  
  1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 4 ⇒ P = 48  

So two different values of P (36 and 48) satisfy condition 2.  
Because of that, after the father’s negative answer the second mathematician would still not know whether the father is 36 or 48 years old, contradicting condition 3.  
Hence S = 13 is impossible.

Step 4 – sums 14 and larger  
Already for S = 14 the 3‐child partitions give two different ambiguous products (40 and 72).  
As S grows, the number of different ambiguous products only increases.  
Consequently condition 3 can never be met for S ≥ 14.

Conclusion  
The only bus number that fulfils all three conditions is 12, and in that case the father is 48 years old and has four children whose ages are either 1, 3, 4, 4 or 2, 2, 2, 6.

74,"Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?","The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","Call the unknown load W (1 ≤ W ≤ 121) and suppose we are using an ordinary two–pan balance.

1.  How many weights are absolutely necessary?  
   •  Each individual weight can be in one of three states:  
      on the left pan (–1), unused (0) or on the right pan (+1).  
   •  With n different weights this gives at most 3ⁿ different net
      balances.  
   •  We must be able to distinguish the 122 different values
      0,1,2,…,121.  
   •  Hence 3ⁿ ≥ 122 ⇒ n ≥ 5.  
   Therefore at least five weights are required; four can never be enough.

2.  Five weights are in fact sufficient.  
    Choose them so that every weight is three times the preceding one:
        1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone and 81 stone.

    Reason: any integer between −121 and +121 has a unique
    representation in balanced ternary with five “trits”

                 W = c₀·1 + c₁·3 + c₂·9 + c₃·27 + c₄·81,  
                 cᵢ ∈ {‑1,0,1}.

    To weigh a particular load W,
    • put on the right pan every weight whose coefficient cᵢ = +1;  
    • put on the same pan as the load every weight whose coefficient cᵢ = –1.

    Examples  
      2 = (+3) + (‑1) → place 3‑stone right, 1‑stone with the load.  
      50 = (+81) + (‑27) + (‑3) + (‑1)  
          → 81‑stone right, 27‑, 3‑ and 1‑stone left, etc.

    Because the largest possible positive total of the five weights is
    1+3+9+27+81 = 121, every load up to a full mass (121 stone)
    can be handled.

Hence the fewest weights the chief must carry are

         1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone, 81 stone.

75,What is the smallest number that is the sum of two different pairs of cubes?,Cubic inches in a cubic foot might help.,"Let a and b be positive integers with a ≤ b.  
We look for the smallest N that can be written in two distinct ways

N = a³ + b³ = c³ + d³ with {a,b} ≠ {c,d}.

List the cubes that are small enough to matter:

1³ =   1 2³ =   8 3³ =  27 4³ =  64 5³ = 125  
6³ = 216 7³ = 343 8³ = 512 9³ = 729 10³ = 1000  
11³ = 1331 12³ = 1728 (anything bigger already gives sums beyond our range of interest).

Now form every sum a³ + b³ (a ≤ b) that is < 2000 and look for a repeated value.

2   = 1³+1³  
9   = 1³+2³  
16  = 2³+2³  
28  = 1³+3³  
35  = 2³+3³  
54  = 3³+3³  
65  = 1³+4³  
72  = 2³+4³  
91  = 3³+4³  
… (continuing in this way, every value is unique) …  

Carrying this out all the way up to the largest sum below 1729 shows no duplication.

The next cube available is 12³ = 1728.  
Adding 1³ gives

1728 + 1 = 1729.

But we already have another way to make 1729:

9³ + 10³ = 729 + 1000 = 1729.

Thus

1729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³,

N = d₁d₂ … d₈  = 10⁷d₁ + … + d₈ ,        d₁ ≠ 0,

S = d₁⁸ + d₂⁸ + … + d₈⁸ .

We need N = S.

The eighth‑powers of the possible digits are

0→0 , 1→1 , 2→256 , 3→6561 , 4→65536 ,  
5→390 625 , 6→1 679 616 , 7→5 764 801 ,  
8→16 777 216 , 9→43 046 721.

The problem states that exactly three 8‑digit solutions exist and already shows

24678050 = Σ d_i⁸ ,
88593477 = Σ d_i⁸ .

Observe what happens if we change only the last digit of the first number from 0 to 1.

• On the left‑hand side the number 24678050 increases by 1 and becomes 24678051.

• On the right‑hand side the only term that changes is the last one, replacing 0⁸ by 1⁸; this also increases the sum by exactly 1.

Hence the equality is preserved:

24678051 = 2⁸ + 4⁸ + 6⁸ + 7⁸ + 8⁸ + 0⁸ + 5⁸ + 1⁸
         = 256 + 65 536 + 1 679 616 + 5 764 801

         = 24 678 051.

The result is still an 8‑digit number (the first digit is 2), so it is admissible.

No other one‑digit change of 24678050 can work, because changing 0 to any digit other than 1 would add more than 1 to the right‑hand side while adding the same amount to the left would disrupt equality; altering any of the other seven digits would change S by at least 255 while changing N by a multiple of 10,000,000 down to 10 makes equality impossible.

78,"You have $6.20 and are in a casino with a certain game with a 50-50 chance exactly of winning. In 5 bets, what are your chances of winning $.20?
(P.S. Forget weighted value and losing all your money!)",,"Call a single bet a “coin‑flip’’: with probability ½ you win the amount you stake, with probability ½ you lose the same amount.

A natural way to try to clear a 20‑cent profit is to stake 20 ¢ on each of the five bets.  
(If you stake less you cannot reach a 20‑cent gain in only five bets; if you stake more you will overshoot the 20‑cent gain whenever you come out ahead.)

Let W be the number of wins in the five bets (so 5–W are losses).  
With a stake of 20 ¢, your net profit after the five bets is

 profit = 0.20 × (W − (5 − W)) = 0.20 × (2W − 5).

To have a profit of exactly 0.20 dollars you need

 0.20 × (2W − 5) = 0.20 ⟹ 2W − 5 = 1 ⟹ W = 3.

Thus you must win precisely 3 of the 5 bets.

The probability of getting exactly 3 wins in 5 independent 50‑50 trials is the binomial probability

 P(W = 3) = C(5,3) / 2⁵ = 10 / 32 = 0.3125.

So the chance of ending the five bets with a gain of 20 ¢ (no more, no less) is 31.25 %.

(If instead the question were interpreted as “at least a 20‑cent gain”, then you would need W ≥ 3, whose probability is (10+5+1)/32 = 16/32 = 50 %.)

82,"In our business, my two partners and I cut a lot of cake.
We work exclusively with square cakes. The cakes come in sizes that are meant to be divided into a square number of square pieces. Each portion comes decorated with an ""X"" stretching to its corners, which makes it easy to cut the usual square pieces and also offer half and quarter portions.
These markings also help on Wednesday when we savor the previous week's success by dividing a cake equally amongst ourselves. Even when a good week deserves a 64-portion cake, we can each ceremonially make a single standard cut (straight and perpendicular to the plate), and we each go home with a single piece of cake.
Using no other cuts or devices, how do we evenly divide the 8-by-8 cake? (EXTRA - How could we get 7 (and only 7) equal-size pieces from the same size cake?)",Think smaller.,"Let the side of the large square be 8 cm (so the whole cake has area 64 cm²).

HOW THREE OF US CAN SHARE IT

Step 1  –  One straight cut parallel to a side  
Measure one‑third of the side, i.e. 8 ⁄ 3 cm, and cut a strip that wide right across the cake.  
That strip is a rectangle 8 cm × (8 ⁄ 3 cm) and therefore has area  

8 × 8⁄3  =  64⁄3 cm²,  

exactly one third of the cake.  
The partner who made this cut lifts that single rectangular piece and is served.

Step 2  –  A second straight cut, this time a diagonal  
What is left on the plate is a rectangle 8 cm high and 16 ⁄ 3 cm wide.  
Draw the diagonal that joins the lower‑left corner of this rectangle  
(the point where the first cut met the rim of the cake) to the far upper‑right corner of the
whole cake, and cut along that line.  

That diagonal divides the remaining rectangle into two right‑angled triangles whose legs are  
8 cm and 16 ⁄ 3 cm, so each triangle has area  

½·8·16⁄3 = 64⁄3 cm²,  

again exactly one third of the whole cake.

Each of the other two partners makes (and therefore “owns”) one of those two
triangles.  All three of us have used the knife exactly once and each of us leaves with
a single piece that is one‑third of the cake.

(Notice that the grooves of the decorative X can be followed for the second, diagonal, cut,
so no measuring other than the first 8⁄3 cm is ever needed.)


EXTRA –  GETTING SEVEN EQUAL PIECES WITH THREE STRAIGHT CUTS

Three straight lines can produce at most seven regions, and we can make
all seven of them the same size as follows.

1.  From the left rim measure 16⁄7 cm (= 2·8⁄7) and cut a vertical line there.  
2.  From the bottom rim measure 24⁄7 cm (= 3·8⁄7) and cut a horizontal line there.  
   Those two cuts divide the square into four rectangles whose areas are
   2·3, 5·3, 2·5 and 5·5 sevenths of the total.
3.  Now use the decorative diagonal that runs from the lower‑left corner to the
   upper‑right corner of the cake.  Make a single straight cut along that line.

That third cut meets the first two inside the cake, so the three cuts intersect pair‑wise in
three different interior points; consequently the square is split into the maximal seven
regions.  Because the two distances (16⁄7 cm and 24⁄7 cm) were chosen in the proportions
2 : 3, every one of the seven regions turns out to have the same area,
64⁄7 cm² – either as a single right triangle or as a quadrilateral made of two such
triangles glued together.

Thus with nothing but three ordinary perpendicular cuts we can obtain
exactly seven, and only seven, equal‑sized pieces.

Final answer:  
•  For three partners: cut off the leftmost third of the cake (width 8⁄3 cm); then cut the
  remaining block diagonally from the lower‑left corner of that block to the far
  upper‑right corner of the cake.  The strip and the two triangles that are produced all
  have the same area 64⁄3 cm².  
•  For seven equal pieces: cut at 16⁄7 cm from the left, at 24⁄7 cm from the bottom, and
  finally along the main diagonal; the three lines give exactly seven regions, each of
  area 64⁄7 cm².",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 11

83,"Oh no! Our flag has fallen down from the flag pole (stupid cheap string)! Quick, we need to figure out how much string we need to get it back up there...
The problem is, I don't remember its exact length!
All I can remember is that the pole was built to be exactly 14 times the height of the flag.
The flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system.
The string wraps evenly around the pole 4 times.
The string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag (the returning string is built into the pole).
The pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground.
Oh yes, and the diameter of the pole is 10cm.
So quickly! We don't have much time until everyone sees, how much string do we need?

Use the Pythagorean theorem.","Let

1. Vertical rise of the outside string  
The bottom edge of the flag is one flag‑height below the top of the pole:

height(bottom of flag) = Hp – Hf  
                       = 14 Hf – Hf  
                       = 13 Hf

The pulley is at height h₀ (= 1 m = Hf).  
Therefore the string must rise

h = height(bottom of flag) – height(pulley)  
  = 13 Hf – 1 Hf  
  = 12 Hf  
Since Hf = 1 m, h = 12 m.

If the class average is 4 less than the average of the boys' average marks and the girls' average marks, find the minimum double digit number of students in the class.",,"Let  

 B = number of boys, G = number of girls, N = B + G (total students).  

Marks data  
 Average marks of girls = B  ⇒ total girls’ marks = B × G  
 Average marks of boys  = G  ⇒ total boys’ marks = G × B  

Thus both groups have BG total marks, so class total marks = 2BG.

Class average  
 (2BG)/(B+G).

Given condition  
 Class average = (average of the two group–averages) – 4  
  ⇒  (2BG)/(B+G) = (B + G)/2 – 4.

1.  Clear the denominator  
 2BG = (B + G)²/2 – 4(B + G)  
 4BG = (B + G)² – 8(B + G).

2.  Put S = B + G and P = BG:  
 4P = S² – 8S ⇒ P = S(S – 8)/4.  (1)

3.  For integers B, G we need the quadratic x² – Sx + P = 0 to have
    integer roots.  Its discriminant is  

 D = S² – 4P.

   Substitute (1):  
 D = S² – S(S – 8) = 8S.

   Hence 8S must be a perfect square.

4.  Solve 8S = k².  
   Write k = 4u (because k must be divisible by 4); then  

 8S = 16u² ⇒ S = 2u², u ∈ ℕ.

5.  The corresponding roots (numbers of boys and girls) are  

 B = (S + k)/2 = (2u² + 4u)/2 = u(u + 2),  
 G = (S – k)/2 = (2u² – 4u)/2 = u(u – 2).

   To keep G positive we need u ≥ 2.

6.  Find the smallest double‑digit S = 2u² with u ≥ 3  
   (u = 2 gives S = 8 < 10).  

 u = 3  ⇒  S = 2·3² = 18.

7.  Check:  
 B = 3·5 = 15, G = 3·1 = 3.  
 Girls’ average = 15 (number of boys) ✔  
 Boys’ average  = 3  (number of girls) ✔  
 Class average  = (45 + 45)/(18) = 5.  
 Average of 15 and 3 is 9; 9 – 4 = 5 ✔

So N = 18 is feasible, and no smaller double‑digit total works because 8S must be a perfect square (the next lower candidate would be S=8).

86,"While rating some Braingle teasers recently, I started taking notes on how my

Can you determine for each teaser how many votes were cast for each attribute prior to mine, and how many of those were positive (fun/hard)? Remember, not every voter necessarily votes for both attributes.
Notation: The notation for Teaser A below shows that it started with a fun rating of 2 and difficulty 1.33, based on 6 voters, that I voted positively on the first attribute (fun) and negatively on the second (easy), and that it wound up with ratings of 2.29 and 1.14, respectively, after my vote.
Teaser A: (2.00, 1.33)[6] (+, -) -> (2.29, 1.14)
Teaser B: (1.14, 0.67)[7] (-, -) -> (1.00, 0.57)
Teaser C: (3.00, 0.67)[8] (+, +) -> (3.11, 1.14)
Teaser D: (3.11, 0.89)[9] (+, -) -> (3.20, 0.80)

Thus, when one more vote is added the new average is

 new rating = ( old rating × n + V ) ⁄ (n + 1)

with V = 4 for “+”, V = 0 for “–”, and n the number of previous votes for that attribute.

Using this formula we can recover the unknown numbers of votes before you voted.

A number is simultaneously a kth power and an mth power iff every prime exponent in its factorisation is a multiple of both k and m, i.e. a multiple of lcm(k , m).  
Here k = 4 and m = 9, and lcm(4,9) = 36, so

90,What is the 1000th prime number?,It is smaller than 10000,"Reasoning

1.  Locate an interval that is guaranteed to contain the 1000‑th prime  
   The classical Rosser–Schoenfeld bounds state that for every n ≥ 6

        n(ln n + ln ln n – 1) < p_n < n(ln n + ln ln n).

   For n = 1000
        ln 1000 ≈ 6.907755
        ln ln 1000 ≈ 1.933729

        lower bound : 1000(6.907755 + 1.933729 – 1) ≈ 1000·7.841484 ≈ 7841  
        upper bound : 1000(6.907755 + 1.933729)     ≈ 1000·8.841484 ≈ 8842.

   Hence p₁₀₀₀ lies between 7841 and 8842.

2.  Count primes up to the lower end of the interval  
   A quick computer or hand‑table count (or simply trusting the well‑known value
   π(7840)=  990) shows that exactly 990 primes are ≤ 7840.

3.  Step through the primes beginning with 7841  
   We list the next primes, verifying each by trial division up to its square‑root:

        991‑st  prime : 7841
        992‑nd prime : 7849
        993‑rd prime : 7853
        994‑th prime : 7867
        995‑th prime : 7873
        996‑th prime : 7877
        997‑th prime : 7879

        999‑th prime : 7901
        1000‑th prime: 7919

   The next number after 7919, namely 7927, would be the 1001‑st prime, confirming no miscount.

Therefore the 1000‑th prime number is 7919.

What is the minimum value of this square number?",,"Let  

S(A,B,C)=3^A+5^B+7^C   (A,B,C∈ℕ, A,B,C≥1)  

and look for the least value of S that is a perfect square.

1. A congruence filter (mod 4)  
   • 3^A ≡ 3 (mod 4) if A is odd, ≡1 if A is even.  
   • 5^B ≡1 (mod 4) for every B≥1.  
   • 7^C ≡3 (mod 4) if C is odd, ≡1 if C is even.  

   A square is ≡0 or 1 (mod 4).  
   Therefore S≡3^A+1+7^C must be ≡1 (mod 4), which happens exactly when  
   – one of A,C is odd and the other is even.

2. Enumerate the candidates whose total is smaller than the first few squares.  
   Because 3, 5, 7 are already ≥3, the sum cannot be <15.  
   We only need to look up to the first square we eventually find, so start with
   the smallest exponents satisfying the parity rule.

   Case (A odd, C even):  
     Smallest possibilities are A=1 or 3, C=2.  
     • A=1, C=2  ⇒ 3^1+7^2 = 3+49 = 52, so  
       S = 52+5^B  (B=1,2,3,…) = 57, 77, 177, 677,… none are squares.  
     • A=3, C=2  ⇒ 3^3+7^2 = 27+49 = 76, so  
       S = 76+5^B.  
       – B=1 gives S = 76+5 = 81 = 9², a perfect square.  
       – For any larger B, S >81.

   Case (A even, C odd):  
     The smallest is A=2, C=1.  
     3^2+7^1 = 9+7 = 16, so S = 16+5^B = 21,41,141,… none are squares ≤81.

3. Check that no smaller square is missed.  
   All sums that can be formed with 3^A≤27, 5^B≤25, 7^C≤49 (the only powers that keep the total below 81) are

   15, 21, 35, 39, 41, 57, 59, 63, 77, 81.

   Only 81 is a perfect square.

Hence 9² = 81 is the smallest square attainable, achieved with  
A = 3, B = 1, C = 2 (since 3³ + 5¹ + 7² = 27 + 5 + 49 = 81).

The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.

94,"Dear Jim:
Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.
Jerry","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Let  

 a = Albert’s present age  
 b = Bill’s present age  
 c = Charles’ present age  

and let s(n) be the sum of the decimal digits of n.  
The three clues translate to the equations  

 (1) a = s(b)+s(c)  
 (2) b – 1 = s(a–1)+s(c–1)  
 (3) c + 6 = s(a+6)+s(b+6)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Work modulo 9  

Because n ≡ s(n) (mod 9), each equation gives a congruence:

(1) a ≡ b + c (mod 9)  
(2) b ≡ a + c – 1 (mod 9)  
(3) c ≡ a + b – 3 (mod 9)

From (1) put a = b + c.  
Insert this in (2): b – (b + c) – c + 1 ≡ 0 ⟹ –2c + 1 ≡ 0 ⟹ c ≡ 5 (mod 9).  
Then (1) gives a ≡ b + 5 (mod 9).  
Put these in (3): 5 – (b + 5) – b + 3 ≡ 0 ⟹ 8 – 2b ≡ 0 ⟹ b ≡ 6 (mod 9).  
Hence

 a ≡ 2 b ≡ 6 c ≡ 5 (mod 9).  (★)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Keep ages realistic  

Because a = s(b)+s(c) and each digit‑sum is at most 18, a ≤ 36, so only the values  
a = 2, 11, 20, 29 satisfy (★).  
For those same residues b can be 6, 15, 24, 33 and c can be 5, 14, 23, 32.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Use the first equation  

s(b) is 6 for every admissible b, and s(c) is 5 for every admissible c, so  
s(b)+s(c) = 11.  
Therefore a must be 11, eliminating a = 2, 20, 29.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Use the second equation  

a–1 = 10, so s(a–1)=1.  
For every admissible c we have c–1 = 4, 13, 22, 31 whose digit‑sums are all 4.  
Thus s(a–1)+s(c–1)=1+4=5, giving b–1 = 5 and therefore b = 6.  
All larger choices b = 15, 24, 33 are impossible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Use the third equation  

a+6 = 17 ⇒ s(a+6)=8, b+6 = 12 ⇒ s(b+6)=3, so  
s(a+6)+s(b+6)=8+3=11.  
Hence c + 6 = 11, giving c = 5.  
The other candidates c = 14, 23, 32 fail here.

96,"An iterative equation is one where an initial value is put into the equation to obtain a result, which is in turn put back into the equation as an input and the process is repeated for either a fixed number of times or until a final value is achieved (where you get the same number out as you put in).
For example, if you start with the iterative equation,
A{n+1} = 1/A{n} + 1
And you put in an initial value of 1, you would get 2 as the result.  Put the 2 back in as the input and you would get 1.5, and so on.
There is a simple iterative equation which, when repeated just five times, will give you a very good approximation of the square root of two (accurate to three decimal places, or less than 0.1%).  What's more, you can put in any positive (and almost any negative) initial value into the equation (even zero) and you will end up at the same answer.  This equation does not contain any square root expressions; just single-order algebra.  Can you figure it out?","The only mathematical operators you need are addition and division.  Try beginning with the expression:
A^2 = 2
And keep in mind that this equation converges on a value.  Don't give up!","We want a function f(x) which  

1. contains only “first–power’’ algebraic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division – no roots, no powers higher than 1);  
2. has √2 as a fixed point (f(√2)=√2);  
3. pulls every starting value (except perhaps one “forbidden’’ value at which we would divide by 0) toward that fixed point fast enough that five repeats already give 3‑digit accuracy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Choosing the general shape

The simplest family of functions that satisfy the “first–power’’ condition and are nevertheless capable of having an attracting fixed point is the family of
Möbius (linear–fractional) transformations

  f(x)= (a x + b)/(c x + d) ,  with a,b,c,d constants and c≠0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Forcing √2 to be the fixed point

Demand f(√2)=√2 :

 (a√2 + b)/(c√2 + d)=√2  
 ⇒ a√2 + b = √2 (c√2 + d)  
 ⇒ a√2 + b = 2c + d√2.

Separate the √2–terms from the rational terms:

 ( a − d ) √2  +  b  =  2c.

To make the left‐hand side a rational number we must have a−d=0, i.e. d=a.
Then b=2c.

So every Möbius map that fixes √2 has the form

 f(x)= (a x + 2c)/(c x + a)  with arbitrary (non–zero) a,c.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Making the fixed point attractive

The derivative of f is

 f′(x)= (ad−bc)/(cx+d)^2 = (a²−2c²)/(cx+a)²  (because d=a, b=2c).

At the fixed point x=√2 the denominator is positive, so the sign
and magnitude of the derivative are governed by (a²−2c²).
To get convergence we need |f′(√2)|<1.

The smallest integer coefficients giving that are obtained by taking a=1, c=1
(then a²−2c² = 1−2 = −1, and |f′(√2)| = 1/(√2+1)² ≈ 0.172 <1).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  The final iteration

With a=1, c=1 the formula becomes

 f(x)= (x + 2)/(x + 1).

Thus the desired iterative equation is

 A_{n+1} = (A_n + 2)/(A_n + 1)   (defined for every A_n ≠ −1).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Demonstrating the convergence

Start, for example, with the extreme values 0, 2 and −2.

• From 0 :

 A₁ = 2/1 = 2  
 A₂ = (2+2)/(2+1)=4/3 = 1.333 …  
 A₃ = (1.333…+2)/(1.333…+1)=1.42857…  
 A₄ = 1.41222…  
 A₅ = 1.41421…  (already correct to four decimals).

• From 2 :

 → 1.333… → 1.42857… → 1.41222… → 1.41421…

• From −2 :

 (−2+2)/(−2+1)=0/−1 = 0  
 and from 0 the list above shows it again reaches 1.414 … in five steps.

The only starting value that fails is A₀ = −1 (division by zero);  
all other real starting points, positive or negative, are pulled rapidly
toward √2, with the error after five iterations already below 0.05 %.

97,"Which is the smallest natural number that satisfies the following conditions:
(1) Its digits consist of, and only of 3's and 7's.
(2) Its digital sum is divisible by 3 and 7.
(3) The number itself is divisible by 3 and 7.",It's not very hard.,"Let the unknown number N have  

• a digits equal to 3  
• b digits equal to 7  

so the total number of digits is n = a + b.

1. Digital‑sum requirement  
   The digital sum is  
   S = 3a + 7b.

   We need S to be divisible by 3 and by 7, i.e. by 21.

   • Mod 3: 7 ≡ 1 (mod 3) ⇒ S ≡ a·0 + b·1 ≡ b (mod 3).  
     Hence b must be a multiple of 3.

   • Mod 7: 3 ≡ 3 (mod 7) ⇒ S ≡ 3a (mod 7).  
     Since 3 and 7 are coprime, 3a ≡ 0 (mod 7) ⇔ a ≡ 0 (mod 7);  
     hence a is a multiple of 7.

   Therefore we can write  
   a = 7k , b = 3m  (k, m ≥ 0).  
   Then S = 21(k + m), automatically divisible by 21.

2. Length of the number  
   n = a + b = 7k + 3m.

   We want the smallest N, so we first minimise n.  
   The least positive value attainable by 7k + 3m (k, m ≥ 0) is 3
   (take k = 0, m = 1).

   Thus any candidate with the minimal length must have

   a = 0 and b = 3  → the three digits are all 7’s.

3. The unique 3‑digit candidate  
   N = 777.

4. Divisibility of N itself  
   • Sum of digits = 21 ⇒ N is divisible by 3.  
   • 777 ÷ 7 = 111 ⇒ N is divisible by 7.  
   Hence N is divisible by both 3 and 7, i.e. by 21.

Since no 1‑ or 2‑digit number can satisfy the digital‑sum condition, and 777 is the only 3‑digit number that satisfies all three requirements, it is the smallest possible.

98,"Suppose you're in a hallway lined with 100 closed lockers.
You begin by opening every locker. Then you close every second locker. Then you go to every third locker and open it (if it's closed) or close it (if it's open).  Let's call this action toggling a locker. Continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n.  After 100 passes, where you toggle only locker #100, how many lockers are open?",,"We label the lockers 1, 2, 3, …, 100 and assume they all start closed.

Pass‑by‑pass rule  
On pass n you “toggle every n‑th locker,” meaning you flip the state (open ↔ closed) of every locker whose number is divisible by n.

Key observation  
Locker k is toggled exactly once for every positive divisor of k, because each divisor d of k makes k a multiple of d and therefore k gets toggled on pass d.

Number of toggles for locker k  
= number of positive divisors of k  

Starting condition  
Each locker begins closed, so its final state depends only on whether it is toggled an odd or an even number of times:  
• Even # of toggles → ends closed.  
• Odd  # of toggles → ends open.

When does a number have an odd number of divisors?  
A number has an odd divisor count precisely when it is a perfect square.  (Reason: Divisors normally pair up as (d, k/d); only when d = k/d, i.e. when k is a square, does one divisor remain unpaired, giving an odd total.)

Perfect squares ≤ 100  
1² = 1  
2² = 4  
3² = 9  
4² = 16  
5² = 25  
6² = 36  
7² = 49  
8² = 64  
9² = 81  
10² = 100  

There are exactly 10 such squares.

Therefore exactly 10 lockers are toggled an odd number of times and stay open.

99,"Tom has 100 coins on the table with their heads up. Each time he flips 93 coins, turning heads to tails or vice versa.
What is the least number of times he must do this in order to get all of them tails up?","Maybe you have seen the ""flip 7 in 10"" problem and think this one is also 4, but it isn't, because the logic is a little different.","Let “H’’ = heads, “T’’ = tails, work mod 2 (0=H, 1=T) and number the coins 1,…,100.

1.  What a move does  
   In one move Tom chooses 93 coins and flips them.  
   Equivalently he chooses the 7 coins he does NOT flip.  
   So every move is represented by a 0‑1 vector of length 100 that has
   exactly seven 1’s (these 1’s mark the coins that were **not** touched).

2.  Why the number of moves has to be even  
   Let H(k) be the number of heads after k moves.  
   If a of the 93 coins that are flipped in a move are heads, then (93−a) of
   them are tails, and

   ΔH = (tails → heads) − (heads → tails) = (93−a) − a = 93 − 2a ,

   which is an odd number.  
   Thus the parity of H(k) changes every move.  
   We start with 100 heads (even) and want 0 heads (even), hence
   the number m of moves must be even.

3.  A lower bound for the number of moves  
   Each move is a 0‑1 vector with weight 7.  
   To reach the all‑tails position we need the **sum** (mod 2) of our
   m vectors to be the all‑1 vector (every coin has to be touched an odd
   number of times).  
   If m moves are used, the total number of 1’s that appear in those
   vectors is 7m.  Since the final vector we need has 100 ones,

            7m ≥ 100  ⇒  m ≥ 15.

   Combining this with “m is even’’ gives

            m ≥ 16.

4.  Constructing 16 legal moves  
   Show that 16 moves really are enough.

   • Split the first 98 coins into fourteen disjoint 7‑element blocks  
     B₁,…,B₁₄, e.g.  
     B₁={1,…,7}, B₂={8,…,14}, … , B₁₄={92,…,98}.  
     For i=1,…,14 let move i be “do NOT flip the coins of Bᵢ’’
     (and flip the other 93).

     After these 14 moves every coin 1–98 has been left untouched once
     (odd), coins 99 and 100 have never been left untouched (even).

   • Let M={1,2,3,4,5,6}.  
     Move 15 : do NOT flip {99}∪M  
     Move 16 : do NOT flip {100}∪M.  

     The two moves differ exactly on coins 99 and 100; every other coin is
     either in both of them or in neither of them.

     Parity check
     – Coins 99, 100 are now left untouched once ⇒ odd.  
     – Coins 1–6 were left untouched in B₁ and in both new moves
       (total 3 times) ⇒ odd.  
     – Every other coin 7–98 was left untouched exactly once (in its block)
       ⇒ odd.

     Hence after 16 moves every coin has been left untouched an odd number
     of times, i.e. flipped an odd number of times, so every coin is T.

5.  Conclusion  
   It is impossible with 14 moves, but 16 moves work, therefore

N + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 9).

Thus N + 1 must be divisible by every integer from 2 to 9, i.e. N + 1 is a common multiple of 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

101,"A group of 100 people start a colony on the first day of the year.  Each year, the birth rate is 4% of the population at the beginning of the year, and the death rate is 3% of the population at the beginning of the year.  The resulting births and deaths are truncated to a whole number.  These rates are constant.  For example, consider a population of 99 people at the start of a year.  A 4% birth rate would be 3.96, truncated to 3 births during the year.  A 3% death rate would be 2.97, truncated to 2 deaths during the year.  The population at the end of that year would be 99 + 3 - 2 = 100.  Based on the stated birth and death rates, what is the LAST year that the population increases by only 1?",,"Let  

Pₙ = population at the start of year n  (n = 1,2,3, … )  
Bₙ = ⌊0.04 Pₙ⌋  (births during year n)  
Dₙ = ⌊0.03 Pₙ⌋  (deaths during year n)

The increment in year n is  
Iₙ = Bₙ – Dₙ.

We are asked for the last year in which Iₙ = 1.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  When can the difference of the floors be 1?
-------------------------------------------------
Let Bₙ = m.  
Then 25m ≤ Pₙ ≤ 25(m+1) – 1  (because ⌊0.04Pₙ⌋ = m).

For Iₙ = 1 we need ⌊0.03Pₙ⌋ = m – 1, i.e.  

( m‑1 )/0.03 ≤ Pₙ < m/0.03
⇒ 33⅓(m–1) ≤ Pₙ < 33⅓ m.

So we need the two intervals to overlap:

25m ≤ P ≤ 25(m+1)–1                        (1)  
33⅓(m–1) ≤ P ≤ 33⅓m – 1                 (2)

Their overlap exists only if  

33⅓(m–1) ≤ 25(m+1) – 1.

Solving:

33⅓m – 33⅓ ≤ 25m + 24  
8⅓m ≤ 57⅓  
m ≤ 6.

Hence Iₙ = 1 is possible only for m = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.  
For our colony (which never drops below 75), the relevant cases are

m = 4  ⇒ P in 100–124  
m = 5  ⇒ P in 134–149  
m = 6  ⇒ P in 167–174.

After P ≥ 175 the difference of the floors can never again equal 1.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Follow the actual population path.
-------------------------------------------------
Start: P₁ = 100.

a) 100–124 : I = 1.  
Increment by 1 for 25 years → after year 25 we reach P = 124.

b) 125–133 : I = 2.  
Increment by 2 for 5 years → after year 30 we reach P = 135.

c) 135–149 : I = 1.  
Increment by 1 for 15 years → after year 45 we reach P = 150.

d) 150–166 : I = 2.  
Increment by 2 for 9 years → after year 54 we reach P = 168.  
(We skipped 167 because we were moving in steps of 2.)

e) 168–174 : I = 1.  
Increment by 1 for 7 years → after year 61 we reach P = 175.

-------------------------------------------------
3.  What happens after P = 175?
-------------------------------------------------
For P ≥ 175 we have m ≥ 7, and we have already proved that I ≠ 1 for such m.  
Indeed, beginning with P = 175 the possible increments are 2, 3, … but never 1.

Therefore the population increases by exactly one person for the last time in year 61.

102,"If 125207 is ""Hi"", and 031993121212 is ""Dude"", then 125207031993121212 is ""Hi Dude"".
Then what is 799717777010909230151693122001983?",,"We look at the training pairs.

125207  → “Hi”
031993121212 → “Dude”

Notice that 125207 is six digits, so we try grouping into 3‑digit blocks:
   125  207
and likewise
   031  993  121  212

Now check what happens if we sum the three digits in each block:

125 → 1+2+5 = 8 → 8th letter = H  
207 → 2+0+7 = 9 → 9th letter = I  

031 → 0+3+1 = 4 → 4th letter = D  
993 → 9+9+3 = 21 → 21st letter = U  
121 → 1+2+1 = 4 → D  
212 → 2+1+2 = 5 → E  

The rule is therefore:
• Split the long number into 3‑digit chunks.  
• Add the digits in each chunk.  
• Convert the sum (1–26) to its alphabet position.

Now decode 799717777010909230151693122001983:

799  717  777  010  909  230  151  693  122  001  983

Add the digits and translate:

799 → 7+9+9 = 25 → Y  
717 → 7+1+7 = 15 → O  
777 → 7+7+7 = 21 → U  
010 → 0+1+0 = 1  → A  
909 → 9+0+9 = 18 → R

103,"Two aging mathematics professors, Al Gebra and Cal Culus were sitting at their favourite Thai restaurant, Phun Kshuns, reminiscing about when they first met, while their waiter, Theo Rumsanrools (who also took Professor Gebra's Advanced Mathematics course at Cart Eshian University) eavesdropped on their conversation as he brought them their meals.
""You know what occurred to me the other day, Cal?"" asked Professor Gebra.
""What's that?"" said Professor Culus.
""Well, when we met, the square of your age contained the same three digits as the square of my age, just in a different order,"" Professor Gebra continued.
""This will really blow your socks off then, Al! If you take the square of the sum of our ages when we met and split it into two 2-digit numbers, you'd have my age then and your age now!"" Professor Culus exclaimed.
Wanting to impress his professor, Theo interjected.
""I thought you were much younger than that, Professor Gebra,"" Theo said.
Said Professor Gebra, ""And just how old am I then, young fellow?""",,"Let  

 x = Professor Gebra’s age when they first met,  
 y = Professor Culus’s age when they first met,  
 n = years that have passed since that meeting (so Gebra is now x + n years old).

1.  “The square of your age contained the same three digits as the square of my age.”  
 So x² and y² are 3–digit numbers which are anagrams of each other.

 Among the 3–digit squares (10² = 100 to 31² = 961) the only anagrammatic pairs are  

  12² = 144 and 21² = 441  
  13² = 169, 14² = 196, 31² = 961  
  16² = 256 and 25² = 625

2.  “If you take the square of the sum of our ages when we met and split it into two 2–digit numbers, you’d have my age then and your age now.”  

 Hence (x + y)² is a 4–digit number whose first two digits are y and whose last two digits are x + n.  
 Algebraically: (x + y)² = 100·y + (x + n)  with 10 ≤ y ≤ 99, 10 ≤ x + n ≤ 99.  
 Thus n = (x + y)² − 100y − x must be a non‑negative integer.

3.  Test the three candidate pairs:

 a) (x, y) = (12, 21) → (x + y)² = 33² = 1089; first two digits 10 ≠ 21 ✗  
 b) (x, y) = (13, 14), (14, 13), (13, 31), … All give either a 3–digit square or wrong first two digits ✗  
 c) (x, y) = (16, 25) → 41² = 1681; first two digits 16 = y ✔  

 Now CD = 81, so x + n = 81 ⇒ n = 81 − 25 = 56 (non‑negative and x + n is two‑digit).  
 Everything is consistent:

  • Ages when they met: Gebra 25, Culus 16.  
  • Squares: 25² = 625 and 16² = 256 (same digits).  
  • Sum of ages then: 41, whose square 1681 splits as 16 | 81 = (Culus’s age then) | (Gebra’s age now).

 This is the only pair that works.

Therefore Professor Al Gebra is now 81 years old.

104,"Kurt & Rod were hanging around the window at school munching the last of their Rnkfurers hoard.  They spotted their neighbor lounging in the enclosed courtyard, looking hungry.

105,"A man is standing on a rock in the middle of a circular lake of radius 1. There is a tiger on the shore of the lake that can run four times as fast you can swim, however the tiger cannot swim. The tiger is hungry and always attempts to keep the distance between the two of you at a minimum. How can you safely swim to shore?
Assume that as long as you can get to the shore before the tiger gets to you (even if it is only a split-second before), you will be safe.",,"Let  

 v = your swimming speed  
 4v = the tiger’s running speed  

Because the lake’s radius is 1, the tiger’s maximum angular speed while it runs round the bank is  

 ωt = (4v)/1 = 4v  radians per unit time.

If you are at distance r from the centre and you swim purely tangentially, your angular speed is  

 ωs = v / r .

1.  Gaining an angular lead  
   If r < ¼ then  
  ωs = v/r > 4v = ωt .  
   Hence, while you stay inside the circle of radius ¼ you can rotate round the centre faster than the tiger can follow; the angular separation between you and the tiger can be made as large as you like.

2.  The set‑up  
   Start at the rock (the centre).  
   Swim inside the small circle r = ¼, choosing your direction so that you drive the tiger round the shore until it is diametrically opposite some point P on the bank – the point at which you intend to land.  
   Because you are inside r = ¼, the tiger cannot keep the same bearing on you; after at most one full circuit you can make the angular separation exactly π radians (180°).

3.  The dash to shore  
   When you are on the radius that ends at P and exactly ¼ from the centre, turn and swim straight to P.

   • Distance you must cover: 1 − ¼ = ¾.  
     Time you need: Ts = (¾)/v.

   • The tiger must run at least half the circumference (an arc of length π) to reach P.  
     Time the tiger needs: Tt = π/(4v).

   Compare the two times:  

  Ts = 0.75/v   Tt = π/(4v) ≈ 0.7854/v.

   Since 0.75 < 0.7854, you arrive a fraction of a second before the tiger.

4.  Safety  
   You step onto the shore at P just before the tiger reaches the same point, so you are safe.

In summary:  
• Stay within the circle of radius ¼, circling until the tiger is on the opposite side of the lake from your intended landing point.  
• From radius ¼ swim straight to the bank; you beat the tiger because your remaining swim takes less time than the tiger’s half‑circumference sprint.

106,Justin has a bag of marbles and nine friends.  He gives Mike exactly 1/2 of the marbles.  He gives Paul exactly 1/3 of the remaining marbles.  He gives Dave exactly 1/4 of the remaining marbles.  He gives Bert exactly 1/5 of the remaining marbles.  He gives Kyle exactly 1/6 of the remaining marbles.  He gives Andy 1/7 of the remaining marbles.  He gives Rick 1/8 of the remaining marbles.  He gives Fred 1/9 of the remaining marbles.  He gives Will 1/10 of the remaining marbles.  What is the smallest quantity of marbles that Justin still has in the bag?,,"Let  

N₀  = number of marbles Justin starts with,  
N₁  = number left after giving to Mike,  
N₂  = number left after giving to Paul,  
… ,  
N₉  = number left after giving to Will (this is the amount we want).

1.  Track the amount left after each gift.

   Each time Justin gives the stated fraction, he keeps the complementary fraction.

   Mike : keeps 1 – 1/2 = 1/2 of what he had → N₁ = (1/2)N₀  
   Paul : keeps 1 – 1/3 = 2/3 of what he has → N₂ = (2/3)N₁  
   Dave : keeps 1 – 1/4 = 3/4 of what he has → N₃ = (3/4)N₂  
   …  
   Will : keeps 1 – 1/10 = 9/10 of what he has → N₉ = (9/10)N₈  

   Multiply all the “kept” fractions:

   (1/2)(2/3)(3/4)(4/5)(5/6)(6/7)(7/8)(8/9)(9/10)  
   = 1/10   (everything cancels telescopically)

   Therefore   N₉ = (1/10)N₀.

2.  Work out the divisibility requirements.

   For each gift, the number of marbles given away must be an integer.

   • Mike: N₀ must be divisible by 2.  
   • Paul: N₁ = N₀/2 must be divisible by 3  ⇒ N₀ divisible by 2·3 = 6.  
   • Dave: N₂ = N₀/3 must be divisible by 4 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 3·4 = 12.  
   • Bert: N₃ = N₀/4 must be divisible by 5 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 4·5 = 20.  
   • Kyle: N₄ = N₀/5 must be divisible by 6 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 5·6 = 30.  
   • Andy: N₅ = N₀/6 must be divisible by 7 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 6·7 = 42.  
   • Rick: N₆ = N₀/7 must be divisible by 8 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 7·8 = 56.  
   • Fred: N₇ = N₀/8 must be divisible by 9 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 8·9 = 72.  
   • Will: N₈ = N₀/9 must be divisible by 10 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 9·10 = 90.

   Thus N₀ must be divisible by every number  
   2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90.

   The least common multiple of those numbers is the least possible N₀.

   Prime–factorise them:

   2          = 2  
   6          = 2·3  
   12         = 2²·3  
   20         = 2²·5  
   30         = 2·3·5  
   42         = 2·3·7  
   56         = 2³·7  
   72         = 2³·3²  
   90         = 2·3²·5  

   Take the highest power of each prime appearing:

   2³, 3², 5¹, 7¹  ⇒  8·9·5·7 = 2520.

   So the smallest possible starting total is N₀ = 2520.

3.  Find the smallest possible remainder.

   N₉ = (1/10)N₀ = 2520 / 10 = 252.

107,"Arrogant Arnold and Witty Will are brothers. One day, they were going from New Jersey to Florida. Bored, they decided to ask each other brain teasers. After a while, they got bored with this, so Arnold decided to place a bet. He would ask Will one teaser, which he thought was very hard. If Will got it right, Arnold would clean his room for the rest of the year. However, if Will got it WRONG, he would have to clean Arnold's room for a year and do his dishes for a month. After thinking for a while, Will agreed to this. This was Arnold's teaser:
Use each digit 1-9 only once each, so that one number multiplied by another equals the third. One example is 12*483=5796. Name at least one more!!!
Being witty as his name suggests, Will easily answered this. The question is, can you find one?","1) They can't be -12*483=-5796, 1.2*48.3=57.96, etc.
2) The third number in another possibility is also 5796.","Below is one systematic way to hunt for a solution, ending in a correct example.

1.  We look for a product of a 2‑digit number and a 3‑digit number, because  
    2‑digit × 3‑digit is naturally a 4‑digit number, giving us the required total of nine digits (2+3+4 = 9).

2.  All nine symbols 1–9 must appear exactly once, so every candidate pair of factors must already have five different digits.  The remaining four digits must then appear, without repetition, in the product.

3.  A quick divisibility test helps cut the search space:  
        (sum of digits 1–9) = 45 ≡ 0 (mod 9).  
    Therefore the product itself must be divisible by 9.  In other words, the 4‑digit product must have digit‑sum 9, 18, 27 or 36.

4.  Start with a small 2‑digit number that has no repeated digits and does not contain 0 or 5 (because 0 is forbidden and 5 in a factor often forces a 0 or 5 in the product’s last digit, which we want to avoid).  
    Take 39.

5.  Choose a 3‑digit companion whose digits are disjoint from {3,9}.  
    Pick 186 (digits {1,8,6}); so far we have five different digits {1,3,6,8,9}.

6.  Compute the product:  
        39 × 186 = 7 2 5 4.

7.  Check the digits now used:  
        factors : 3,9,1,8,6  
        product : 7,2,5,4  
        Total   : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 — each exactly once!

Thus we have a completely valid solution.

Steps:  
1. Creative – Restrict the search to expressions of the type “2-digit × 3-digit = 4-digit,” since 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 distinct digits fits the problem’s requirement.  

2. Rudimentary – Note that the two factors must already contribute five different digits, so the remaining four digits will have to appear (without repetition) in the product.  

3. Creative – Apply the fact that the overall digit-sum 1+2+…+9 = 45 is a multiple of 9; hence the 4-digit product must itself be divisible by 9, narrowing the search to products whose digit-sum is 9, 18, 27, or 36.  

4. Rudimentary – Pick a convenient 2-digit number with distinct non-zero, non-5 digits; choose 39.

108,"In the equation FORTY+TEN+TEN=SIXTY, each letter represents a different digit. Can you figure out which letter is which digit?",Start from the last digits.,"Step–by–step reasoning

1.  Write the addition in columns.

              F  O  R  T  Y
                 T  E  N
                 T  E  N
          ----------------
              S  I  X  T  Y

   Carries from right to left will be called c₁ , c₂ , c₃ , c₄.

2.  Units column  
    Y + N + N = Y  + 10 c₁  → 2N = 10 c₁.  
    Hence N = 0 and c₁ = 0 (the only digit for which 2N = 0 or 10).

3.  Tens column  
    T + E + E + c₁ = T (mod 10)  
    ⇒ 2E ≡ 0 (mod 10) → 2E = 0, 10, 20.  
    E cannot be 0 (already used by N); 2E = 10 gives E = 5.  
    Then T + 2E = T + 10, so c₂ = 1.

4.  Hundreds column  
    R + T + T + c₂ = X + 10 c₃  
    ⇒ R + 2T + 1 = X + 10 c₃.           (1)

5.  Thousands column  
    O + c₃ = I + 10 c₄.                 (2)

6.  Ten‑thousands column  
    F + c₄ = S.                         (3)

7.  Examine c₃.

    • If c₃ = 0, equation (2) forces O = I, impossible (digits must differ).  
    • If c₃ = 1, then (2) gives I = O + 1 (c₄ = 0).  Equation (3) would give S = F, also impossible.  
    • Therefore c₃ = 2.

8.  With c₃ = 2, equation (1) is  
    R + 2T + 1 = X + 20  ⇒  X = R + 2T – 19,  and 19 ≤ R + 2T ≤ 27.      (4)

9.  Still with c₃ = 2, equation (2) is  
    O + 2 = I + 10 c₄.

    • If O + 2 < 10, c₄ = 0, giving S = F again (from (3)); impossible.  
    • Hence O + 2 ≥ 10, so c₄ = 1 and I = O − 8.

    The only digit that works is O = 9, giving I = 1 (both unused so far) and c₄ = 1.

10.  Equation (3) now reads F + 1 = S; thus S = F + 1.

11.  Collect what we have:

    N = 0,  E = 5,  O = 9,  I = 1,
    c₁ = 0, c₂ = 1, c₃ = 2, c₄ = 1.

    Unused digits so far: 2,3,4,6,7,8.

12.  Use (4).  Try the allowed digits for T (not 0 or 5 or 9 or 1):

    Take T = 8  →  2T = 16.  Then R must satisfy 19 ≤ R + 16 ≤ 27, i.e. 3 ≤ R ≤ 11.
    Possible R (distinct and unused): 6 or 7.

    • If R = 6,  X = 6 + 16 – 19 = 3 (unused).  
      Unused digits left: 2,4,7.  
      But F must be one of these and S = F + 1 must also be unused; none work.

    • If R = 7,  X = 7 + 16 – 19 = 4 (unused).  
      Unused digits left: 2,3,6.  
      Choose F = 2 ⇒ S = 3 (both unused).  
      The only digit still free is Y = 6.

    All digits are now distinct and every digit 0–9 is used exactly once:

      F=2, O=9, R=7, T=8, Y=6,
      E=5, N=0, S=3, I=1, X=4.

13.  Check:

          2 9 7 8 6
          +    8 5 0
          +    8 5 0

They meet every 30 s, so one relative lap (1800 m) is covered in 30 s:

110,A man has nine children born at regular intervals. The sum of the square of their ages is equal to the square of his own age. What are the ages of his children?,,"Let  

 k = the common interval between successive births (in years),  
 x = the age of the youngest child (in years),  
 F = the father’s age (in years).

The children’s ages therefore form the arithmetic progression  
x, x+k, x+2k, … ,x+8k .  

The statement says that the sum of the squares of these nine ages equals the square of the father’s age:

 F² = Σ_{i=0}^{8} (x + ik)².

1.  Evaluate the sum of squares.  
 Σ_{i=0}^{8} (x + ik)²  
 = Σ (x² + 2xk i + k² i²)  
 = 9x² + 2xk Σ i + k² Σ i²  
 = 9x² + 2xk·36 + k²·204  
 = 9x² + 72xk + 204k².

 Hence F² = 9x² + 72xk + 204k². (1)

2.  Reduce the equation by introducing t = x/k (a positive rational number):

 F² = k² ( 9t² + 72t + 204 ) = k² f(t) with f(t)=9t²+72t+204. (2)

 For F to be integral, f(t) must itself be a perfect square.  Set

 f(t) = m² with m ∈ ℕ. (3)

3.  Solve 9t² + 72t + 204 = m² for rational t.

 9t² + 72t + (204 − m²) = 0.

        = 5184 − 36(204 − m²)  
        = 36(m² − 60).

 For t to be rational, D must be a perfect square, say D = (6ℓ)².  
 Thus m² − 60 = ℓ² ⇒ m² − ℓ² = 60 ⇒ (m − ℓ)(m + ℓ) = 60. (4)

 The two factors on the right must have the same parity.  
 Possible even factor pairs of 60 are (2, 30) and (6, 10).

 •  (m − ℓ, m + ℓ) = (2, 30)  ⇒  m = 16, ℓ = 14.  
 •  (m − ℓ, m + ℓ) = (6, 10) ⇒  m = 8,  ℓ = 2 (gives negative t).

 Hence the only positive‑t solution is m = 16.

4.  Find t.

 Using D = (6ℓ)² with ℓ = 14:

 t = [−72 ± 6ℓ]/(2·9) = [−72 ± 84]/18.

 The positive root gives t = 12/18 = 2/3. (5)

5.  Recover x and k.

 t = x/k = 2/3  ⇒  x = 2k/3.

 x must be integral, so k must be a multiple of 3.  Write k = 3s (s ∈ ℕ); then

111,"Mad Ade was visiting his friend, computer tycoon and Olympic Kebab hurling champion, Mike Rohsopht.
He was there on Sunday and when the radio gave the time at the hour, Mad Ade noticed that the Madadian antique clock, designed by Madadian clock maker Arthur Minit (teaser #4891) was exactly 3 minutes slow.
""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Mike assured Mad Ade that his treasured Arthur Minit clock had not been adjusted nor fixed since his last visit.
What day of the week was Mad Ade's second visit?",,"Let the first visit be our time origin.  
At that moment (a Sunday, exactly on the radio “pip‑pip‑pip, it’s *n* o’clock”),  

• the real time = 0 minutes  
• the Arthur Minit clock = –3 minutes (it is 3 min slow).  

The clock loses 7 min every real hour, i.e. it runs at  

    rate  =  60 – 7  minutes per real 60 minutes  
           =  53/60 of real time.

Hence after n real hours

    time shown by the clock   =  53n  minutes,
    real elapsed time         =  60n  minutes,
    error                     =  53n – 60n – 3
                              = –7n – 3  minutes.            (1)

For the clock to look “dead right” again the two dials must agree, and on a
12‑hour dial that means the error must be an integral multiple of 12 hours
(720 min):

        –7n – 3  =  –720k        (k = 1,2,3,…).              (2)

Because the second observation is also made exactly on the hour,
n itself must be an integer.

Solve the diophantine equation (2):

        7n + 3 = 720k.                                    (3)

Since gcd(7, 720)=1, 7 has a modular inverse mod 720; 7·103 = 721 ≡ 1 (mod 720).
Multiply (3) by 103:

        n ≡ 103·(720k – 3)  ≡ 103·(–3) ≡ –309 ≡ 411 (mod 720).

The smallest positive solution is n = 411 hours.  
Substituting in (3): 7·411 + 3 = 2880 = 720·4, so k = 4.  
Thus the first moment when the clock is “dead right” again occurs after

        411 hours = 17 days and 3 hours.

Now count the days of the week:

        Sunday + 14 days = Sunday
        Sunday + 17 days = Wednesday

(The extra 3 hours merely changes the time of day, not the weekday,
unless the first observation had been after 21:00, which would contradict
the statement that the second occasion was “rather late in the evening”.)

Hence Mad Ade’s second visit took place on a

112,"Pretend you have two faucets for your shower, one that releases hot water and one that releases cold water, but at varying pressures.  If the hot water is 105 degrees Fahrenheit and the cold water is 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and you could rotate the faucet at most 360 degrees, how much would you have to rotate the cold water faucet to get the temperature to be 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, if the hot water is turned on all the way, and could not be turned down?",Add how much you've rotated each and divide by the total rotation to get the average temperature.,"Let  

Th = 105 °F   (temperature of the hot supply)  
Tc = 45 °F    (temperature of the cold supply)  

Assumptions usually made for this kind of “two‑handle” problem  
1. Each faucet delivers a flow rate proportional to how far it is opened.  
2. Fully opening either faucet (a 360° turn) gives the same maximum flow rate.  

Take the hot faucet to be fully open, giving a (normalized) flow rate  
H = 1 unit / s.  

If the cold handle is turned θ degrees (0 ≤ θ ≤ 360), its flow rate is  

C = (θ / 360°) · 1  = θ/360   (units / s).  

The mixed temperature T is the flow‑weighted average  

T = ( H·Th + C·Tc ) / ( H + C ).  

Set T = 98.6 °F and solve for θ:

(1·105 + (θ/360)·45) / (1 + θ/360) = 98.6  
⇒ 105 + 45 θ/360 = 98.6 + 98.6 θ/360  
⇒ 105 − 98.6 = (98.6 − 45) θ/360  
⇒ 6.4 = 53.6 θ/360  
⇒ θ/360 = 6.4 / 53.6 = 8/67 ≈ 0.1194  
⇒ θ = 360·(8/67) = 2880/67 ≈ 42.99°.

So you need to open the cold‑water faucet by about 43 degrees, i.e. roughly 1/8 of a full turn.

Denote  
S = x + y (the three–digit sum)  
P = xy  (the three–digit product)  

Because the product is the reversal of the sum,

S = 100a + 10b + c  ( a, b, c are the decimal digits, a≠0 ),  
P = 100c + 10b + a.                                         (1)

The numbers x and y are the roots of

t² – S t + P = 0 .

Hence the discriminant must be a perfect square:

D = S² – 4P = d²,  d ∈ ℕ.                                (2)

Since P ≤ 999, equation (2) implies

S² – d² = 4P ≤ 3996  ⇒  S – d = t ≤ 20,             (3)

so let d = S – t with 1 ≤ t ≤ 20 (t is small).

Substituting d = S – t in (2):

t(2S – t) = 4P.                                           (4)

Now go through the twenty possible values of t; for all odd t
the left‐hand side is ≡ 2S – 1 (mod 4) and can never be divisible by 4,
so only even t have to be checked.

t = 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 each lead, after inserting
(1) in (4), to a linear diophantine equation that has no digit
solutions.  

The only viable value is t = 4.

t = 4:

Equation (4) gives P = 2S – 4.                           (5)

Insert (1) in (5):

2(100a + 10b + c) – 4 = 100c + 10b + a  
⇔ 199a + 10b – 98c = 4.                                  (6)

Because 0 ≤ b ≤ 9, equation (6) requires
0 ≤ 10b = 4 – 199a + 98c ≤ 90.

Testing 0 ≤ a ≤ 9 and 0 ≤ c ≤ 9, the only triple of digits
satisfying (6) is

a = 4, b = 9, c = 9.

Therefore

S = 100·4 + 10·9 + 9 = 499,  P = 100·9 + 10·9 + 4 = 994.

d = S – t = 499 – 4 = 495,  
x = (S + d)/2 = (499 + 495)/2 = 497,  
y = (S – d)/2 = (499 – 495)/2 =   2.

Verification  
x + y = 497 + 2 = 499,

114,"12 is an abundant number, because the sum of its proper divisors: 1+2+3+4+6=16, and this is larger than the number itself. However, you will notice that 1+2+3+6=12.
A weird number is an abundant number, n, for which no subset of its proper divisors adds to n. What is the smallest weird number?",They are very rare indeed. The smallest is somewhere between 50 and 100.,"We need a number n that satisfies two simultaneous conditions  
  
1. n is abundant: the sum σ(n) of its proper divisors exceeds n.  
2. n is not pseudoperfect: no subset of its proper divisors adds up to n.  
Such a number is called weird.  We must find the least one.

Step 1.  List all abundant numbers below 70.  
A quick divisor–sum check gives the complete list

12, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 66.

Step 2.  Verify that each of these is pseudoperfect (i.e. has a subset
adding to itself).

12  = 1+2+3+6  
18  = 9+6+3  
20  = 10+5+4+1  
24  = 12+8+4  
30  = 15+10+5  
36  = 18+12+6  
40  = 20+10+8+2  
42  = 21+14+7  
48  = 24+16+8  
54  = 27+18+9  
56  = 28+14+8+4+2  
60  = 30+20+10  
66  = 33+22+11  

Hence every abundant number below 70 is NOT weird.

Step 3.  Examine 70.

Its proper divisors are  
1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35;  their sum is

1+2+5+7+10+14+35 = 74 > 70,

so 70 is abundant.

We must show no subset of these divisors totals 70.

• If 35 were in the subset, the remaining divisors would have to supply 35 more.  
  The largest attainable sum with 1,2,5,7,10,14 is  
  14+10+7+5+2+1 = 39;  none of its sub‑sums equals 35, so 35 cannot be used.

• Omitting 35, the sum of all the remaining divisors is only 39, far short of 70.

Therefore no subset of proper divisors of 70 can equal 70, so 70 is weird.

Step 4.  Because every abundant number below 70 is pseudoperfect and 70 itself is weird, 70 is the smallest weird number.

In the ritual, each arm of a male links with an arm of a female, no male-female pair of robots linking more than once. The minimum number of robots required to link all arms once only is the number belonging to that tribe.

116,"Mad Ade's kids, Mad Ade junior and little Miss Mad Ade were going to cut the grass on their square lawn, while their dad was out buying a bumper family sized kebab with extra grease. They agreed that each should cut one-half of the area. Junior went first, and cut a border 2 metres wide all the way around.
After doing a few sums, Little Miss agreed that exactly one-half had been cut and happily cut the rest.
What was the area of the lawn?",,"Let the lawn be a square of side L metres.

After Junior mows a 2‑metre‑wide strip right round the edge, the part still uncut is the inner square of side L – 4 metres.

Border (mown) area = total area – inner area  
         = L² – (L – 4)²

We are told this border area is exactly one‑half of the total area:

L² – (L – 4)² = ½ L²

Expand and simplify:

L² – [L² – 8L + 16] = ½ L²  
8L – 16 = ½ L²  
Multiply by 2: 16L – 32 = L²  
Re‑arrange:   L² – 16L + 32 = 0

Solve the quadratic:

L = [16 ± √(16² – 4·32)] / 2  
  = [16 ± √128] / 2  
  = [16 ± 8√2] / 2  
  = 8 ± 4√2

The minus sign gives L < 4 m, impossible because the border alone is 4 m across, so take

L = 8 + 4√2 metres

Total area of the lawn:

A = L² = (8 + 4√2)²  
  = 64 + 64√2 + 32

117,"What is the largest number of pieces you can form with n straight cuts of a pizza?
The pieces do not need to be of equal size.",,"Let P(n) denote the greatest possible number of pizza pieces that can be obtained with n straight cuts.  
We want a formula for P(n).

1.  Begin with no cuts.  
    P(0) = 1 (the whole pizza).

2.  What happens when we add the (k + 1)-st cut?  
    • Arrange the new cut so that it is not parallel to any previous cut and no three cuts meet at one point.  
    • Under this “best–possible” arrangement the new cut meets every one of the k existing cuts in a distinct interior point of the pizza.  
    • So it is divided into k + 1 separate line‐segments.  
    • Each such segment lies in a previously existing piece, and every time the segment crosses the boundary of that piece it splits it into two.  
      Hence the new cut creates exactly k + 1 new pieces.

3.  Recurrence.  
    Therefore  
        P(k + 1) = P(k) + (k + 1).

4.  Solve the recurrence.  
        P(0)=1  
        P(1)=1+1=2  
        P(2)=2+2=4  
        P(3)=4+3=7

5.  Result.

The following are not zingers:

Zingers: 9, 57, 41, 89, 33, 17  
Non‑zingers: 2, 8, 59, 13, 68, 36  

Step 1 – Test divisibility by small integers  
• Squares? 9 is, others aren’t → no.  
• Primes? Some are, some aren’t → no.  

Step 2 – Look at remainders when divided by small integers (modular arithmetic).  
Check “mod 8”, because 8 is a common small modulus that quickly separates numbers:

 9 ÷ 8 = 1 R 1 → remainder 1  
 57 ÷ 8 = 7 R 1 → remainder 1  
 41 ÷ 8 = 5 R 1 → remainder 1  
 89 ÷ 8 = 11 R 1 → remainder 1  
 33 ÷ 8 = 4 R 1 → remainder 1  
 17 ÷ 8 = 2 R 1 → remainder 1  

All zingers leave remainder 1 when divided by 8.

Now check the non‑zingers:

 2 ÷ 8 = 0 R 2 → remainder 2  
 8 ÷ 8 = 1 R 0 → remainder 0  
 59 ÷ 8 = 7 R 3 → remainder 3  
 13 ÷ 8 = 1 R 5 → remainder 5  
 68 ÷ 8 = 8 R 4 → remainder 4  
 36 ÷ 8 = 4 R 4 → remainder 4  

None of the non‑zingers give remainder 1.  

Therefore the defining property is:

A “zinger” is an integer that is exactly one more than a multiple of 8; equivalently, a number congruent to 1 modulo 8.

Symbolically: n is a zinger ⇔ n ≡ 1 (mod 8).

The required property is  

(10a + b) + (10c + d) = 10b + c.                (1)

Simplify (1):

10a + b + 10c + d = 10b + c  
10a – 9b + 9c + d = 0  
10a + d = 9(b – c).                              (2)

Observation from (2)
• 10a + d is positive, so b > c (the right‐hand side is positive).  
• 10a + d must be a positive multiple of 9 not exceeding 9·9 = 81, because b − c ≤ 9.

Since 10a ≡ a (mod 9), equation (2) implies a + d ≡ 0 (mod 9), i.e.  

d = 9 – a  (for a = 1,…,8).                      (3)

(The case a = 9 gives 10a + d ≥ 90, which is too large.)

Substituting (3) in (2):

   The two‑digit multiples of 7 that start with 4 are 42 and 49.
   – FG = 42 gives G = 2, but then GH = 26, which is not divisible by 8 ⇒ reject.
   – FG = 49 gives G = 9. Accept.

5. GH must be divisible by 8 with G = 9, so GH can be 96 (since 92 is not a multiple of 8).
   ⇒ H = 6 and GH = 96 is valid.

6. The even digits left for B and D are 2 and 8.

7. HI must be divisible by 9 with H = 6.
   6+I ≡ 0 (mod 9) ⇒ I = 3.

8. Remaining unused digits: 1,2,7,8.  
   Positions left: A, B, C, D with B and D even.

   Case 1: B = 2, D = 8  
           BC ( = 2C ) must be divisible by 3 → C = 1 or 7 work (21 or 27),  
           but CD ( = C8 ) must be divisible by 4 → neither 18 nor 78 is, so no solution.

   Case 2: B = 8, D = 2  
           BC ( = 8C ) divisible by 3 → C = 1 (81) or C = 7 (87) both work.  
           CD ( = C2 ) divisible by 4 → 12 and 72 are both multiples of 4.  
           Hence two possibilities:

124,"I have a machine which has four cog wheels in constant mesh. The largest cog has 242 teeth and the others have 160, 64 and 22 respectively. How many revolutions must the largest cog make before each of the cogs is back in its starting position?",,"When two gears mesh, the numbers of teeth that pass the point of contact are equal, so

(teeth on gear A) × (revolutions of gear A)  
= (teeth on gear B) × (revolutions of gear B).

Let the four wheels be W₁, W₂, W₃, W₄ with teeth  
T₁ = 242, T₂ = 160, T₃ = 64, T₄ = 22.

Let R be the required number of revolutions made by the largest wheel W₁.  
Because every pair is in simple external mesh, the train ratio from W₁ to any other wheel is just the ratio of their teeth, so the revolutions of each wheel are

W₂ : R·T₁/T₂ = R·242/160 = R·121/80  
W₃ : R·T₁/T₃ = R·242/64  = R·121/32  
W₄ : R·T₁/T₄ = R·242/22  = 11R.

For every wheel to be back in its initial orientation, each of these numbers has to be an integer.

Thus R must make both fractions R·121/80 and R·121/32 integral.  
Since 121 and 80 are coprime, 80 | R.  
Since 121 and 32 are coprime, 32 | R.

The least common multiple of 80 and 32 is  
LCM(80, 32) = 2⁵·5 = 160.

Taking R = 160 makes the other wheels turn

W₂ : 160·121/80  = 242 whole revolutions,  
W₃ : 160·121/32  = 605 whole revolutions,

Each man travels at their own constant rate.",The bicycle may be left at any point along the bridge and may be ridden in either direction. Every man should finish at the same time.,"Let the length of the bridge be 1 unit.

Speeds

B (walking) = 1/5   bridge / min  
C (walking) = 1/2   bridge / min  
Bicycle             = 1      bridge / min  

Denote by tA , tB , tC (≥0) the total times each man rides the bicycle.  
During the remaining time each walks at his own rate.

1.  Distance constraints

   B : 0.2·(T – tB) + 1·tB = 1   ⇒ T ≥ 5 – 4 tB  
   C : 0.5·(T – tC) + 1·tC = 1   ⇒ T ≥ 2 – tC  

2.  Bicycle resource constraint  
   tA + tB + tC ≤ T    (only one man can ride at a time).

Because C can cross in 2 minutes on foot, for any T ≥ 2 we may choose tC = 0.  
Hence only A and B need bicycle time.

For a target finishing time T the minimal bicycle times that allow A and B to make it are  

    tA = (10 – T)/9,   tB = (5 – T)/4.       (1)

They are both non‑negative when T ≤ 5.  
Insert (1) into the resource constraint:

     (10 – T)/9 + (5 – T)/4 ≤ T
     ⇔ 85 – 13T ≤ 36T
     ⇔ 49 ≤ 13T
     ⇔ T ≥ 49/13 ≈ 3.76923 min.

Thus no schedule can get everybody across in less than 49/13 minutes.  
We now show that 49/13 is attainable.

Optimal schedule (time in minutes, distances in bridge lengths)

• 0 – 4/13   B rides the bicycle the first 4/13 of the bridge, leaves it there,
              then walks the rest.

   – At t = 4/13 the bicycle is at position 4/13.

• C simply starts walking at t = 0 and finishes at t = 2.

• A starts walking at t = 0.

   – It takes A 40/13 minutes to reach position 4/13  
      ( distance / speed = (4/13)/(1/10) = 40/13 ).

• 40/13 – 49/13   A now rides the bicycle the remaining 9/13 of the bridge  
                   (time 9/13), reaching the far bank at t = 49/13.

• B after leaving the bicycle walks the remaining 9/13 of the bridge:  
   time = (9/13)/(1/5) = 45/13.  
   Finishing time for B: 4/13 + 45/13 = 49/13.

Finish times  
C : 2 < 49/13  
A : 49/13  
B : 49/13

All are across at t = 49/13 minutes, and the bicycle is used for  
tA + tB = 9/13 + 4/13 = 13/13 = 49/13 minutes, satisfying the resource limit.

Because 49/13 is both a lower bound and is achievable, it is the minimal possible time.

126,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.

128,"Arrange the digits 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, and 9, to form a single fraction that equals 1/2.  (Here is one example that, alas, turns out not to be true:  32145/24690=1/2)",,"We want two multi‑digit numbers that  

• together use the multiset of digits {0,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,9} exactly once, and  
• satisfy  numerator / denominator = 1/2  ⟺  denominator = 2 · numerator.

Denote  
N = numerator (last digit n₀),  
D = denominator = 2N (last digit d₀).

1.  Units digits.  
   For every possible units digit n₀ of N we compute d₀ = 2·n₀ (mod 10) and keep only pairs whose d₀ is an available digit.  
   The available pairs are   
   (1,2), (2,4), (3,6), (5,0), (6,2).  
   We choose the pair (5,0); this uses the unique digits 5 and 0 and immediately makes D even.  
   Thus  
   N = …1 5, D = … 0,  
   and doubling 5 gives 0 with a carry 1 into the tens place.

2.  Tens digits.  
   Let the tens digit of N be d.  We must have

        2d + 1 (carry) = 10·c₁ + j ,

   where j is the tens digit of D and c₁ the carry into the hundreds place.  
   Trying the remaining digits {1,2,2,3,4,4,6,9} gives

        d = 1  →  j = 3,  c₁ = 0   (allowed)  
        d = 4  →  j = 9,  c₁ = 0   (allowed)  
        d = 6  →  j = 3,  c₁ = 1   (allowed)  
        d = 9  →  j = 9,  c₁ = 1   (allowed)

   We adopt the first of these: d = 1, j = 3 (no carry).

3.  Hundreds digits.  
   Let the hundreds digit of N be c.  With no incoming carry we need

        2c = 10·c₂ + k ,

   where k is the hundreds digit of D and c₂ the next carry.  
   From the still unused digits {2,2,4,4,6,9} only

        c = 2  →  k = 4,  c₂ = 0  
        c = 6  →  k = 2,  c₂ = 1

   are possible.  Pick c = 2, k = 4 (no carry).

4.  Thousands digits.  
   Let the thousands digit of N be b.  Again with zero carry:

        2b = 10·c₃ + ℓ ,

   ℓ being the thousands digit of D.  Using digits {2,4,4,6,9} we have

        b = 6  →  ℓ = 2,  c₃ = 1  
        b = 2  →  ℓ = 4,  c₃ = 0

   We choose b = 6, ℓ = 2, creating a carry 1 into the ten‑thousands place.

5.  Ten‑thousands digits.  
   The only digits still unused are {4,9}.  Let a be the ten‑thousands digit of N.  
   With incoming carry 1 we need 2a + 1 < 10 (otherwise D would gain an extra digit), so

        2a + 1 ≤ 9  →  a ≤ 4.

   Therefore a = 4, and the leading digit of D becomes 9.

We have now fixed every digit:

        N = 4 6 2 1 5  =  46215  
        D = 9 2 4 3 0  =  92430.

Double check: 2 · 46215 = 92430, and the digits
0,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,9 appear exactly once across N and D.

Hence the required fraction is 46215 / 92430 = 1/2.

129,"Xavier and Rex were playing a game that involved 5 dice. In each turn, they would roll the 5 dice. Each face of the die is worth a different amount of points. On their first 2 shots, they rolled this:
Xavier 1: 1, 3, 3, 4, 6 = 177 points
Rex 1: 2, 4, 4, 5, 6 = 268 points
Xavier 2: 1, 1, 1, 4, 4 = 203 points
Rex 2: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 = 216 points
Using this information, can you work out how many points Xavier and Rex each got on their third turn and how many points each face is worth?
Xavier 3: 1, 2, 2, 3, 4 = ?
Rex 3: 1, 3, 4, 6, 6 = ?",Xavier scored more than Rex and the difference between the two total scores is 26 points.,"Let the six unknown point–values of the faces  

 1,2,3,4,5,6  

be denoted by  

 a , b , c , d , e , f  (respectively).

From the four rolls we are told

(1) a + 2c + d + f = 177        (Xavier 1)  
(2) b + 2d + e + f = 268        (Rex 1)  
(3) 3a + 2d        = 203        (Xavier 2)  
(4) a + b + c + d + f = 216        (Rex 2)

These are four linear equations in the six unknowns a,b,c,d,e,f.

Solving the four independent equations:

 d = (203 – 3a)/2        (from (3))  
 f = (151 + a)/2 – 2c       (from (1))  
 b = 216 – a – c – d – f     (from (4))  
 e = 52  + a + c – d       (from (2))

Thus every choice of the two variables a (which must be odd and ≤ 67 so that d is a positive integer) and c (any positive integer that keeps f and e positive and makes all six values different) produces a perfectly valid set of face‑values.

For example  
 a=5, c=38 gives (a,b,c,d,e,f) = (5, 77, 38, 94, 1, 2);  
 a=41, c=3 gives (41, 42, 3, 40, 56, 90);  
 a=11, c=35 gives (11, 70, 35, 85, 8, 9);  
and so on.  There are infinitely many such choices.

What about the third rolls?

Xavier 3 uses the faces 1,2,2,3,4; its score is  
 X₃ = a + 2b + c + d = (359 – a + 6c)/2.

Rex 3 uses the faces 1,3,4,6,6; its score is  
 R₃ = a + c + d + 2f = (505 + a – 6c)/2.

Because a and c are still free, X₃ and R₃ are not fixed numbers; they vary with the particular admissible choice of a and c (although their sum is always X₃ + R₃ = 432).

Hence

• the point‑value of each face, and  
• the scores obtained by Xavier and Rex on their third turn

 a = 17.345 km / 10 km = 1.7345 rad (first leg, ≈99.44°)  
 b = 47.124 km / 10 km = 4.7124 rad (second leg, ≈270.00°).

1.  Choose coordinates conveniently.  
    Put the ship at the North Pole S = (0,0,1) on the unit sphere and let the x‑z plane be the meridian on which you start walking.

2.  First leg.  
    After travelling the angle a along that meridian the position is  

        P₁ = (sin a, 0, cos a).

    The (unit) tangent (direction of motion) there is  

        T₁ = (cos a, 0, –sin a),

    pointing southward.

3.  Turn left 90°.  
    “Left” is the vector perpendicular to both P₁ (the local vertical) and T₁ (the direction you were moving).  
    That vector is  

        U = P₁ × T₁ = (0, 1, 0),

    which is due east and has unit length.

4.  Second leg: walk b = 3π/2 ≈ 4.7124 rad along the great circle whose initial point is P₁ and whose initial tangent is U.  
    A great‑circle path with those initial data is

        P(t) = P₁ cos t + U sin t.

    At t = b = 3π/2, cos b = 0 and sin b = –1, so

        P₂ = P₁·0 + U·(–1) = –U = (0, –1, 0).

    Notice that P₂ depends only on U; it is completely independent of a (the length of the first walk).

5.  Distance from the ship.  
    The dot product S·P₂ = (0,0,1)·(0,–1,0) = 0, hence the central angle between S and P₂ is 90° = π/2 rad.

    Great‑circle distance = R · (π/2) = 10 km · π/2 = 5π km ≈ 15.708 km.

(The tiny difference between 47.124 km and the exact 3π/2·10 km = 47.1239 km alters the answer by only a few millimetres, far below any practical relevance.)

1.  How to turn a clock‐time into a number  
   • Put the HOUR hand’s position and the MINUTE hand’s position on a 360° circle (0° at 12, angles increasing clockwise).  
     – Minute hand = 6° × minutes.  
     – Hour hand = 30° × hours + 0.5° × minutes.  
   • Measure the clockwise angle from the hour hand to the minute hand.  
   • That angle, in degrees, is the painting number.

2.  Verify the rule with the given data  
   a) 11 : 00  
      Hour = 11 ⇒ 11·30° = 330°  
      Minute = 00 ⇒ 0°  
      Clockwise from 330° to 0° is (0 − 330) mod 360 = 30°.  → Number 30 ✔  
   b) 4 : 00  
      Hour = 4 ⇒ 4·30° = 120°  
      Minute = 00 ⇒ 0°  
      Clockwise from 120° to 0° is (0 − 120) mod 360 = 240°. → Number 240 ✔  
   c) 7 : 30  
      Hour = 7 ⇒ 7·30° + 30·0.5° = 210° + 15° = 225°  
      Minute = 30 ⇒ 30·6° = 180°  
      Clockwise from 225° to 180° is (180 − 225) mod 360 = 315°. → Number 315 ✔

132,"There is a rubber band that is looped around an immovable steel rod.  It is three inches long.  At the fixed end is a spider.  He starts walking along the rubber band at the rate of one inch per minute.
A minute after he started, the rubber band is stretched by three inches.  The spider continues walking on it at the same rate.
In another minute, the rubber band is stretched another three inches.
This keeps going on until the spider reaches the end of the rubber band.  How long did it take the spider to reach the end?","The spider's position is not changed when the rubber band is stretched, but the total distance of travel does change.","Let  

L₀ = 3 in   (initial length)  
x₀ = 0      (spider’s distance from the fixed end, after the 0‑th stretch)  

Label the moments just after the nth stretch as “time n”.  
At that instant the band–length is  

Lₙ = 3 + 3n = 3(n+1)     (1)

and the spider stands at xₙ inches from the fixed end.

Walking–phase (between the n‑th and (n+1)‑st stretches)  
During this minute the band does not change length and the spider walks 1 inch, so just before the next stretch his distance is xₙ + 1.

Stretching–phase  
The (n+1)‑st stretch lengthens the band from Lₙ to Lₙ₊₁ uniformly, so every distance from the fixed end is multiplied by  

sₙ = Lₙ₊₁ / Lₙ = (3(n+2))/(3(n+1)) = (n+2)/(n+1).  (2)

Hence

xₙ₊₁ = (xₙ + 1) · sₙ = (xₙ + 1) · (n+2)/(n+1).  (3)

Fractional position  
Let fₙ = xₙ / Lₙ (the fraction of the band already covered just after the n‑th stretch).  
Using (1) and (3):

fₙ₊₁ = xₙ₊₁ / Lₙ₊₁
      = (xₙ + 1) / Lₙ               (because the same factor sₙ cancels)
      = fₙ + 1/Lₙ.        (4)

But Lₙ = 3(n+1), so

fₙ₊₁ = fₙ + 1 / [3(n+1)].    (5)

Start with f₀ = 0 and iterate:

fₙ = 1/3 · (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + … + 1/n) = (1/3)·Hₙ ,  (6)

where Hₙ is the nth harmonic number.

When does the spider get to the far end?  
We need the first n for which fₙ ≥ 1.

Compute Hₙ:

H₁ = 1  
H₂ = 1.5  
H₃ = 1.833…  
H₄ = 2.083…  
H₅ = 2.283…  
H₆ = 2.45  
H₇ = 2.593…  
H₈ = 2.718…  
H₉ = 2.829…  
H₁₀ = 2.928968…  
H₁₁ = 3.019877…

Thus

f₁₀ = H₁₀ /3 ≈ 0.976323   (not yet there)  
f₁₁ = H₁₁ /3 ≈ 1.006626   (already past the end).

So the spider finishes during the 11th minute (between 10 and 11 minutes after the start).

Exact finishing time  
After 10 minutes the band length is

L₁₀ = 3(10+1) = 33 inches.

Fraction left to cover:

1 − f₁₀ = 1 − H₁₀/3 = (3 − H₁₀)/3.

Distance left = L₁₀(1 − f₁₀)
              = 33 · (3 − H₁₀)/3
              = 33 − 11H₁₀
              = 33 − 11·(7381/2520)
              = 33 − 81191/2520
              = 1969/2520 in
              ≈ 0.7817 in.

Walking 1 inch per minute, the remaining time is

t_remaining = 1969/2520 min ≈ 0.7817 min ≈ 46.9 s.

Total time

T = 10 min + 1969/2520 min = 27169/2520 min ≈ 10.78 min

133,"A postman delivered letters every day. On the first day he delivered one letter, on the second day he delivered three letters, on the third day he delivered five letters, and so on. Each day from the second on he delivered two letters more than the preceding day.
The day he retired, he noticed that he had delivered a total of more than 100,000 letters.
Something fun is that the total number of letters he had delivered has its digits arranged in ascending order.
How many days had he worked, and how many letters had he delivered in total?",The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.,"Let the number of days the postman worked be n.

Letters delivered on day k : 1, 3, 5, … , so

Total after n days  
S = 1 + 3 + 5 + … + (2n – 1) = n²  
(the sum of the first n odd numbers).

We need n² > 100 000 and the digits of n² must be in strictly ascending order.

1.  Since n² > 100 000, n ≥ 317 (because 316² = 99 856).  
2.  A 5–digit number cannot exceed 99 999, so n² is a 6–digit number.  
    The largest 6–digit number whose digits are strictly ascending is 456 789  
    (digits 4,5,6,7,8,9).  
    Therefore n² ≤ 456 789, hence n ≤ ⌊√456 789⌋ = 675.

So 317 ≤ n ≤ 675.

3.  For a 6‑digit number to have strictly ascending digits the last digit must be at
    least 6 (otherwise there are not enough smaller digits available).
    But a perfect square can end only in 0,1,4,5,6,9, and 6 is impossible
    (the only ascending 6‑digit number ending in 6 is 123 456, not a square).
    Thus n² must end in 9, so n ends in 3 or 7.

4.  Check the 72 values of n in 317 ≤ n ≤ 675 that end in 3 or 7.

   Doing this (or, equivalently, checking each of the 56 six‑digit ascending
   numbers ending in 9 for being a square) reveals exactly one match:

                n = 367  →  n² = 134 689

   134 689 has digits 1 < 3 < 4 < 6 < 8 < 9, satisfying the ascending condition.

No other n in the required range gives an ascending‑digit square, so the
solution is unique.

1.  Since AB and BC must be two‑digit primes, their units digits (B for AB, C for BC) have to be 1, 3, or 7 (9 is forbidden and 5 would give a multiple of 5).  
   So B ∈ {1,3,7} and C ∈ {1,3,7} with C ≠ B (digits are distinct).

2.  List the possible two‑digit primes of the form BC:

   B=1  →  13, 17  
   B=3  →  31, 37  
   B=7  →  71, 73

   Hence the six viable (B,C) pairs are  
   (1,3), (1,7), (3,1), (3,7), (7,1), (7,3).

3.  For each pair, choose A (≠ B, C, 0, 9) so that AB is prime, and test the three 3‑digit numbers formed from the digits (ABC, descending order, ascending order):

   • (B,C) = (1,3)  
     AB prime requires A1 ∈ {31,41,61,71}.  
     None of (413, 631, 713) passes all tests.

   • (B,C) = (1,7)  
     AB prime requires A1 ∈ {31,41,61,71}.  
     Only A = 6 gives a survivor:  
        ABC = 617  (prime)  
        digits ↑ = 167  (prime)  
        digits ↓ = 761  (prime)  
        AB = 61 (prime),  BC = 17 (prime)  
        All six clues are satisfied.

   • (B,C) = (3,1), (3,7), (7,1), (7,3)

136,"Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?
Comments to triflers:
The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!",There are hints in the comments to triflers and in the title.,"Let  

C = 25   (maximum number of bottles – opened or unopened – that can be on the MoJoPed at one time)  
D = 5 mi (distance to be covered)  
N = 120 (un‑opened bottles available at the Weiss Pavilion = 5 cases × 24)

Every time the machine travels one mile it “uses up’’ one bottle.  
If, at some spot on the road, there are more than C bottles waiting to be taken farther,
the driver has to shuttle: go forward with a load, come back empty (or nearly empty) to get
another load, and so on.  

Suppose k = ⌈n/C⌉ loads are necessary to move the n bottles that are at one place
one mile farther along the road.  
For the first k–1 loads Bu must drive that mile forward and the same mile back,
using 2 bottles per load, while the last load is driven forward once,
using 1 bottle.  So the absolute minimum fuel that can be burnt to move
all n bottles one mile is

               2(k – 1) + 1 = 2k – 1 bottles.

That figure gives a lower bound; if we can design a plan that actually attains that bound,
it is optimal.

------------------------------------------------
1.  From 120 bottles down to 100 bottles
------------------------------------------------
With 120 bottles we need k = ⌈120/25⌉ = 5 loads,
so the least possible fuel consumption per mile is 2·5 – 1 = 9 bottles.
To get the stock down to 100 bottles we must burn 20 bottles.
At 9 bottles per mile that takes

        20 / 9 miles.

After travelling 20/9 miles we are 2 2⁄9 miles from Weiss Pavilion and
exactly 100 bottles remain.

------------------------------------------------
2.  From 100 bottles to Wirth Pavilion
------------------------------------------------
With 100 bottles only k = ⌈100/25⌉ = 4 loads are required,
so the least possible fuel consumption drops to 2·4 – 1 = 7 bottles per mile.
The distance still to go is

        5 − 20/9 = 25/9 miles.

Fuel burnt on that stretch is

        7 · 25/9 = 175/9 bottles.

Bottles that arrive (un‑opened) at the Wirth Pavilion:

        100 − 175/9 = 725/9 = 80 5⁄9.

------------------------------------------------
3.  Integer bottling
------------------------------------------------
Because bottles are indivisible, at most 80 of them can arrive unopened.
That bound of 80 is reachable (for example, by doing exactly the two‑stage shuttle
described above and letting the fractional 5⁄9 of a bottle be the fuel left in the
tank), so 80 is the maximum.

2. (Creative) Analyse the shuttling requirement: if k = ⌈n / C⌉ loads are needed to move n bottles one mile, the minimal fuel for that mile is 2k − 1 bottles (k − 1 round-trips at 2 bottles each plus one one-way trip at 1 bottle).

137,"Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.  Henry's plan calls for the tracks (each of which is one mile in length) to be laid end-to-end with no gap between them, pinned to the ground at every other juncture, as shown below:
v_______ _______vv_______ _______v
Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""
Henry replies, ""The expansion will only be an inch over the whole mile length.  If the tracks buckle, it will only be by an inch or two at most.  The trains will certainly have no trouble bumping over these buckles.""
Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?",Would Pythagoras have the same plan?,"Assumptions the boss makes (and Henry ignores)

1.  Each rail is 1 mile = 5 280 ft = 63 360 in long.  
   The coefficient of thermal expansion is such that the rail becomes 1 in longer in the worst‐case temperature change.
2.  Henry pins the rail to the ground at every other joint, so the ends that are actually fixed are 2 miles = 10 560 ft = 126 720 in apart.
3.  Between two pins the two one‑mile pieces behave as one continuous “bar” 2 inches longer than the distance between its fixed ends.  
   It therefore has to take the shape of an arc that is 2 in longer than its 10 560 ft straight‑line distance.

How much “hump” does 2 extra inches create?

Let  

c = straight–line distance between the pins = 10 560 ft = 126 720 in  
Δ = extra length that must be absorbed by a buckle = 2 in  

Assume the rail buckles into a very shallow circular arc.  
For a shallow arc the excess length Δ and the mid‑height (sagitta) h are related by

Δ ≈ 8h² ⁄ (3c)  (standard approximation for a shallow circular arc).

Solve for h:

h ≈ √(3cΔ ⁄ 8).

Insert the numbers:

h ≈ √[ (3)(126 720 in)(2 in) ⁄ 8 ]  
  ≈ √(95 040) in  
  ≈ 308 in ≈ 25.7 ft.

So the track between two pins will rise roughly twenty‑five feet off the ground!

Even if Henry had pinned every single joint (so c = 1 mile and Δ = 1 in), the buckle height would still be

h ≈ √[ (3)(63 360)(1) ⁄ 8 ] ≈ 154 in ≈ 12.8 ft.

Why the boss fired Henry

A train cannot “bump over” a hump that towers a dozen (let alone twenty‑five) feet above the grade.  
Henry’s intuition that “an inch or two of extra length will make only an inch or two of buckle” is dead wrong; with long fixed spans a tiny percentage increase in length produces enormous vertical deflections.  
Seeing this fundamental misunderstanding of elementary structural geometry, the boss quite reasonably concluded that Henry was unfit for the job.

Final answer: The 2 inches of extra rail between fixed points 2 miles apart forces a buckle about 25 feet high (even 1 mile spans would buckle ~13 ft), far too large for trains to ride over, so Henry’s plan is disastrously unsafe and his boss fires him.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7

   The angle between these vectors is arccos[(0)(–4)+6(–4)] / (6√32) = 135°, as required.

140,"Take a five-digit number and reverse it. Subtract the original number from the reversed number and you are left with 33957.
How many different possibilities does the original number have?",Work from the first and last digits.,"Let the original five–digit number be  

 N = 10000 a + 1000 b + 100 c + 10 d + e, where a (the ten‑thousands digit) is 1–9 and b,c,d,e are 0–9.

Its reversal is  

 R = 10000 e + 1000 d + 100 c + 10 b + a.

Given: R – N = 33 957 (with R > N).

1.  Compute R – N symbolically  
 R – N = (10000e – 10000a) + (1000d – 1000b) + (100c – 100c) + (10b – 10d) + (a – e)

2.  Divide by the common factor 9:  
 1111(e – a) + 110(d – b) = 3773.  (1)

3.  Let  
 x = e – a  (so –9 ≤ x ≤ 9)  
 y = d – b  (so –9 ≤ y ≤ 9).

 1111x + 110y = 3773.

4.  Solve this Diophantine equation.

   Reduce (1) modulo 10: 1111x ≡ 3773 (mod 10) ⇒ x ≡ 3 (mod 10).

   With –9 ≤ x ≤ 9, the only possible value is x = 3 (because –7 would make y outrageously large).

   Substitute x = 3 into (1):  
 1111·3 + 110y = 3773  
 3333 + 110y = 3773  
 110y = 440  
 y = 4.

5.  Translate back to digit restrictions.

   From e = a + 3 and 0 ≤ e ≤ 9, we get 1 ≤ a ≤ 6 (so e ranges from 4 to 9).

   From d = b + 4 and 0 ≤ d ≤ 9, we get 0 ≤ b ≤ 5 (so d ranges from 4 to 9).

   The middle digit c is unrestricted: 0 ≤ c ≤ 9.

So the whole rope is being removed at  
1/60 + 1/60 = 1/30 rope per minute,  
meaning rope #1 disappears in exactly 30 minutes.  
When the two fronts meet and nothing is left, you have a clear, observable event: 30 minutes have passed.

Step 2 – get an additional 45‑minute signal  
Take the untouched rope #2 immediately when rope #1 vanishes.  
• Put Mouse A at one end and Mouse C at the other end (Mouse B can be set aside).  

Their combined opposite‑end rate is

 A + C = 1/60 + 1/180 = 1/45 rope per minute,

N = 225 × k  (k is a positive integer)

and, when written in ordinary decimal notation, N must consist exclusively of the digits 0 and 1.

Break the divisibility requirement.

1. 225 = 9 × 25  
   • Divisibility by 25 means the last two decimal digits must be 00 (because 25, 50, 75 all use forbidden digits).  
   • Divisibility by 9 means the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9.

So N must look like “(some digits)…00”, and among all its digits the count of 1’s must be a multiple of 9.

Strip off the mandatory ending “00”.  
Write N = 100 × m, where m itself is a decimal number made only of 0’s and 1’s.

Because gcd(100, 9)=1, 9 divides N ⇔ 9 divides m.  
Hence the problem reduces to:

Find the smallest positive multiple of 9 whose decimal expansion uses only 0’s and 1’s.

Digit–sum viewpoint.

• A decimal number made of 0’s and 1’s has digit–sum equal to the number of 1’s it contains.  
• To be divisible by 9, that digit–sum must be 9, 18, 27, …  
• With at most 8 digits you cannot reach a digit–sum of 9 (the maximum would be 8).  
  Therefore such a number must have at least 9 digits.

Try 9 digits.  
The lexicographically (and numerically) smallest 9‑digit string of 0/1’s containing exactly nine 1’s is

   111 111 111.

Its digit‑sum is 9, so it is divisible by 9.  
Hence

   m = 111 111 111  is the smallest possible.

Re‑attach the two obligatory zeros.

   N = 100 × m = 11 111 111 100.

Verification.

• Last two digits are 00  ⇒ divisible by 25.  
• Digit‑sum = 9  ⇒ divisible by 9.  
⇒ N is divisible by 225.

No smaller N can work:

– A 10‑digit number ending in 00 would have only 8 remaining digits; the greatest possible digit‑sum would be 8, so it can’t be divisible by 9.  
– For 11‑digit numbers ending in 00, all first 9 digits must be 1 to reach digit‑sum 9, giving exactly the number above.  
Thus 11 111 111 100 is indeed the minimum.

Number of packages.

k = N / 225 = 11 111 111 100 / 225 = 49 382 716 (an integer).

9. Reattach the two trailing zeros to get N = 11 111 111 100. (Rudimentary)

11. Give the minimality proof: a 10-digit number ending in 00 would leave only 8 meaningful digits, whose digit-sum can be at most 8, so it cannot be divisible by 9.

144,"Arrange the digits 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, and 7 to form a single fraction that equals 1/11",,"We have to use each digit of the multiset  
{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7} exactly once to write a fraction Numerator/Denominator that equals 1/11, i.e.  

Numerator × 11 = Denominator.  

Because multiplying a 4‑digit number by 11 always produces a 5‑digit number, the only feasible partition of the 9 digits is  

• a 4‑digit numerator N  
• a 5‑digit denominator D = 11 N.

Let N = abcd (a is the thousands digit, d the units digit).  
When a number is multiplied by 11, its units digit is unchanged, so d reappears as the units digit of D.  
Therefore d must be a digit that occurs twice in the multiset; the possible choices are 1, 3, 4.

Take d = 4.  
Using the standard “multiply by 11” algorithm (add each pair of neighbouring digits, keeping carries):

 c + 4 gives the tens digit of D,  
 b + c gives the hundreds digit,  
 a + b gives the thousands digit,  
 a (plus any final carry) gives the ten‑thousands digit.

Choosing c = 3 gives tens digit 7.  
Choosing b = 2 gives hundreds digit 5.  
Choosing a = 1 gives thousands digit 3 and leading digit 1.

Thus  

 N = 1 2 3 4 = 1234  
 D = 1 3 5 7 4 = 13574.

Check: 1234 × 11 = 13574.  
The digits used are  

 Numerator: 1, 2, 3, 4  
 Denominator: 1, 3, 5, 7, 4

which together are exactly the given multiset.

Hence the required fraction is 1234/13574, and indeed

145,How many trailing zeros are in the number 1000!?,,"To count the trailing zeros of 1000!, we need to know how many times 10 divides that factorial.  
A factor 10 = 2 × 5, and in any factorial there are far more factors 2 than factors 5.  
Hence the number of trailing zeros equals the number of times 5 appears as a prime factor of 1000!.

For n!, the exponent of a prime p in its prime‑factorization is given by Legendre’s formula:  
⎣n/p⎦ + ⎣n/p²⎦ + ⎣n/p³⎦ + … until the quotients vanish.

Using p = 5 and n = 1000:

⎣1000/5⎦   = 200  
⎣1000/25⎦  = 40  
⎣1000/125⎦ = 8  
⎣1000/625⎦ = 1  
Next power 5⁵ = 3125 > 1000, so the series stops.

In all 14 stages ""Crazy"" Charles finished in the same position: 93rd. However, at the end of the race, ""Crazy"" Charles was declared runner-up in the competition: his accumulated time was less than that of all the other competitors except one, the champion.
Bearing in mind the fact that none of the 100 competitors withdrew from the race, how was it possible for ""Crazy"" Charles to finish second if he never even made it into the top 90 competitors?",,"Think of the 14 stages being run according to the usual road‑cycling rule:

•  Riders who cross the finish line together are all given exactly the same time;  
   their order of crossing counts only for the day’s stage placings.

Design the race as follows.

Stage pattern (the same on every one of the 14 stages)

1.  The future overall winner (call him the Champion) attacks early and finishes
    the stage all alone, 10 minutes ahead of everybody else.

2.  Ninety‑two riders – one of whom is “Crazy” Charles – reach the finish in a big
    bunch.  Because they arrive together they all get the same time, 10 minutes
    slower than the Champion’s.  When the bunch sprints for the line Charles
    is the last man in it, so he is recorded as 93rd for the stage
    (the Champion is 1st, the other 91 in the bunch are 2nd‑92nd).

3.  The remaining seven riders come in far behind, one hour after the bunch.
    They therefore receive a time that is 1 h 00 min slower than Charles’s.

Varying the seven “stragglers”
There are 14 stages × 7 straggler places = 98 “late‑arrival slots”.
Let every one of the 98 riders other than the Champion and Charles occupy
one of those slots exactly once.
Thus, during the whole race

•  Charles is never a straggler; he is always in the bunch.  
•  Each of the other 98 riders is a straggler on one stage and loses
   an extra hour to Charles on that day, but finishes in the bunch (same time as
   Charles) on the other 13 stages.  
•  The Champion gains 10 minutes on Charles on every stage.

Compute the accumulated times

Champion:   gains 10 min × 14 = 2 h 20 min on Charles.

Charles:    loses nothing extra at any time.

Any other rider:  
  loses the same 10 min per stage to the Champion that Charles loses,  
  and on one stage also loses 1 h 00 min to Charles.  
  Therefore he finishes the race 1 h 00 min behind Charles.

So, after 14 stages

1st Champion   (best total time)  
2nd “Crazy” Charles  (1 h ahead of everyone else except the Champion)  
3rd‑100th  All the remaining riders

Hence it is perfectly possible for Charles to have finished 93rd in every single
stage and still be runner‑up in the general classification.

Final answer: Because stage times are awarded to whole groups that finish together, Charles could always finish last in the main bunch (93rd place) while every other rider (except the eventual winner) lost a large amount of time on at least one stage; thus Charles’s consistent bunch finishes left him with the second‑best aggregate time even though he never placed better than 93rd on any single day.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 9

After 10 minutes of gruelling hand-to-fin combat, all of the sharks were killed.  Miraculously, none of the cadets were killed.

One of the cadets noted that during the fight, there were 4 times as many cadets in the water as there were sharks.

148,"There is a five digit square number that is palindromic, and each digit is also a nonzero square number.
What is it?","Of course, it must be the square of a palindromic number. Therefore, when you multiply its square root by itself, there's no carrying, because carrying will break the palindrome. And therefore...","Let the five–digit palindrome be written as ABCBA.  
Because it must read the same backwards, its first and last digits are the same (A), and its second and fourth digits are the same (B).

1. Each digit must itself be a non‑zero perfect square digit; hence each digit is in {1, 4, 9}.  
2. A perfect square is congruent to 0 or 1 (mod 4).  
   Compute ABCBA (mod 4):

   ABCBA = 10001A + 1010B + 100C  
          ≡ A + 2B  (mod 4)

   Since A, B ∈ {1,4,9} ⇒ A ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 4) and B ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 4).

   • If B ≡ 1, then A + 2 ≡ 0,1  ⇒ A ≡ 2 or 3 (impossible).  
   • Therefore B ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ B = 4.

   Hence the number has the form A 4 C 4 A, with A, C ∈ {1,4,9}.

3. List the nine possible palindromes:

   14141, 14441, 14941,  
   44144, 44444, 44944,  
   94149, 94449, 94949.

4. Test each for being a perfect square (only roots between 100 and 316 need checking):

   118² = 13924   119² = 14161        → 14141 not a square  
   120² = 14400   121² = 14641        → 14441 not a square  
   122² = 14884   123² = 15129        → 14941 not a square  

   210² = 44100   211² = 44521        → 44144 not a square  
   211² = 44521   212² = 44944        → 44444 not a square  
   212² = 44944                     → 44944 IS a square (212²)

   306² = 93636   307² = 94249        → 94149 not a square  
   307² = 94249   308² = 94864        → 94449 not a square  
   308² = 94864   309² = 95481        → 94949 not a square  

Only 44944 satisfies all conditions: it is palindromic, every digit (4,4,9,4,4) is a non‑zero square digit, and 44944 = 212².

151,"In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.
On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.
About this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, ""Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.""
Knowing Junior, we asked, ""How big a headache is your math gonna give us?""
She answered, ""I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.""
Name the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.",Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.,"One (and in fact the first) regular polygon that allows such a game is the regular octagon.

Label its vertices in order
A , B , C , D , E , F , G , H  

and perform the three straight cuts shown below.

1st cut AD  
  This isolates the quadrilateral A‑B‑C‑D.  
2nd cut DG  
  This isolates the quadrilateral D‑E‑F‑G.  
3rd (last) cut DH  
  This divides the remaining quadrilateral G‑H‑A‑D into the two triangles  
  D‑G‑H and H‑D‑A.

After the third cut we have obtained

 Q₁ = ABCD  Q₂ = DEFG  T₁ = DGH  T₂ = HDA ,

altogether four pieces.

Why the four pieces are equal‑area  

Put the octagon with its centre O at the origin and inscribe it in the unit
circle.  
For any polygon with vertices (x₀ , y₀ ), … , (x_{m−1} , y_{m−1}) its area is

  S = ½ │ Σ (x_i y_{i+1}  −  x_{i+1} y_i) │   (the “shoelace’’ rule)

(take the index i+1 cyclically).

Working only with that rule one finds

 area(ABCD)  =  ½ (3 sin 45° − sin 135°)  
       =  (sin 45°) ,

 area(DGH)  =  ½ (2 sin 45°)  
       =  (sin 45°) ,

and the same value is obtained for DEFG and HDA.  
(The numerical value sin 45° = √2 ⁄ 2 need never be written; it
cancels out everywhere, so no roots, powers or trigonometry are really
required.)

Because every piece has the same area, each of them is one quarter of the
whole cake.  
The first two cuts each produced exactly one of those quarters; the last cut
split what was left into the final two quarters, so all the conditions stated
in the problem are satisfied.

152,"A solid wooden cuboid is made which measures an exact, and even, number of centimetres along each of its edges. It is then painted black all over its exposed faces and, when the paint is dry, the cuboid is cut up into 1 centimetre cubes. These small cubes are counted and it is then found that the number having NO paint on them at all, is exactly the same as the number which do have some paint on them. What is the LEAST number of small cubes there could be in total?",,"Let the even edge–lengths of the big cuboid be  
a cm , b cm , c cm   (a , b , c even positive integers).

After cutting into 1 cm cubes:

• Total number of small cubes: N = a b c.  
• Cubes with no paint (completely inside the solid): (a–2)(b–2)(c–2).  
• Cubes with some paint (on the surface): N – (a–2)(b–2)(c–2).

The statement of the problem gives

(a–2)(b–2)(c–2) = N – (a–2)(b–2)(c–2).

Hence

2 (a–2)(b–2)(c–2) = a b c.  (1)

────────────────────────────────────────
1.  Remove the factor 2 cm of paint‑free “padding”

Because a , b , c are even, write  

a = 2(A+1), b = 2(B+1), c = 2(C+1)

with A , B , C positive integers.  
Put these into (1):

8 (A+1)(B+1)(C+1) = 16 A B C  
⟹  (A+1)(B+1)(C+1) = 2 A B C.  (2)

Let p = A, q = B, r = C ;  then p , q , r are positive integers and (2) is

(p+1)(q+1)(r+1) = 2 p q r.  (3)

We also want p ≤ q ≤ r (just to avoid duplicating cases).

The total number of 1 cm cubes is, from N = a b c,

N = 8 (p+1)(q+1)(r+1) = 16 p q r.  (4)

So minimising N is the same as minimising the product p q r subject to (3).

────────────────────────────────────────
2.  Solve equation (3)

Rewrite (3) for fixed p.

p q r = p q + p r + q r + p + q + r + 1.  (5)

Case p = 1 → Left < Right (impossible).  
Case p = 2.

Putting p = 2 in (5) and simplifying gives

(q – 3)(r – 3) = 12.

With q ≤ r this yields the solutions

(q , r) = (4 , 15), (5 , 9), (6 , 7).

Case p = 3.

Putting p = 3 in (5) gives

(q – 2)(r – 2) = 6,

which yields

(q , r) = (3 , 8), (4 , 5).

Case p ≥ 4.

If p ≥ 4 then p q r ≥ 4·4·4 = 64, and by (4) this forces N ≥ 16·64 = 1024, already larger than one solution we have found below, so no smaller total can arise here. (A direct check for p = 4, 5 shows there is in fact no solution at all.)

Thus all solutions are

(p , q , r) = (2,4,15), (2,5,9), (2,6,7), (3,3,8), (3,4,5).

────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Compute N for each solution (use N = 16 p q r)

(2,4,15) → N = 16·2·4·15 = 1920  
(2,5,9)  → N = 16·2·5·9  = 1440  
(2,6,7)  → N = 16·2·6·7  = 1344  
(3,3,8)  → N = 16·3·3·8  = 1152  
(3,4,5)  → N = 16·3·4·5  = 960 ← smallest

────────────────────────────────────────
4.  Recover the cuboid’s actual dimensions for the minimal case

For (p , q , r) = (3 , 4 , 5):

a = 2(p+1) = 2·4 = 8 cm  
b = 2(q+1) = 2·5 = 10 cm  
c = 2(r+1) = 2·6 = 12 cm.

Indeed,

interior cubes = (8–2)(10–2)(12–2) = 6·8·10 = 480  
surface  cubes = 8·10·12 – 480 = 960 – 480 = 480.

So the numbers match, and 960 is the least total possible.

153,"Find three numbers, all under 500, where the sum of all three is a perfect square and the sums of any two of them are also perfect squares.",,"Let the three required numbers be  
a , b , c   (< 500)  

and denote the three pair–sums and the total sum by squares

a + b = p²  
a + c = q²  
b + c = r²  
a + b + c = s².                (1)

1.  Express a , b , c in terms of the three squares  
 From the first three equations of (1)

 2a = p² + q² – r² ⇒ a = (p² + q² – r²)/2  
 2b = p² + r² – q² ⇒ b = (p² + r² – q²)/2            (2)  
 2c = q² + r² – p² ⇒ c = (q² + r² – p²)/2

   For a , b , c to be positive all three right‑hand sides must be positive, i.e.  
 p² , q² , r² satisfy the triangle inequality.

2.  A useful relation among p , q , r , s  
   Adding the three pair‑sums gives  
 p² + q² + r² = 2(a + b + c) = 2s².                 (3)

   Hence we need three squares whose sum equals twice another square and which pass the
   triangle test.

3.  Looking for such a triple of squares  
   Take two odd squares of the same residue mod 16 (so that their sum is 2 (mod 16))
   and look for an even square which completes (3).

   A convenient choice is  

 19² = 361, 21² = 441 (both 9 mod 16)  

   Their sum is 361 + 441 = 802.

   We want an even square t² such that  

 361 + 441 + t² = 2s².                               (4)

   Trying successive odd s gives s = 23 :

 2·23² = 2·529 = 1058, so take t² = 1058 – 802 = 256 = 16².   (5)

   Thus we have the three pair‑squares  

 p² = 361 (= 19²), q² = 441 (= 21²), r² = 256 (= 16²).        (6)

   Since 441 < 361 + 256 and 361 < 441 + 256 and 256 < 361 + 441,
   the triangle inequality holds, so (2) gives positive a , b , c.

4.  Determining a , b , c  

 a = (361 + 441 – 256)/2 = 546/2 = 273  
 b = (361 + 256 – 441)/2 = 176/2 = 88  
 c = (441 + 256 – 361)/2 = 336/2 = 168                 (7)

   All three are < 500.

5.  Verification  

 a + b = 273 + 88 = 361 = 19²  
 a + c = 273 + 168 = 441 = 21²  
 b + c = 88 + 168 = 256 = 16²  
 a + b + c = 273 + 88 + 168 = 529 = 23².              (8)

   Every requirement of the problem is satisfied.

Therefore the three desired numbers are 88, 168 and 273.

154,"Mad Ade noticed that he could arrange the five odd digits (1,3,5,7,9) into a five-digit number, such that the first two digits (as a 2-digit number) times the last two digits (as a 2-digit number) minus the center digit results in a number composed of repetitions of one digit.
Mad Ade noted there were two possible answers.
What are they?",,"Let the five–digit number be  

 D₁D₂D₃D₄D₅  (with the digits 1,3,5,7,9, all different).  

Set  
 A = 10·D₁ + D₂ (the first two‑digit number)  
 B = 10·D₄ + D₅ (the last two‑digit number)  
 C = D₃      (the centre digit)

Mad Ade’s condition is  

 A·B – C  =  a repdigit (all its digits equal).

Step 1 – Parity of the repdigit  
A and B are odd, so A·B is odd.  
Subtracting the odd digit C gives an even result, therefore the repeated digit must be even: 2, 4, 6 or 8.

Step 2 – Last–digit condition  
The last digit of A·B is the product of the units digits of A and B; call that u.  
We need u – C ≡ d (mod 10), where d is the repeated digit (2,4,6 or 8).  
Trying all odd digits for u and C shows only one possibility:

 u ≡ 3 (mod 10) and C = 1 gives u – C ≡ 2.

Hence the repdigit must be 222…2, and the centre digit is 1.

Step 3 – Size of the repdigit  
The smallest possible value of A·B (13×57) is 741; the largest (97×59) is 5 723.  
Therefore A·B – 1 must be at least 732, so the repdigit has at least four digits.  
The only four–digit repdigit whose final digit is 2 is 2222.

So we must have  

 A·B − 1 = 2222 ⇒ A·B = 2223.

Step 4 – Factoring 2223  
2223 = 3²·13·19 = 39·57 = 57·39.

Both factors are two–digit numbers that use only the digits 1,3,5,7,9 once each (39 uses 3,9; 57 uses 5,7) and leave 1 for the centre digit.  Thus

 A, B = 39 and 57  (in either order), C = 1.

Step 5 – Forming the five‑digit numbers
1. A = 39, C = 1, B = 57 ⇒ 39157  
2. A = 57, C = 1, B = 39 ⇒ 57139

Verification  
39157: 39×57 = 2223; 2223 – 1 = 2222 ✔  
57139: 57×39 = 2223; 2223 – 1 = 2222 ✔

When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 90 days also.
For how long can the three animals graze on the field together?",,"Let  

F = amount of grass that is on the field at the start (measured in “grass‑units”),  
r = grass that grows back each day,  
C , G , S = grass eaten per day by the Cow, the Goat, and the (Scotch‑egg‑laying) Goose, respectively.

While the animals are grazing, the grass on the field changes at the net rate  

  (net change) = r  – (consumption of the animals present).

If the net change is negative the stock of grass falls at constant rate  
  F / (consumption – r)  
and the field is bare when the initial stock is exhausted.

Hence, for every group we have  

  time until bare = F / (consumption of that group – r).

The data give four such equations.

1. Cow + Goat: 45 = F / (C + G – r)  ⇒ F = 45(C + G – r) … (i)
2. Cow + Goose: 60 = F / (C + S – r)  ⇒ F = 60(C + S – r) … (ii)
3. Cow alone:  90 = F / (C – r)     ⇒ F = 90(C – r) … (iii)
4. Goat + Goose: 90 = F / (G + S – r)  ⇒ F = 90(G + S – r) … (iv)

Use equation (iii) to express C – r:

 C – r = F / 90.                                        (1)

(i) minus (iii) eliminates C – r and r:

 (C + G – r) – (C – r) = F/45 – F/90  
 G = F/90.                                              (2)

(ii) minus (iii):

 (C + S – r) – (C – r) = F/60 – F/90  
 S = F/180.                                            (3)

Add (2) and (3): G + S = F/90 + F/180 = F/60.

Insert in (iv):

 G + S – r = F/90  
 F/60 – r = F/90 ⇒ r = F/180.                        (4)

Now find C from (1) and (4):

 C = (C – r) + r = F/90 + F/180 = F/60.                (5)

Summary of the rates (all in grass‑units per day):

 C = F/60, G = F/90, S = F/180, r = F/180.

Finally, when all three animals graze together the net depletion rate is

 (C + G + S) – r
 = (F/60 + F/90 + F/180) – F/180
 = (3F + 2F + 1F – 1F) / 180
 = 5F / 180
 = F / 36.

Therefore the time until the grass is gone is

 t = F / (F/36) = 36 days.

156,n people each know a different piece of gossip. They can telephone each other and exchange all the information they know (so that after the call they both know anything that either of them knew before the call). What is the smallest number of calls needed so that everyone knows everything?,,"For 1, 2 and 3 people the minimum numbers of calls can be written down directly

• 1 person: nobody has to ring – 0 calls.  
• 2 people: one call lets the two of them swap what they know – 1 call.  
• 3 people: A telephones B, B telephones C, and C telephones A – 3 calls.  
  (With two calls at least one of the three would still be ignorant of something.)

From 4 people on the general answer is

  minimum number of calls = 2 n − 4       (n ≥ 4).

Why 2 n − 4 calls are enough

Label the people 1,2,…,n (n ≥ 4).

Step 1 1 telephones 2.          (1 call)

Step 2 n telephones 1.         (1 call, total 2)

After these two calls person 1 knows the gossips 1,2,n and persons 1 and n each know three different items.

Step 3 The remaining n − 3 people call 1 one after another
         (in the order n − 1, n − 2, … , 3).             (n − 3 calls, total n − 1)

 • while these calls are being made person 1 keeps
   gathering information;  
 • at the moment the k‑th of them (counting from the end)
   rings, 1 already knows everything except that caller’s
   own gossip, so the caller receives the whole collection.

Consequently after Step 3

  – person 1 knows every gossip;  
  – every caller of Step 3 (i.e. everybody except 2) also
         knows every gossip;  
  – only person 2 does not yet know everything.

Step 4 Somebody who already knows everything (for instance n)
         rings 2 once more and tells it to him.            (1 call)

Total number of calls

  1  (first call)  
 + 1  (second call)  
 + (n − 3)  (calls in Step 3)  
 + 1  (last call)  
 = 2n − 4.

So 2n − 4 calls always suffice.

Why 2 n − 4 calls are necessary

Take any sequence of calls that ends with everybody knowing everything.

• Look at the final call.  Just before it, at least two people
  still lacked some information – namely the two who
  took part in that last call.  
• The other n − 2 people were already fully informed
  before the last call took place, and each of those n − 2
  people had to learn his last new item in some *earlier*
  call.  A person can learn new items from only one side
  of a conversation, so each of those n − 2 fully informed
  people must have taken part in at least two earlier calls:
  one in which he got his last missing item and another
  in which he *gave* it to somebody else.  That accounts
  for at least 2(n − 2) person‑participations.  

• The last call contributes 2 more person‑participations,
  so altogether there have been at least 2(n − 2)+2 =
  2n − 2 person‑participations.  Each telephone call involves
  exactly two participants, hence the total number of calls
  is at least (2n − 2)/2 = n − 1.  

• But we already used n − 1 calls to make *everyone*
  know everything except the two people in the last call,
  so in addition we need those two final calls that made
  that last pair acquainted with the rest.  Hence at least  
  (n − 1)+ (n − 3)+1 = 2n − 4 calls are unavoidable.

Because 2n − 4 calls are both sufficient and necessary we have proved that

  For n ≥ 4 the smallest number of calls is 2n − 4.

• multiplier 3D uses the fixed digit 3 and another digit D ≠3,0  
• all nine digits 1‑9 must appear once and only once in the whole equation.

Hence the digits 3 and D are already “taken” by the multiplier, and neither of them may recur in ABC or in the product.

For each person P let k(P) be the number of people P knows, counting P himself/herself.  
Because “knowing’’ is mutual, for every pair (A,B) we have  
A knows B  ⇔  B knows A.

1.  Bounds on k(P).

   Consequently no one can know everybody, so no person can have k = n.

   Conversely, if some Y has k(Y)=n (Y knows everybody), then Y knows X, hence X knows Y; thus k(X)≠1.

161,"There was a body pump class that lasted a long time, but it always changed. The instructor was a very smart person and liked to throw puzzles at the students. About 15 minutes into the class, one kid asked how much time there was left in the class. He said: ""Right now? Oh, I'd say seven."" The kid was confused and knew the instructor was never going to tell anybody.
Another 5 minutes in, another kid asked how much time was left. The instructor said, ""About five now."" Confused, the kid went back and the class continued.
Ten minutes later, a perplexed pupil in the front asked  how much time was left. The instructor said, ""I think it's about three.""

163,"Find the smallest number such that if its rightmost digit is placed at its left end, the new number so formed is precisely 50% larger than the original number.",,"Let  

n = 10 a + b with b = last digit (1 ≤ b ≤ 9)  
m = number obtained by moving b to the front = b·10^{k‑1} + a ,  
where k is the number of digits of n (so a has k–1 digits).

The condition “m is 50 % larger than n” gives  

b·10^{k-1} + a = (3/2)(10 a + b).

Multiply by 2 and collect terms:

2b·10^{k-1} + 2a = 30a + 3b  
2b·10^{k-1} – 3b = 28a  
b(2·10^{k-1} – 3) = 28a.       (★)

Hence  

a = b(2·10^{k-1} – 3) / 28            (1)

and a must be an (integer) k–1‑digit number.

Check successive values of k.

k = 2 ⇒ 2·10^{1}–3 = 17, gcd(17,28)=1;  
equation (1) would require b multiple of 28 – impossible (b ≤ 9).  
So no 2‑digit solution.

k = 3 : 2·10^{2}–3 = 197, gcd(197,28)=1 → impossible.  
k = 4 : 1997, gcd(1997,28)=1 → impossible.  
k = 5 : 19 997, gcd=1 → impossible.

k = 6 : 199 997.  
199 997 is divisible by 7 but not by 4, so gcd(199 997,28)=7.  
Cancel the common factor 7 in (1):

a = b·(199 997/7) / 4 = b·28 571 / 4.        (2)

For a to be integral, b must be divisible by 4.  
Possible b: 4 or 8.  
Choose the smaller, b = 4, to obtain the smallest n.

Then a = 4·28 571 / 4 = 28 571 (which indeed has 5 digits).

Thus  
n = 10a + b = 10·28 571 + 4 = 285 714.

(Using b = 8 would give the larger solution 571 428.)

Verification:  
Put the 4 in front of 285 714 → 428 571.  
428 571 = (3/2)·285 714, so the condition is satisfied.

The two boats leave from opposite shores at the same time.  They pass at a point of 720 yards from Lard Sculptures.  Upon arriving at the opposite shore, each boat stays in its slip for 5 minutes, and then starts back. They pass again 400 yards from Kebab Fountains. Assume both boats travel along a straight line.  How far is it from Kebab Fountains to Lard Sculptures by water?",,"Let

1.  The first meeting

The boats leave opposite ends simultaneously and meet 720 yd from Lard
Sculptures (the west shore).

Let us measure distance x from the west shore (x = 0 at Lard Sculptures,
x = D at Kebab Fountains).

Choose the faster launch order so that

 • Lead Balloon starts at Kebab Fountains (x = D) and heads west.  
 • Iceberg Magnet starts at Lard Sculptures (x = 0) and heads east.

At the first meeting:

 distance travelled by Lead  = D – 720  
 distance travelled by Iceberg = 720

Equal times give

Each boat waits 5 min after reaching the far shore, then returns.

Lead (now at the west side) leaves again at time   tL = D/vL + 5

Iceberg (now at the east side) leaves again at time tI = D/vI + 5  
and, travelling west, its position for t ≥ tI is   xI(t) = D – vI(t – tI).

They meet the second time 400 yd from Kebab Fountains, i.e. at x = D – 400.

⇨ 1040 + 1440r = 1120r + 720r²

⇨ 720r² – 320r – 1040 = 0

Said Bert to Alf ""I'm off down the pub"". How old were Alf and Bert the last time they met?",,"Let  

A = Alf’s present age  
B = Bert’s present age

1.  “When I was half your age …”  
 Let that moment be t years ago.  
 Then A – t = ½(B – t) ⇒ 2(A – t) = B – t ⇒ t = 2A – B.

2.  At that moment Bert was  
 B – t = B – (2A – B) = 2B – 2A  
 and Alf was half of that, namely B – A.

3.  Bert’s father was “six times” that Bert‑age, i.e.  
 6(2B – 2A) = 12B – 12A.  
 Thirty years earlier the father was therefore  
 (12B – 12A) – 30.

4.  “When I was a quarter of the age I am now …”  
 Alf reached age A/4 exactly ¾A years ago.  
 At that instant Bert was B – ¾A.

 According to Alf, that Bert‑age equalled  

 A/4  + ½[(12B – 12A) – 30].

 Hence
 B – ¾A = A/4 + ½(12B – 12A – 30)

 ⇒ B – ¾A = A/4 + 6B – 6A – 15  
 ⇒ 0 = 5B – 5A – 15  
 ⇒ B = A + 3.                                           (★)

   So Bert is exactly three years older than Alf.

5.  “The last time we met our ages were both prime numbers.”

166,"Your assignment is to make a delivery from the depot to your base camp, 1600 miles away. The trip begins normally, but unfortunately, halfway to base camp, your supply truck breaks down. You have no way to call for help. Luckily, in addition to medical supplies, the truck is carrying a Desert Patrol Vehicle (DPV) and two barrels of fuel.
The DPV has a full 10 gallon tank, but to make room for the medical supplies, it can only carry one of the 45 gallon barrels at a time. While you can't transfer fuel between barrels, you can refill the tank from the barrels. Assume the DPV can get 12 miles per gallon, regardless of the load it carries.
How far can you go? Is it far enough to deliver the medical supplies and the DPV to your base camp?","Use half of a tank to carry one barrel, then return for the other.","Let  

 •  the starting point (the wrecked truck) be mile 0,  
 •  your base camp be 800 miles ahead,  
 •  the DPV’s petrol consumption be 12 mi/gal,  
 •  the fuel you possess be  
   10 gal in the DPV’s tank + 2 × 45 gal in the barrels = 100 gal.  

Because the DPV can carry only one 45‑gallon barrel at a time, every time you want to move both barrels forward you must

 1. drive forward a distance d carrying the first barrel,  
 2. leave that barrel, refuel, and drive back the same distance d with no barrel,  
 3. pick up the second barrel and drive the distance d again.

Three trips over the same stretch of road consume  

 3 d ÷ 12 = d⁄4 gallons.  (1)

After finishing that “shuttle” both barrels have been advanced d miles and the total fuel left is

 100 − d⁄4 gallons.  (2)

Final, non‑stop dash to base camp
---------------------------------
After the last shuttle you will take one (and only one) barrel with you; together with the 10‑gallon tank the maximum fuel the DPV can leave with is

 45 gal + 10 gal = 55 gal,

which is good for

 55 × 12 = 660 miles.  (3)

Hence, when you start the final dash the remaining distance must not exceed 660 miles; i.e.

 800 − d ≤ 660  ⇒  d ≥ 140 miles.  (4)

But the fuel left after the shuttle must still let you cover that 660‑mile dash:

 100 − d⁄4 ≥ 55  (5)

 d ≤ 180 miles.  (6)

Together, (4) and (6) give

 140 mi ≤ d ≤ 180 mi.

Any choice for d in this interval works.  To maximise the distance you can travel, pick the largest possible shuttle distance, d = 180 mi.

What happens with d = 180 miles
--------------------------------
• Fuel used in the one and only shuttle  
 = d⁄4 = 180⁄4 = 45 gal.  
• Fuel left at the 180‑mile mark  
 = 100 − 45 = 55 gal.  
• That is exactly the 55 gal you can take along, so you leave with a full 10‑gal tank and a full (45‑gal) barrel.

Those 55 gallons carry you

 55 × 12 = 660 miles.

Hence the DPV reaches

 180 mi + 660 mi = 840 miles

from the breakdown point, 40 miles past your base camp.  
When you reach the camp (800 mi from the start) you still have

 40 mi ÷ 12 mi/gal = 3⅓ gallons

in the tank.

Conclusion
----------
You can drive the DPV at most 840 miles; since the base camp is only 800 miles away, the medical supplies (and the DPV itself) can indeed be delivered with a little fuel to spare.

Final answer: yes – by shuttling the barrels 180 miles ahead and then making a 660‑mile non‑stop run, you can cover the 800 miles to base camp (the theoretical maximum distance is 840 miles).",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 16

Multiply (1) by 2:

2N = k(2a + k − 1).                                        (2)

Because k ≥ 2, k must divide 2N.  
Notice the parity of the two factors in (2):

• If k is even, then 2a+k−1 is odd, so the right side of (2) is even×odd = even.  
  But for a to be an integer we need 2a+k−1 to be even (so that (2a+k−1)/2 is integral).  
  Hence k cannot be even.

• Therefore k must be odd.  Write k = d, an odd divisor of 2N.  
  Since d is odd it already divides N itself (because 2 contributes no odd factor).  
  Letting d>1 be any odd divisor of N, equation (1) gives

169,"Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.
We were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?",,"Let an ID be written as the three–digit string  
a b c  with a ≠ 0 (otherwise the machine rejects it).

1.  Count all admissible IDs.  
   a can be 1–9 and b,c can be 0–9, so there are  
   9 × 10 × 10 = 900 possible IDs (100–999).

2.  Separate the IDs according to the behaviour of their reverse.

   •  IDs that end with 0 (c = 0)  
      Reversing c b a gives 0 b a, which starts with 0 and is therefore
      not a valid ID at all.  
      There are 9 × 10 = 90 such IDs (a = 1–9, b = 0–9).  
      Each of them is “alone”, so we can keep all 90.

   •  Palindromic IDs (a b a)  
      Reversing gives the same number, so no conflict arises if we keep it.
      There are 9 × 10 = 90 palindromes (a = 1–9, b = 0–9).  
      We keep all 90.

   •  All remaining IDs  
      These have c ≠ 0 and are not palindromes, so
      a b c ≠ c b a, but both numbers are valid.
      They therefore form two–element “reverse pairs” in which we may keep
      at most one member.  
      Count them: total admissible IDs (900) minus the 90 ending with 0
      minus the 90 palindromes leaves 720 IDs.  
      Hence there are 720 / 2 = 360 reverse pairs, and we may keep exactly
      one ID from each pair → 360 IDs.

3.  Add up all IDs we can retain:

      90  (ending with 0)  
    + 90  (palindromes)  
    + 360 (one from each non‑palindromic pair)  
    = 540.

Thus the largest possible set of three–digit IDs satisfying the requirement has 540 members.

171,"Mad Ade was in his local news agents looking at the various magazines on display, He picked a copy of ""Kebabs and Me"" a copy of ""Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Nylon Underpants"" and a copy of ""Indoor Hang Gliding"". He passed the magazines to the shop keeper, who duly entered the amounts of each magazine into the till.  ""Wow, hang on a minute"" said Mad Ade.  ""You just pressed the multiplication button each time between amounts instead of the addition button.""  The shop keeper smiled with new false teeth and replied, ""it doesn't matter either way, it still comes to £5.70p"".
What were the prices of the magazines, that could either be multiplied or added to make £5.70",,"Let the three prices (in pounds) be  

a , b , c  (all positive and given to the nearest penny).

The shop‑keeper’s slip shows that  
a + b + c = 5.70  and  a b c = 5.70.

Write the prices in pence so that we work with whole numbers:
x = 100 a , y = 100 b , z = 100 c
(so x , y , z are positive integers and one penny = 1 unit).

Then  

x + y + z = 570                       (1)  
x y z = 5.70 × 10⁶ = 5 700 000   (2)

Factor 5 700 000:
5 700 000 = 2⁵ · 3 · 5⁵ · 19 .

We need x,y,z ≤ 570 whose product is 5 700 000 and whose sum is 570.
Take one factor x and compute the required y and z from (1) and (2):

If x is chosen, then  
y + z = 570 − x ,  y z = 5 700 000 / x .

For integral y and z we need the quadratic
t² − (570−x)t + 5 700 000/x = 0
to possess integral roots; that happens exactly when its discriminant
Δ = (570−x)² − 4·(5 700 000/x)
is a perfect square.

Testing the divisors of 5 700 000 that do not exceed 570 gives only one value of x producing a perfect‑square discriminant:

x = 160
 → y + z = 410 , y z = 35 625  
 → Δ = 410² − 4·35 625 = 25 600 = 160² (a perfect square).

Hence  

y , z = (410 ± 160)/2 = 285 and 125.

Thus, up to order,

x , y , z = 125 , 160 , 285  (pence).

Converting back to pounds:

£1.25  £1.60  £2.85

Quick check:
1.25 + 1.60 + 2.85 = 5.70

174,"Arrange the numbers from 1 to 25 in a 5x5 grid so that each row, column, and diagonal adds up to the same number.","All of the rows, columns, and diagonals add up to 65.","We want a 5 × 5 magic square that uses every integer from 1 to 25 exactly once and makes every row, column and the two long diagonals add to the same total (the “magic constant”).

────────────────────────
Step 1.  Work out the magic constant

For an n × n magic square filled with the consecutive integers 1 … n², the common sum is

 M = n(n² + 1) / 2.

Here n = 5, so

 M = 5(25 + 1)/2 = 5·26/2 = 65.

Every row, column and main diagonal must therefore total 65.

────────────────────────
Step 2.  Use the Siamese (De la Loubère) method

The Siamese construction works for every odd order (3, 5, 7, …).

Rule summary
1. Put 1 in the middle cell of the top row.
2. From any number k, place k + 1 one step “up and to the right” (north‑east).
3. If that step would leave the square (wrap‑around):
   • off the top ⇒ re‑enter at the bottom of the same column,
   • off the right ⇒ re‑enter at the far left of the same row,
   • off the top‑right corner ⇒ re‑enter at the bottom‑left corner.
4. If the destination cell is already occupied, instead place k + 1 directly beneath k.

────────────────────────
Step 3.  Carry out the construction

We label rows 1–5 (top→bottom) and columns 1–5 (left→right).

k  position placed    comment
1  (row 1,col 3)      start in middle of top row
2  (row 5,col 4)      up‑right from (1,3) wraps off the top ⇒ row 5,col 4
3  (row 4,col 5)      up‑right again
4  (row 5,col 1)      up‑right leaves square at right edge ⇒ wrap to col 1
5  (row 3,col 1)      up‑right from (5,1) goes to (4,2)
6  (row 4,col 2)
7  (row 5,col 3)
8  (row 4,col 4)      (row 6 would wrap to row 1 but col 5 already contains 3)  
                      so place directly below 7
9  (row 3,col 4)      up‑right from 8
10 (row 2,col 5)
11 (row 1,col 1)
12 (row 2,col 2)      up‑right from 11 would hit filled square (row 0,col 2)  
                      ⇒ put directly below 11
13 (row 3,col 3)
14 (row 4,col 4)      but 8 already there ⇒ put below 13, i.e. (row 4,col 3)?  
                      (we track carefully and continue) …

Continuing this mechanical process right through k = 25 gives the completed square:

Row 1: 17  24   1   8  15  
Row 2: 23   5   7  14  16  
Row 3:  4   6  13  20  22  
Row 4: 10  12  19  21   3  
Row 5: 11  18  25   2   9  

────────────────────────
Step 4.  Check the sums

Rows
17+24+1+8+15 = 65  
23+5+7+14+16 = 65  
4+6+13+20+22 = 65  
10+12+19+21+3 = 65  
11+18+25+2+9 = 65  

Columns
17+23+4+10+11 = 65  
24+5+6+12+18 = 65  
1+7+13+19+25 = 65  
8+14+20+21+2 = 65  
15+16+22+3+9 = 65  

Main diagonals
17+5+13+21+9 = 65  
15+14+13+12+11 = 65  

Everything matches the magic constant, so the square is valid.

with the usual rules: each letter is a distinct non‑zero digit.

1.  Units:        R + L = 3 (or 13).  
   If the sum were 3 there would be no carry, but trying all possibilities quickly shows that leads to contradictions, so R + L = 13 with a carry 1.

2.  Tens:         E + A + 1 = 11  ⇒  E + A = 10 (carry 1).

3.  Hundreds:     I + R + 1 = 16  ⇒  I + R = 15 (carry 1).

4.  Thousands:    S + T + 1 = 15 or 5.  
   Only S + T = 14 works (carry 1).

5.  Ten‑thousands: O + S + 1 = 12  ⇒  O + S = 11 (carry 1).

6.  Hundred‑thousands: N + A + 1 = 7  ⇒  N + A = 6.

The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""
And so it was.
How many pearls were there in the bag?
How many daughters did the old man have?
How many pearls did each girl get?","If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","Let  

P        = number of pearls originally in the bag  
n        = number of daughters  
R₀ ,R₁…,Rₙ = pearls remaining after the 0‑th, 1‑st,…, n‑th girl has been served  
k        = number of pearls each girl finally receives (the Judge’s statement)  

Distribution rule for the i‑th daughter (i = 1,2,…,n)  

1. She first takes i pearls.  
2. Out of what is then left she takes one‑seventh.  

Hence the i‑th girl receives  

aᵢ = i + (1/7)(R_{i‑1} – i).                (1)

The remainder afterwards is  

Rᵢ = R_{i‑1} – aᵢ                             
    = R_{i‑1} – i – (1/7)(R_{i‑1} – i)       
    = (6/7)(R_{i‑1} – i).                     (2)

All girls finally have the same number of pearls, so  

aᵢ = k   for every i.                        (3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Express R_{i‑1} in terms of k and i
--------------------------------------------------------------------
From (1) and (3):      

k = i + (1/7)(R_{i‑1} – i)  
7k = 7i + R_{i‑1} – i  
R_{i‑1} = 7k – 6i.                            (4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Express Rᵢ in two ways and equate
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Using (2) and (4):

Rᵢ = (6/7)(R_{i‑1} – i)  
    = (6/7)(7k – 6i – i)  
    = (6/7)(7k – 7i)  
    = 6(k – i).                               (5)

But from (4) with i replaced by i+1 we also have  

Rᵢ = 7k – 6(i+1).                             (6)

Equate (5) and (6):

6(k – i) = 7k – 6(i+1)  
6k – 6i = 7k – 6i – 6  
⇒ k = 6.                                      (7)

Thus every girl finally receives k = 6 pearls.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Determine the remainders and stop when none are left
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Insert k = 6 into (4):

R_{i‑1} = 7·6 – 6i = 42 – 6i = 6(7 – i).     

As soon as the remainder becomes zero, the distribution ends:

R_n = 0 ⇒ 6(7 – n) = 0 ⇒ n = 6.              (8)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4: Initial number of pearls
--------------------------------------------------------------------
R₀ (the original total) is obtained from (4) with i = 1:

R₀ = 42 – 6·1 = 36.                           (9)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Verification (quick check)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Start with 36 pearls.

1st girl: takes 1 + (1/7)(35) = 1 + 5 = 6, remainder 30  
2nd girl: takes 2 + (1/7)(28) = 2 + 4 = 6, remainder 24  
3rd girl: takes 3 + (1/7)(21) = 3 + 3 = 6, remainder 18  
4th girl: takes 4 + (1/7)(14) = 4 + 2 = 6, remainder 12  
5th girl: takes 5 + (1/7)( 7) = 5 + 1 = 6, remainder 6  
6th girl: takes 6 + (1/7)( 0) = 6 + 0 = 6, remainder 0  

All six daughters receive 6 pearls, and none are left—exactly as required.

178,"At a certain fast food restaurant, Brain can buy 3 burgers, 7 shakes and one order of Fries for $120 exactly.

179,"Weedy Willie was getting too old to work the land alone so he decided to divide his cornfield between himself and his four sons in proportion to their five work rates. He knew that Rastus, Wig, Twig and Swig together could plant a field of corn in five hours whereas Wig, Twig and Swig and himself together could manage the same task in six hours. So Weedy divided his field into a two-digit square number of parts and kept just one part for himself. Now, Wig, Twig and Swig were identical triplets so each received the same whole number of parts.

2.  Express W and R in terms of t

An arc is a portion of a circle.","Step 1 – Why each line must be tangent to the circle  
A straight line can meet a circle in 0, 1, or 2 points.  
If it meets it in exactly one point the line is a tangent at that point.  
The problem states that the circle meets AO only at A and BO only at B, so AO and BO are tangents to the circle at A and B.

Step 2 – Relating the radii to the tangents  
A radius drawn to a point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line.  
Hence  
 CA ⟂ AO and  
 CB ⟂ BO.

Step 3 – Comparing the directions of CA and CB  
AO and BO are themselves perpendicular (given).  
Rotating a vector through 90° is an isometry, so if AO ⟂ BO then the two perpendicular directions to them, CA and CB, are also perpendicular.  
Therefore ∠ACB, the central angle between the radii CA and CB, is 90°.

Step 4 – Converting the central angle to an arc measure  
In a circle the measure of a minor arc equals the measure of its central angle.  
Hence the minor arc AB measures 90°.

Step 5 – Obtaining the larger arc  
The full circle is 360°.  
Larger arc AB = 360° − 90° = 270°.

That value is fixed by the geometry and is already integral, so it is the smallest (and only) possible integral measure for the larger arc.

183,"""I'm telling you, Kurt,"" Rod said to his best friend, ""these Rnkfurers are the greatest thing since whatever was before sliced bread!  They're low-calorie, high-protein, fortified with vitamins B-1, B-36, and F-22, and come with three months of basic cable!""
Kurt finally gave in, and agreed to go in with Rod on a minimum special order of the multi-colored treats.  When the box arrived, they divided the bounty as originally planned.
""Interesting,"" Kurt noted, ""that the number of Rnkfurers you got is the same integer as my percentage.""
Rod did a little mental math.  ""You're right,"" he noted, ""and I think that's the lowest pair of integers we could do that with.""
""Maybe; the next largest set is trivial.  50 Rnkfurers each, and then we'd each have the percentage the other guy got: 50% and 50 Rnkfurers each.""
Kurt unwrapped a Rnkfurer and took his first bite.  He glowed with pleasure for half a minute, and then spoke quietly.
""Rod, how many of these in a case?""
""Fifty.""
""I think we'd better order a few.  And this time, it's my turn to get more than you do.""
""Well, we can still arrange it so the number I get is your percentage of the total.""
Kurt did a little mental math this time.  ""Yeah, that's right.  I can't fit more than 100 in my desk at school, so this will do the trick.""
How many did each boy get each time?","Although there are a dozen pairs of numbers that satisfy the percentage condition, the three used in the story are the only ones in which each boy gets fewer than 100 Rnkfurers.","First order (the “minimum special order”)  
Let Rod receive R and Kurt receive K, so the total is T = R + K.

The condition “the number of Rnkfurers you got is the same integer as my percentage” means

  R  =  (K / T) · 100.  (1)

From (1), K = (R/100) T, so

  T = R + K = R + (R/100) T  
  ⟹ T(1 – R/100) = R  
  ⟹ T = 100R /(100 – R).  (2)

We need positive integers with R < T, K = T – R, and 0 < R < 100.  
Testing R = 1,2,3,… shows that the first R that makes T an integer is R = 20:

  T = 100·20 /(100 – 20) = 2000 / 80 = 25, K = 25 – 20 = 5.

So the smallest possible division is

  Rod 20  Kurt 5.

(They note that the next solution is the trivial 50 & 50 split when T = 100.)

Second order (multiples of 50, Kurt gets more)  
Now T must be a multiple of 50, Kurt wants more than Rod (K > R), and Kurt can store at most 100, i.e. K ≤ 100.  The same relation (2) holds.

Because K = T – R and K > R, we need T > 2R.  Substituting (2):

  100R /(100 – R) > 2R ⟹ R > 50.

Also K = R² /(100 – R) ≤ 100.  Checking the integers 51 ≤ R ≤ 99 that make T integral:

  R = 60  →  T = 100·60 /(100 – 60) = 6000 / 40 = 150 (which is 3 cases),  
       K = 150 – 60 = 90   (and 90 ≤ 100).

All larger integral solutions give K > 100, so this is the only one that fits Kurt’s limit.

Thus for the second purchase they buy 150 Rnkfurers and divide them

  Rod 60  Kurt 90.

3:12",,"Let the required 1 : 5 ratio be  

          X  :  5X

All nine non‑zero digits 1…9 must appear exactly once when the four‑digit number X and the five‑digit number 5X are written.

1.  X must be four digits  
    (because 4 + 5 = 9 digits in total, and 5X is necessarily the longer one).

2.  5X ends in 0 or 5.  
    Since 0 is forbidden, 5X ends in 5.  
    Hence the units‑digit of X must be 1, 3, 7 or 9 (because 5·1,3,7,9 all give a final 5).

3.  X is divisible by 3.  
    The digit sum of X + 5X is 45, a multiple of 9, so 6X ≡ 0 (mod 9) ⇒ X ≡ 0 (mod 3).

4.  Try the admissible unit digits:

    •  If the unit digit were 1, the next digit of 5X would be 0 or 5, both impossible (0 forbidden, 5 already used).  
       So the unit digit cannot be 1.

    •  Take the unit digit 3.  Then 5·3 = 15, so the units of 5X are 5, carry 1.

      Write X = ABC3 (A thousands, B hundreds, C tens).

      Tens of 5X = (5C +1) mod 10.  This is never 0 or 5, so it is admissible.

      Continue the multiplication systematically, demanding that every produced
      digit is new and non‑zero.  One consistent chain occurs with

However, the camel can only carry a maximum of 100 watermelons at a time. In addition to that, the camel eats one watermelon per each kilometer it travels.
The guy wants to bring to the fair as many watermelons as possible. How can he do it? And what is the maximum number?",What if the distance was just 1km? What if it was 2? What if it was 5?,"Let

• N = 1000 the number of melons at A,  
• d = 99 km the distance to B.  

Moving melons while the camel must come back for other loads costs extra melons.  
If, at some place, there are k full loads (k ≥ 2) still to be carried on, every forward kilometre costs  

 (2 k – 1) melons  

(1 km out with a load and 1 km back for each of the first k–1 loads; no return for the last load).

The optimal procedure is therefore: as soon as exactly one load (100 melons) has been eaten in a stage, the number of loads drops by one and the cost per kilometre falls.  
Keep doing this until the 99 km are covered.

Stage–by–stage

 start: 1000 melons = 10 loads, cost 19 mel/km  
 eat one load (100 mel) ⇒ distance = 100/19 km

 900 melons = 9 loads, cost 17 mel/km  
 eat one load ⇒ distance += 100/17 km

 800 melons = 8 loads, cost 15 mel/km  
 eat one load ⇒ distance += 20/3 km

 700 melons = 7 loads, cost 13 mel/km  
 eat one load ⇒ distance += 100/13 km

 600 melons = 6 loads, cost 11 mel/km  
 eat one load ⇒ distance += 100/11 km

 500 melons = 5 loads, cost 9 mel/km

 eat one load ⇒ distance += 100/7 km

 300 melons = 3 loads, cost 5 mel/km  
 eat one load ⇒ distance += 100/5 = 20 km

After these eight stages

 melons left = 200 (2 loads)  
 distance still to B = 99 – 79.9922196826… = 19.0077803174… km

188,"In the early years of the last century, a MADADIAN industrialist, Nastee, had employed 100 labourers to build his new improved Kebab and Rat Poison factory. Things were a little different those days, and the employment of labourers' wives and children was commonplace, although Nastee did not allow any woman to work without her husband. Also, at least half the men working came with their wives.
He paid five Madadian Wonks per day to each man, four Wonks to each woman and one Wonk to each child. He gave out 200 Wonks every evening.
How many men, women and children were working with Nastee?",,"Let  

m = number of men  
w = number of women  
c = number of children  

1. Total labourers  
 m + w + c = 100 … (1)

2. Daily wages (5, 4, 1 Wonks respectively)  
 5m + 4w + c = 200 … (2)

3. “No woman without her husband”  ⇒ w ≤ m  
4. “At least half the men came with their wives”  ⇒ w ≥ m⁄2

----------------------------------------------------
From (1): c = 100 − m − w

Insert in (2):  
5m + 4w + (100 − m − w) = 200  
⇒ 4m + 3w + 100 = 200  
⇒ 4m + 3w = 100 … (3)

Solve (3) in integers.  
Write m = 3k + 1 (since 4m + 3w = 100 ⇒ 100 − 4m ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ m ≡ 1 (mod 3)).  
Then

w = (100 − 4m)/3  
  = (100 − 4(3k + 1))/3  
  = (96 − 12k)/3 = 32 − 4k.

So

m = 3k + 1, w = 32 − 4k.

Use the inequalities:

a) w ≥ 0 ⇒ 32 − 4k ≥ 0 ⇒ k ≤ 8.  
b) w ≤ m ⇒ 32 − 4k ≤ 3k + 1 ⇒ 7k ≥ 31 ⇒ k ≥ 5.  
c) w ≥ m⁄2 ⇒ 32 − 4k ≥ (3k + 1)/2  
     ⇒ 64 − 8k ≥ 3k + 1 ⇒ 63 ≥ 11k ⇒ k ≤ 5.

Hence k must satisfy 5 ≤ k ≤ 5; thus k = 5.

Compute the numbers:

m = 3·5 + 1 = 16  
w = 32 − 4·5 = 12  
c = 100 − 16 − 12 = 72.

189,"A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Let  

  L = length of the bridge (km)  
  vₘ = man’s running speed (km/h)  
  vₜ = train’s speed = 80 km/h  
  x = man’s starting distance from A = 3/8 L  
  D = train’s distance behind A at the instant the man hears it (km)  

The moment the man hears the train, both start moving:

CASE 1 – Man runs back to A  
  Time for man:  t₁ = x / vₘ  
  Time for train: t₁ = D / vₜ  

CASE 2 – Man runs forward to B  
  Time for man:  t₂ = (L – x) / vₘ = (5/8 L)/vₘ  
  Time for train: t₂ = (D + L) / vₜ       (train must cover D to A plus L to B)

Because they meet simultaneously in each case,

(1)  x / vₘ = D / vₜ  
(2)  (L – x) / vₘ = (D + L) / vₜ

Divide (2) by (1):

[(L – x)/vₘ] / [x/vₘ] = [(D + L)/vₜ] / [D/vₜ]

(L – x)/x = (D + L)/D

Plug x = 3/8 L and L – x = 5/8 L:

(5/8 L)/(3/8 L) = (D + L)/D  
5/3 = (D + L)/D  
5D = 3D + 3L  
2D = 3L  
D = (3/2) L

Now use equation (1) to get vₘ:

x / vₘ = D / vₜ  
vₘ = x · vₜ / D  
     = (3/8 L) · 80 / (3/2 L)

What is the number?",,"Let n be the unknown number and examine the three conditional statements one by one.

Write the implications and their contrapositives.

   Contrapositive: If n is not in 70–79, then n is a multiple of 6.     …(iii)

Now split the possibilities by the three decade–intervals that appear.

A. 50–59  
Here D (in 50–59) is true, but n is not in 60–69 (so by (i) n must be a multiple of 4) and not in 70–79 (so by (iii) n must be a multiple of 6). Hence n must be a multiple of lcm(4,6)=12 inside 50–59. No such number exists (multiples of 12 are …48, 60…), so this interval is impossible.

B. 60–69  
Here n is not in 50–59 ⇒ by (ii) n is not a multiple of 3.  
Also n is not in 70–79 ⇒ by (iii) n is a multiple of 6 (hence of 3).  
Contradiction. Thus 60–69 is impossible.

C. 70–79  
Here n is not in 50–59 ⇒ by (ii) n is not a multiple of 3.  
Also n is not in 60–69 ⇒ by (i) n is a multiple of 4.

So within 70–79 we need multiples of 4 that are not multiples of 3.  
Multiples of 4 in that decade: 72, 76.  
72 is also a multiple of 3, so discard it.  
76 is not a multiple of 3, hence satisfies all conditions.

Finally, check the original statements for n = 76:

• 76 is a multiple of 4 → the antecedent of (1) is false, so (1) holds.  
• 76 is not a multiple of 3 → antecedent of (2) is false, so (2) holds.  
• 76 is not a multiple of 6 and indeed lies in 70–79 → (3) holds.

Numbering columns from units (rightmost, column 1) to hundred‑thousands (leftmost, column 6) gives

column 1 : T + S + A + E = T + 10 c₁
column 2 : I + E + L + c₁ = R + 10 c₂
column 3 : K + T + c₂     = O + 10 c₃
column 4 : 9 + T + c₃     = F + 10 c₄
column 5 : T + I + c₄     = F + 10 c₅
column 6 : L + c₅         = 7 + 10 c₆        (E = 7, A = 9)

Step‑by‑step deductions

1.  Units column:  T + S + 9 + 7 = T + 10 c₁  → S + 16 = 10 c₁  
   The only single digit giving a multiple of 10 is S = 4 with c₁ = 2.

2.  Tens column:  I + 7 + L + 2 = R + 10 c₂ → I + L + 9 = R + 10 c₂  
   The sum I + L + 9 is at least 10, so c₂ = 1 or 2.  Later we find c₂ = 2.

3.  Hundred‑th column:  K + T + c₂ = O + 10 c₃.  
   As we will see, c₃ = 0, so O = K + T + 2 < 10.

4.  Thousand‑th column:  9 + T + c₃ = F + 10 c₄.

5.  Ten‑thousand column: T + I + c₄ = F + 10 c₅.

6.  Hundred‑thousand column: L + c₅ = 7 (since c₆ = 0).  
   Hence c₅ = 1 and L = 6 (L ≠ 7).

7.  With c₅ = 1, equation (5) gives T + I + c₄ = F + 10.  
   Equation (4) together with (5) forces c₄ = 1, c₃ = 0 and yields  
   I = 8 and F = T – 1.

8.  Tens column now: I + L + 9 = 8 + 6 + 9 = 23 = R + 10 c₂.  
   Therefore c₂ = 2 and R = 3.

9.  Since F = T – 1 and digits must be distinct and unused (0,1,2,5 remain free),  
   trying T = 1 makes F = 0 (allowed).  
   Now O = K + T + 2 = K + 3.  Choosing K = 2 gives O = 5 (all digits distinct).  
   All other possibilities clash with already‑used digits, so this is the only fit.

The full assignment is therefore

A = 9  
E = 7  
S = 4  
L = 6  
I = 8  
R = 3  
T = 1  
F = 0  
K = 2  
O = 5

Verification:

       IT      = 81
     TAKES     = 19274
         A     = 9
     LITTLE    = 681167

     EFFORT    = 700531

All sums and digit‑uniqueness conditions are satisfied.

194,"Difficult Danny has acquired his nickname (and some other, less polite nicknames) due to the fact that, whenever he buys anything, he insists upon paying the exact amount, with precisely 100 pieces of currency. Danny wanted an xCube365 (it lasts 365 days before programmatically disabling itself, so that a new one must be purchased), the highly coveted gaming system that had just been released. It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?",,"Let  

a = number of $1 bills  
b = number of $5 bills  
c = number of $10 bills  
d = number of $20 bills  
e = number of $50 bills  
f = number of $100 bills  

1.  He pays with exactly 100 bills:  
   a + b + c + d + e + f = 100. … (1)

2.  The total value is \$230:  
   1·a + 5·b + 10·c + 20·d + 50·e + 100·f = 230. … (2)

Subtract (1) from (2):

   4b + 9c + 19d + 49e + 99f = 130. … (3)

Because 99 f ≤ 130, f can only be 0 or 1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Case f = 1  
Then (3) gives 4b + 9c + 19d + 49e = 31, impossible if e ≥ 1, so e = 0.  
The only solutions of 4b + 9c + 19d = 31 are  
(b,c,d) = (3,0,1) or (1,3,0).  
Both give two different zero–counts (c = 0 and e = 0, or d = 0 and e = 0); having two denominations with 0 bills produces many “0 × x = 0” triples, violating the “exactly one triplet” rule.  
So no solution with f = 1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Case f = 0  
Equation (3) becomes 4b + 9c + 19d + 49e = 130.  
Since 49·3 = 147 > 130, e is 0, 1 or 2.

• e = 0 → every solution has at least two zeros (e itself and f), again producing too many 0‑triples.

• e = 1 gives 4b + 9c + 19d = 81.  
  Among its positive solutions, the only one leaving exactly one zero–count is  
  (b,c,d) = (1,2,1) or (2,6,1) or (4,3,2); none of these yield a unique multiplication triple.

• e = 2 gives 4b + 9c + 19d = 32.  
  The positive‑integer solution (b,c,d) = (1,1,1) works, because it leaves only one zero (f).  

   a  = 100 − (b + c + d + e + f)  
      = 100 − (1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0)  
      = 95.

So the tentative bill‑counts are  

a = 95,  b = 1,  c = 1,  d = 1,  e = 2,  f = 0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Checking the conditions

• Number of bills: 95 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 100 ✓  
• Value: 95·1 + 1·5 + 1·10 + 1·20 + 2·50 + 0·100  
          = 95 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 100 = 230 ✓  

• Exactly one multiplication triplet:  
  The six counts are 95, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0.  
  Three different denominations ($5, $10, $20) each have a count of 1, and  

     1 × 1 = 1

  is a true multiplication sentence using those three denominations.  
  Because every other denomination has a different, non‑unit count, and there is only one zero‑count, no other distinct set of three denominations can satisfy x · y = z.  
  Hence there is exactly one valid triplet. ✓

All requirements are met.

196,"Mad Ade bought a little box of midget matches, each one inch in length. He found that he could arrange them all in the form of a triangle whose area was just as many square inches as there were matches.
Mad Ade then used up six of the matches, and found that with the remainder he could again construct another triangle whose area was just as many square inches as there were matches.
And using another six matches Mad Ade could again do precisely the same.
How many matches were there in the box originally?
Note that the match-box can hold maximum of 50 matches.",There are two possible answers!,"Let  

 a,b,c = lengths (in inches) of the three sides that Mad Ade makes with his matches  
 P = a+b+c = number of matches used (each match is one inch long)  
 A = area (in square inches) of the triangle.  

The statement “area equals number of matches’’ is

 A = P. …(1)

By Heron’s formula

 A² = s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c)  where s = P/2 (the semiperimeter).

Insert (1):

 P² = 4s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c) = 4s·x·y·z,

with the abbreviations

 x = s−a, y = s−b, z = s−c. 

But P = 2s, so

 (2s)² = 4s·xyz ⇒ xyz = 4s. …(2)

Moreover

 x + y + z = s, x,y,z > 0  (because a,b,c are positive and satisfy the triangle inequalities).

So for every admissible triangle the positive integers (x,y,z,s) must satisfy simultaneously

 x + y + z = s, xyz = 4s, s ≤ 25  (because P = 2s ≤ 50).

We now look for all s (3 ≤ s ≤ 25) for which such a triple (x,y,z) exists.

A short enumeration gives

   s = 12 with (x,y,z) = (2,4,6): xyz = 48 = 4·12  
   s = 15 with (x,y,z) = (2,3,10): xyz = 60 = 4·15  
   s = 18 with (x,y,z) = (1,8,9): xyz = 72 = 4·18  

No other s ≤ 25 works.

These three semiperimeters give the perimeters (number of matches)

   P₁ = 2·12 = 24 matches  
   P₂ = 2·15 = 30 matches

They differ successively by six, exactly as required:

   P₃ = P₂ + 6, P₂ = P₁ + 6.

Corresponding integer–sided triangles are

198,"Detective Grant was inspecting the scene of the crime. The 50-year-old victim, Joe, had been poisoned by a candy containing cyanide. On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table. John, 46, was found with 5 candies the day after a 4-yr sentence had been turned over a week ago. Jim, 35, had gotten off a 5-yr sentence a few days ago, only to be found dead with 6 candies yesterday.
Grant puzzled over these cases for days, and then -boom- it hit him. There was a pattern in these murders! What pattern did Grant spot?

199,Lester has 40 kilograms of wheat. He has a simple balance and 4 weights of whole number denominations. The 4 weights are such that he is able to measure any whole number amount of wheat from 1 to 40 (no fractions). He can use a combination of two or more weights on any side of the balance as required. He can also use one weight on the left side and two or more weights on the right along with the wheat to weigh the required amount if necessary. What are the 4 weights Lester has?,,"Reasoning step–by–step  

1.  Let the four weights (whole numbers) be  
   w₁ < w₂ < w₃ < w₄ .

2.  To be able to weigh 1 kg of wheat, the lightest weight must be 1 kg,  
   so w₁ = 1.

3.  Suppose with the first k – 1 weights we can produce every integer mass
   from 1 up to N kilograms (by putting the older weights on either side of the
   balance).  
   With those weights we can offset as much as N kilograms on the same side as
   the wheat, so a new weight wₖ put on the opposite pan can represent every
   mass from wₖ – N up to wₖ + N.  
   For there to be no gap at N + 1 we need

             wₖ – N ≤ N + 1   ⇒   wₖ ≤ 2N + 1.        (★)

   Condition (★) is therefore necessary.  
   If we always make it an equality, each new weight is as small as possible,
   which maximises the total range attainable with a fixed number of weights.

4.  Apply (★) successively:

   • k = 2:  N = w₁ = 1       ⇒   w₂ ≤ 2·1 + 1 = 3.  
     Since w₂ > w₁, either w₂ = 2 or 3.

     – If w₂ = 2, the heaviest total after two weights is 1 + 2 = 3.  
       Then (★) gives w₃ ≤ 2·3 + 1 = 7 and w₄ ≤ 2·(3 + w₃) + 1 ≤ 21,  
       so the greatest possible total weight is < 1 + 2 + 7 + 21 = 31 < 40.  
       Thus w₂ ≠ 2.

     – Therefore w₂ = 3 and after two weights N = 1 + 3 = 4.

   • k = 3:  w₃ ≤ 2·4 + 1 = 9.  
     Taking w₃ smaller than 9 again leaves too small a total to reach 40 kg,
     so we must have w₃ = 9.  Then N becomes 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.

   • k = 4:  w₄ ≤ 2·13 + 1 = 27.  
     The total of the four weights must be at least 40 kg (so that 40 kg of
     wheat can be balanced with all the weights on the other pan).
     With w₁ + w₂ + w₃ = 13, this forces w₄ ≥ 27, hence w₄ = 27.

5.  Thus the only possible set is {1 kg, 3 kg, 9 kg, 27 kg}.

6.  Verification:  Every integer 1 … 40 has a balanced‑ternary
   representation using the digits –1, 0, 1 with radices 1, 3, 9, 27
   respectively; putting the “–1” weights on the wheat side and the “1”
   weights on the opposite side realises that representation on the balance.  
   Therefore all required masses can indeed be weighed.

And for £2.99, Mad Ade can buy a mixed packet containing 3 pounds of almonds, 1 pound of walnuts, and 1 pound of filberts.

  b = price (£) of 1 lb Brazil nuts

(1) w + 2b = 1.98  
(2) w + 4f = 2.48  
(3) w + f + 3a = 2.99  

We need the cost of one pound of every nut:

 S = w + b + f + a.

Rather than solve for each variable, look for a linear combination of (1)–(3) whose left‑hand side equals w + b + f + a.

Suppose we take ½ of (1), 1⁄6 of (2) and 1⁄3 of (3):

Left‑hand side:
½(w + 2b) + 1⁄6(w + 4f) + 1⁄3(w + f + 3a)

Right‑hand side (the costs):
½(1.98) + 1⁄6(2.48) + 1⁄3(2.99)

9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9  

and try to reach 1990 by splitting them into blocks and inserting the four allowed operations.

1.  A convenient starting point is
   999 + 999 = 1998,  
   already very close to 1990.

2.  To lower 1998 to 1990 we must subtract 8.  
   One way to make 8 from 9’s is 9 – 9/9 = 9 – 1 = 8.

3.  So  
   999 + 999 – (9 – 9/9) = 1990.

   Up to here we have used only 9 of the 15 digits (the two 999’s and the 9 – 9/9).

4.  The six unused 9’s can be added in cancelling “+9–9” pairs, which change nothing:
   +9–9+9–9+9–9  ≡  0.

5.  Writing everything in order, without changing the sequence of digits, gives

   999 + 999 – 9 + 9/9 + 9 – 9 + 9 – 9 + 9 – 9 = 1990.

   • 999 (digits 1‑3)  
   • +999 (digits 4‑6)  
   • –9  (digit 7)  
   • +9/9 (digits 8‑9)  
   • +9–9+9–9+9–9 (digits 10‑15)

   All fifteen 9’s are used, in their original order, and the value is indeed 1990:

   999 + 999 = 1998  
   1998 – 9 = 1989  
   9/9 = 1 ⇒ 1989 + 1 = 1990  
   each subsequent +9 – 9 pair adds 0, so the result stays 1990.

205,"When Nora and Corman stopped by the school to whisk Monette off to lunch, the poor principal was hemmed in by two tall, annoyed math students.
""My answer is right, and I want my three points!"" the blond one cried.
""But it's not the answer Mr. Collins left on the key!""
""He's wrong,"" the other one insisted.  ""My answer is right!""
Corman leaned over to whisper in Nora's ear, ""Does she need our help?""
""Yours, probably.  Mr. Collins is at a conference for the weekend, and Monette took his math class.  It looks like she handed back an exam.""
""I teach math.  Can I help?""
All three talked at once; Monette was as frustrated as the two students.  While they jabbered, Corman managed to read the problem in question:
""My house is built on a strangely-shaped lot, so my back yard is a right triangle with an area of 840 square feet.  Each of the three sides measures an integral number of feet.  If I want to stake my dog so that he can reach the entire yard, how long must his rope be?""
Monette finally pulled rank on the adolescents.  ""It's not really your problem, but I'd be glad of some help.  Mr. Collins marked their papers wrong; their answers don't match his.  The students *sound* right, but math was too long ago for me; I'm not sure.  To make matters worse, they don't even agree with each other.""
""I see,"" said Corman, playing for time while he mentally checked the answer on the key in Monette's trembling hand.  ""That's the answer Mr. Collins left you?""
""Yes,"" she began.
""The right answer is 8 feet shorter,"" the blond claimed.
""No, it's a lot longer,"" insisted the other.
Corman held up a hand for peace.  ""Actually, you *could* all be correct.""
""How can there be ... oh, it's one of those problems with an infinite number of right answers, because we're missing a clue?""
""Well, let me see your work.""  The students handed him their papers; he followed the algebra, nodding for almost a minute.
""Nice work.  You've found the only three right answers.""
""How can there be exactly three?  Usually, it's one, two, or infinity?""
""Usually, you're right.  Welcome to discrete math.  When you restrict things to whole numbers sometimes they don't work out so simply.""
How much rope did Mr. Collins really need?",Mr. Collins's answer key gives the actual dimensions of the yard; he didn't realize there were two other answers from the hints he gave.,"To be able to “reach the entire yard’’ the dog has to be tied at the one point that is farthest from every place in the yard – the centre of the circle that just contains the whole triangular yard.  
For any right‑angled triangle that circle is the circumcircle whose diameter is the hypotenuse, so the required length of rope is the radius  

                 rope length = (circumradius) = ½ × (hypotenuse).

Therefore we must first find every right‑angled triangle of integral side–lengths that has area 840 ft², then take half of its hypotenuse.

1.  Let the two legs be a and b (integral); area = ½ab = 840, so  

                                ab = 1680.

2.  We need a² + b² to be a perfect square c² (integral hypotenuse).  
    List the factor pairs of 1680 and test them:

            (24,70)  → 24²+70² = 576+4900 = 5476 = 74²
            (40,42)  → 40²+42² = 1600+1764 = 3364 = 58²
            (15,112) → 15²+112² = 225+12544 = 12769 = 113²

    No other factor pair of 1680 gives a perfect square, so there are exactly three
    integral right triangles with area 840 ft²:

            24–70–74  40–42–58  15–112–113.

3.  The three corresponding rope lengths are half their hypotenuses:

            74/2 = 37 ft
            58/2 = 29 ft
           113/2 = 56.5 ft

    (These are precisely the three answers the two students and Mr Collins obtained:
     29 ft is 8 ft shorter than the 37 ft on the key, while 56½ ft is “a lot longer.”)

Thus Mr Collins’ answer of 37 feet is perfectly correct for one of the three possible
yards, and together the three numbers above are the only possible correct answers

206,"Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"Let  

  P  = selling price per box (dollars)  
  C  = production/marketing cost per box (dollars)  
  Q  = number of boxes sold each week  
  W  = weekly profit  

1.  Find the constant unit‑cost.  
   At the given price $5.95 the profit per box is $1.75, hence  

        C = 5.95 − 1.75 = $4.20 .

2.  Express quantity demanded as a function of price.  
   Each $0.20 decrease raises sales by 25 boxes, i.e.  

        ΔQ / ΔP = 25 / (−0.20) = −125 .  

   Using the point (P,Q) = (5.95 , 100),

        Q(P) = 100 − 125(P − 5.95)
              = 843.75 − 125P .

3.  Write the profit function.  

        W(P) = (price − cost) · quantity
              = (P − 4.20)(843.75 − 125P) .

4.  Maximize W(P).  
   Differentiate and set to zero:

        W′(P) = (1)(843.75 − 125P) + (P − 4.20)(−125)
               = 843.75 − 125P − 125P + 525
               = 1368.75 − 250P .

        1368.75 − 250P = 0  ⇒  P = 1368.75 / 250 = 5.475 .

5.  Interpret the result.  
   The profit‑maximising price is $5.475 ≈ $5.48 per box.

207,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote an equation on a rock:
SLIDE
-DEAN
______
3651
""Each letter in the equation represents a different digit,"" said the troll. ""The letters in the password represent 3651.""
So, what is the password?",,"We look for digits (0‑9) to replace the letters in

          SLIDE
        –   DEAN
        ----------

with each letter standing for a different digit.

Column‑by‑column subtraction with possible borrows gives these conditions:

1. S – borrow₄ = 0  ⇒  borrow₄ = 1 and S = 1.  
2. Because of this borrow₄, the thousands column must have borrowed, so borrow₃ = 1.  
   Hence L – borrow₃ + 10 – D = 3  ⇒  D = L + 6.  
   With digits 0–9 this allows (L,D) = (0,6), (2,8), (3,9).
3. In the hundreds column (with borrow₃ = 1):

        I – borrow₂ + 10 – E = 6
        ⇒  E = I + 4  (if borrow₂ = 0)  or  E = I + 3  (if borrow₂ = 1).

4. In the tens column:

        D – borrow₁ – A = 5   (if borrow₂ = 0)
        D – borrow₁ + 10 – A = 5  ⇒  A = D – borrow₁ + 5   (if borrow₂ = 1).

5. In the units column:

        E – N = 1   (borrow₁ = 0),  or  E = 0 , N = 9   (borrow₁ = 1).

Trying the possibilities quickly eliminates all but one consistent assignment:

   S = 1,  L = 3,  I = 2,  D = 9,  E = 6,  A = 4,  N = 5

which gives

          1 3 2 9 6
        –   9 6 4 5
        --------------
            3 6 5 1

Indeed 13296 – 9645 = 3651, and every letter has a distinct digit.

Therefore the digits 3‑6‑5‑1 correspond respectively to the letters

   3 → L,   6 → E,   5 → N,   1 → S.

Peru    200,000
Brazil  340,000

How many people were listed as living in Tibet?",,"Let the computer’s “population” function be P(word).

Look at the words already given and separate each letter into  
vowels (A E I O U) and consonants.

USA  → vowels = 2 (U A), consonants = 1 (S)  
Population shown: 130 000 ⇒ 13×10 000

England → vowels = 2 (E A), consonants = 5 (N G L N D)  
Population shown: 410 000 ⇒ 41×10 000

Try to express 13 and 41 from the vowel / consonant counts.  
Assume  

each vowel contributes v,  
each consonant contributes c.

Then for USA: 2v + 1c = 13 … (1)  
for England: 2v + 5c = 41 … (2)

Subtract (2)–(1): 4c = 28 → c = 7  
Insert into (1): 2v + 7 = 13 → v = 3

So the computer counts

• 3 “people” for every vowel,  
• 7 “people” for every consonant,

and then multiplies the total by 10 000 to dress the answer up as a population.

Check this rule on the other examples:

France (v=2, c=4) 2·3 + 4·7 = 6 + 28 = 34 → 340 000 ✔  
Peru   (v=2, c=2) 2·3 + 2·7 = 6 + 14 = 20 → 200 000 ✔  
Brazil (v=2, c=4) 2·3 + 4·7 = 34 → 340 000 ✔  
Greece (v=3, c=3) 3·3 + 3·7 = 9 + 21 = 30 → 300 000 ✔  
Japan  (v=2, c=3) 2·3 + 3·7 = 6 + 21 = 27 → 270 000 ✔

The rule works for every case.

Now apply it to “Tibet”.

Tibet has the letters T I B E T  
vowels = I, E → 2 vowels  
consonants = T, B, T → 3 consonants

Population value = 2·3 + 3·7 = 6 + 21 = 27

Normally, you would touch each tiny one by one by one cube and they would fall off. However, with new quantum technology, it has become more interesting. You may say the total number of possible cubes (not necessarily with side length one) in the twelve by twelve by twelve Rubik's cube, and hocus-pocus, cubes of all sizes would appear. Assuming that each side in the tiny cubes has length one and that you may only make cubes of integer side length, what number should you say for the new technology to work?","For 1^3+2^3+... n^3, use (1+2+...n)^2.","Step 1 ‒ Understand what is being counted  
Every “cube” we are to create must  
• be aligned with the 12 × 12 × 12 grid,  
• have all edges parallel to the large cube’s edges,  
• have integer side length 1,2,…,12.

So we are really counting all axis–parallel sub‑cubes contained in the big cube.

Step 2 ‒ Count cubes of a fixed side length k  
Pick a side length k (1 ≤ k ≤ 12).  
Along each coordinate axis the left‑front‑bottom corner of such a k×k×k cube can start at any integer position from 1 up to 12−k+1.  
Number of choices in x-direction: 12−k+1  
Same in y and in z.  

Therefore, for this k, the number of k×k×k cubes is  
(12−k+1)³.

Step 3 ‒ Sum over all admissible k  
Total cubes = Σ_{k=1}^{12}(12−k+1)³.  
Let s = 12−k+1; as k runs from 1 to 12, s runs from 12 down to 1, so

Total cubes = Σ_{s=1}^{12}s³.

Step 4 ‒ Evaluate the sum of cubes  
For any n, 1³+2³+⋯+n³ = [n(n+1)/2]².

Australia –  500  
Peru – 8 000  
India – 4 500  
Scotland – 9 500  

Notice that every number is a multiple of 500.  Divide each distance by 500:

500 ÷ 500 = 1  
8 000 ÷ 500 = 16  
4 500 ÷ 500 = 9

A  = 1  
P  = 16  
I  = 9  
S  = 19  

So the faulty atlas is computing

distance = 500 × (position of first letter in the alphabet).

214,"Alec, Brett and Chris each purchased parts for their skateboards at the sports store. Alec and Brett wanted to build new skateboards, so they each needed to purchase a deck, trucks, bearings and wheels. Chris only needed new wheels. The store offers a 10% discount for purchases over $250, so the boys decided to pay for all the parts together to qualify for the discount. Altogether, the boys spent $266.40. The clues below reflect the price of the items before the discount is applied.
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
They each bought the same kinds of wheels. Together they spent $75 for the 3 sets of wheels. Each set contained 4 wheels.
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his. However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Brett spent $3 more on bearings than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
How much did each person spend?",,"Let  

D_A , T_A , B_A , W         = Alec’s deck, trucks, bearings, wheels

W                            = price of one set of wheels (all three boys bought the same wheels)  

1. 3 sets of wheels cost \$75  
 ⇒ W = 75/3 = \$25  

2. Total wheels cost – total bearings cost = \$24  
 ⇒ 3W – (B_A + B_B) = 24  
 ⇒ 75 – (B_A + B_B) = 24  
 ⇒ B_A + B_B = \$51  

3. Bearings cost \$1 more than Alec’s deck  
 ⇒ B_A + B_B = D_A + 1 = 51  
 ⇒ D_A = \$50  

4. Alec’s deck is \$5 more than Brett’s  
 ⇒ D_A = D_B + 5 → D_B = 50 – 5 = \$45

  B_A + 2 B_A + 3 = 51 → 3 B_A = 48 → B_A = \$16  
  B_B = 2·16 + 3 = \$35  

6. Brett’s trucks cost \$5 more than Alec’s  
 ⇒ T_B = T_A + 5  

7. Total pre‑discount amount is \$296 (because \$266.40 is 90 % of the bill).  
   Add what we already know:  
   decks 50 + 45 = 95  
   bearings 16 + 35 = 51  
   wheels 3·25 = 75  
   subtotal = 95 + 51 + 75 = 221

218,"A man had a clock with an hour hand and a minute hand of the same length and indistinguishable. If the clock was set going at noon, what would be the first time that it would be impossible, by reason of the similarity of the hands, to be sure of the correct time?
In grappling with this little problem, you may assume that it is possible to indicate fractions of a second. On this assumption, an exact answer can be given.",,"Let t  hours (0<t<12) be the true time after 12 o’clock.

Positions of the hands (measured as fractions of one revolution from 12):

hour‑hand H(t) = t/12  
minute‑hand M(t) = t − ⌊t⌋ (the fractional part of t)

Because the hands are indistinguishable, the indication at the true time t will also be obtained at some other time s ≠ t provided the two positions are interchanged:

H(t) = M(s)    and    M(t) = H(s).             (1)

Write  
t = k + u with k = ⌊t⌋, 0 ≤ u < 1  
s = m + v with m = ⌊s⌋, 0 ≤ v < 1.

Substituting in (1):

t/12 = v                        (2)  
u   = (m + v)/12.             (3)

From (2) v = t/12 = (k + u)/12.

Insert this in (3):

u = (m + (k + u)/12)/12  
12u = m + (k + u)/12  
144u = 12m + k + u  
143u = 12m + k.               (4)

Now t = k + u, so

t = k + (12m + k)/143 = (12m + 144k)/143.      (5)

We want the very first positive solution.

Take k = 0 (so 0 < t < 1 hr); then (5) gives

t = 12m / 143.

To keep t under 1 hour we need m ≤ 11.  
The smallest positive m is 1, giving

t = 12/143 hour.

No solution with k > 0 can give a smaller t, because k itself would already be at least 1 hour. Hence this is the first ambiguous instant.

Convert t to ordinary units:

t = 12/143 hour = (12/143)·60 min = 720/143 min  
        = 5 min + 5/143 min  
        = 5 min + (5·60)/143 s  
        = 5 min 300/143 s  
        ≈ 5 min 2.097 902 s.

Thus, just a little more than five minutes after noon the two identical hands stand in positions that could equally well be read as a little after 1 o’clock with the hands interchanged. From that instant onward the clock cannot be read with certainty.

219,Two and a half artists spend two and a half hours painting two and a half models on two and a half canvases. How many artists are necessary to paint twenty-four models on twenty-four canvases in twenty hours?,,"Step 1.  Extract the basic “work” rate from the given data.  
2.5 artists working for 2.5 hours produce 2.5 finished model‑on‑canvas paintings.

Step 2.  Compute the amount of artist‑time needed for one finished painting.  
Total artist‑hours used = 2.5 artists × 2.5 hours = 6.25 artist‑hours.  
Paintings produced = 2.5.  
Artist‑hours per painting = 6.25 / 2.5 = 2.5 artist‑hours.

Equivalently: one artist needs 2.5 hours to finish one model on its canvas.

Step 3.  Determine total artist‑hours required for the new job.  
We now need 24 paintings.  
Required artist‑hours = 24 paintings × 2.5 artist‑hours/painting = 60 artist‑hours.

Step 4.  Convert the total artist‑hours to a headcount given the available time.  
The work must be completed in 20 hours.  
Let N be the number of artists.  Then

with a,b,c,d,e non–negative integers.  
Each solution (a,b,c,d,e) corresponds to one way to change a dollar, so we just have to count the solutions.

Step 1 – choose the number of 50‑cent coins e.

e = 0,1,2 are the only possibilities.

────────────────────────────────────────
Case 1: e = 0   (no 50‑cent coins)

Need 100 cents from 25,10,5,1.

Fix the number d of 25‑cent coins (d = 0…4).  
For each d the remainder is R = 100 – 25d.

For that R count pairs (c,b) with 10c + 5b ≤ R; once c and b are chosen,
a is forced and non‑negative, so there is exactly one a for each (c,b).

Number of pairs (c,b) = Σ_{c=0}^{⌊R/10⌋} ( ⌊(R−10c)/5⌋ + 1 )

Carrying this out:

d  R  c‑range  counts
0 100 0–10  21,19,17,15,13,11,9,7,5,3,1  → 121
1  75 0–7   16,14,12,10,8,6,4,2          →  72

4   0        only (0,0)                  →   1

Total for e = 0: 121 + 72 + 36 + 12 + 1 = 242.

────────────────────────────────────────
Case 2: e = 1   (one 50‑cent coin)

Now we must form 50 cents from 25,10,5,1.

d  R  c‑range  counts
0  50 0–5   11,9,7,5,3,1  → 36
1  25 0–2    6,4,2        → 12
2   0        only (0,0)   →  1

Total for e = 1: 36 + 12 + 1 = 49.

• F be the top of the fence, 8 ft above the ground.  
• T be the top of the tree (height h to be found).  

Horizontal distances (all measured straight back from Homer):  

E → F : 5 ft  
F → T : 200 ft  
Therefore E → T : 5 ft + 200 ft = 205 ft

Since the line of sight from E just grazes the top of the fence before reaching T, the points E, F and T are collinear.

1. Compute the slope of the line of sight using E and F:
   vertical rise EF = 8 ft – 5.583 ft = 2.417 ft  
   horizontal run EF = 5 ft  
   slope m = 2.417 ft / 5 ft = 0.4834

If each phone call takes 30 seconds, and it takes each person 90 seconds to get out of the building, how long will it take to empty all 375 apartments?",Fibonacci might have the answer!,"Think in half‑minute units (one 30‑second “tick”).

1.  Let M(t) be the greatest number of flats that can have been warned after t ticks.

2.  Basis

   t = 1  M(1)=1 (Dave makes one call)

3.  Recurrence for t ≥ 2

   • In tick 2 Dave rings the second resident; that resident has t–2 ticks left and can warn at most M(t–2) more people.

ABCD x 4 = DCBA","If ABCD is being multiplied by 4, the answer must be even. Therefore, A, which is the last digit of the answer, must be even.","Step‑by‑step reasoning

1.  Write the four–digit numbers with carries  
   ABCD × 4 = DCBA  

   Units: 4·D = A + 10k₁  
   Tens:  4·C + k₁ = B + 10k₂  
   Hundreds: 4·B + k₂ = C + 10k₃  
   Thousands: 4·A + k₃ = D   (no further carry, so ≤9)

2.  From the thousands column  
   4A + k₃ ≤ 9.  
   Hence A can only be 1 or 2.

3.  Units column condition (A = 4D mod 10) rules out A = 1, because 4·D never ends in 1.  
   Therefore A = 2.

4.  With A = 2, thousands gives  
   4·2 + k₃ = 8 + k₃ = D ≤ 9 ⇒ k₃ = 0 and D = 8.

5.  Units column with D = 8 gives  
   4·8 = 32 ⇒ A = 2 (already satisfied) and carry k₁ = 3.

6.  Let k₂ be the carry from the tens column (0–3).  
   Hundreds column: 4B + k₂ = C (since k₃ = 0, the value is <10).  
   Tens column: 4C + k₁ = B + 10k₂, with k₁ = 3.

7.  Substitute C = 4B + k₂ into the tens equation:  
   4(4B + k₂) + 3 = B + 10k₂  
   16B + 4k₂ + 3 = B + 10k₂  
   15B − 6k₂ + 3 = 0 ⇒ 5B − 2k₂ = −1.

   Testing k₂ = 0, 1, 2, 3, only k₂ = 3 works, giving B = 1.

8.  Then C = 4B + k₂ = 4·1 + 3 = 7.

   FLY + FLY + FLY = 3·FLY = AWAY is a 4‑digit number, the first digit A must be 1 or 2 (because 3·999 = 2997).

2.  Units column

      3Y ≡ Y  (mod 10)  ⇒  2Y ≡ 0 (mod 10)  ⇒  Y = 5 (digits are non‑zero).  
      3·5 = 15 gives a carry c₁ = 1 to the tens column.

3.  Tens column  
      3·L + c₁ = 3L + 1.  
      The digit written is A and the carry to the hundreds column is c₂.  
      So 3L + 1 = 10·c₂ + A  with A = 1 or 2.  
      Trying L = 1,…,9 gives only one possibility:

      Write W and carry c₃ to the thousands column:  
      3F + 2 = 10·c₃ + W,   c₃ = A = 2.  
      Thus 3F + 2 is between 20 and 29:  20 ≤ 3F + 2 ≤ 29

231,What is the smallest integer greater than 0 that can be written entirely with zeros and ones and is evenly divisible by 225?,,"Because the number must be divisible by 225 = 9·25, it has to satisfy simultaneously  

• divisibility by 25 ⟹ its last two decimal digits are 00,  
• divisibility by 9  ⟹ the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.

Since only the digits 0 and 1 are allowed, the digit–sum equals the number of 1’s that appear.

1.  The last two digits are fixed as 00, so all other digits (call their number k) precede these two zeros.  
2.  To make the digit–sum a multiple of 9 we need at least 9 ones; hence k ≥ 9.  
3.  Putting nine 1’s into exactly those k positions, the fewest total digits (and therefore the smallest magnitude) occurs when k = 9, giving an 11–digit number.  
4.  To minimise the value we push every possible 1 as far to the right (toward the least–significant positions) as we can, leaving only the leading digit forced to be 1.  
   Thus the pattern is  

   1 11111111 00  
   (one leading 1, eight more 1’s, and the required trailing 00).

   That number is  

   11111111100.

5.  Check:  
   • it ends in 00 ⟹ divisible by 25,  
   • it contains nine 1’s ⟹ digit–sum = 9 ⟹ divisible by 9.

Therefore it is divisible by 225.  
Any attempt to shorten the number fails (fewer than nine positions before the final 00 cannot supply nine 1’s), and inserting additional zeros to the left of the block of eight 1’s only increases its magnitude. So this is the smallest possible.

Solve the system

Write p = 4k + 1.  Substitute into the second congruence:

4k + 1 ≡ 4 (mod 5)

Since 4⁻¹ ≡ 4 (mod 5), multiply both sides by 4:

k ≡ 3·4 ≡ 12 ≡ 2 (mod 5).

Thus k = 5m + 2, and

p = 4(5m + 2) + 1 = 20m + 9.

237,"There are four three-digit numbers that share this property: the number itself, its double and its triple contain each digit from 1 to 9 exactly once. For example, 192 is one of them because 192, 384, 576 contain 1 to 9 each once. 273 is another one of them because 273, 546, 819 contain 1 to 9 each once.
Can you find the other two numbers that also have this property?","Yes, it's EASIER than you think.","Step–by–step reasoning

1.  Let the required number be n (a three–digit integer).  
    We need the 9 digits occurring in  
           n , 2n , 3n  
    to be 1,2,…,9 each exactly once.

2.  A quick consequence from casting out nines  
        digit‑sum(n)+digit‑sum(2n)+digit‑sum(3n) ≡ n+2n+3n ≡ 6n (mod 9).  
    But the left hand side is the digit–sum of 1+2+…+9 = 45, which is 0 (mod 9).  
    Thus 6n ≡ 0 (mod 9) ⇒ n ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
    So n must be a multiple of 3, and because 3n is still three–digit we have  
           100 ≤ n ≤ 333.

3.  We now inspect the last digit d of n.  
    Since 0 must not appear, d cannot be 0 or 5 (because 2·5 ends in 0 and 3·5 ends in 5, repeating a digit).  
    For the remaining last digits (1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9) we list all multiples of 3 between 100 and 333 that end with that digit, keep only those whose three digits are distinct and non–zero, and test whether the 9 digits of n,2n,3n are pairwise different.

    Doing this case by case gives:

       last digit 1 : no candidate works  
       last digit 2 : the only candidate that works is 192  
       last digit 3 : the only candidate that works is 273  
       last digit 4 : none works  
       last digit 6 : none works  
       last digit 7 : the only candidate that works is 327  
       last digit 8 : none works  
       last digit 9 : the only candidate that works is 219

4.  Hence the complete list of three–digit numbers possessing the property is  

           192   (192, 384, 576)  
           219   (219, 438, 657)  
           273   (273, 546, 819)  
           327   (327, 654, 981)

1. Introduce the unknown three-digit number n and translate the requirement: the digits appearing in n, 2n and 3n must be exactly the nine digits 1–9 with no repeats.  (Rudimentary)

2. Use the “casting-out-nines’’ (digit-sum) argument to show  
   digit-sum(n)+digit-sum(2n)+digit-sum(3n) ≡ 6n (mod 9).  
   Because the left–hand side must equal the digit-sum of 1+2+…+9 = 45 ≡ 0 (mod 9), deduce 6n ≡ 0 (mod 9) and hence n ≡ 0 (mod 3).  (Creative)

3. Combine “n is a multiple of 3’’ with the fact that 3n must still be a three-digit number to conclude 100 ≤ n ≤ 333.  (Rudimentary)

5. For each allowed last digit, list every multiple of 3 between 100 and 333 ending in that digit, discard any whose own three digits repeat or include 0, and test each surviving candidate to see whether the nine digits in n, 2n, 3n are all distinct.  (Rudimentary)

238,"At midnight on Sunday, December 31st, Professor Lawrence set two of her analog clocks to the correct time. One of her clocks gains one minute every hour and the other loses two minutes every hour.
1. When will the clocks next show the same time as each other?
2. When will the clocks both show the correct time?",,"Let t be the number of real HOURS that have elapsed since the two clocks were set
(at 12:00 a.m. on Sunday, 31 December).

Errors of the two clocks  
• Fast clock: gains 1 min per hour  → error = + t minutes  
• Slow clock: loses 2 min per hour → error = – 2t minutes  

(Remember that an analog clock is “right” whenever its error is an integer multiple
of 12 h = 720 min.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  When do the two clocks show the same time?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
They coincide when their errors are congruent modulo 720 min:

 t  ≡  –2t  (mod 720)  
 3t ≡ 0      (mod 720)

The smallest positive solution is

 3t = 720  ⇒  t = 240 hours.

240 h = 10 days, so the first coincidence occurs 10 days after the setting,
i.e. at 12:00 a.m. on Wednesday, 10 January.

2.  When are both clocks simultaneously correct?

Each must individually have an error that is a multiple of 720 min.

Fast clock correct  ⇒  t is a multiple of 720.  
Slow clock correct  ⇒  2t is a multiple of 720  ⇒  t is a multiple of 360.

The least common multiple of 720 and 360 is 720, so the first positive moment
satisfying both conditions is

239,"A farmer was weighing five bales of hay, and each bale was a different weight. Because he was an odd farmer, he weighed the hay bales in groups of two, in every possible combination (but 2-3 and 3-2 are the same).  The farmer wrote down the total weights, but forgot to match them to the groups of hay bales (1&2, 1&3 etc.) that they went with.  The weights were 80, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, and 91 kilograms.
The task is to find out how much each bale of hay weighs and what combinations of bales made each total weight.",,"Label the five (different) bales so that their weights satisfy  

a < b < c < d < e.

Because the lightest two bales must give the lightest recorded sum and the heaviest two bales must give the heaviest recorded sum, we have  

a + b = 80     …(1)  
d + e = 91     …(2)

Take the three least sums in the list: 80, 82, 83.  
All of them must involve the lightest bale a.  
(The next–lightest bale b already appeared in 80, so every other sum that is still ≤83 must pair a with some other bale.)

Thus set  
a + b = 80, a + c = 82, a + d = 83.     …(3)

Subtracting these gives  
c – b = 2, d – b = 3.     …(4)

Write b from (1) as b = 80 – a, then from (4)

c = b + 2 = 82 – a,  
d = b + 3 = 83 – a.     …(5)

Insert d in (2):

e = 91 – d = 91 – (83 – a) = a + 8.     …(6)

Now impose the ordering a < b < c < d < e:

a < 80 – a  ⟹ a < 40  
83 – a < a + 8 ⟹ 2a > 75 ⟹ a > 37.5.

Hence a is an integer 38 or 39.

• If a = 38 ⇒ (b,c,d,e) = (42,44,45,46);  
  their pair–sums include 89 instead of the listed 85, so discard.

• If a = 39 ⇒ (b,c,d,e) = (41,43,44,47);  
  every one of their ten pair‑sums is in the given list and nothing is missing.

Therefore the only possible set of bale weights is  

39 kg, 41 kg, 43 kg, 44 kg, 47 kg.

Pairings that give each recorded total:

80 kg  = 39 + 41

   • The ball is released from 9 ft, so it falls 9 ft.

2. First rebound  
   • It rises ⅔ of 9 ft = 6 ft (up).

3. Second rebound  
   • It rises ⅔ of 6 ft = 4 ft (up).  
   • It then falls the same 4 ft (down).

4. This pattern repeats: each new up‑or‑down segment is ⅔ of the previous one.

Let h₁ = 6 ft, h₂ = 4 ft, h₃ = (2/3)·4 ft = 8/3 ft, …  
The sequence of rebound heights is a geometric series:
h₁ = 9·(2/3), h₂ = 9·(2/3)², h₃ = 9·(2/3)³, …

Total distance traveled  
• Initial drop: 9 ft  
• Every rebound height hₙ (n ≥ 1) is traveled twice (up and down):

Total distance = 9 + 2 (h₁ + h₂ + h₃ + ⋯)

The infinite geometric sum of the hₙ’s:

242,"We were all celebrating the 25th birthday of my beloved sister, Lavi the kindhearted Romankachi. She was younger to me Rudy the business-minded Romankachi by two years and to our elder brother Fred the well-settled Romankachi by four years. Just as the celebrations were in full swing, I realized something about our ages. I found that I could say at least two things definitely about each of the following two integer values formed by manipulating our ages taken as integers:-
a) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Lavi's and my age considered during any one year right since she was a year old.
b) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Fred's and my ages considered during any one year right since I was a year old.
Though I forgot about this the next moment and got busy enjoying myself, could you tell what were the two things that flashed across my mind.
Consider all ages to be integer values. Also during any given year, Lavi was exactly two years younger to me and exactly four years younger to Fred.",I'm exactly two years elder to Lavi and exactly two years younger to Fred.,"Let L be Lavi’s age in a particular year.  
Then, because Rudy is 2 years older and Fred is 4 years older,

 Rudy’s age  = L + 2  
 Fred’s age  = L + 4.

a)  Number considered:  L · R + 1

Thus, in every possible year (L ≥ 1):

1.  Each of the two numbers is a perfect square – namely (L + 1)² and (L + 3)².

In 1853 an Englishman Rhind found one of Ahmes's papyruses near the temple of Ramses II in Thebes. The papyrus is a rectangle 33 cm wide and about 5 m long. There is the following math brain teaser on it (besides others).
100 measures of corn must be divided among 5 workers, so that the second worker gets as many measures more than the first worker, as the third gets more than the second, the fourth more than the third and the fifth more than the fourth. The first two workers shall get seven times less measures of corn than the three others.
How many measures of corn shall each worker get?",,"Reasoning step by step

1.  Let the first worker receive a measures of corn and let the common difference between consecutive shares be d.  
    Then the five shares form an arithmetic progression  

          a , a+d , a+2d , a+3d , a+4d .

2.  The total amount is 100 measures, so  
          a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) + (a+4d) = 100  
          5a + 10d = 100.                                   …(1)

3.  “The first two workers shall get seven times less measures of corn than the three others’’ means that the last three together get seven times as much as the first two together:

          (a+2d) + (a+3d) + (a+4d) = 7[ a + (a+d) ].  
          3a + 9d = 7(2a + d).                              …(2)

4.  Simplify (2):

          3a + 9d = 14a + 7d  
          –11a + 2d = 0 ⇒ 2d = 11a ⇒ d = 11a/2.            …(3)

5.  Substitute (3) in (1):

          5a + 10(11a/2) = 100  
          5a + 55a = 100  
          60a = 100  
          a = 5/3.

     Then  
          d = 11a/2 = 11(5/3)/2 = 55/6.

6.  Compute each worker’s share:

     Worker 1: a               = 5/3      = 1 2⁄3  
     Worker 2: a+d             = 5/3 + 55/6 = 65/6 = 10 5⁄6  
     Worker 3: a+2d            = 5/3 + 110/6 = 120/6 = 20  
     Worker 4: a+3d            = 5/3 + 165/6 = 175/6 = 29 1⁄6  
     Worker 5: a+4d            = 5/3 + 220/6 = 230/6 = 38 1⁄3.

7.  Check:  
     • Total = 1 2⁄3 + 10 5⁄6 + 20 + 29 1⁄6 + 38 1⁄3 = 100.  
     • First two together = 12 1⁄2; last three together = 87 1⁄2, and 87 1⁄2 = 7 × 12 1⁄2.  
       All conditions are satisfied.

246,"The Star of David (the star on the flag of Israel) has two superimposed equilateral triangles which produce six line segments and twelve segment intersections.  Using this star as a template, arrange the numbers 1 through 12, placing them at the twelve intersections, such that the four numbers on each line segment produce a sum of 26.  There is more than one solution.",,"Let the six outer (tip) points of the star be  

u₁  = the top tip,  
u₂  = the lower‑right tip of the upright (▲) triangle,  
u₃  = the lower‑left tip of the upright triangle,  
d₁  = the bottom tip of the inverted (▼) triangle,  
d₂  = the upper‑left tip of the inverted triangle,  
d₃  = the upper‑right tip of the inverted triangle.  

The six inner points form a little hexagon.  
Label them, consecutively round that hexagon,

i₁  on the edge u₁–u₂,  
i₂  on the edge u₁–u₂ (the lower of the two inner points on that edge),  
i₃  on the edge u₂–u₃,  
i₄  on the edge u₂–u₃,  
i₅  on the edge u₃–u₁,  
i₆  on the edge u₃–u₁.

Along every edge of the two triangles there are exactly four of those points, and the
problem asks that each such quartet sum to 26:

(1)  u₁ + i₁ + i₂ + u₂ = 26  
(2)  u₂ + i₃ + i₄ + u₃ = 26  
(3)  u₃ + i₅ + i₆ + u₁ = 26  
(4)  d₃ + i₂ + i₃ + d₁ = 26  
(5)  d₁ + i₄ + i₅ + d₂ = 26  
(6)  d₂ + i₆ + i₁ + d₃ = 26.

Because of the six‑fold symmetry we may fix one number in one position;  
take u₁ = 1.
Working systematically with the six equations (and keeping the twelve numbers distinct)
one finds the unique assignment (up to rotations and reflections) that satisfies them all:

u₁ = 1 ,   u₂ = 3 ,   u₃ = 11  
d₁ = 9 ,   d₂ = 4 ,   d₃ = 2  
i₁ = 12 ,  i₂ = 10 ,  i₃ = 5 ,  i₄ = 7 ,  i₅ = 6 ,  i₆ = 8.

Check of the six required sums:

1 + 12 + 10 + 3 = 26  
3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 26  
11 + 6 + 8 + 1 = 26  
2 + 10 + 5 + 9 = 26  
9 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 26  
4 + 8 + 12 + 2 = 26.

Thus one concrete way to place the numbers 1 through 12 on the Star of David is

                 1
              12   2
           11   6     3
              8   10
           9    7     4

(reading clockwise the outer tips are 1,2,3,9,11,4 and the inner hexagon
vertices are 12,10,5,6,8,7).

Any rotation or mirror image of this arrangement is also a solution, so the
puzzle does indeed have several (symmetry‑related) solutions.

247,"The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?",,"Let  

D₁ ,D₂ ,D₃ ,D₄ ,D₅ ,D₆ = numbers getting down at  
Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf respectively  
Uᵢ = numbers getting in at station i  
P₀ = passengers on the train just before reaching Maver  

1.  Twice as many get in as get down ⇒  Uᵢ = 2 Dᵢ  
2.  The primes allowed by the ranges are  
  Maver {2,3,5,7}  
  Willow {11,13,17,19}  
  Wonderland {23,29}  
  Doku {31,37}  
  Lemp {41,43,47}  
  Rudolf {53,59}  
3.  |Uᵢ – Uᵢ₋₁| ≥ 20  ⇒ |Dᵢ – Dᵢ₋₁| ≥ 10  
4.  D₁+…+D₆ is even.  
5.  After all six stations the passenger total is 227, so  

  P₀ + (D₁+…+D₆) = 227.  (★)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step‑by‑step selection of the Dᵢ

a) D₁–D₂ condition  
 Allowed (D₁,D₂) pairs are  
 (2,13), (2,17), (2,19), (3,13), (3,17), (3,19),  
 (5,17), (5,19), (7,17), (7,19).

b) D₂–D₃ condition  
 With D₃ = 23 we need D₂ ≤ 13; with D₃ = 29 we need D₂ ≤ 19  
 ⇒ viable triples are only those with D₃ = 23 and D₂ = 13.

c) D₃–D₄ condition  
 D₃ = 23 forces D₄ = 37 (since 31 gives a gap of 8 < 10).

d) D₄–D₅ condition  
 With D₄ = 37, only D₅ = 47 gives a gap ≥ 10.

e) D₅–D₆ condition  
 With D₅ = 47, only D₆ = 59 works (gap = 12).

f) Evenness of total downs  
 Two possibilities were left:  

  (D₁,D₂,D₃,D₄,D₅,D₆) = (2,13,23,37,47,59)  sum = 181 (odd) – reject  
  (D₁,D₂,D₃,D₄,D₅,D₆) = (3,13,23,37,47,59)  sum = 182 (even) – accept

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Final calculation

Sum of people getting down = 182, hence from (★)

 P₀ = 227 – 182 = 45.
