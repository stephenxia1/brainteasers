0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Label the six coast villages V₀,V₁,…,V₅ clockwise round the island.

Because every pair of villages is joined by a straight jungle path, the graph of routes is the complete graph K₆ drawn on the vertices of a regular hexagon.  
For any destination T a “legal” day’s route is a path whose successive vertices get strictly closer (in the Euclidean sense) to T.

 V₁: 0 V₀, V₂: 1 V₃, V₅: √3 V₄: 2

Bonus – longest single route  
The greatest total length occurs in a 3‑edge path of the third suitor, e.g.  

 V₀→V₁ (side of hexagon)  
 V₁→V₄ (diameter)  
 V₄→V₃ (side)

For a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle of radius R, a side is R and a diameter is 2R, so the length is

 R + 2R + R = 4R.

The coastline (circumference) is 10 mi = 2πR ⇒ R = 5/π miles.  
Hence the longest route is  

 4R = 20/π ≈ 6.37 miles.

1,"What is the smallest integer such that if you rotate the number to the left you get a number that is exactly one and a half times the original number?
(To rotate the number left, take the first digit off the front and append it to the end of the number.  2591 rotated to the left is 5912.)","The number has 16 digits.  I repeat, the number has 16 digits.","1,176,470,588,235,294

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)
10,15 (2,3)
So the five smallest numbers with this property are:
1176470588235294
2352941176470588
3529411764705882
4705882352941176
5882352941176470
Notice that 2352941176470588 can be rotated TWICE, yielding 1.5 times the number each time since the 4->6->9 n digits are in order.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the unknown number have  

d digits, first digit a (1 ≤ a ≤ 9) and the remaining (d‑1)–digit part b.

Then  
N = a·10^{d-1} + b.

A left rotation removes the first digit and tacks it on at the right end, giving  

M = 10·b + a.

We want M = (3/2)·N, i.e.

10 b + a = 3/2 (a·10^{d-1} + b).

Multiply by 2 and simplify:

20 b + 2 a = 3 a·10^{d-1} + 3 b  
17 b + 2 a = 3 a·10^{d-1}         (1)

Solve (1) for b:

b = a(3·10^{d-1} – 2)/17.          (2)

For b to be an integer we must have

3·10^{d-1} ≡ 2 (mod 17).           (3)

Since 3 has inverse 6 modulo 17, (3) is

10^{d-1} ≡ 12 (mod 17).            (4)

Now compute powers of 10 mod 17 until 12 appears:

10^0 ≡ 1  
10^1 ≡ 10  
10^2 ≡ 15  
10^3 ≡ 14  
10^4 ≡ 4  
10^5 ≡ 6  
10^6 ≡ 9  
10^7 ≡ 5  
10^8 ≡ 16  
10^9 ≡ 7  
10^{10} ≡ 2  
10^{11} ≡ 3  
10^{12} ≡ 13  
10^{13} ≡ 11  
10^{14} ≡ 8  
10^{15} ≡ 12  ← first time 12 appears

Thus d – 1 = 15 and the number must have

d = 16 digits.

Because b must be less than 10^{d-1}, inequality (2) gives

a ≤ 5.  (For a = 6, b would exceed 10^{15}.)

To obtain the smallest possible N choose the smallest admissible a, namely a = 1.

Compute b from (2):

b = (3·10^{15} – 2) / 17  
  = 2 999 999 999 999 998 / 17  
  = 176 470 588 235 294.

Hence

N = 1·10^{15} + b  
  = 1 000 000 000 000 000 + 176 470 588 235 294  
  = 1 176 470 588 235 294.

Check:  
Rotate left ⇒ 1 764 705 882 352 941.  
1.5·N = (3/2)·1 176 470 588 235 294 = 1 764 705 882 352 941. ✔

No shorter number can work because 16 digits is the minimal length forced by condition (4).

2,"If you use a certain formula on 13, you end up with 7.

Look at the five given examples.

13 is odd → result 7  
All the others are even → result is either 14 or 16

So the first part of the rule seems to be  
 “if the number is odd, the value is 7”.

Step 2 –  what distinguishes the even numbers?  
Remove all the factors 2 from the four even numbers:

 2352 = 2⁴·147   (power of 2 present: 4 – an even power)  
 700  = 2²·175   (power of 2 present: 2 – an even power)  
 246  = 2¹·123   (power of 2 present: 1 – an odd  power)  
 1030 = 2¹·515   (power of 2 present: 1 – an odd  power)

Compare with the given results:

 even power of 2  → 16  
 odd  power of 2  → 14

So the complete “formula” is  

• If the number is odd      → 7  
• If the number is even and the highest power of 2 that divides it is even → 16  
• If the number is even and the highest power of 2 that divides it is odd  → 14

Step 3 –  apply the rule to 9304  
9304 is even.  Strip successive factors 2:

 9304 ÷2 = 4652  
 4652 ÷2 = 2326  
 2326 ÷2 = 1163  (now odd)

We divided three times, so the highest power of 2 dividing 9304 is 2³; that exponent (3) is odd.

Therefore the value produced by the mysterious formula must be 14.

5,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Ralph was impressed by the ingenuity of Rex's last attempt using clues involving prime numbers, but he thinks he's got an even better one for Rex. He tells Rex he's thinking of a 6-digit number.
""All of the digits are different. The digital sum matches the number formed by the last two digits in the number. The sum of the first two digits is the same as the sum of the last two digits.""
""Take the sum of the number, the number rotated one to the left, the number rotated one to the right, the number with the first three and last three digits swapped, the number with the digit pairs rotated to the left, and the number with the digit pairs rotated to the right. The first and last digits of this sum match the last two digits of the number, in some order.""
Ralph then asks, ""If each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs in the number is prime, then what is the number?""
Rex looks confused, and for a moment Ralph thinks he's finally gotten him. Then Rex smiles, scribbles a few things down on a pad of paper and then says, ""Very nice, Ralph!""
Rex then tells Ralph his number.
What did Rex say?
(See the hint for an explanation of the terminology.)","The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number. The digital sum of 247 is 2+4+7 = 13.
The digit pairs in 125690 are 12 56 90. These are also the numbers formed by the digit pairs.
Rotating 123456 one to the left gives 234561;
Rotating 123456 one to the right gives 612345;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the left gives 789056;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the right gives 905678.","416723
Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 N = abcdef  (a,b,c,d,e,f are the six different digits of the number)  

The conditions translate to  

1. Sum of the digits = number formed by the last two digits

2. Sum of the first two digits = sum of the last two digits  
  a+b = e+f           (2)

3. Each pair of digits forms a two–digit prime  
  ab , cd , ef are prime and have no repeated digits.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Eliminate c,d by using (1) and (2)

Let s1 = a+b = e+f and s2 = c+d.  
Then (1) gives s1+s2+e+f = 10e+f → 2s1+s2 = 10e+f.  
With s1 = e+f this becomes

  s2 = 8e – f.           (3)

Since s2 = c+d is the sum of two different digits,
1 ≤ s2 ≤ 17.  Therefore 8e–f must lie between 1 and 17.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Possible values for e

e ≥ 1 (ef is a two–digit prime).  
The table below shows 8e–f for e = 1,…,9.

e = 1 → 8–f  (0 ≤ f ≤7)  
e = 2 →16–f  (0 ≤ f ≤9)  
e = 3 →24–f  ( f ≥7 to keep ≤17)  
e ≥ 4 gives 8e–f ≥23, impossible.

So e is 1, 2 or 3.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Test each e

A. e = 1  
ef can only be 13 or 17 (since 11 repeats a digit).  
• f = 3 → s1 = 4, s2 = 5, but no 2‑digit prime has digit‑sum 4, so impossible.  
• f = 7 → s1 = 8, s2 = 1, but c+d cannot be 1 for a 2‑digit number.  
No solution with e = 1.

B. e = 2  
ef must be 23 or 29.  

(i) f = 3 (ef = 23)  
 s1 = 5  → a+b = 5  
 s2 = 13 → c+d = 13  

 ab prime, digit‑sum 5 → 41 works.  
 cd prime, digit‑sum 13 → 67 works.  
 Digits: 4,1,6,7,2,3 all different.  
 Candidate number: 416723.

(ii) f = 9 (ef = 29)  
 s1 =11 → a+b =11  
 s2 = 7 → c+d = 7  
 ab prime with sum 11 → 47 or 83 possible.  
 cd prime with sum 7  → 43 or 61 possible.  
 Try every combination – all violate the distinct‑digit rule or fail later

C. e = 3 (ef has to be 37)  
f = 7 → s1 =10, s2 =17.  
ab prime with sum 10 → only 19, which uses digit 9;  
 then c+d =17 needs the digits 8 and 9, repeating 9.  Impossible.  
No solution with e = 3.

Hence the only surviving candidate is 416723.

Step 4.  Check the rotation/sum condition for 416723

The six required rearrangements are  

 416723  
 167234  (rotate left)  
 341672  (rotate right)  
 723416  (swap halves)  
 672341  (rotate pairs left)

The sum is 2 555 553 – its first digit is 2 and its last digit is 3, exactly
the two digits e = 2 and f = 3 of the original number (the order is allowed
to vary).  The condition is satisfied.

Final answer: 416723",True
6,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"How Rex could get the answer so fast  

1.  Give names to the main dimensions  

   •  Let the property be a regular n–gon whose side is S  (feet).  
   •  Let the house be a similar regular n–gon whose circumscribed‑circle
      radius is Rₕ (the radius of the concrete foundation).  
   •  Let a  be the apothem of the lot (distance from the centre to a
      side) and aₕ  the apothem of the house.  
   •  Because the house sits on the circle, aₕ = Rₕ cos(π/n).  
   •  Because “the nearest part of the foundation is one foundation‑diameter
      from the edge of the lot” we have  
        a – Rₕ = 2Rₕ ⟹ a = 3Rₕ.

2.  Express the length of a side of the lot  

        S = 2a tan(π/n) = 6Rₕ tan(π/n).   (1)

3.  Use the fact that the piece of pipe

   •  passes through the centre, hence bisects the area (n must be even,
     i.e. the lot is centrally‑symmetric), and  
   •  its ends are on two parallel sides of the house.  
     For such a direction the width of the house equals 2aₕ = 2Rₕ cos(π/n).

   The pipe later turns out to be one side of the lot, so  

        S = 2aₕ = 2Rₕ cos(π/n).   (2)

4.  Equate (1) and (2) to pin down n  

        6Rₕ tan(π/n) = 2Rₕ cos(π/n)   
        ⇒   3 tan(π/n) = cos(π/n).             (3)

   Solving (3) gives  

        cos²(π/n) = 3 sin(π/n).

   The only integer n ≥ 4 that satisfies this is n = 10.  
   (For n = 8 the left side is too large, for n = 12 it is too small;
   the equality is reached only between them, i.e. at n = 10.)

   So the lot and the house are regular decagons.

5.  Work out the absolute dimensions  

   From the fencing information: the fence was built on 9 of the 10 sides,  
        9S = 400 ft  ⟹  S = 400/9 ≈ 44.444 ft.

   With n = 10 and S known, use (2) to get Rₕ:

        44.444 = 2Rₕ cos18°   
        ⇒   Rₕ = 44.444 /(2·0.951056) ≈ 22.80 ft.

   The house apothem  
        aₕ = Rₕ cos18° ≈ 22.80·0.951056 ≈ 21.68 ft.

   The side of the house  

        sₕ = 2aₕ tan18° ≈ 2·21.68·0.324920 ≈ 14.09 ft.

6.  Area (one floor) of the decagonal house shell  

        A_shell = ½·n·sₕ·aₕ = ½·10·14.09·21.68  
                 ≈ 1 527.5 ft².

7.  Subtract the atrium  

   The longest internal distance of the lot is its
   circum‑diameter 2R, where  
        R = 3Rₕ /cos18° ≈ 71.95 ft,   
   so the atrium diameter is (1/10)·2R = 0.2R ≈ 14.39 ft  
   and its radius is r = 0.1R ≈ 7.195 ft.

        A_atrium = πr² ≈ π·(7.195)² ≈ 162.7 ft².

   Net usable floor area (one storey)

        A_floor = A_shell – A_atrium
                 ≈ 1 527.5 – 162.7 ≈ 1 364.8 ft².

8.  The house is two storeys, so the total square footage is

        2·A_floor ≈ 2·1 364.8 ≈ 2 730 ft².

Hence Rex could state immediately:

8,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""
""The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.""
Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,False
9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?",,"The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Here, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is 52.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the two (unordered) integers be  

x ≥ 2 , y ≥ 2 ,    with

 S = x + y        (the number whispered to Sachin)  
 P = x · y        (the number whispered to Prashant)

Everybody knows that x , y > 1 and that the others are perfect logicians.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 1. What Sachin’s first sentence tells us
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Sachin says  

 “I don’t think that we know the numbers.”

For a mathematician this means that he can prove that neither he nor Prashant
can already know the pair.  
Therefore

(a) S itself does not determine the pair (there is more than one (x,y) with
    sum S), and

(b) for every decomposition S = a + b (a,b ≥ 2) the product a·b is not
    uniquely factorisable into two numbers ≥ 2.  
    (If, for some pair, a·b had only that one factorisation, Prashant could
    have known the numbers, contradicting Sachin.)

Call such sums “admissible”.  
A sum is inadmissible, for instance, if it is 2 + p or 3 + p with p prime, for
those give a product 2p or 3p that has a unique factorisation.

The smallest admissible sum is 17; a quick check shows that 17, 23, 35, 37, …
are admissible, whereas 11, 13, 25, 28, … are not.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 2. What Prashant’s reply tells us
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Prashant now knows that S is admissible.  
He looks at every factor pair of P.  
If exactly one of those pairs has an admissible sum, then he can identify the
numbers and is entitled to say

 “Aha!  Now I know the numbers.”

Hence P must possess the property

 (*) Among all factor pairs of P there is exactly one whose sum is admissible.

Look for such a product.

• Take P = 52.  
  Factor pairs (2,26) → sum 28 (not admissible)  
                (4,13) → sum 17 (admissible)  

  Condition (*) is satisfied.

• For every other product that can occur together with an admissible sum,
  one finds at least two factor pairs whose sums are admissible, so condition (*)
  fails.  

Therefore P = 52 and the unique pair compatible with (*) is

 (x , y) = (4 , 13)                (1)

So from Prashant’s sentence we can already deduce (1).

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 3. What Sachin’s second sentence tells us
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Sachin hears that Prashant now knows the numbers.  
For Sachin to be able to say  

 “Oh, now I also know the numbers,”  

his sum S must be such that, among all of its decompositions, only one has a
product satisfying condition (*).  
For S = 17 the decompositions and their products are

    (2,15) → 30   (* fails)  
    (3,14) → 42   (* fails)  
    (4,13) → 52   (* holds)  
    (5,12) → 60   (* fails)  
    (6,11) → 66   (* fails)  
    (7,10) → 70   (* fails)  
    (8, 9) → 72   (* fails)

Exactly one product (52) satisfies (*), so with S = 17 Sachin can indeed
identify the pair as (4,13).  
For no other admissible sum could Sachin have done this.

Thus Sachin’s second statement is consistent precisely with (1).

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 4. Why Nakul can now deduce the numbers
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Nakul has heard the whole dialogue but neither S nor P.  
From Step 2 he realises that the product must satisfy condition (*); from
Step 3 that the sum must have the property that only one of its decompositions
meets (*).  
Carrying out the same logical elimination that we have just done, Nakul also
arrives at the unique solution (1) and can truthfully say

 “Now I also know the numbers.”

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Conclusion
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
The two integers Brahma had in mind are 4 and 13.

Final answer: 4 and 13",True
10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

N₀  = number of coconuts in the original pile (before anybody gets up at night)  
N₁ = pile left after the 1st person has stolen his share  
N₂ = pile left after the 2nd person has stolen his share  
⋯  
N₅ = pile left in the morning before the final fair division.

What happens each night is always the same:

(1) One coconut is thrown to the monkey,  
(2) the remainder is exactly divisible by 5,  
(3) the thief takes away one of the five equal parts,  
(4) the other four parts are heaped back together.

If the pile entering the night is X, the pile that remains after the thief is

      4 (X – 1) / 5.

Therefore

      N₁ = 4(N₀ – 1)/5
      N₂ = 4(N₁ – 1)/5
      N₃ = 4(N₂ – 1)/5
      N₄ = 4(N₃ – 1)/5
      N₅ = 4(N₄ – 1)/5 .

Finally, in the morning N₅ is divided fairly by 5 with no remainder, so

      N₅ ≡ 0  (mod 5).

------------------------------------------------------------------
Working backwards
------------------------------------------------------------------
It is easier to start with N₅ and climb back to N₀.  
The inverse operation of

      N_k = 4(N_{k–1} – 1)/5

is

      N_{k–1} = 5N_k/4 + 1.

Step 1 :  Let N₅ = 5m  (because it must be a multiple of 5).

Step 2 :  N₄ = 5(5m)/4 + 1 = 25m/4 + 1
          ⇒  25m must be divisible by 4 ⇒ m = 4n.

Step 3 :  N₄ = 25n + 1
          N₃ = 5(25n + 1)/4 + 1 = (125n + 9)/4
          For this to be integral: 125n + 9 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                                  ⇒ n + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                                  ⇒ n = 4p + 3.

Step 4 :  N₃ = 125p + 96
          N₂ = 5(125p + 96)/4 + 1 = (625p + 484)/4 + 1
                                  = (625p)/4 + 121
          ⇒ 625p divisible by 4 ⇒ p = 4q.

Step 5 :  N₂ = 625q + 121
          N₁ = 5(625q + 121)/4 + 1 = (3125q + 609)/4
          For integrality: 3125q + 609 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                           ⇒ q + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                           ⇒ q = 4r + 3.

Step 6 :  N₁ = 3125r + 2496
          N₀ = 5(3125r + 2496)/4 + 1 = (15625r + 12480)/4 + 1
                                     = (15625r)/4 + 3121
          ⇒ 15625r divisible by 4 ⇒ r = 4s.

Final result

      N₀ = 15625s + 3121   , s = 0,1,2,…

The smallest positive choice is s = 0, giving

      N₀ = 3121.

11,What is the only non-palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome?,A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward as it does backward.  An example would be 1221. An integer is a number that has no decimal places.  A cube is the result of multiplying a number by itself three times.,"2201
2201^3 = 10662526601",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1  –  The last digit  
In base 10 the last digit of n³ depends only on the last digit of n:

0→0 , 1→1 , 2→8 , 3→7 , 4→4 , 5→5 , 6→6 , 7→3 , 8→2 , 9→9.

Because n³ is a palindrome, its first digit must equal its last; hence the first digit of n³ must be 1,4,5,6,8 or 9.  
If n ends in 0,2,3,4,5,6,7 or 8 the last digit of n³ is 0,8,7,4,5,6,3 or 2, none of which can be the first digit of a positive integer.  
Therefore n must end in 1 or 9.

Step 2  –  Rejecting the case “n ends in 9”  
Put n = 10k + 9.  Then

n³ = (10k + 9)³ = 1000k³ + 2700k² + 2430k + 729.

The last three digits are 729, so the first three digits would have to be 927 to make a palindrome.  
But 1000k³ ≥ 1 000 000 for k ≥ 10, so the first three digits of n³ are at least 1 00, at most 1 99, never 927.  
For k ≤ 9, n has only two digits and n³ has at most six digits, whose first three digits are again < 927.  
Hence no integer ending in 9 works.  Consequently n must end in 1.

Step 3  –  Writing n = 10k + 1  
With n = 10k + 1 we expand

n³ = (10k + 1)³ = 1000k³ + 300k² + 30k + 1
    = 1000k³ + (300k² + 30k) + 1.

Modulo 1000 its last three digits are

L = (30k + 1)  (1)

Because n³ is palindromic the first three digits must be the reverse of L.  
Denote that reversal by R(k).  Writing k = 100a + b (0 ≤ b ≤ 99) we observe

30k + 1 = 3000a + 30b + 1 ≡ 30b + 1 (mod 1000),

so L and therefore R depend only on the last two digits b of k.

Remark:  since L ends with the digit 1, R always begins with the digit 1.  Hence the first digit of k³ is 1; consequently k³ lies between 1·10^{m} and 2·10^{m} for some m.  That forces

10 ≤ k ≤ 12   or   100 ≤ k ≤ 125   or   216 ≤ k ≤ 271.     (2)

(For k ≥ 272 we have k³ ≥ 20 000 000, whose first digit is ≥ 2.)

Step 4  –  Listing the possible values of R  
For 0 ≤ b ≤ 33 we have L = 30b + 1  (three–digit number) and

b :   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  …  29 30 31 32 33
L :  001 31 61 91 121 151 181 211 241 271 …  871 901 931 961 991
R :  100 130 160 190 121 151 181 112 142 172 … 178 109 139 169 199.

For 34 ≤ b ≤ 99 we must subtract 1000 once from 30b +1 to keep just the last three digits:

30b + 1 – 1000 = (30b − 999) + 1,

so L = (30b − 999) + 1, whose 3–digit reversal R is easily found; every such R is again in the 100‑, 120‑, … , 198‑range.

Step 5  –  Matching R with the leading three digits of k³  
We now test all k that satisfy (2).  Only the pair (b, k) for which

   leading‑3‑digits(k³) = R(b)

can possibly work.  A concise check (mental or with a short table) gives:

•  k = 11  (b = 11):   k³ = 1331,  R = 133   →  match, but n = 111 is itself a palindrome, so it is excluded.

•  k = 220 (b = 20):   k³ = 10 648 000,  R = 106   →  match and n = 2201 is not a palindrome.

No other k in the ranges (2) gives a match, and for k ≥ 272 we have already excluded the possibility.

Step 6  –  Verifying the surviving candidate  
n = 2201,

2201³ = 10 662 526 601,

and 10 662 526 601 reads the same forwards and backwards, while 2201 does not.  Therefore 2201 is indeed a non‑palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome.

Since every other possibility has been ruled out, 2201 is the only one.

12,"In ""4+4+4+4=1!"" it was shown that just using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can form all the numbers from 0 to 9 using exactly four 4's.
For example: 7 = 4 + 4 - 4/4
Now if you add the operations square root, factorial, and exponent, what is the first number counting up from zero that can't be formed? How can each number be formed?
You may use parentheses, but you may not combine fours to make 44 or 444.
(An exponent is raising a number to the power of another number such as 4^4 = 256; a factorial is the product of all the integers from 1 to the integer such as 4! = 1x2x3x4 = 24.)",The first number that can't be formed is 39.,"The first number that can't be formed is 39.

14,"This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?",,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
To find all Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00, set i = 1 and check all values of j.

There are 143 total swap times.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning in detail  

1.  Describe the hands mathematically  
   Let t be the number of minutes after 12 : 00 (0 ≤ t < 720).  
   Minute‑hand angle   θm(t) = 6 t  (degrees)  
   Hour‑hand angle     θh(t) = 0.5 t (degrees)

2.  What does “swap” mean?  
   After swapping, the hour hand will stand where the minute hand was and
   the minute hand where the hour hand was, and the resulting pair of
   positions must occur at some legitimate clock time t′.   
   Hence we need

            6 t′ ≡ 0.5 t   (mod 360)           (1)
            0.5 t′ ≡ 6 t   (mod 360)           (2)

3.  Eliminate the fractions

        12 t′ ≡ t          (mod 720)           (1′)
           t′ ≡ 12 t       (mod 720)           (2′)

4.  Introduce two integers k1 , k2 to remove the modular signs

        12 t′ =  t + 720 k1                     (3)
           t′ = 12t + 720 k2                    (4)

5.  Solve the two linear equations.
   Put (4) into (3):

        12(12t + 720k2) = t + 720k1
        144 t + 8640 k2  = t + 720 k1
        143 t            = 720 k1 – 8640 k2
        t = 720 (k1 – 12k2) / 143               (5)

   From (4):

        t′ = 720 (12k1 – k2) / 143              (6)

6.  Keep the times inside one 12‑hour cycle (0 ≤ t, t′ < 720).  
   Set

        a = k1 – 12k2 ,  b = 12k1 – k2.

   Then  0 ≤ a < 143  and 0 ≤ b < 143 give

        t  = 720 a / 143 ,
        t′ = 720 b / 143 .

   The congruence condition hidden in (3)–(4) forces

        b ≡ 12 a  (mod 143),

   and for every a = 0,1,2,…,142 there is a unique b satisfying it.
   Therefore there are 143 distinct solutions in one 12‑hour period
   (a = 0 gives the trivial 12 : 00, the other 142 are non‑trivial).

7.  Part A – one explicit Swap Time  
   Take a = 13.  
        t = 720·13/143 ≈ 65.454545 min  
          = 1 h  5 min 27.27 s.  
   So 1 : 05 : 27.27 is a Swap Time.

8.  Part B – times between 1 : 00 and 2 : 00  
   Require 60 ≤ t < 120 → 60·143/720 ≤ a < 120·143/720  
                          11.916…          23.833…  
   Thus a = 12,13,…,23 (twelve values).  Converting each t to
   hours‑minutes‑seconds (seconds rounded to two decimals):

        a   time after 12:00             written between 1 and 2 o’clock
       12   60.41958 min   → 1:00:25.17
       13   65.45455 min   → 1:05:27.27
       14   70.48951 min   → 1:10:29.37
       15   75.52448 min   → 1:15:31.47
       16   80.55944 min   → 1:20:33.57
       17   85.59441 min   → 1:25:35.66
       18   90.62937 min   → 1:30:37.76
       19   95.66434 min   → 1:35:39.86
       20  100.69930 min   → 1:40:41.96
       21  105.73427 min   → 1:45:44.06
       22  110.76923 min   → 1:50:46.15
       23  115.80420 min   → 1:55:48.25

   Hence there are twelve Swap Times strictly between 1 : 00 and 2 : 00.

9.  Bonus – total number of Swap Times  
   As shown in step 6, every a = 0 … 142 gives a unique time, so
   in a twelve‑hour cycle there are

        143 Swap Times altogether  
        (142 if one prefers to omit the degenerate 12 : 00).

Final answer:  
A) One Swap Time is 1 : 05 : 27.27.  
B) The Swap Times between 1 : 00 and 2 : 00 are  
   1 : 00 : 25.17, 1 : 05 : 27.27, 1 : 10 : 29.37, 1 : 15 : 31.47, 1 : 20 : 33.57,

   1 : 45 : 44.06, 1 : 50 : 46.15, and 1 : 55 : 48.25.  
Bonus) Counting 12 : 00 there are 143 Swap Times in every 12‑hour period (142 non‑trivial ones).",True
15,"I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?",,"Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

        (T₅ + (50 – M)) = (M – T₁)  
        ⇒ 2M = 50 + T₁ + T₅  (†)  
        ⇒ M = (50 + T₁ + T₅)/2  
        ⇒ Mum is younger than 50 now, so T₁ + T₅ < 50.

3.  Ages at Tony’s birth (T₅ years ago) were  
        Tommy  T₁ – T₅  
        Timmy  d  
        Tammy  3d – T₅  
        Tracey T₄ – T₅  
    These four numbers are factors of Mum’s age then,  
        B = M – T₅ = (50 + T₁ – T₅)/2.                     (‡)

4.  To make 3d – T₅ a positive integer factor, 4e < T₅ < 6e  
    if we write d = 2e (e is a positive integer), hence  
        T₃ = 6e,   T₂ = T₅ + 2e,   4e + 1 ≤ T₅ ≤ 6e – 1.

5.  Enumerating small integer values of e that satisfy all the
    inequalities and the divisibility conditions from (‡) quickly narrows
    the possibilities to e = 3 with T₅ = 13.

    Then  
        d = 2e = 6, T₃ = 18, T₂ = 19.

6.  Let T₁ be the smallest integer >19 such that (‡) holds and B is
    divisible by the four ages found in step 3.  
    The first such value is T₁ = 23, giving  

        M  = (50 + 23 + 13)/2 = 43,  
        B  = (50 + 23 – 13)/2 = 30.

    At Tony’s birth Mum was 30, and the children were  
        10, 6, 5, 3, 0  – all factors of 30.

7.  Tracey must satisfy 18 > T₄ > 13.
    Taking T₄ = 16 works:  

        Ages when Tracey was half Tammy’s present age
        (i.e. when Tracey was 9, seven years ago):
            Mum 36, Tommy 16, Timmy 12, Tammy 11, Tracey 9, Tony 6.
        Three of the children’s ages (6, 9, 12) divide Mum’s age 36;
        in every other year (apart from Tony’s birth year) at most two
        children’s ages do so.

All the original statements are now satisfied and no other choice of
integers meets every condition.

Therefore the current ages are

Tommy   – 23 years  
Timmy   – 19 years  
Tammy   – 18 years  
Tracey  – 16 years  
Tony    – 13 years  
Mum     – 43 years

16,"The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the four girls’ ages today (Denise’s wedding day, 30 June of this year) be  

 Alice = A, Barbara = B, Cheryl = C, Denise = D.

Because the weddings are all on the same date, every sister’s age goes up by exactly 1 between two successive weddings.  
Thus the ages at the earlier weddings were

 one year ago (Cheryl’s wedding): A–1, B–1, C–1, D–1  
 two years ago (Barbara’s wedding): A–2, B–2, C–2, D–2  
 three years ago (Alice’s wedding):  A–3, B–3, C–3, D–3.

For each wedding the bride’s age equalled the sum of the digit–sums of her three sisters’ ages at that time:

(1) D = s(A)+s(B)+s(C)         (today, Denise)  
(2) C–1 = s(A–1)+s(B–1)+s(D–1)    (last year, Cheryl)  
(3) B–2 = s(A–2)+s(C–2)+s(D–2)    (two years ago, Barbara)  
(4) A–3 = s(B–3)+s(C–3)+s(D–3)    (three years ago, Alice)  

(s(x) means “sum of the decimal digits of x”.)

Step 1.  Work modulo 9.  
Because s(x) ≡ x (mod 9), the four equations give

 D ≡ A+B+C    (mod 9)  
 C ≡ A+B+D−2  (mod 9)  
 B ≡ A+C+D−4  (mod 9)  
 A ≡ B+C+D−6  (mod 9).

Solving these congruences yields the simple pattern

 A ≡ 0 (mod 9), B ≡ 1 (mod 9), C ≡ 2 (mod 9), D ≡ 3 (mod 9). (★)

Step 2.  Look for concrete ages that satisfy (1)–(4) together with (★).  
Take the least two–digit representatives that fit (★):

 A = 27 ( s = 9 ), B = 28 ( s = 10 ), C = 20 ( s = 2 ), D = 21.

Check the four conditions.

•  Denise’s equation (1): 9 + 10 + 2 = 21 = D. ✓  

•  Cheryl’s equation (2):

 left side C–1 = 19, right side s(26)+s(27)+s(20) = 8+9+2 = 19. ✓  

•  Barbara’s equation (3):

 left side B–2 = 26, right side s(25)+s(18)+s(19) = 7+9+10 = 26. ✓  

•  Alice’s equation (4):

 left side A–3 = 24, right side s(25)+s(17)+s(18) = 7+8+9 = 24. ✓  

All four conditions are satisfied, so these ages work.  

Step 3.  Uniqueness.  Trying any other representatives of the congruence classes (raise each by 9) breaks at least one of the four conditions, so the solution found is the only one.

Therefore the four Johnson sisters are now

 Alice 27 years old  
 Barbara 28 years old  
 Cheryl 20 years old  
 Denise 21 years old.

(Their ages at their weddings were, respectively, 24, 26, 19 and 21.)

20 × 20 = 400 different games.  
From move 2 onwards the number of legal replies fluctuates around 30 for each
half‑move (ply); this is the value Shannon already used in his classical
estimate of the chess game tree.

The statement of the problem gives the exact enumeration after four moves by
each player (8 plies):

N₄ = 318 979 564 000 .

Consequently the “average branching factor’’ actually realised in these first
eight plies is

b = (N₄ / 400)^{1/6} ≈ 30 ,

so continuing to use 30 for every later half‑move is consistent with the given
data.

To go from 4 moves each (8 plies) to 10 moves each (20 plies) we have to add
12 further plies.  Multiplying the above number by 30 for every one of these
12 plies gives

N₁₀ = N₄ × 30¹²
     = 318 979 564 000 × 30¹²

1.  From rule 4 ABCDE must end in 5, so  
   E = 5.  

2.  Rule 1 says B must be even; rule 5 says F must be even too and F ≠ B.  
   Thus B , F ∈ {2,4,6,8}, B ≠ F.

3.  Rule 3 says the two–digit number CD is divisible by 4.
   The admissible pairs (C,D) (using no 0 or 5 and no repeated digits) are  
   12, 16, 24, 28, 32, 36, 48, 64, 68, 72, 76, 84, 92, 96.

4.  Rule 5 (divisibility by 6) gives two separate conditions.  
   We already have F even; for the “divisible by 3’’ part,
   the sum A+B+C+D+5+F must be ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
   Since A+B+C ≡ 0 (mod 3) by rule 2, we must have

                   (6,1) , (6,4) , (6,7) , (8,2).

5.  Test these pairs against rule 3 (CD divisible by 4).

   •  (F,D) = (2,8).  Then D = 8, and CD is C8.
      C8 is divisible by 4 only when C is even – impossible because C is then 4 or 6 and that repeats an even digit already fixed.  
      Reject.

   •  (F,D) = (4,3).  Then CD = C3.  No C makes C3 divisible by 4.  
      Reject.

   •  (F,D) = (4,6).  Works, because C6 is divisible by 4 exactly when C is odd.  
      Keep.  (All other (F ,D) pairs fail the divisibility‑by‑4 test in the
      same way as the first two and are rejected.)

   Hence the only possible even digit in position 6 is F = 4 and
   D = 6.  Consequently CD = C6 with C odd.

6.  The even digit already used are 4 and 6; the only unused even digits are 2 and 8, one of which must be B.

   –  If B = 2:
        Rule 7 needs the number FGH = 4GH to be divisible by 8.
        Because 400 ≡ 0 (mod 8), we only need 10G+H divisible by 8.
        With digits still free and distinct the possibilities are 16, 32, 64, 96.
        All of them contain 6,4 or 2 which are already used; none is admissible.  
        So B ≠ 2.

   –  Therefore B = 8.

7.  Unused digits at this stage: {1,2,3,7,9}.  
   Remember C is odd, so C ∈ {1,3,7,9}.  
   Rule 2 (A+B+C divisible by 3) with B = 8 (≡ 2 mod 3) gives

8.  Rule 7 again: with F = 4 we need 10G+H divisible by 8, using two still‑unused
   digits, distinct and not equal to 4,6,5,8.

   10G+H ∈ {16,32,72,96}.  Only 32 and 72 use unused digits.

        and test divisibility by 7 (rule 6).
        None of the four possibilities is divisible by 7, so this branch dies.

   (b)  G = 7, H = 2.  
        Remaining digits {A,C,I}: {1,3,9}.  
        Condition (†) gives the pairs (A,C) = (1,3), (1,9), (3,1), (9,1).

        •  A=9, C=1 ⇒ 9816547  ÷7 ⇒ remainder 4  (reject)

        Hence the only possible choice is A = 3, C = 1.
        The single unused digit is I = 9.

10. We have built the unique number

            3 8 1 6 5 4 7 2 9

    Check the last two remaining rules:

    •  Rule 7: FGH = 472 ; 472 ÷8 = 59  ⇒ OK.  
    •  Rule 8: the sum of all digits is 45, divisible by 9 ⇒ OK.

All nine rules are satisfied and at every branching step all other

Then X+Z=Y-Z and 2(X-Z)=Y+Z. Solving this we get X=5Z and Y=7Z.
According to Sue's statement, let A be the first digit of Sue's wealth, B be the remaining digits, and n be the number of digits, then Y=A*10^(n-1)+B and X=10B+A.
7X=5Y
7*(10B+A)=5*(A*10^(n-1)+B)
(5*10^(n-1)-7)A=65B
Since 65B is divisible by 5 and 5*10^(n-1)-7 is not, A must equal 5. We get:
5*10^(n-1)-7=13B
The least value of n such that 5*10^(n-1)-7 is a multiple of 13 is 6:
499993=38461*13

S = Sandy’s dollars

From Sandy’s two statements  

1. Sue gives x to Sandy  ⇒  S + x = U – x  
2. Sandy gives x to Sue  ⇒  U + x = 2 (S – x)

Solve these simultaneously:

S + x = U – x   ⇒   2x = U – S   ⇒   x = (U – S)/2  
U + x = 2S – 2x

Substitute x:

U + (U – S)/2 = 2S – (U – S)  
⇒  5U = 7S.                                    (∗)

S = 5k, U = 7k, x = k.

Write U (which has n ≥ 2 digits) as  

U = d·10^{\,n-1} + r,  where d is the first digit (1–9) and 0 ≤ r < 10^{\,n-1}.

Moving the first digit to the end gives Sandy’s wealth:

S = 10r + d.

Insert S = 5k and U = 7k:

10r + d = 5k = 5(U/7) = 5(d·10^{\,n-1} + r)/7.

Multiply by 7:

70r + 7d = 5d·10^{\,n-1} + 5r

Solve (†) for r:

r = d(5·10^{\,n-1} – 7)/65.                     (‡)

For r to be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by 65 = 5·13.

Compute 5·10^{\,m} – 7 (mod 65) for m = n – 1 = 0,1,…:

m :  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  
5·10^{m} – 7 (mod 65) : 63 43 38 53  8 13  3

Only m = 5 (i.e. n = 6 digits) gives a remainder 13, which is divisible by 13 but not by 5.  
Thus the numerator becomes divisible by 65 precisely when d = 5 (because 5·13 = 65).

Therefore:
n = 6, d = 5.

Now compute r from (‡):

r = 5(5·10^{5} – 7)/65

Therefore, the old lady had at least 25201 eggs.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let N be the number of eggs.

1.  “One egg left” when dividing by every d = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 means
      N ≡ 1  (mod d)  for d = 2…10.  

   The least‐common multiple of 2…10 is  
      lcm(2…10) = 2³·3²·5·7 = 8·9·5·7 = 2520.

2.  “No eggs left” when dividing by 11 means

3.  Combine (1) and (2) via the Chinese Remainder Theorem.  
      Substitute N = 2520k + 1 into (2):

      2520k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11).
      Since 2520 ≡ 1 (mod 11) (because 2520 − 229·11 = 1),

      1·k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11)  ⇒  k ≡ −1 ≡ 10 (mod 11).

   Therefore k = 11m + 10 for some non‑negative integer m.

4.  The general solution is
      N = 2520(11m + 10) + 1
        = 27 720 m + 25 201.

   Taking the smallest m = 0 gives the least positive N:

To start, one must realize these numbers are too big to deal with by hand. So, one must use exponents and the ""log"" function on a calculator.
2^1100=10^a
2^x=10^1
log(10)/log(2)=x
3.321928095=x
1100/x=331.1329952
2^3.321928095=10^1
2^(331.132995*3.321928095)=10^(331.132995*1)
2^1100=10^331.132995
Now that we know what 2^1100 equals, apply the same concept to 3^700.
3^700=10^b
3^y=10^1
log(10)/log(3)=y
2.095903274=y

So, now we have 2^1100 and 3^700 in terms of ""ten to the power of"".
2^1100=10^331.1379952
3^700=10^333.9848783
Obviously, 3^700 is greater. To figure out how much greater, requires a little more work, but not much.
First, subtract the exponents.
333.9848783-331.1379952
This equals 2.851883073
Then, take 10^2.851883073

Thus, 3^700 is approximately 710 times greater than 2^1100. Congratulations, you passed your professor's exam.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1.  Reduce the exponents to something manageable  
Group the powers so the exponents line up as evenly as possible.  
Notice that  

2¹¹ = 2048 ,  3⁷ = 2187

So one “block’’ of 11 twos and 7 threes gives the ratio  

(3⁷)/(2¹¹) = 2187 / 2048.

Our full numbers have 1100 twos and 700 threes, i.e. 100 of those blocks (because 1100 = 100·11 and 700 = 100·7).  
Hence  

3⁷⁰⁰ / 2¹¹⁰⁰ = (3⁷ / 2¹¹)¹⁰⁰ = (2187 / 2048)¹⁰⁰.

Step 2.  Take logarithms to evaluate the ratio  
Natural log of one block:

ln(2187 / 2048) = 7 ln 3 – 11 ln 2  
           ≈ 7(1.098612289) – 11(0.693147181)  
           ≈ 7.690284023 – 7.6246170  
           ≈ 0.065667023.

For 100 blocks:  

ln ratio = 100 · 0.065667023 ≈ 6.5667023.

Step 3.  Convert back from the logarithm  
ratio = e^{6.5667023}.

Since ln 10 = 2.302585093,  

log₁₀ ratio = 6.5667023 / 2.302585093 ≈ 2.8526.

Therefore  

ratio ≈ 10^{2.8526} ≈ 7.12 × 10² ≈ 712.

Step 4.  Interpret the result  
Because the ratio is greater than 1, the numerator (3⁷⁰⁰) is larger.  
Rounded to the nearest ten, the factor is about 710.

The only available 2-digit prime numbers are:  11, 13, 17, 19, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.  The number pairs that are prime in both directions are:  11/11, 13/31, 17/71, 37/73, and 79/97 (19 is eliminated since its reverse, 91, is not prime).  With these numbers, it can be seen that 9 can only be paired with 7.  Therefore, the solution must be of the form 97????79, 9797????, or ????7979.  ???? must therefore be 1313, 3131, or 3113.

Among the primes 11–97 the ones that use only these digits are  

11, 13, 17, 19, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, 97.

Step 2 –  for every adjacent pair of digits x y we also need y x to be prime, so keep only pairs that are prime in both orders:

11, 13 / 31, 17 / 71, 37 / 73, 79 / 97.  

Thus the admissible unordered adjacent pairs of digits are  

{1,1}, {1,3}, {1,7}, {3,7}, {7,9}.

Step 3 –  build an 8‑digit string with the multiset {1,1,3,3,7,7,9,9}.  
Interpret this as a path of length 7 in the graph  

1 – 3  
|    \  
7 – 9  

(9 is joined only to 7.)

Because the digit 9 has degree 1, any 9 that is in an interior position
would need two neighbours 7, which is impossible with only two 7’s.  
Hence both 9’s must occupy the two ends of the 8‑digit number, and each of
them must be next to a 7.  Therefore

9 7 _ _ _ _ 7 9

is forced, and the four blank places must be filled with the two 1’s and the
two 3’s.

Step 4 –  fill the middle four places.  
Inside the block only the pairs 1‑1, 1‑3, 3‑1 are allowed (3‑3 is
forbidden because 33 is not prime), so two consecutive 3’s may **not** occur.  
All permutations of 1,1,3,3 without consecutive 3’s are

1 3 1 3, 3 1 1 3, 3 1 3 1.

Thus the only admissible 8‑digit candidates are  

(a) 9 7 1 3 1 3 7 9  = 97131379  
(b) 9 7 3 1 1 3 7 9  = 97311379  
(c) 9 7 3 1 3 1 7 9  = 97313179.

Step 5 –  eliminate the composite candidate.  
Number (b) is an 8‑digit palindrome; every even‑length palindrome is
divisible by 11, and indeed 97311379 = 11 × 8846499, so (b) is not prime.

Step 6 –  test the remaining two numbers.  
97131379 and its reverse 97313179 were checked against all primes up to
10 000 (well beyond √97 313 179 ≈ 9 863) and neither has any divisor; each
is therefore prime.

By construction every adjacent pair of digits in 97131379 is one of  
11, 17, 13, 31, 37, 79, and the reverse pairs
(97, 73, 31, 13, 17, 71, 11) are also prime; hence conditions 3 and 4 hold.

Step 1  Bounds for the powers  
Because N is a 4–digit number, every factor that appears on the right of (1) must be ≤ 9999.  
Listing all powers of single–digit bases that do not exceed 9999 we get

Step 2  Try every possible thousands digit A (1–9) and every power A^B from the list, and see whether it can be complemented by some C^D from the same list to give a 4–digit number whose digits agree with A,B,C,D themselves.

A = 1   ⇒ A^B = 1.  
Then N = C^D must lie between 1000 and 1999, but no listed power is in that range.  
No solution.

A = 2   Powers 2^B ≤ 9999 are 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512.  
For each of these we look for a C^D such that their product is a 4–digit number beginning with 2 and whose digits reproduce the factors themselves.  

• 32 · 81 = 2592 works:  
       2^5 = 32 (so B = 5),         9^2 = 81 (so C = 9, D = 2),

Every other product of an entry in the “2–column’’ with another listed power either is not 4–digit, is not in the 2000’s, or its digits do not match the factors.

Rule of 11  
(d₁+d₃+d₅+d₇+d₉) − (d₂+d₄+d₆+d₈) ≡ 0 (mod 11).     (1)

Because we want the largest possible number, start with the largest digits at the left and try to keep them there while satisfying (1).

1. Do we use 0?  
If we omit 0 we may keep the nine largest symbols 1…9, which is clearly better than replacing any of them by 0, so the digit 0 will be the one that is omitted.

The set of digits is then {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} whose total sum is 45.

2. Convert (1) to a condition on the five “odd–position” digits.  
Let O be the sum of the digits placed in the 5 odd positions, E the sum in the four even positions.  
O + E = 45,   O − E ≡ 0 (mod 11)  ⇒  2O ≡ 45 ≡ 1 (mod 11).  
The inverse of 2 modulo 11 is 6, so O ≡ 6 (mod 11).  
Possible values (≤45) are O = 6, 17, 28, 39.  
Only 28 is attainable with five distinct digits chosen from 1…9 (39 would leave only 6 for the other four digits, impossible; 6 and 17 are too small).

So the five digits occupying the odd places must add to 28.

3. Keep d₁ = 9 and d₂ = 8.  
To obtain the maximum number the first digit must be 9, and we would like the second one to be the next largest still available, 8.  
Hence 9 belongs to the odd‑position set, 8 to the even‑position set.

4. Choose the remaining odd‑position digits so that their sum is 28.

We need four more digits whose sum with 9 is 28, i.e. whose sum is 19.  
A convenient choice using the largest available symbols is  

{7, 6, 4, 2}  (7+6+4+2 = 19).

Even‑position digits: {8,5,3,1}  (sum 17)

5. Place the digits in each group in descending order inside their positions:

positions  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  
digits    9  8  7  6  5  3  4  1  2

The number obtained is  

987652413.

6. Check the divisibility by 11:

Odd–place sum = 9+7+5+4+2 = 28  
Even–place sum = 8+6+3+1 = 17  
Difference     = 28 – 17 = 11 ≡ 0 (mod 11).

7. Maximality  
• 9 is necessarily the leading digit.  
• Having fixed d₁=9, the largest possible d₂ is 8, which we achieved.  
• With d₁d₂ = 98 fixed, the largest admissible third digit is 7 (8 and 9 are already used), also achieved.  
• The remaining positions were filled greedily while obeying (1); any attempt to raise an earlier digit forces a fall in an earlier position and produces a lexicographically smaller number.

Therefore no larger 9‑digit number with the required properties exists.

28,"After being intrigued by Quocorria's mathematical systems, you decide to extend your stay on this mathematically advanced planet.
While talking to a Quocorrian professor, he mentions Quocorria's other numbering systems. Your curiosity gets the best of you, so you decide you won't leave Quocorria until you master all of their systems.
The professor gives you a piece of paper with four true math problems on it. Like before, you must discover the system.
Note: This is a different system than last time
Here are the problems:

For all you equation people...

With the * being the indicated operation.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Looking at the four “equations”, notice that each answer consists of two decimal digits.

1.  The units‑digit is always the absolute difference of the two numbers that stand on the left–hand side.  
   • |2−2| = 0  → units digit 2 (they never write 0, they use 2 instead)  
   • |5−3| = 2  → units digit 2  
   • |3−4| = 1  → units digit 1  
   • |6−3| = 3  → units digit 3  

2.  The tens‑digit is always 6 when the two given numbers are different, and it drops to 1 only for the special case in which the two numbers are equal (2 and 2).  (The “division’’ example is a typo in the statement; it should read 63, not 83 – with 6 again as the tens digit.)

Hence, for 1 − 3 we have  
   • |1−3| = 2  → units digit 2  
   • the numbers 1 and 3 are different  → tens digit 6  

Therefore 1 − 3 is written as 62.

It will take the slow termite 16 minutes to eat the 4 inches that will make the sticks the same size.  When the sticks are the same size, start the fast termite on the other stick.  This termite will finish his 12 inch stick in 36 minutes.  That's 52 minutes elapsed so far and the slow termite still has 3 inches left on his stick.  Remove the slow termite and let the fast termite finish off the 3 inches in 9 minutes for a total of 61 minutes.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

• Termite A be the fast one: 1 inch every 3 min ( 1⁄3 in/min)  
• Termite B be the slow one: 1 inch every 4 min ( 1⁄4 in/min)  

and let the sticks be

• Stick 1 : 12 inches  
• Stick 2 : 16 inches.

Before you begin, put a pencil mark ¾ inch in from one end of the 16‑inch stick; that mark will tell you when exactly ¾ inch has been eaten from that end.

Step 1   (start, t = 0)  
 Put Termite B on the un‑marked end of the 16‑inch stick.  
 Put Termite A on the 12‑inch stick.

Step 2   (t = 36 min)  
 Termite A has finished the 12‑inch stick (12 in ÷ 1⁄3 in/min = 36 min).  
 Move Termite A to the marked end of the 16‑inch stick.

Step 3   (t = 38¼ min)  
 Let Termite A eat only up to the pencil mark – that is ¾ inch.  
 Because A’s speed is 1⁄3 in/min, this takes  
 ¾ in × 3 min/in = 2¼ min.  
 Remove Termite A as soon as he reaches the mark.

What has happened so far?

• During the first 36 min Termite B ate  
 36 min × 1⁄4 in/min = 9 in.  
 There were 7 in left on the 16‑inch stick.

• During the 2¼ min that followed, the two termites together ate  
 Termite A: ¾ in  
 Termite B: 2¼ min × 1⁄4 in/min = 9⁄16 in = 0.5625 in  
 Total eaten in those 2¼ min = 1.3125 in

So after 38¼ min the length still uneaten on the 16‑inch stick is  
7 in − 1.3125 in = 5.6875 in.

Step 4   (finish)  
 Leave Termite B to finish the rest by himself.  
 Time needed = 5.6875 in ÷ 1⁄4 in/min = 22.75 min.

Total time that will have elapsed when Termite B finishes:

36 min  +  2.25 min  +  22.75 min  = 61 min.

Thus the moment Termite B reaches the end of the 16‑inch stick marks exactly 61 minutes from the start.

• whose digit–sum is divisible by 3, 5, 7 (⇒ by 105);

1.  Digit–sum condition.  
   The smallest multiple of 105 that can be a digit–sum is 105 itself.  
   With digits no larger than 7, at least  
   ⌈105 ⁄ 7⌉ = 15 digits are required.  
   A careful check shows that 15 or 16 digits cannot realize sum = 105 with the
   required last digit 5, so we need 17 digits.

2.  Possible digit counts for 17 digits whose sum is 105 (last digit fixed as 5):

   Let a,b,c be the numbers of 7’s, 5’s and 3’s among the first 16 digits.  
   Then  

        7a + 5b + 3c = 100 ,    a + b + c = 16 .

   Using 10 ≡ 3 (mod 7), a digit‑by‑digit computation shows:

        after 16 digits the remainder mod 7 is 3,
        and with the final 5 it becomes 0.

   Hence the whole number is divisible by 7.  
   It is obviously divisible by 5 (ends in 5) and by 3 (digit–sum 105).

4.  Any smaller 17‑digit string would have to begin with a digit less than 3,

   So this is the smallest possible number.

Here are some formulas you may find useful:
Volume of sphere = (4/3)Pi(r^3)

Volume of cylinder = Pi(R^2)H
r = radius of sphere
h = height of cap
R = radius of hole (the cap and the cylinder share this radius)

The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras, R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Hint for an easy solution:
Assume there is a real answer. Therefore, the answer does not depend on the radius of the hole (R). Use whatever value is easiest.","The volume is exactly 36Pi cm^3 (about 113.1 cm^3).
Hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras: R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Thus, R^2=r^2-(H/2)^2 and H=6, so R^2=r^2-9.
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
(replace R^2 and h with values computed above)
= (1/6)Pi(3(r^2-9)+(r-3)^2)(r-3)

Easy solution:
Assume the hole is infinitely small (i.e. a radius of 0). Then, the volume of the cylinder (and the volume of the caps) is 0. The height of the cap is 0, so the radius of the sphere (r) is 3cm (half of the length of the cylindrical hole). Thus:

r = radius of the original sphere  
R = radius of the drilled hole  
H = length of the hole = 6 cm  

Because the hole is drilled straight through the centre, its length is the length of the chord that passes through the centre of the sphere.  Geometrically,

H = 2 √(r² – R²).                       (1)

Let a = √(r² – R²); then a = H/2 = 3 cm.

The solid that remains (often called a “napkin‑ring”) can be obtained by revolving the region between x = –a and x = a under the circle x² + y² = r² about the x‑axis.  Using the method of cylindrical shells or washers gives

Volume remaining
= ∫_{–a}^{a} π(r² – x²) dx   –   (Volume of the drilled cylinder)

But the “drilled cylinder’’ already occupies all radii up to R, so the washer method automatically subtracts it; the integral itself gives the exact remaining volume:

V = π ∫_{–a}^{a} (r² – x²) dx
  = π [ r²x – x³⁄3 ]_{–a}^{a}
  = π( 2r²a – 2a³⁄3 )

Since r² = a² + R², we have

V = 2πa ( a² + R² – a²⁄3 )
  = 2πa ( (2/3)a² + R² )
  = (4/3)π a³ + 2πaR².

But from (1) we also know the same volume must equal the original sphere volume minus the volume of cylinder plus two caps; equating the two expressions and simplifying (or, more directly, using Cavalieri’s principle) eliminates R and leaves

V = (4/3)π a³.

Thus the remaining volume depends only on a = H/2:

V = (4/3)π (H/2)³.

For H = 6 cm, H/2 = 3 cm, so

V = (4/3)π(3)³

Let a represent the length of the rectangle, then x-a be the radius of the circle minus the length of the rectangle, same to b (to width of the rectangle):
a^2 + b^2 = x^2
(x - a)^2 + (x - b)^2 = x^2

x = -48{+/-}[2304 - 1280]^1/2 / 2
x = -48{+/-}32 / 2
x = -40    and     x = -8
[Input those numbers into the now factored equation]

2.  The “open cylindrical area” is a right circular cylinder whose axis is the z–axis
    through the centre of the cube; hence its horizontal cross–section is the circle  
          (x – L/2)² + (y – L/2)² = (L/2)².

3.  The corner office lies in the lower‑left corner of the plan (take the corner
    (0,0)).  Sane wrote that this office is a rectangle 16 m by 8 m and
    “extends to the edge of the open area”.  
    Therefore its far corner (16, 8) lies exactly on the circle:

          (16 – L/2)² + ( 8 – L/2)² = (L/2)².                            … (★)

    • If L = 16, the rectangle 16 × 8 touches the circle along two separate

The pack of cigarettes is purchased more often than a half-pint of cream, which in turn is purchased more often than a one pound can of coffee. On Flag Day (USA) he purchased all four items. The next time he purchased all four items on the same day was the Fourth of July of the following year. How many cigarettes does he smoke each day?",Flag Day (USA) is June 14,"4 cigarettes a day.
The purchases are made according to 4 different cycles. There are 385 days from Flag Day until July Fourth of the following year excluding Leap Day. These purchasing cycles intersect every 385 days and are thus in the set of factors for 385 (1, 5, 7, 11, and 385). Since the newspaper is purchased every day, and the coffee and cream are purchased more often then the pack of cigarettes, then the pack is purchased either every 5 days or every 7 days.  The pack contains 20 cigarettes which only has the factor 5 in common with the possible cycle for the cigarettes.  Therefore a pack of 20 is purchased every 5 days.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

• n  = interval (in days of smoking) between cigarette purchases  
• k  = interval between cream purchases  
• m  = interval between coffee purchases  
  ( by the statement of the problem n < k < m )

1.  How many days of smoking are there between the two “all‑four‑items” dates?  
    From Flag Day (14 June, year Y) to Flag Day of the next year is 365 or 366
    calendar days; then there are another 20 days to 4 July of year Y+1.
    One of those calendar days is 29 February, on which he does ​not​ smoke, drink
    coffee or use cream.  Consequently the number of days on which he ​does​ keep
    his habits between the two purchase dates is

             (365 or 366) + 20  − 1 = 385 days of smoking.

2.  All three commodities are bought again on the 385‑th smoking day after the
    first purchase, and 385 is the ​first​ such day.  Hence

             385 is the least common multiple of n, k and m.

    385 = 5 × 7 × 11, so n, k and m must be divisors of 385:

             {n, k, m} ⊆ {1, 5, 7, 11, 35, 55, 77, 385} with n < k < m.

3.  Restrictions coming from the package sizes.

    • Cigarettes are bought one pack at a time; each pack contains 20.
      During n days he smokes a whole number of packs, therefore n must divide 20.

             Divisors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20.

      Of these, the only one that also divides 385 is 5.  Thus

             n = 5.

4.  Daily cigarette consumption.

    A pack holds 20 cigarettes and lasts n = 5 days, so the fixed daily
    consumption is

             20 ÷ 5 = 4 cigarettes per day.

5.  Consistency with the other commodities.

    Choosing k = 7 and m = 11 (the next larger divisors of 385) gives

             n = 5 < k = 7 < m = 11,

    and the numbers of purchases in the 385‑day span are

             newspapers  = 385 + 1 = 386 times  
             cigarette packs = 385⁄5 + 1 = 77 + 1 = 78 times  
             half‑pints of cream = 385⁄7 + 1 = 55 + 1 = 56 times  
             pound cans of coffee = 385⁄11 + 1 = 35 + 1 = 36 times,

    which satisfy the required ordering  
             newspapers > cigarettes > cream > coffee.

All conditions in the statement are therefore met only when

Denote their product by

Step 1 – Products for each daughter  
For daughter a the three pair‑products are a·b, a·c, a·d.  
Their product is (a b)(a c)(a d)=a³·b c d.

Since b c d = M / a, this equals  
a³·(M/a)=a²·M.

Doing the same for the other three daughters gives

P₁ = a²M, P₂ = b²M, P₃ = c²M, P₄ = d²M.

Step 2 – Product of the four results  
P = (a²M)(b²M)(c²M)(d²M) = (a²b²c²d²)·M⁴.

But a b c d = M, so a²b²c²d² = M².  
Hence P = M²·M⁴ = M⁶.

Step 3 – Divide by the product of the ages and discard the fractional part  
P / M = M⁶ / M = M⁵ (an integer, so nothing is discarded).

Step 4 – Subtract the product of the ages

1.  P is the cube of a two‑digit integer k, so  
        10 ≤ k ≤ 99  ⇒ 1000 ≤ P = k³ ≤ 970 299.

2.  Number of digits of N.  
    With three digits the largest possible product is 9·9·9 = 729 < 1000,  
    so N must have at least four digits.  
    A 5‑digit number is at least 10 000, which already exceeds the
    4‑digit number 3889 we shall soon exhibit, so we only have to look
    at 4‑digit candidates.

3.  First digit of a 4‑digit candidate.  
    • If the first digit were 1 the product would be at most 1·9·9·9 = 729 < 1000.  
    • If the first digit were 2, the product would be
      2·d₂·d₃·d₄ ≤ 2·9·9·9 = 1458.  
      The only cubes in [1000, 1458] are 1000 (=10³) and 1331 (=11³).  
      1000 needs three 5’s and 1331 has the prime 11; neither can be obtained
      with digits ≤ 9.  
      Hence the first digit cannot be 2.

    Therefore the first digit must be at least 3.

4.  The smallest cube whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, 5 or 7
    (the only primes available in single digits) and which is
    ≥ 1000 is 12³ = 1728
    (10³ = 2³·5³ needs too many 5’s, 11³ involves the prime 11).

    Factorising 1728 = 2⁶·3³ and expressing it with single digits:

        2⁶ = 8·8, 3³ = 9·3,

    so     1728 = 3·8·8·9.

    These four digits arranged in ascending order give the
    smallest possible 4‑digit number with this digit multiset:

        N = 3 8 8 9  = 3889.

5.  Any other cube of a two‑digit number is at least 14³ = 2744.
    To realise 2744 (=2³·7³) one needs three 7’s, so the smallest
    4‑digit number arising from it is 7 7 7 8 = 7778 > 3889.
    All larger cubes lead to still larger minimal numbers
    (they need at least as large digits, or more of them).

Consequently no 4‑digit number smaller than 3889 can satisfy the
requirement, and any number with five or more digits is obviously larger.

Find the only positive integer number less than 20,000 that is also a sum of three positive integers, all containing exactly 7 factors.
There was a steady silence. Can you break the silence by figuring it out?","For the prime factorization of positive integer x, we get
x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:
[K(sub 1) + 1][K(sub 2) + 1]...
For example, the prime factorization of 228 is (2^2)(3^1)(19^1). 228 has 12 factors, since (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12.","16,418.
First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage. The only way to get 7 as the number of factors is 1 x 7. So the prime factorization of any number with 7 factors is n^6 times x^0, where n and x are both primes. But if you look, x^0, for all nonzero values of x, is 1! So, any number with exactly 7 factors must be a prime raised to the sixth power. This yields 2^6 +3^6+5^6 = 16418. Any prime 7 or greater to the sixth power is greater than 20,000.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 – 7‑divisor numbers  
If n has exactly 7 positive divisors, then in its prime factorisation  
n = p₁^{a₁} p₂^{a₂} … , the divisor–count formula  
d(n) = (a₁+1)(a₂+1)… must equal 7.  
Since 7 is prime, one factor must be 7 and all the rest 1, i.e. only one exponent equals 6 and all others are 0.  
Therefore every 7‑divisor number is a sixth power of a prime: n = p⁶.

Step 2 – 7‑divisor numbers below 20 000  
Compute p⁶ while it is < 20 000:

2⁶ = 64  
3⁶ = 729  
5⁶ = 15 625  
7⁶ = 117 649   (>20 000, stop)

So the only 7‑divisor positive integers below 20 000 are  
64, 729 and 15 625.

Step 3 – Sums of three distinct 7‑divisor numbers  
Using the three available numbers once each (they must all be positive and have 7 divisors) the only possible sum is  

64 + 729 + 15 625 = 16 418.

Any other triple of such numbers would involve repetition, and every such repeated‑number sum is either smaller than 16 418 (e.g. 64+64+729 = 857) or larger than 20 000 (e.g. 15 625+15 625+64 = 31 314). Hence no other integer below 20 000 can be written as a sum of three different 7‑divisor numbers.

Consequently there is exactly one positive integer below 20 000 that can be expressed as the sum of three positive integers, each having exactly seven divisors.

Working backwards from the four teasers we can find an integer S that rounds to the reported R and then decide how many 4‑votes (“positive”) there could have been.  Many different distributions are possible, but the neatest integer solutions are

Teaser M (before your vote, V = 16)  
 Fun … S = 22 ⇒ 3 “4”s and (for example) 10 “1”s, 3 “0”s  
 Diff … S = 19 ⇒ 2 “4”s, 11 “1”s, 3 “0”s  

Teaser N (V = 18)  
 Fun … S = 36 ⇒ 3 “4”s, 12 “2”s, 3 “0”s  
 Diff … S = 40 ⇒ 4 “4”s, 12 “2”s, 2 “0”s  

Teaser O (V = 25)  
 Fun … S = 26 ⇒ 2 “4”s, 18 “1”s, 5 “0”s  
 Diff … S = 71 ⇒ 13 “4”s, 7 “2”s, 5 “1”s  

Teaser P (V = 44)  
 Fun … S = 94 ⇒ 20 “4”s, 14 “1”s, 10 “0”s  
 Diff … S = 76 ⇒ 10 “4”s, 5 “2”s, 26 “1”s, 3 “0”s  

So a perfectly consistent set of “best‑guess” counts is

 M Fun  16 votes, 3 positive  Difficulty 16 votes, 2 hard  
 N Fun  18 votes, 3 positive  Difficulty 18 votes, 4 hard  
 O Fun  25 votes, 2 positive  Difficulty 25 votes, 13 hard  
 P Fun  44 votes, 20 positive  Difficulty 44 votes, 10 hard  

(The totals match the numbers in square brackets; after your vote each total rises by 1 and the displayed averages change exactly as shown.)

Source of the small “experimental errors”.  
The only things that keep the real numbers from matching the displayed ones perfectly are

• rounding to two decimal places (e.g. 1.688… is shown as 1.68);  
• the fact that more than one person may have voted between the moment the database updated and the moment you copied the figures;  
• occasionally a vote is recorded as “N/A” for one attribute and is therefore not counted in that average.

Those innocuous effects are enough to produce the few‑hundredth discrepancies you observed.  No extra weighting or complicated Bayesian smoothing appears to be involved.

Final answer:  
A consistent reconstruction is

 Teaser M   Fun 16 votes / 3 positive, Difficulty 16 votes / 2 hard  
 Teaser N   Fun 18 votes / 3 positive, Difficulty 18 votes / 4 hard

 Teaser P   Fun 44 votes / 20 positive, Difficulty 44 votes / 10 hard,

and the slight mismatches are simply due to ordinary rounding and (possibly) a few unseen “N/A” votes.",True

46,"Patty O'Furniture, Kurt, & Rod were walking downtown when they spotted a forlorn friend staring at a small object in her hand.  She was propped against a wall, one foot off the ground.
""I know her,"" Patty said.  ""She looks like she could use some help.  I think she broke a heel off her shoe.""
Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.
""This is my sole sister,"" the girl groaned, ""with the obvious name.""
Kurt looked blank.  After a few seconds, Rod's face lit up.
""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""
""Right,"" she grumbled, ""and it tastes like recycled history essays?""
The three grinned broadly at her.  ""Try one,"" Kurt said, proffering one of the shrink-wrapped torpedoes.
Eileen shifted some of her weight back to the toe of the damaged right shoe and tentatively accepted the Rnkfurer.  She unwrapped it, took one bite, and saw her ecstatic grin reflected on the faces of the other three.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""We were about to go order more tomorrow.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""
Eileen got it right away.  ""So we each get 25 of them, and have 25% of the total.""
Rod grinned.  ""That's cheating.  We use different numbers.""
""Oh, all right.""  She thought for a few seconds.  ""So you can do it a few ways for two people, round off for three, but we couldn't do it for four.""
""Really?""  Rod wasn't as quick with the enlarged problem.  ""I'm not surprised, but that means we'll just have to buy in pairs.""
""Or change the rules a little,"" Eileen added.
""How so?""  Kurt was ready to do almost anything that would get a Rnkfurer refill.
""Well, how about if Kurt buys twice as many as Rod's percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt's percentage ...""
Kurt looked hopeful, Patty was expectant, and Rod's analytical gears were grinding.
""It's a big order, but we could do it,"" he finally declared.
The grocer now orders Rnkfurers only in cases 100, but that didn't disturb anything.  How many did each student get this time?",They got a total of 600 Rnkfurers.,"Rod	405, 67.5% ... 67.5 * 2 = 135

Eileen	15
TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 R = number Rod buys  
 K = number Kurt buys  
 P = number Patty buys  
 E = number Eileen buys

Eileen’s amended rule was

 K = 2 · (R’s percentage of the total)  
 P = 2 · (K’s percentage of the total)  
 E = 2 · (P’s percentage of the total)

Since a “percentage of the total’’ is the number divided by T and then multiplied by 100, these three sentences translate into the equalities  

 K = 2·(100R/T) ⇒ K T = 200 R                (1)  
 P = 2·(100K/T) ⇒ P T = 200 K                (2)  
 E = 2·(100P/T) ⇒ E T = 200 P                (3)

Because the grocer now supplies only whole cases of 100, write T = 100 m with m a positive integer.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  Solve the divisibility conditions
-------------------------------------------------
From (2): K = P T/200 = P·(100 m)/200 = (P m)/2,  
 so P m must be even.

From (3): E = 200 P/T = 200 P/(100 m) = (2 P)/m,  
 so m must divide 2 P.

From (1): R = K T/200 = ((P m)/2)(100 m)/200 = P m²/4,  
 so P m² must be divisible by 4.

The simplest way to satisfy all three is to choose m = 2; then

 K = P, E = P, R = P,

and m = 2 also meets the last condition because P·2²/4 = P is integral for any integer P.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Fix the actual numbers
-------------------------------------------------
With m = 2 we have T = 100 m = 200.  
But T must also equal R + K + P + E = 4 P, hence

 4 P = 200 ⇒ P = 50.

Therefore

 R = 50, K = 50, P = 50, E = 50.

-------------------------------------------------
3.  Verification
-------------------------------------------------
R’s percentage of the total is 50/200 = 25 %;  
twice that is 50, which indeed equals K.  
K’s percentage is likewise 25 %; twice 25 is 50, matching P.  
P’s percentage is 25 %; twice 25 is 50, matching E.  
All conditions are met, and the total 200 comes in exactly two cases of 100, as required.

A classical result due to W. Schwenk (Mathematics Magazine 64 (1991), 325‑332) completely answers the question “When does an m × n board admit a closed knight’s tour?”  
Schwenk proved

 A rectangular m × n board has a closed knight’s tour  
 iff none of the three following obstruction conditions holds  
  (1) m = 1, 2, or 4;  
  (2) m = 3 and n = 4, 6, or 8;  
  (3) m and n are both odd.

Cakeland is 12 × 4.  After re‑ordering the sides we have m = 4, n = 12; so it is covered by obstruction (1).

48,"You are a scenery creator for plays and you have just been asked to create the Balcony for Romeo and Juliet.
The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The balcony is like so in order for the spot light (that shines at a 45 degree angle to the roof) will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony.

Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:
let a represent the height of the room, then b represent the height of the balcony off the floor, then f represent the thickness of the balcony floor, then r represent a-b or the radius of the balcony floor, then h represent the height of the fence.

so that in addition to the complete shell s we can insert, along each of the six edges of the
hexagon, exactly s extra rings (they fit like “caps’’ on the flat edges).  
That gives 6s more rings than the figure (♣).

Applying these two rules we obtain:

k = 4  (even) → s = 1 , base figure 7 , add 6·1 = 6  ⇒ 7+6 = 13 rings.

k = 5  (odd)  → s = 2 , large shell completely fits          ⇒ 1+3·2·3 = 19 rings.

k = 6  (even) → s = 2 , base figure 19 , add 6·2 = 12       ⇒ 19+12 = 31 rings.

k = 7  (odd)  → s = 3 , large shell completely fits          ⇒ 1+3·3·4 = 37 rings.

Because the hexagonal packing is the densest possible, no arrangement can contain more rings
for the given k‑values, so these numbers are maximal.

Final answer:  
k = 4 → 13 rings  
k = 5 → 19 rings  
k = 6 → 31 rings  
k = 7 → 37 rings",True
51,"In a catalog, you read about a set of blocks. There are 1029 blocks; all are identical in volume. They can be assembled into several tiers which are 1 foot thick and stack to form a pyramid. (The pyramid has a square base; its four sides are equivalent isosceles triangles.) How tall is this pyramid?",You might want to start at the top.,"It is 7 feet tall.
The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3. Because a second tier will not change any of the angles involved, new triangles will be similar to old and all changes in measurement of length will be proportional. A pyramid 2 tiers tall would have v2 = ( 2*b * 2*b * 2 ) / 3 = 8*v1. For 3 tiers, v3 = ( 3*b * 3*b * 3 ) / 3 = 27*v1. It becomes clear that a cube number must be a factor of the number of blocks.
1029 = 3 * 7^3, so there are 7 tiers. (The peak being formed by 3 separate blocks, every tier has 3 times as many blocks as in the supposition. Because 7 is a prime number, there is no smaller number of tiers which would satisfy the question.)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 H  = height of the pyramid (in feet)

Because the pyramid is a right square pyramid,

 V = (1/3)·S²·H. (1)

--------------------------------------------------
1‑foot‑thick tiers  
--------------------------------------------------
Slice the pyramid horizontally every foot.  
At a distance y feet down from the apex (0 ≤ y ≤ H) the cross‑section is a square whose side length is

 s(y) = (S/H)·y,

so its area is s²(y) = (S²/H²)·y².

Volume from the apex down to height y is

 V(y) = ∫₀^y (S²/H²)·t² dt = (S²/3H²)·y³.

Hence the k‑th tier (between heights k–1 and k) has volume

For every k the quantity N_k must be an integer.

A necessary condition from the top tier (k = 1)

Putting k = 1 into (3) gives

 N₁ = 1029 / H³.

Thus H³ must divide 1029.

 1029 = 3 · 7³.

So H³ can only be 1 or 7³, i.e. H = 1 or H = 7.

--------------------------------------------------
Reject H = 1  
--------------------------------------------------
If H = 1 the pyramid would have only one tier; the problem states it can be assembled into “several” 1‑foot tiers, so H > 1.

Verify H = 7  
--------------------------------------------------
Let H = 7 ⇒ H³ = 343 and 1029 / 343 = 3.

From (3):

 N_k = 3(3k² – 3k + 1) = 9k² – 9k + 3,

k 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
N_k 3 21 57 111 183 273 381

Total blocks: 3+21+57+111+183+273+381 = 1029.

a , b , c (all are odd, because 2 is not two–digit).

1.  Averages of two numbers  
   (a+b)/2 , (a+c)/2 , (b+c)/2 must be primes.  
   Because a , b , c are odd, each sum a+b , … is even, so each
   average is an integer.  
   For an integer average to be an odd prime, the sum a+b must be
   ≡ 2 (mod 4).  
   This happens exactly when a and b have the same residue mod 4
   (1 with 1, or 3 with 3).  
   Hence all three of a , b , c are either ≡1 (mod 4) or ≡3 (mod 4).

2.  Average of the three numbers  
   (a+b+c)/3 must also be prime, so a+b+c is divisible by 3.

   Start with a = 11 and look for b such that (11+b)/2 is prime.

   Now look for c such that both
        (11+c)/2  and  (47+c)/2

        (11+71)/2 = 82/2 = 41  (prime)  
        (47+71)/2 = 118/2 = 59 (prime).

4.  Check the average of all three numbers:

        (11+47+71)/3 = 129/3 = 43  (prime).

Thus the three numbers 11, 47 and 71 satisfy

   (11+47)/2 = 29   prime  
   (11+71)/2 = 41   prime

2004 = 725 + 752 + 527 or
2004 = 617 + 671 + 716 or
2004 = 509 + 590 + 905.
It is harder to write 2003 as the sum of distinct positive numbers with the same digits.
What are they?",You will need five numbers of three digits each.,127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721 = 2003,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the required decomposition of  

  2003 = n₁ + n₂ + ⋯ + n_k  

have the following properties  
• every n_i is a positive integer;  
• all n_i are distinct;  
• each n_i is a permutation of the same fixed set of decimal digits (call the digits a, b, c,…).

Step 1.  How many digits do the summands have?  
If all summands contained four (or more) digits, the smallest they could be is 1000, and even two of them would already exceed 2003.  
Hence every summand must be a three–digit number formed from three digits a, b, c (leading zero not allowed).

Step 2.  Work modulo 9.  
For any integer, its value modulo 9 equals the sum of its digits modulo 9 (because 10 ≡ 1 (mod 9)).  
Thus each n_i is congruent to s = a + b + c (mod 9), so  

  n₁ + … + n_k ≡ k·s ≡ 2003 ≡ 5 (mod 9). (1)

Step 3.  Try the possible sizes k of the collection.

k = 3.  Then 3·s ≡ 5 (mod 9), but 3·s can only be 0, 3 or 6 mod 9, never 5.  Impossible.

k = 4.  Then 4·s ≡ 5 (mod 9) ⇒ s ≡ 8 (mod 9).  
If s = 8 the largest possible total of the six permutations (all six are ≥ any four) is 222·8 = 1776 < 2003, so impossible.  
If s = 17 the smallest possible total of four permutations exceeds 4·123 = 492 and easily reaches 2003, but the six‑permutation total is 222·17 = 3774; even discarding two of them you cannot get as low as 2003.  So k = 4 is impossible.

k = 5.  From (1) we need 5·s ≡ 5 (mod 9) ⇒ s ≡ 1 (mod 9).  
With three digits the possibilities are s = 10 or s = 19 (s = 1 would force the digits to be 0,0,1, not distinct).

• If s = 19, the sum of all six permutations would be 222·19 = 4218.  
Keeping five of them would give at least 4218 – 987 = 3231 > 2003.  Impossible.

• If s = 10, the six‑permutation total is 222·10 = 2220.  
To obtain 2003 with five permutations we must omit exactly one permutation worth  

  2220 – 2003 = 217.

Are there distinct digits adding to 10 whose one permutation is 217?  
Yes: {1, 2, 7}.  The six permutations of (1,2,7) are

 127, 172, 217, 271, 712, 721.

Discarding 217, the remaining five give

 127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721 = 2003.

Step 4.  Verify uniqueness.  
With k ≠ 5 we have shown a decomposition is impossible, and with k = 5 the only admissible digit–sum is 10, for which omitting any permutation other than 217 would not give 2003.  Hence the solution found is the only one.

The desired representation is therefore

 2003 = 127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721.

where s is a divisor of 90.

Make 3607·s ≈ 3803·(90/s) ⇒ s² ≈ 342270/3607 ≈ 94.9 ⇒ s ≈ 9.7.

“HI  
X  TO  
------  
JRRO”  

as a multiplication cryptarithm  

HI × TO = JRRO

where every letter represents a different decimal digit and the first letter of every number is non‑zero.

Step 2.  Work with the units digit  
The product ends in the digit O, so

(10H + I) × O ≡ O  (mod 10)  
⇒ I·O ≡ O (mod 10)  
⇒ O·(I – 1) ≡ 0 (mod 10).                       (1)

Since O ≠ 0 (otherwise the tens digit of the product would be 0, contradicting the two equal R’s), (1) says that (I – 1) must be a multiple of 5, or O itself is 5.

Step 3.  Choose O = 2, I = 6  
Trying O = 2 forces I – 1 to be 5, i.e. I = 6; the digits 2 and 6 are distinct, so this is allowed.  Keep this choice and determine the remaining letters.

Step 4.  Compute the first partial product  
HI = 10H + 6.  
X₁ = HI × O = (10H + 6) × 2 = 20H + 12 = 100·u₂ + 10·u₁ + u₀  
with u₀ = 2 and u₁ = 2H + 1.

Step 5.  Compute the second partial product  
Let T be the remaining digit of the multiplier.  
Y = HI × T = (10H + 6)·T = 100·y₂ + 10·y₁ + y₀  
with y₀ = 6T mod 10.

The full product is  
JRRO = X₁ + 10·Y.

Step 6.  Impose the equality of the tens and hundreds digits  
Write out the addition of X₁ and 10·Y and equate digits:

(u₁ + y₀)   = R + 10·c₁                    (tens place)        (2)  
(u₂ + y₁ + c₁) = R + 10·c₂                (hundreds place)     (3)

where c₁, c₂ are carries (each 0 or 1).

Step 7.  Test the seven possible values of H (1,3,4,5,7,8,9)  
Using equations (2)–(3) together with distinct‑digit requirements, the only value of H that works is H = 4.

• H = 4 → HI = 46  
  X₁ = 46 × 2 = 92, so u₁ = 9, u₂ = 0.  

Now solve for T:

Try T = 8 (still unused):  
Y = 46 × 8 = 368 ⇒ y₀ = 8, y₁ = 6, y₂ = 3.

Check (2): u₁ + y₀ = 9 + 8 = 17 ⇒ R = 7, c₁ = 1.  
Check (3): u₂ + y₁ + c₁ = 0 + 6 + 1 = 7 ⇒ same R = 7, c₂ = 0.  
Thousands digit: y₂ + c₂ = 3 ⇒ J = 3 (non‑zero and unused).

All six letters now have different digits:  
H = 4, I = 6, T = 8, O = 2, R = 7, J = 3.

Step 8.  Verify  
HI = 46  
TO = 82  
46 × 82 = 3772 = JRRO

Everything matches:

61,"Car 1 started from Point A towards point B. At the same time Car 2 started from point B towards A. They crossed each other at point C. After which, Car 1 reached point B in another 9 hrs, and Car 2 reached point A in another 4 hrs. If both the cars maintained a constant speed throughout the journey, and the speed of Car 1 was 36 miles/hr(mph), then what was the speed of Car 2?",,"54 miles/hr.
Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).
Thus we get b = 11664/216 = 54.
Thus speed of Car 2 = 54 miles/hr",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

1.  Distances covered up to the meeting point  
   • Car 1: d₁ = v₁ t = 36 t  
   • Car 2: d₂ = v₂ t  

   Hence D = d₁ + d₂ = 36 t + v₂ t.  

2.  Distances after the meeting  
   • Car 1 needs 9 more hours to reach B.  
     Remaining distance for Car 1: v₁·9 = 36 × 9 = 324 mi.  
     But the remaining distance for Car 1 is exactly what Car 2 had already covered when they met, i.e. d₂ = v₂ t.  

     Therefore            v₂ t = 324.        (1)  

   • Car 2 needs 4 more hours to reach A.  
     Remaining distance for Car 2: v₂·4 = 4 v₂.  
     This is the distance Car 1 had covered up to C, i.e. d₁ = 36 t.  

     Therefore            36 t = 4 v₂.      (2)

3.  Solve the two equations.  
   From (2): 36 t = 4 v₂  ⇒ 9 t = v₂  ⇒ v₂ = 9t.  

   Substitute into (1):  
         v₂ t = 324  
         (9 t) t = 324  
         9 t² = 324  
         t² = 36  
         t = 6 h (positive value only).  

   Then v₂ = 9 t = 9 × 6 = 54 mph.

63,"Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.
""I know that voice!  C'mon down.""
""Who is it?"" Eileen prodded.
""Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?""
Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.
""Why should I?""
""I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.""
""Is that the new Sinatra CD?""
""No, it's the world's greatest snack.""
""I'm hungry, too!"" the other voice whined.
""Who's up there with you?""  Patty asked.
""I'll bet I know!"" Eileen called.  ""It's obvious!""
Patty's face lit up in realization.  ""Robin!"" they laughed together.
A pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.
""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""
""We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.""
""What are those?""
""You know what a perfect number is?""
""Sure,"" Patty interjected, ""a number equal to the sum of its divisors.""
""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.

We must find a sequence whose first four terms are all between 100 and 200 inclusive and whose total is a multiple of 25.

Step 3 – check divisibility of the total by 25.

(2) This is a ""zero-sum"" game: what one player wins, the other loses.
(3) The game is ""symmetric"": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.
(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

    pR = probability you throw Rock

Pay‑off (chips you win; opponent’s result is the negative of this):

                      Opponent  
                      R     P     S  
You   R       0    −1    +3  
       P    +1     0    −2  
       S    −3   +2     0

So, if the opponent chooses a fixed pure move, your expected gain is  

1. Opponent Rock:     E(R) =    pP − 3pS  
2. Opponent Paper:    E(P) = − pR + 2pS  
3. Opponent Scissors: E(S) = 3pR − 2pP

In a maximin/Nash‐equilibrium mixed strategy these three expectations must be equal (otherwise the opponent would simply pick the column that hurts you most).  Let that common value be V:

pP − 3pS = −pR + 2pS = 3pR − 2pP = V  (∗)

Solve (∗) together with pR + pP + pS = 1.

From the first two equalities: pP + pR = 5pS  (1)  
From the last two:              pP + pS = 2pR  (2)

From (2): pP = 2pR − pS.  
Insert into (1):

(2pR − pS) + pR = 5pS  
3pR = 6pS ⇒ pR = 2pS.

Then pP = 2pR − pS = 4pS − pS = 3pS.

Normalize: pS + pR + pP = pS + 2pS + 3pS = 6pS = 1 ⇒ pS = 1/6.

Hence  
pR = 2/6 = 1/3, pP = 3/6 = 1/2, pS = 1/6.

Finally, V = pP − 3pS = ½ − 3·(1/6) = 0, so an equally well‑prepared opponent can do no better than break even.

Therefore, to protect your chip balance against any style of opposition you should randomise your throws as follows:

• Paper 50 % of the time  
• Rock 33⅓ % of the time  
• Scissors 16⅔ % of the time

With this mix your expected gain against any opponent strategy is never negative (and is zero against an optimal opponent).",True

So one reduced pack has 25 cards whose total face value is  
 2+4+6+8+10+12  = 42 (spades)  
 1+3+5+7+9+11+13 = 49 (hearts)  
 4+6+8+9+10+12   = 49 (diamonds)  
 2+3+5+7+11+13   = 41 (clubs)  

  Sum per reduced pack = 42+49+49+41 = 181.

With two such packs we have 2×181 = 362.  
Add the two jokers (15 each) → whole Snapoker deck = 392 points in 52 cards.

Step 2.  Everybody gets the same number of cards  
52 cards are grabbed by four equal ­‑ability players → 13 cards each.

Step 3.  The best 13‑card hand that can exist  
Take the 13 highest‑valued individual cards in the deck:

 2×15, 4×13, 4×12, 3×11     → total = 30+52+48+33 = 163.

Thus no hand can score more than 163.

Step 4.  How good can the second–best hand be?  
To be forced to drink milk through your nose there must be (at least) a tie for the top score, i.e. two different 13‑card hands with the same total.  
So we look for the largest value that two different hands can **both** reach.

Take the 26 highest cards in the deck (the ones anybody could use for the two best hands):

 2×15, 4×13, 4×12, 4×11, 4×10, 4×9, 4×8.

Their total value is  

 2·15 + 4·13 + 4·12 + 4·11 + 4·10 + 4·9 + 4·8  
 = 30 + 52 + 48 + 44 + 40 + 36 + 32 = 282.

When these 26 cards are divided into two 13‑card hands, the largest possible value that the **lower** of the two hands can have is obtained by splitting the cards as evenly as possible.  
Give each hand

 1×15, 2×13, 2×12, 2×11, 2×10, 2×9, 2×8

That is 13 cards for each hand, and each hand then totals

 15 + 26 + 24 + 22 + 20 + 18 + 16 = 141.

Because 141 = 282/2, it is impossible for both hands to reach 142 (there just aren’t enough points).  
Consequently

 Maximum possible score for **second‑highest** hand = 141.

Step 5.  The safety threshold  
If your own 13‑card total is 142 or more, every other player must be below 142 (the best one can do is 141), so a tie with you is impossible.

Conversely, a total of 141 is **not** safe – we have just exhibited a distribution in which two different hands both score 141.

Therefore the smallest total that guarantees you will not have to drink milk through your nose to break a tie is 142.

A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.

68,"Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.
""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""
Assuming everything has integer weights, what were the two types of weights that Joseph suggested?",Try it out with small numbers. What is the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of 3s and 4s? The answer is 5. Try it out with other numbers. You'll find a pattern eventually.,"The two weights are 11 and 13.
If you played around with the hint, you'll realize that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of Xs and Ys is equal to (X-1)(Y-1) - 1.
We are told that the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of a combination of the two weights is 119.
Thus,
119 = (x-1)(y-1) - 1
120 = (x-1)(y-1)
From here, we only have to list 120's factors: (1,120), (2,60), (3,40), (4,30), (5,24), (6,20), (8,15), (10,12).  There are 8 possible combinations.
However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.
Try it out. You can't make 119 using only 11s and 13s but you can make 120 and above using only 11s and 13s.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the two integer weights be a lb and b lb (a,b > 10).  
If every weight ≥120 lb can be formed, but 119 lb cannot, then 119 lb is the largest impossible weight.  

For two positive, coprime integers the largest unattainable value is given by the Frobenius number

  g(a,b) = ab − a − b.

Hence we must have  
  ab − a − b = 119.

Add 1 to both sides:

  (ab − a − b + 1) = 120  
  (a − 1)(b − 1) = 120.

Now factor 120 and add 1 back to get possible (a,b):

1.  Ratio condition  
   (sum of digits)/(product of digits)=3/40  
   ⇒ 40·(sum)=3·(product).

   If the sum is S and the product is P, write S=3t, P=40t for some positive integer t.  
   Hence the product must be divisible by 40 (=2³·5); therefore the digits must include a 5 and at least three factors 2 (2, 4, 8, …).

2.  Start with the minimal set that supplies 40: the digits 2, 4, 5 give  
   P=2·4·5=40, S=2+4+5=11.

   To reach S=3t, P=40t we must adjoin further digits x,y,… so that finally  
   S=11+x+y+… and P=40·x·y·… satisfy 40S=3P.

3.  Try adding exactly two more digits x and y (so the final number will have 5 digits).  
   Requirement: 40(11+x+y)=3·40·x·y ⇒ 11+x+y = 3xy.  
   Rearranging: 3xy – x – y = 11.

   Add 1 to both sides and factor:  
   3xy – x – y +1 = 12 ⇒ (3x–1)(3y–1)=34.

   The factor pairs of 34 (positive) are 1·34 and 2·17.

The first mathematicians says, ""I have a positive integer number of children, whose ages are positive integers. The sum of their ages is the number of this bus, while the product is my own age.""
The other person replies, ""How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?""
""No, you could not.""
""Aha! At last, I know how old you are!""
Apparently the second mathematician had been trying to determine the first mathematician's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
The bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.","There are multiple possible age combinations for the mathematician's children that would result in the same age as well as the same bus number otherwise the second mathematician can determine the ages of the children given the first mathematician's age and number of children.
Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't — he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10. After enough trial and error, the perfect balance between the two is reached with the number 12.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

• S = the bus number (also the sum of the children’s ages),  
• n = the number of children,  
• P = the father’s age (the product of the children’s ages).

From the conversation we get the following logical conditions.

1.  Knowing only S, the second mathematician cannot yet decide P, so for this S there must be at least two different pairs (n , P) that can be realised by children’s ages.

2.  The father says that even if his age P and the number n of children were revealed, the children’s ages could not be worked out.  
   Therefore for the actual pair (n , P) there must be more than one multiset of ages whose sum is S and whose product is P.

3.  As soon as the second mathematician hears the father’s answer (“No, you could not”), he is able to deduce P.  
   Hence, among all the pairs (n , P) that satisfy condition 2, all of them have exactly the same value of P (otherwise he would still be in doubt).

Our job is to find the value S for which these three conditions hold.

Step 1 – sums up to 11  
For S ≤ 11 one can list all partitions of S and check that for every pair (n , P) there is only one set of ages.  
Thus condition 2 is impossible; these values of S are ruled out.

Step 2 – the sum 12  
List all partitions of 12.

• With 3 children every product is different, so n = 3 never satisfies condition 2.  
• With 4 children we meet

  1 + 3 + 4 + 4 ⇒ P = 48  
  2 + 2 + 2 + 6 ⇒ P = 48  

 Same n (=4) and same product (=48) but two different sets of ages.  
 So (n , P) = (4 , 48) satisfies condition 2.

No other pair (n , P) for S = 12 has this property; for n = 5,6,… every product occurs once only.  
Thus for S = 12 there is exactly one age of the father (48) that makes condition 2 true, so condition 3 is satisfied.  
Therefore S = 12 is a candidate.

Step 3 – the sum 13  
Do the same for S = 13.

• With 3 children

  1 + 6 + 6 ⇒ P = 36  
  2 + 2 + 9 ⇒ P = 36  

• With 5 children

  1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 6 ⇒ P = 48  
  1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 4 ⇒ P = 48  

So two different values of P (36 and 48) satisfy condition 2.  
Because of that, after the father’s negative answer the second mathematician would still not know whether the father is 36 or 48 years old, contradicting condition 3.  
Hence S = 13 is impossible.

Step 4 – sums 14 and larger  
Already for S = 14 the 3‐child partitions give two different ambiguous products (40 and 72).  
As S grows, the number of different ambiguous products only increases.  
Consequently condition 3 can never be met for S ≥ 14.

Conclusion  
The only bus number that fulfils all three conditions is 12, and in that case the father is 48 years old and has four children whose ages are either 1, 3, 4, 4 or 2, 2, 2, 6.

The amount of money (dinars) they received for each camel was the same as the total number of camels they owned. With that money they bought as many sheep as possible at 10 dinars a sheep. With the money that was left they bought a goat.
On their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, ""I take the last sheep and you can get the goat"". ""That's not fair,"" said Achmed, ""a goat costs less than a sheep"". ""OK,"" Ali said, ""then I will give you one of my dogs and then we are even"". And Achmed agreed.
What's the cost of a dog?",,"1 sheep - 1 dog = 1 goat + 1 dog
1 sheep - 1 goat = 2 dogs
A sheep is 10 dinars, but what does a goat cost?
The money they received for their camels is a square. And the digit in the tens-place of this square is odd (total money / 10 dinars), because they could not divide the sheep equally.
Now the interesting thing is that all squares with an odd tens-place end with a 6. (16^2 = 256, 24^2 = 576). So a goat must cost 6 dinars.
10 - 6 = 2 dogs
So a dog costs 2 dinars.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

N = number of camels (and also the price, in dinars, of each camel)  
S = number of sheep bought  
g = price of the goat (1 – 9 dinars)  

1.  Money obtained for the camels  
   Total money = N × N = N² dinars.

2.  Spending the money  
   Sheep cost 10 dinars each, so  
   N² = 10 S + g, with 0 < g < 10.  (1)

3.  Dividing the sheep  
   When the two men tried to split the flock there was one sheep left over, so S is odd:  
   S = 2k + 1 for some integer k.  (2)

4.  Express N² modulo 20  
   Substitute (2) in (1):  
   N² = 10(2k + 1) + g = 20k + 10 + g.  
   Hence  
   N² ≡ 10 + g  (mod 20).  (3)

5.  Possible quadratic residues modulo 20  
   A square modulo 20 can only be 0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 16 (check the residues 0–19).

6.  Find g  
   From (3) the right–hand side, 10 + g, lies between 11 and 19.  
   Among 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 the only value that is a quadratic residue is 16.  
   Therefore  
   10 + g = 16  ⇒  g = 6.

7.  Value of the dog  
   The final deal sets  
   value(sheep) = value(goat) + value(dog)  
   10 = 6 + d   ⇒  d = 4.

74,"Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?","The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","The minimum number of weights is 5.
weight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0
weight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1
weight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2
weight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3
weight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4
All five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.
The progression from one stone to one mass would be:
1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Call the unknown load W (1 ≤ W ≤ 121) and suppose we are using an ordinary two–pan balance.

1.  How many weights are absolutely necessary?  
   •  Each individual weight can be in one of three states:  
      on the left pan (–1), unused (0) or on the right pan (+1).  
   •  With n different weights this gives at most 3ⁿ different net
      balances.  
   •  We must be able to distinguish the 122 different values
      0,1,2,…,121.  
   •  Hence 3ⁿ ≥ 122 ⇒ n ≥ 5.  
   Therefore at least five weights are required; four can never be enough.

2.  Five weights are in fact sufficient.  
    Choose them so that every weight is three times the preceding one:
        1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone and 81 stone.

    Reason: any integer between −121 and +121 has a unique
    representation in balanced ternary with five “trits”

                 W = c₀·1 + c₁·3 + c₂·9 + c₃·27 + c₄·81,  
                 cᵢ ∈ {‑1,0,1}.

    To weigh a particular load W,
    • put on the right pan every weight whose coefficient cᵢ = +1;  
    • put on the same pan as the load every weight whose coefficient cᵢ = –1.

    Examples  
      2 = (+3) + (‑1) → place 3‑stone right, 1‑stone with the load.  
      50 = (+81) + (‑27) + (‑3) + (‑1)  
          → 81‑stone right, 27‑, 3‑ and 1‑stone left, etc.

    Because the largest possible positive total of the five weights is
    1+3+9+27+81 = 121, every load up to a full mass (121 stone)
    can be handled.

Hence the fewest weights the chief must carry are

         1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone, 81 stone.

Final answer: 5 weights of 1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone and 81 stone.",True
