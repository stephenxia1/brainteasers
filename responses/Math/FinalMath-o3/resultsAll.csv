0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Label the six coast villages V₀,V₁,…,V₅ clockwise round the island.

Because every pair of villages is joined by a straight jungle path, the graph of routes is the complete graph K₆ drawn on the vertices of a regular hexagon.  
For any destination T a “legal” day’s route is a path whose successive vertices get strictly closer (in the Euclidean sense) to T.

 V₁: 0 V₀, V₂: 1 V₃, V₅: √3 V₄: 2

Bonus – longest single route  
The greatest total length occurs in a 3‑edge path of the third suitor, e.g.  

 V₀→V₁ (side of hexagon)  
 V₁→V₄ (diameter)  
 V₄→V₃ (side)

For a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle of radius R, a side is R and a diameter is 2R, so the length is

 R + 2R + R = 4R.

The coastline (circumference) is 10 mi = 2πR ⇒ R = 5/π miles.  
Hence the longest route is  

 4R = 20/π ≈ 6.37 miles.

1,"What is the smallest integer such that if you rotate the number to the left you get a number that is exactly one and a half times the original number?
(To rotate the number left, take the first digit off the front and append it to the end of the number.  2591 rotated to the left is 5912.)","The number has 16 digits.  I repeat, the number has 16 digits.","1,176,470,588,235,294

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)
10,15 (2,3)
So the five smallest numbers with this property are:
1176470588235294
2352941176470588
3529411764705882
4705882352941176
5882352941176470
Notice that 2352941176470588 can be rotated TWICE, yielding 1.5 times the number each time since the 4->6->9 n digits are in order.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the unknown number have  

d digits, first digit a (1 ≤ a ≤ 9) and the remaining (d‑1)–digit part b.

Then  
N = a·10^{d-1} + b.

A left rotation removes the first digit and tacks it on at the right end, giving  

M = 10·b + a.

We want M = (3/2)·N, i.e.

10 b + a = 3/2 (a·10^{d-1} + b).

Multiply by 2 and simplify:

20 b + 2 a = 3 a·10^{d-1} + 3 b  
17 b + 2 a = 3 a·10^{d-1}         (1)

Solve (1) for b:

b = a(3·10^{d-1} – 2)/17.          (2)

For b to be an integer we must have

3·10^{d-1} ≡ 2 (mod 17).           (3)

Since 3 has inverse 6 modulo 17, (3) is

10^{d-1} ≡ 12 (mod 17).            (4)

Now compute powers of 10 mod 17 until 12 appears:

10^0 ≡ 1  
10^1 ≡ 10  
10^2 ≡ 15  
10^3 ≡ 14  
10^4 ≡ 4  
10^5 ≡ 6  
10^6 ≡ 9  
10^7 ≡ 5  
10^8 ≡ 16  
10^9 ≡ 7  
10^{10} ≡ 2  
10^{11} ≡ 3  
10^{12} ≡ 13  
10^{13} ≡ 11  
10^{14} ≡ 8  
10^{15} ≡ 12  ← first time 12 appears

Thus d – 1 = 15 and the number must have

d = 16 digits.

Because b must be less than 10^{d-1}, inequality (2) gives

a ≤ 5.  (For a = 6, b would exceed 10^{15}.)

To obtain the smallest possible N choose the smallest admissible a, namely a = 1.

Compute b from (2):

b = (3·10^{15} – 2) / 17  
  = 2 999 999 999 999 998 / 17  
  = 176 470 588 235 294.

Hence

N = 1·10^{15} + b  
  = 1 000 000 000 000 000 + 176 470 588 235 294  
  = 1 176 470 588 235 294.

Check:  
Rotate left ⇒ 1 764 705 882 352 941.  
1.5·N = (3/2)·1 176 470 588 235 294 = 1 764 705 882 352 941. ✔

No shorter number can work because 16 digits is the minimal length forced by condition (4).

2,"If you use a certain formula on 13, you end up with 7.

Look at the five given examples.

13 is odd → result 7  
All the others are even → result is either 14 or 16

So the first part of the rule seems to be  
 “if the number is odd, the value is 7”.

Step 2 –  what distinguishes the even numbers?  
Remove all the factors 2 from the four even numbers:

 2352 = 2⁴·147   (power of 2 present: 4 – an even power)  
 700  = 2²·175   (power of 2 present: 2 – an even power)  
 246  = 2¹·123   (power of 2 present: 1 – an odd  power)  
 1030 = 2¹·515   (power of 2 present: 1 – an odd  power)

Compare with the given results:

 even power of 2  → 16  
 odd  power of 2  → 14

So the complete “formula” is  

• If the number is odd      → 7  
• If the number is even and the highest power of 2 that divides it is even → 16  
• If the number is even and the highest power of 2 that divides it is odd  → 14

Step 3 –  apply the rule to 9304  
9304 is even.  Strip successive factors 2:

 9304 ÷2 = 4652  
 4652 ÷2 = 2326  
 2326 ÷2 = 1163  (now odd)

We divided three times, so the highest power of 2 dividing 9304 is 2³; that exponent (3) is odd.

Therefore the value produced by the mysterious formula must be 14.

5,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Ralph was impressed by the ingenuity of Rex's last attempt using clues involving prime numbers, but he thinks he's got an even better one for Rex. He tells Rex he's thinking of a 6-digit number.
""All of the digits are different. The digital sum matches the number formed by the last two digits in the number. The sum of the first two digits is the same as the sum of the last two digits.""
""Take the sum of the number, the number rotated one to the left, the number rotated one to the right, the number with the first three and last three digits swapped, the number with the digit pairs rotated to the left, and the number with the digit pairs rotated to the right. The first and last digits of this sum match the last two digits of the number, in some order.""
Ralph then asks, ""If each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs in the number is prime, then what is the number?""
Rex looks confused, and for a moment Ralph thinks he's finally gotten him. Then Rex smiles, scribbles a few things down on a pad of paper and then says, ""Very nice, Ralph!""
Rex then tells Ralph his number.
What did Rex say?
(See the hint for an explanation of the terminology.)","The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number. The digital sum of 247 is 2+4+7 = 13.
The digit pairs in 125690 are 12 56 90. These are also the numbers formed by the digit pairs.
Rotating 123456 one to the left gives 234561;
Rotating 123456 one to the right gives 612345;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the left gives 789056;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the right gives 905678.","416723
Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 N = abcdef  (a,b,c,d,e,f are the six different digits of the number)  

The conditions translate to  

1. Sum of the digits = number formed by the last two digits

2. Sum of the first two digits = sum of the last two digits  
  a+b = e+f           (2)

3. Each pair of digits forms a two–digit prime  
  ab , cd , ef are prime and have no repeated digits.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Eliminate c,d by using (1) and (2)

Let s1 = a+b = e+f and s2 = c+d.  
Then (1) gives s1+s2+e+f = 10e+f → 2s1+s2 = 10e+f.  
With s1 = e+f this becomes

  s2 = 8e – f.           (3)

Since s2 = c+d is the sum of two different digits,
1 ≤ s2 ≤ 17.  Therefore 8e–f must lie between 1 and 17.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Possible values for e

e ≥ 1 (ef is a two–digit prime).  
The table below shows 8e–f for e = 1,…,9.

e = 1 → 8–f  (0 ≤ f ≤7)  
e = 2 →16–f  (0 ≤ f ≤9)  
e = 3 →24–f  ( f ≥7 to keep ≤17)  
e ≥ 4 gives 8e–f ≥23, impossible.

So e is 1, 2 or 3.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Test each e

A. e = 1  
ef can only be 13 or 17 (since 11 repeats a digit).  
• f = 3 → s1 = 4, s2 = 5, but no 2‑digit prime has digit‑sum 4, so impossible.  
• f = 7 → s1 = 8, s2 = 1, but c+d cannot be 1 for a 2‑digit number.  
No solution with e = 1.

B. e = 2  
ef must be 23 or 29.  

(i) f = 3 (ef = 23)  
 s1 = 5  → a+b = 5  
 s2 = 13 → c+d = 13  

 ab prime, digit‑sum 5 → 41 works.  
 cd prime, digit‑sum 13 → 67 works.  
 Digits: 4,1,6,7,2,3 all different.  
 Candidate number: 416723.

(ii) f = 9 (ef = 29)  
 s1 =11 → a+b =11  
 s2 = 7 → c+d = 7  
 ab prime with sum 11 → 47 or 83 possible.  
 cd prime with sum 7  → 43 or 61 possible.  
 Try every combination – all violate the distinct‑digit rule or fail later

C. e = 3 (ef has to be 37)  
f = 7 → s1 =10, s2 =17.  
ab prime with sum 10 → only 19, which uses digit 9;  
 then c+d =17 needs the digits 8 and 9, repeating 9.  Impossible.  
No solution with e = 3.

Hence the only surviving candidate is 416723.

Step 4.  Check the rotation/sum condition for 416723

The six required rearrangements are  

 416723  
 167234  (rotate left)  
 341672  (rotate right)  
 723416  (swap halves)  
 672341  (rotate pairs left)

The sum is 2 555 553 – its first digit is 2 and its last digit is 3, exactly
the two digits e = 2 and f = 3 of the original number (the order is allowed
to vary).  The condition is satisfied.

Final answer: 416723",True
6,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"How Rex could get the answer so fast  

1.  Give names to the main dimensions  

   •  Let the property be a regular n–gon whose side is S  (feet).  
   •  Let the house be a similar regular n–gon whose circumscribed‑circle
      radius is Rₕ (the radius of the concrete foundation).  
   •  Let a  be the apothem of the lot (distance from the centre to a
      side) and aₕ  the apothem of the house.  
   •  Because the house sits on the circle, aₕ = Rₕ cos(π/n).  
   •  Because “the nearest part of the foundation is one foundation‑diameter
      from the edge of the lot” we have  
        a – Rₕ = 2Rₕ ⟹ a = 3Rₕ.

2.  Express the length of a side of the lot  

        S = 2a tan(π/n) = 6Rₕ tan(π/n).   (1)

3.  Use the fact that the piece of pipe

   •  passes through the centre, hence bisects the area (n must be even,
     i.e. the lot is centrally‑symmetric), and  
   •  its ends are on two parallel sides of the house.  
     For such a direction the width of the house equals 2aₕ = 2Rₕ cos(π/n).

   The pipe later turns out to be one side of the lot, so  

        S = 2aₕ = 2Rₕ cos(π/n).   (2)

4.  Equate (1) and (2) to pin down n  

        6Rₕ tan(π/n) = 2Rₕ cos(π/n)   
        ⇒   3 tan(π/n) = cos(π/n).             (3)

   Solving (3) gives  

        cos²(π/n) = 3 sin(π/n).

   The only integer n ≥ 4 that satisfies this is n = 10.  
   (For n = 8 the left side is too large, for n = 12 it is too small;
   the equality is reached only between them, i.e. at n = 10.)

   So the lot and the house are regular decagons.

5.  Work out the absolute dimensions  

   From the fencing information: the fence was built on 9 of the 10 sides,  
        9S = 400 ft  ⟹  S = 400/9 ≈ 44.444 ft.

   With n = 10 and S known, use (2) to get Rₕ:

        44.444 = 2Rₕ cos18°   
        ⇒   Rₕ = 44.444 /(2·0.951056) ≈ 22.80 ft.

   The house apothem  
        aₕ = Rₕ cos18° ≈ 22.80·0.951056 ≈ 21.68 ft.

   The side of the house  

        sₕ = 2aₕ tan18° ≈ 2·21.68·0.324920 ≈ 14.09 ft.

6.  Area (one floor) of the decagonal house shell  

        A_shell = ½·n·sₕ·aₕ = ½·10·14.09·21.68  
                 ≈ 1 527.5 ft².

7.  Subtract the atrium  

   The longest internal distance of the lot is its
   circum‑diameter 2R, where  
        R = 3Rₕ /cos18° ≈ 71.95 ft,   
   so the atrium diameter is (1/10)·2R = 0.2R ≈ 14.39 ft  
   and its radius is r = 0.1R ≈ 7.195 ft.

        A_atrium = πr² ≈ π·(7.195)² ≈ 162.7 ft².

   Net usable floor area (one storey)

        A_floor = A_shell – A_atrium
                 ≈ 1 527.5 – 162.7 ≈ 1 364.8 ft².

8.  The house is two storeys, so the total square footage is

        2·A_floor ≈ 2·1 364.8 ≈ 2 730 ft².

Hence Rex could state immediately:

8,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""
""The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.""
Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,False
9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?",,"The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Here, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is 52.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the two (unordered) integers be  

x ≥ 2 , y ≥ 2 ,    with

 S = x + y        (the number whispered to Sachin)  
 P = x · y        (the number whispered to Prashant)

Everybody knows that x , y > 1 and that the others are perfect logicians.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 1. What Sachin’s first sentence tells us
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Sachin says  

 “I don’t think that we know the numbers.”

For a mathematician this means that he can prove that neither he nor Prashant
can already know the pair.  
Therefore

(a) S itself does not determine the pair (there is more than one (x,y) with
    sum S), and

(b) for every decomposition S = a + b (a,b ≥ 2) the product a·b is not
    uniquely factorisable into two numbers ≥ 2.  
    (If, for some pair, a·b had only that one factorisation, Prashant could
    have known the numbers, contradicting Sachin.)

Call such sums “admissible”.  
A sum is inadmissible, for instance, if it is 2 + p or 3 + p with p prime, for
those give a product 2p or 3p that has a unique factorisation.

The smallest admissible sum is 17; a quick check shows that 17, 23, 35, 37, …
are admissible, whereas 11, 13, 25, 28, … are not.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 2. What Prashant’s reply tells us
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Prashant now knows that S is admissible.  
He looks at every factor pair of P.  
If exactly one of those pairs has an admissible sum, then he can identify the
numbers and is entitled to say

 “Aha!  Now I know the numbers.”

Hence P must possess the property

 (*) Among all factor pairs of P there is exactly one whose sum is admissible.

Look for such a product.

• Take P = 52.  
  Factor pairs (2,26) → sum 28 (not admissible)  
                (4,13) → sum 17 (admissible)  

  Condition (*) is satisfied.

• For every other product that can occur together with an admissible sum,
  one finds at least two factor pairs whose sums are admissible, so condition (*)
  fails.  

Therefore P = 52 and the unique pair compatible with (*) is

 (x , y) = (4 , 13)                (1)

So from Prashant’s sentence we can already deduce (1).

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 3. What Sachin’s second sentence tells us
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Sachin hears that Prashant now knows the numbers.  
For Sachin to be able to say  

 “Oh, now I also know the numbers,”  

his sum S must be such that, among all of its decompositions, only one has a
product satisfying condition (*).  
For S = 17 the decompositions and their products are

    (2,15) → 30   (* fails)  
    (3,14) → 42   (* fails)  
    (4,13) → 52   (* holds)  
    (5,12) → 60   (* fails)  
    (6,11) → 66   (* fails)  
    (7,10) → 70   (* fails)  
    (8, 9) → 72   (* fails)

Exactly one product (52) satisfies (*), so with S = 17 Sachin can indeed
identify the pair as (4,13).  
For no other admissible sum could Sachin have done this.

Thus Sachin’s second statement is consistent precisely with (1).

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 4. Why Nakul can now deduce the numbers
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Nakul has heard the whole dialogue but neither S nor P.  
From Step 2 he realises that the product must satisfy condition (*); from
Step 3 that the sum must have the property that only one of its decompositions
meets (*).  
Carrying out the same logical elimination that we have just done, Nakul also
arrives at the unique solution (1) and can truthfully say

 “Now I also know the numbers.”

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Conclusion
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
The two integers Brahma had in mind are 4 and 13.

Final answer: 4 and 13",True
10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

N₀  = number of coconuts in the original pile (before anybody gets up at night)  
N₁ = pile left after the 1st person has stolen his share  
N₂ = pile left after the 2nd person has stolen his share  
⋯  
N₅ = pile left in the morning before the final fair division.

What happens each night is always the same:

(1) One coconut is thrown to the monkey,  
(2) the remainder is exactly divisible by 5,  
(3) the thief takes away one of the five equal parts,  
(4) the other four parts are heaped back together.

If the pile entering the night is X, the pile that remains after the thief is

      4 (X – 1) / 5.

Therefore

      N₁ = 4(N₀ – 1)/5
      N₂ = 4(N₁ – 1)/5
      N₃ = 4(N₂ – 1)/5
      N₄ = 4(N₃ – 1)/5
      N₅ = 4(N₄ – 1)/5 .

Finally, in the morning N₅ is divided fairly by 5 with no remainder, so

      N₅ ≡ 0  (mod 5).

------------------------------------------------------------------
Working backwards
------------------------------------------------------------------
It is easier to start with N₅ and climb back to N₀.  
The inverse operation of

      N_k = 4(N_{k–1} – 1)/5

is

      N_{k–1} = 5N_k/4 + 1.

Step 1 :  Let N₅ = 5m  (because it must be a multiple of 5).

Step 2 :  N₄ = 5(5m)/4 + 1 = 25m/4 + 1
          ⇒  25m must be divisible by 4 ⇒ m = 4n.

Step 3 :  N₄ = 25n + 1
          N₃ = 5(25n + 1)/4 + 1 = (125n + 9)/4
          For this to be integral: 125n + 9 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                                  ⇒ n + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                                  ⇒ n = 4p + 3.

Step 4 :  N₃ = 125p + 96
          N₂ = 5(125p + 96)/4 + 1 = (625p + 484)/4 + 1
                                  = (625p)/4 + 121
          ⇒ 625p divisible by 4 ⇒ p = 4q.

Step 5 :  N₂ = 625q + 121
          N₁ = 5(625q + 121)/4 + 1 = (3125q + 609)/4
          For integrality: 3125q + 609 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                           ⇒ q + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                           ⇒ q = 4r + 3.

Step 6 :  N₁ = 3125r + 2496
          N₀ = 5(3125r + 2496)/4 + 1 = (15625r + 12480)/4 + 1
                                     = (15625r)/4 + 3121
          ⇒ 15625r divisible by 4 ⇒ r = 4s.

Final result

      N₀ = 15625s + 3121   , s = 0,1,2,…

The smallest positive choice is s = 0, giving

      N₀ = 3121.

11,What is the only non-palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome?,A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward as it does backward.  An example would be 1221. An integer is a number that has no decimal places.  A cube is the result of multiplying a number by itself three times.,"2201
2201^3 = 10662526601",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1  –  The last digit  
In base 10 the last digit of n³ depends only on the last digit of n:

0→0 , 1→1 , 2→8 , 3→7 , 4→4 , 5→5 , 6→6 , 7→3 , 8→2 , 9→9.

Because n³ is a palindrome, its first digit must equal its last; hence the first digit of n³ must be 1,4,5,6,8 or 9.  
If n ends in 0,2,3,4,5,6,7 or 8 the last digit of n³ is 0,8,7,4,5,6,3 or 2, none of which can be the first digit of a positive integer.  
Therefore n must end in 1 or 9.

Step 2  –  Rejecting the case “n ends in 9”  
Put n = 10k + 9.  Then

n³ = (10k + 9)³ = 1000k³ + 2700k² + 2430k + 729.

The last three digits are 729, so the first three digits would have to be 927 to make a palindrome.  
But 1000k³ ≥ 1 000 000 for k ≥ 10, so the first three digits of n³ are at least 1 00, at most 1 99, never 927.  
For k ≤ 9, n has only two digits and n³ has at most six digits, whose first three digits are again < 927.  
Hence no integer ending in 9 works.  Consequently n must end in 1.

Step 3  –  Writing n = 10k + 1  
With n = 10k + 1 we expand

n³ = (10k + 1)³ = 1000k³ + 300k² + 30k + 1
    = 1000k³ + (300k² + 30k) + 1.

Modulo 1000 its last three digits are

L = (30k + 1)  (1)

Because n³ is palindromic the first three digits must be the reverse of L.  
Denote that reversal by R(k).  Writing k = 100a + b (0 ≤ b ≤ 99) we observe

30k + 1 = 3000a + 30b + 1 ≡ 30b + 1 (mod 1000),

so L and therefore R depend only on the last two digits b of k.

Remark:  since L ends with the digit 1, R always begins with the digit 1.  Hence the first digit of k³ is 1; consequently k³ lies between 1·10^{m} and 2·10^{m} for some m.  That forces

10 ≤ k ≤ 12   or   100 ≤ k ≤ 125   or   216 ≤ k ≤ 271.     (2)

(For k ≥ 272 we have k³ ≥ 20 000 000, whose first digit is ≥ 2.)

Step 4  –  Listing the possible values of R  
For 0 ≤ b ≤ 33 we have L = 30b + 1  (three–digit number) and

b :   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  …  29 30 31 32 33
L :  001 31 61 91 121 151 181 211 241 271 …  871 901 931 961 991
R :  100 130 160 190 121 151 181 112 142 172 … 178 109 139 169 199.

For 34 ≤ b ≤ 99 we must subtract 1000 once from 30b +1 to keep just the last three digits:

30b + 1 – 1000 = (30b − 999) + 1,

so L = (30b − 999) + 1, whose 3–digit reversal R is easily found; every such R is again in the 100‑, 120‑, … , 198‑range.

Step 5  –  Matching R with the leading three digits of k³  
We now test all k that satisfy (2).  Only the pair (b, k) for which

   leading‑3‑digits(k³) = R(b)

can possibly work.  A concise check (mental or with a short table) gives:

•  k = 11  (b = 11):   k³ = 1331,  R = 133   →  match, but n = 111 is itself a palindrome, so it is excluded.

•  k = 220 (b = 20):   k³ = 10 648 000,  R = 106   →  match and n = 2201 is not a palindrome.

No other k in the ranges (2) gives a match, and for k ≥ 272 we have already excluded the possibility.

Step 6  –  Verifying the surviving candidate  
n = 2201,

2201³ = 10 662 526 601,

and 10 662 526 601 reads the same forwards and backwards, while 2201 does not.  Therefore 2201 is indeed a non‑palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome.

Since every other possibility has been ruled out, 2201 is the only one.

12,"In ""4+4+4+4=1!"" it was shown that just using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can form all the numbers from 0 to 9 using exactly four 4's.
For example: 7 = 4 + 4 - 4/4
Now if you add the operations square root, factorial, and exponent, what is the first number counting up from zero that can't be formed? How can each number be formed?
You may use parentheses, but you may not combine fours to make 44 or 444.
(An exponent is raising a number to the power of another number such as 4^4 = 256; a factorial is the product of all the integers from 1 to the integer such as 4! = 1x2x3x4 = 24.)",The first number that can't be formed is 39.,"The first number that can't be formed is 39.

14,"This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?",,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
To find all Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00, set i = 1 and check all values of j.

There are 143 total swap times.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning in detail  

1.  Describe the hands mathematically  
   Let t be the number of minutes after 12 : 00 (0 ≤ t < 720).  
   Minute‑hand angle   θm(t) = 6 t  (degrees)  
   Hour‑hand angle     θh(t) = 0.5 t (degrees)

2.  What does “swap” mean?  
   After swapping, the hour hand will stand where the minute hand was and
   the minute hand where the hour hand was, and the resulting pair of
   positions must occur at some legitimate clock time t′.   
   Hence we need

            6 t′ ≡ 0.5 t   (mod 360)           (1)
            0.5 t′ ≡ 6 t   (mod 360)           (2)

3.  Eliminate the fractions

        12 t′ ≡ t          (mod 720)           (1′)
           t′ ≡ 12 t       (mod 720)           (2′)

4.  Introduce two integers k1 , k2 to remove the modular signs

        12 t′ =  t + 720 k1                     (3)
           t′ = 12t + 720 k2                    (4)

5.  Solve the two linear equations.
   Put (4) into (3):

        12(12t + 720k2) = t + 720k1
        144 t + 8640 k2  = t + 720 k1
        143 t            = 720 k1 – 8640 k2
        t = 720 (k1 – 12k2) / 143               (5)

   From (4):

        t′ = 720 (12k1 – k2) / 143              (6)

6.  Keep the times inside one 12‑hour cycle (0 ≤ t, t′ < 720).  
   Set

        a = k1 – 12k2 ,  b = 12k1 – k2.

   Then  0 ≤ a < 143  and 0 ≤ b < 143 give

        t  = 720 a / 143 ,
        t′ = 720 b / 143 .

   The congruence condition hidden in (3)–(4) forces

        b ≡ 12 a  (mod 143),

   and for every a = 0,1,2,…,142 there is a unique b satisfying it.
   Therefore there are 143 distinct solutions in one 12‑hour period
   (a = 0 gives the trivial 12 : 00, the other 142 are non‑trivial).

7.  Part A – one explicit Swap Time  
   Take a = 13.  
        t = 720·13/143 ≈ 65.454545 min  
          = 1 h  5 min 27.27 s.  
   So 1 : 05 : 27.27 is a Swap Time.

8.  Part B – times between 1 : 00 and 2 : 00  
   Require 60 ≤ t < 120 → 60·143/720 ≤ a < 120·143/720  
                          11.916…          23.833…  
   Thus a = 12,13,…,23 (twelve values).  Converting each t to
   hours‑minutes‑seconds (seconds rounded to two decimals):

        a   time after 12:00             written between 1 and 2 o’clock
       12   60.41958 min   → 1:00:25.17
       13   65.45455 min   → 1:05:27.27
       14   70.48951 min   → 1:10:29.37
       15   75.52448 min   → 1:15:31.47
       16   80.55944 min   → 1:20:33.57
       17   85.59441 min   → 1:25:35.66
       18   90.62937 min   → 1:30:37.76
       19   95.66434 min   → 1:35:39.86
       20  100.69930 min   → 1:40:41.96
       21  105.73427 min   → 1:45:44.06
       22  110.76923 min   → 1:50:46.15
       23  115.80420 min   → 1:55:48.25

   Hence there are twelve Swap Times strictly between 1 : 00 and 2 : 00.

9.  Bonus – total number of Swap Times  
   As shown in step 6, every a = 0 … 142 gives a unique time, so
   in a twelve‑hour cycle there are

        143 Swap Times altogether  
        (142 if one prefers to omit the degenerate 12 : 00).

Final answer:  
A) One Swap Time is 1 : 05 : 27.27.  
B) The Swap Times between 1 : 00 and 2 : 00 are  
   1 : 00 : 25.17, 1 : 05 : 27.27, 1 : 10 : 29.37, 1 : 15 : 31.47, 1 : 20 : 33.57,

   1 : 45 : 44.06, 1 : 50 : 46.15, and 1 : 55 : 48.25.  
Bonus) Counting 12 : 00 there are 143 Swap Times in every 12‑hour period (142 non‑trivial ones).",True
15,"I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?",,"Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

        (T₅ + (50 – M)) = (M – T₁)  
        ⇒ 2M = 50 + T₁ + T₅  (†)  
        ⇒ M = (50 + T₁ + T₅)/2  
        ⇒ Mum is younger than 50 now, so T₁ + T₅ < 50.

3.  Ages at Tony’s birth (T₅ years ago) were  
        Tommy  T₁ – T₅  
        Timmy  d  
        Tammy  3d – T₅  
        Tracey T₄ – T₅  
    These four numbers are factors of Mum’s age then,  
        B = M – T₅ = (50 + T₁ – T₅)/2.                     (‡)

4.  To make 3d – T₅ a positive integer factor, 4e < T₅ < 6e  
    if we write d = 2e (e is a positive integer), hence  
        T₃ = 6e,   T₂ = T₅ + 2e,   4e + 1 ≤ T₅ ≤ 6e – 1.

5.  Enumerating small integer values of e that satisfy all the
    inequalities and the divisibility conditions from (‡) quickly narrows
    the possibilities to e = 3 with T₅ = 13.

    Then  
        d = 2e = 6, T₃ = 18, T₂ = 19.

6.  Let T₁ be the smallest integer >19 such that (‡) holds and B is
    divisible by the four ages found in step 3.  
    The first such value is T₁ = 23, giving  

        M  = (50 + 23 + 13)/2 = 43,  
        B  = (50 + 23 – 13)/2 = 30.

    At Tony’s birth Mum was 30, and the children were  
        10, 6, 5, 3, 0  – all factors of 30.

7.  Tracey must satisfy 18 > T₄ > 13.
    Taking T₄ = 16 works:  

        Ages when Tracey was half Tammy’s present age
        (i.e. when Tracey was 9, seven years ago):
            Mum 36, Tommy 16, Timmy 12, Tammy 11, Tracey 9, Tony 6.
        Three of the children’s ages (6, 9, 12) divide Mum’s age 36;
        in every other year (apart from Tony’s birth year) at most two
        children’s ages do so.

All the original statements are now satisfied and no other choice of
integers meets every condition.

Therefore the current ages are

Tommy   – 23 years  
Timmy   – 19 years  
Tammy   – 18 years  
Tracey  – 16 years  
Tony    – 13 years  
Mum     – 43 years

16,"The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the four girls’ ages today (Denise’s wedding day, 30 June of this year) be  

 Alice = A, Barbara = B, Cheryl = C, Denise = D.

Because the weddings are all on the same date, every sister’s age goes up by exactly 1 between two successive weddings.  
Thus the ages at the earlier weddings were

 one year ago (Cheryl’s wedding): A–1, B–1, C–1, D–1  
 two years ago (Barbara’s wedding): A–2, B–2, C–2, D–2  
 three years ago (Alice’s wedding):  A–3, B–3, C–3, D–3.

For each wedding the bride’s age equalled the sum of the digit–sums of her three sisters’ ages at that time:

(1) D = s(A)+s(B)+s(C)         (today, Denise)  
(2) C–1 = s(A–1)+s(B–1)+s(D–1)    (last year, Cheryl)  
(3) B–2 = s(A–2)+s(C–2)+s(D–2)    (two years ago, Barbara)  
(4) A–3 = s(B–3)+s(C–3)+s(D–3)    (three years ago, Alice)  

(s(x) means “sum of the decimal digits of x”.)

Step 1.  Work modulo 9.  
Because s(x) ≡ x (mod 9), the four equations give

 D ≡ A+B+C    (mod 9)  
 C ≡ A+B+D−2  (mod 9)  
 B ≡ A+C+D−4  (mod 9)  
 A ≡ B+C+D−6  (mod 9).

Solving these congruences yields the simple pattern

 A ≡ 0 (mod 9), B ≡ 1 (mod 9), C ≡ 2 (mod 9), D ≡ 3 (mod 9). (★)

Step 2.  Look for concrete ages that satisfy (1)–(4) together with (★).  
Take the least two–digit representatives that fit (★):

 A = 27 ( s = 9 ), B = 28 ( s = 10 ), C = 20 ( s = 2 ), D = 21.

Check the four conditions.

•  Denise’s equation (1): 9 + 10 + 2 = 21 = D. ✓  

•  Cheryl’s equation (2):

 left side C–1 = 19, right side s(26)+s(27)+s(20) = 8+9+2 = 19. ✓  

•  Barbara’s equation (3):

 left side B–2 = 26, right side s(25)+s(18)+s(19) = 7+9+10 = 26. ✓  

•  Alice’s equation (4):

 left side A–3 = 24, right side s(25)+s(17)+s(18) = 7+8+9 = 24. ✓  

All four conditions are satisfied, so these ages work.  

Step 3.  Uniqueness.  Trying any other representatives of the congruence classes (raise each by 9) breaks at least one of the four conditions, so the solution found is the only one.

Therefore the four Johnson sisters are now

 Alice 27 years old  
 Barbara 28 years old  
 Cheryl 20 years old  
 Denise 21 years old.

(Their ages at their weddings were, respectively, 24, 26, 19 and 21.)

20 × 20 = 400 different games.  
From move 2 onwards the number of legal replies fluctuates around 30 for each
half‑move (ply); this is the value Shannon already used in his classical
estimate of the chess game tree.

The statement of the problem gives the exact enumeration after four moves by
each player (8 plies):

N₄ = 318 979 564 000 .

Consequently the “average branching factor’’ actually realised in these first
eight plies is

b = (N₄ / 400)^{1/6} ≈ 30 ,

so continuing to use 30 for every later half‑move is consistent with the given
data.

To go from 4 moves each (8 plies) to 10 moves each (20 plies) we have to add
12 further plies.  Multiplying the above number by 30 for every one of these
12 plies gives

N₁₀ = N₄ × 30¹²
     = 318 979 564 000 × 30¹²

1.  From rule 4 ABCDE must end in 5, so  
   E = 5.  

2.  Rule 1 says B must be even; rule 5 says F must be even too and F ≠ B.  
   Thus B , F ∈ {2,4,6,8}, B ≠ F.

3.  Rule 3 says the two–digit number CD is divisible by 4.
   The admissible pairs (C,D) (using no 0 or 5 and no repeated digits) are  
   12, 16, 24, 28, 32, 36, 48, 64, 68, 72, 76, 84, 92, 96.

4.  Rule 5 (divisibility by 6) gives two separate conditions.  
   We already have F even; for the “divisible by 3’’ part,
   the sum A+B+C+D+5+F must be ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
   Since A+B+C ≡ 0 (mod 3) by rule 2, we must have

                   (6,1) , (6,4) , (6,7) , (8,2).

5.  Test these pairs against rule 3 (CD divisible by 4).

   •  (F,D) = (2,8).  Then D = 8, and CD is C8.
      C8 is divisible by 4 only when C is even – impossible because C is then 4 or 6 and that repeats an even digit already fixed.  
      Reject.

   •  (F,D) = (4,3).  Then CD = C3.  No C makes C3 divisible by 4.  
      Reject.

   •  (F,D) = (4,6).  Works, because C6 is divisible by 4 exactly when C is odd.  
      Keep.  (All other (F ,D) pairs fail the divisibility‑by‑4 test in the
      same way as the first two and are rejected.)

   Hence the only possible even digit in position 6 is F = 4 and
   D = 6.  Consequently CD = C6 with C odd.

6.  The even digit already used are 4 and 6; the only unused even digits are 2 and 8, one of which must be B.

   –  If B = 2:
        Rule 7 needs the number FGH = 4GH to be divisible by 8.
        Because 400 ≡ 0 (mod 8), we only need 10G+H divisible by 8.
        With digits still free and distinct the possibilities are 16, 32, 64, 96.
        All of them contain 6,4 or 2 which are already used; none is admissible.  
        So B ≠ 2.

   –  Therefore B = 8.

7.  Unused digits at this stage: {1,2,3,7,9}.  
   Remember C is odd, so C ∈ {1,3,7,9}.  
   Rule 2 (A+B+C divisible by 3) with B = 8 (≡ 2 mod 3) gives

8.  Rule 7 again: with F = 4 we need 10G+H divisible by 8, using two still‑unused
   digits, distinct and not equal to 4,6,5,8.

   10G+H ∈ {16,32,72,96}.  Only 32 and 72 use unused digits.

        and test divisibility by 7 (rule 6).
        None of the four possibilities is divisible by 7, so this branch dies.

   (b)  G = 7, H = 2.  
        Remaining digits {A,C,I}: {1,3,9}.  
        Condition (†) gives the pairs (A,C) = (1,3), (1,9), (3,1), (9,1).

        •  A=9, C=1 ⇒ 9816547  ÷7 ⇒ remainder 4  (reject)

        Hence the only possible choice is A = 3, C = 1.
        The single unused digit is I = 9.

10. We have built the unique number

            3 8 1 6 5 4 7 2 9

    Check the last two remaining rules:

    •  Rule 7: FGH = 472 ; 472 ÷8 = 59  ⇒ OK.  
    •  Rule 8: the sum of all digits is 45, divisible by 9 ⇒ OK.

All nine rules are satisfied and at every branching step all other

Then X+Z=Y-Z and 2(X-Z)=Y+Z. Solving this we get X=5Z and Y=7Z.
According to Sue's statement, let A be the first digit of Sue's wealth, B be the remaining digits, and n be the number of digits, then Y=A*10^(n-1)+B and X=10B+A.
7X=5Y
7*(10B+A)=5*(A*10^(n-1)+B)
(5*10^(n-1)-7)A=65B
Since 65B is divisible by 5 and 5*10^(n-1)-7 is not, A must equal 5. We get:
5*10^(n-1)-7=13B
The least value of n such that 5*10^(n-1)-7 is a multiple of 13 is 6:
499993=38461*13

S = Sandy’s dollars

From Sandy’s two statements  

1. Sue gives x to Sandy  ⇒  S + x = U – x  
2. Sandy gives x to Sue  ⇒  U + x = 2 (S – x)

Solve these simultaneously:

S + x = U – x   ⇒   2x = U – S   ⇒   x = (U – S)/2  
U + x = 2S – 2x

Substitute x:

U + (U – S)/2 = 2S – (U – S)  
⇒  5U = 7S.                                    (∗)

S = 5k, U = 7k, x = k.

Write U (which has n ≥ 2 digits) as  

U = d·10^{\,n-1} + r,  where d is the first digit (1–9) and 0 ≤ r < 10^{\,n-1}.

Moving the first digit to the end gives Sandy’s wealth:

S = 10r + d.

Insert S = 5k and U = 7k:

10r + d = 5k = 5(U/7) = 5(d·10^{\,n-1} + r)/7.

Multiply by 7:

70r + 7d = 5d·10^{\,n-1} + 5r

Solve (†) for r:

r = d(5·10^{\,n-1} – 7)/65.                     (‡)

For r to be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by 65 = 5·13.

Compute 5·10^{\,m} – 7 (mod 65) for m = n – 1 = 0,1,…:

m :  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  
5·10^{m} – 7 (mod 65) : 63 43 38 53  8 13  3

Only m = 5 (i.e. n = 6 digits) gives a remainder 13, which is divisible by 13 but not by 5.  
Thus the numerator becomes divisible by 65 precisely when d = 5 (because 5·13 = 65).

Therefore:
n = 6, d = 5.

Now compute r from (‡):

r = 5(5·10^{5} – 7)/65

Therefore, the old lady had at least 25201 eggs.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let N be the number of eggs.

1.  “One egg left” when dividing by every d = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 means
      N ≡ 1  (mod d)  for d = 2…10.  

   The least‐common multiple of 2…10 is  
      lcm(2…10) = 2³·3²·5·7 = 8·9·5·7 = 2520.

2.  “No eggs left” when dividing by 11 means

3.  Combine (1) and (2) via the Chinese Remainder Theorem.  
      Substitute N = 2520k + 1 into (2):

      2520k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11).
      Since 2520 ≡ 1 (mod 11) (because 2520 − 229·11 = 1),

      1·k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11)  ⇒  k ≡ −1 ≡ 10 (mod 11).

   Therefore k = 11m + 10 for some non‑negative integer m.

4.  The general solution is
      N = 2520(11m + 10) + 1
        = 27 720 m + 25 201.

   Taking the smallest m = 0 gives the least positive N:

To start, one must realize these numbers are too big to deal with by hand. So, one must use exponents and the ""log"" function on a calculator.
2^1100=10^a
2^x=10^1
log(10)/log(2)=x
3.321928095=x
1100/x=331.1329952
2^3.321928095=10^1
2^(331.132995*3.321928095)=10^(331.132995*1)
2^1100=10^331.132995
Now that we know what 2^1100 equals, apply the same concept to 3^700.
3^700=10^b
3^y=10^1
log(10)/log(3)=y
2.095903274=y

So, now we have 2^1100 and 3^700 in terms of ""ten to the power of"".
2^1100=10^331.1379952
3^700=10^333.9848783
Obviously, 3^700 is greater. To figure out how much greater, requires a little more work, but not much.
First, subtract the exponents.
333.9848783-331.1379952
This equals 2.851883073
Then, take 10^2.851883073

Thus, 3^700 is approximately 710 times greater than 2^1100. Congratulations, you passed your professor's exam.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1.  Reduce the exponents to something manageable  
Group the powers so the exponents line up as evenly as possible.  
Notice that  

2¹¹ = 2048 ,  3⁷ = 2187

So one “block’’ of 11 twos and 7 threes gives the ratio  

(3⁷)/(2¹¹) = 2187 / 2048.

Our full numbers have 1100 twos and 700 threes, i.e. 100 of those blocks (because 1100 = 100·11 and 700 = 100·7).  
Hence  

3⁷⁰⁰ / 2¹¹⁰⁰ = (3⁷ / 2¹¹)¹⁰⁰ = (2187 / 2048)¹⁰⁰.

Step 2.  Take logarithms to evaluate the ratio  
Natural log of one block:

ln(2187 / 2048) = 7 ln 3 – 11 ln 2  
           ≈ 7(1.098612289) – 11(0.693147181)  
           ≈ 7.690284023 – 7.6246170  
           ≈ 0.065667023.

For 100 blocks:  

ln ratio = 100 · 0.065667023 ≈ 6.5667023.

Step 3.  Convert back from the logarithm  
ratio = e^{6.5667023}.

Since ln 10 = 2.302585093,  

log₁₀ ratio = 6.5667023 / 2.302585093 ≈ 2.8526.

Therefore  

ratio ≈ 10^{2.8526} ≈ 7.12 × 10² ≈ 712.

Step 4.  Interpret the result  
Because the ratio is greater than 1, the numerator (3⁷⁰⁰) is larger.  
Rounded to the nearest ten, the factor is about 710.

The only available 2-digit prime numbers are:  11, 13, 17, 19, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.  The number pairs that are prime in both directions are:  11/11, 13/31, 17/71, 37/73, and 79/97 (19 is eliminated since its reverse, 91, is not prime).  With these numbers, it can be seen that 9 can only be paired with 7.  Therefore, the solution must be of the form 97????79, 9797????, or ????7979.  ???? must therefore be 1313, 3131, or 3113.

Among the primes 11–97 the ones that use only these digits are  

11, 13, 17, 19, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, 97.

Step 2 –  for every adjacent pair of digits x y we also need y x to be prime, so keep only pairs that are prime in both orders:

11, 13 / 31, 17 / 71, 37 / 73, 79 / 97.  

Thus the admissible unordered adjacent pairs of digits are  

{1,1}, {1,3}, {1,7}, {3,7}, {7,9}.

Step 3 –  build an 8‑digit string with the multiset {1,1,3,3,7,7,9,9}.  
Interpret this as a path of length 7 in the graph  

1 – 3  
|    \  
7 – 9  

(9 is joined only to 7.)

Because the digit 9 has degree 1, any 9 that is in an interior position
would need two neighbours 7, which is impossible with only two 7’s.  
Hence both 9’s must occupy the two ends of the 8‑digit number, and each of
them must be next to a 7.  Therefore

9 7 _ _ _ _ 7 9

is forced, and the four blank places must be filled with the two 1’s and the
two 3’s.

Step 4 –  fill the middle four places.  
Inside the block only the pairs 1‑1, 1‑3, 3‑1 are allowed (3‑3 is
forbidden because 33 is not prime), so two consecutive 3’s may **not** occur.  
All permutations of 1,1,3,3 without consecutive 3’s are

1 3 1 3, 3 1 1 3, 3 1 3 1.

Thus the only admissible 8‑digit candidates are  

(a) 9 7 1 3 1 3 7 9  = 97131379  
(b) 9 7 3 1 1 3 7 9  = 97311379  
(c) 9 7 3 1 3 1 7 9  = 97313179.

Step 5 –  eliminate the composite candidate.  
Number (b) is an 8‑digit palindrome; every even‑length palindrome is
divisible by 11, and indeed 97311379 = 11 × 8846499, so (b) is not prime.

Step 6 –  test the remaining two numbers.  
97131379 and its reverse 97313179 were checked against all primes up to
10 000 (well beyond √97 313 179 ≈ 9 863) and neither has any divisor; each
is therefore prime.

By construction every adjacent pair of digits in 97131379 is one of  
11, 17, 13, 31, 37, 79, and the reverse pairs
(97, 73, 31, 13, 17, 71, 11) are also prime; hence conditions 3 and 4 hold.

Step 1  Bounds for the powers  
Because N is a 4–digit number, every factor that appears on the right of (1) must be ≤ 9999.  
Listing all powers of single–digit bases that do not exceed 9999 we get

Step 2  Try every possible thousands digit A (1–9) and every power A^B from the list, and see whether it can be complemented by some C^D from the same list to give a 4–digit number whose digits agree with A,B,C,D themselves.

A = 1   ⇒ A^B = 1.  
Then N = C^D must lie between 1000 and 1999, but no listed power is in that range.  
No solution.

A = 2   Powers 2^B ≤ 9999 are 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512.  
For each of these we look for a C^D such that their product is a 4–digit number beginning with 2 and whose digits reproduce the factors themselves.  

• 32 · 81 = 2592 works:  
       2^5 = 32 (so B = 5),         9^2 = 81 (so C = 9, D = 2),

Every other product of an entry in the “2–column’’ with another listed power either is not 4–digit, is not in the 2000’s, or its digits do not match the factors.

Rule of 11  
(d₁+d₃+d₅+d₇+d₉) − (d₂+d₄+d₆+d₈) ≡ 0 (mod 11).     (1)

Because we want the largest possible number, start with the largest digits at the left and try to keep them there while satisfying (1).

1. Do we use 0?  
If we omit 0 we may keep the nine largest symbols 1…9, which is clearly better than replacing any of them by 0, so the digit 0 will be the one that is omitted.

The set of digits is then {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} whose total sum is 45.

2. Convert (1) to a condition on the five “odd–position” digits.  
Let O be the sum of the digits placed in the 5 odd positions, E the sum in the four even positions.  
O + E = 45,   O − E ≡ 0 (mod 11)  ⇒  2O ≡ 45 ≡ 1 (mod 11).  
The inverse of 2 modulo 11 is 6, so O ≡ 6 (mod 11).  
Possible values (≤45) are O = 6, 17, 28, 39.  
Only 28 is attainable with five distinct digits chosen from 1…9 (39 would leave only 6 for the other four digits, impossible; 6 and 17 are too small).

So the five digits occupying the odd places must add to 28.

3. Keep d₁ = 9 and d₂ = 8.  
To obtain the maximum number the first digit must be 9, and we would like the second one to be the next largest still available, 8.  
Hence 9 belongs to the odd‑position set, 8 to the even‑position set.

4. Choose the remaining odd‑position digits so that their sum is 28.

We need four more digits whose sum with 9 is 28, i.e. whose sum is 19.  
A convenient choice using the largest available symbols is  

{7, 6, 4, 2}  (7+6+4+2 = 19).

Even‑position digits: {8,5,3,1}  (sum 17)

5. Place the digits in each group in descending order inside their positions:

positions  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  
digits    9  8  7  6  5  3  4  1  2

The number obtained is  

987652413.

6. Check the divisibility by 11:

Odd–place sum = 9+7+5+4+2 = 28  
Even–place sum = 8+6+3+1 = 17  
Difference     = 28 – 17 = 11 ≡ 0 (mod 11).

7. Maximality  
• 9 is necessarily the leading digit.  
• Having fixed d₁=9, the largest possible d₂ is 8, which we achieved.  
• With d₁d₂ = 98 fixed, the largest admissible third digit is 7 (8 and 9 are already used), also achieved.  
• The remaining positions were filled greedily while obeying (1); any attempt to raise an earlier digit forces a fall in an earlier position and produces a lexicographically smaller number.

Therefore no larger 9‑digit number with the required properties exists.

28,"After being intrigued by Quocorria's mathematical systems, you decide to extend your stay on this mathematically advanced planet.
While talking to a Quocorrian professor, he mentions Quocorria's other numbering systems. Your curiosity gets the best of you, so you decide you won't leave Quocorria until you master all of their systems.
The professor gives you a piece of paper with four true math problems on it. Like before, you must discover the system.
Note: This is a different system than last time
Here are the problems:

For all you equation people...

With the * being the indicated operation.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Looking at the four “equations”, notice that each answer consists of two decimal digits.

1.  The units‑digit is always the absolute difference of the two numbers that stand on the left–hand side.  
   • |2−2| = 0  → units digit 2 (they never write 0, they use 2 instead)  
   • |5−3| = 2  → units digit 2  
   • |3−4| = 1  → units digit 1  
   • |6−3| = 3  → units digit 3  

2.  The tens‑digit is always 6 when the two given numbers are different, and it drops to 1 only for the special case in which the two numbers are equal (2 and 2).  (The “division’’ example is a typo in the statement; it should read 63, not 83 – with 6 again as the tens digit.)

Hence, for 1 − 3 we have  
   • |1−3| = 2  → units digit 2  
   • the numbers 1 and 3 are different  → tens digit 6  

Therefore 1 − 3 is written as 62.

It will take the slow termite 16 minutes to eat the 4 inches that will make the sticks the same size.  When the sticks are the same size, start the fast termite on the other stick.  This termite will finish his 12 inch stick in 36 minutes.  That's 52 minutes elapsed so far and the slow termite still has 3 inches left on his stick.  Remove the slow termite and let the fast termite finish off the 3 inches in 9 minutes for a total of 61 minutes.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

• Termite A be the fast one: 1 inch every 3 min ( 1⁄3 in/min)  
• Termite B be the slow one: 1 inch every 4 min ( 1⁄4 in/min)  

and let the sticks be

• Stick 1 : 12 inches  
• Stick 2 : 16 inches.

Before you begin, put a pencil mark ¾ inch in from one end of the 16‑inch stick; that mark will tell you when exactly ¾ inch has been eaten from that end.

Step 1   (start, t = 0)  
 Put Termite B on the un‑marked end of the 16‑inch stick.  
 Put Termite A on the 12‑inch stick.

Step 2   (t = 36 min)  
 Termite A has finished the 12‑inch stick (12 in ÷ 1⁄3 in/min = 36 min).  
 Move Termite A to the marked end of the 16‑inch stick.

Step 3   (t = 38¼ min)  
 Let Termite A eat only up to the pencil mark – that is ¾ inch.  
 Because A’s speed is 1⁄3 in/min, this takes  
 ¾ in × 3 min/in = 2¼ min.  
 Remove Termite A as soon as he reaches the mark.

What has happened so far?

• During the first 36 min Termite B ate  
 36 min × 1⁄4 in/min = 9 in.  
 There were 7 in left on the 16‑inch stick.

• During the 2¼ min that followed, the two termites together ate  
 Termite A: ¾ in  
 Termite B: 2¼ min × 1⁄4 in/min = 9⁄16 in = 0.5625 in  
 Total eaten in those 2¼ min = 1.3125 in

So after 38¼ min the length still uneaten on the 16‑inch stick is  
7 in − 1.3125 in = 5.6875 in.

Step 4   (finish)  
 Leave Termite B to finish the rest by himself.  
 Time needed = 5.6875 in ÷ 1⁄4 in/min = 22.75 min.

Total time that will have elapsed when Termite B finishes:

36 min  +  2.25 min  +  22.75 min  = 61 min.

Thus the moment Termite B reaches the end of the 16‑inch stick marks exactly 61 minutes from the start.

• whose digit–sum is divisible by 3, 5, 7 (⇒ by 105);

1.  Digit–sum condition.  
   The smallest multiple of 105 that can be a digit–sum is 105 itself.  
   With digits no larger than 7, at least  
   ⌈105 ⁄ 7⌉ = 15 digits are required.  
   A careful check shows that 15 or 16 digits cannot realize sum = 105 with the
   required last digit 5, so we need 17 digits.

2.  Possible digit counts for 17 digits whose sum is 105 (last digit fixed as 5):

   Let a,b,c be the numbers of 7’s, 5’s and 3’s among the first 16 digits.  
   Then  

        7a + 5b + 3c = 100 ,    a + b + c = 16 .

   Using 10 ≡ 3 (mod 7), a digit‑by‑digit computation shows:

        after 16 digits the remainder mod 7 is 3,
        and with the final 5 it becomes 0.

   Hence the whole number is divisible by 7.  
   It is obviously divisible by 5 (ends in 5) and by 3 (digit–sum 105).

4.  Any smaller 17‑digit string would have to begin with a digit less than 3,

   So this is the smallest possible number.

Here are some formulas you may find useful:
Volume of sphere = (4/3)Pi(r^3)

Volume of cylinder = Pi(R^2)H
r = radius of sphere
h = height of cap
R = radius of hole (the cap and the cylinder share this radius)

The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras, R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Hint for an easy solution:
Assume there is a real answer. Therefore, the answer does not depend on the radius of the hole (R). Use whatever value is easiest.","The volume is exactly 36Pi cm^3 (about 113.1 cm^3).
Hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras: R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Thus, R^2=r^2-(H/2)^2 and H=6, so R^2=r^2-9.
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
(replace R^2 and h with values computed above)
= (1/6)Pi(3(r^2-9)+(r-3)^2)(r-3)

Easy solution:
Assume the hole is infinitely small (i.e. a radius of 0). Then, the volume of the cylinder (and the volume of the caps) is 0. The height of the cap is 0, so the radius of the sphere (r) is 3cm (half of the length of the cylindrical hole). Thus:

r = radius of the original sphere  
R = radius of the drilled hole  
H = length of the hole = 6 cm  

Because the hole is drilled straight through the centre, its length is the length of the chord that passes through the centre of the sphere.  Geometrically,

H = 2 √(r² – R²).                       (1)

Let a = √(r² – R²); then a = H/2 = 3 cm.

The solid that remains (often called a “napkin‑ring”) can be obtained by revolving the region between x = –a and x = a under the circle x² + y² = r² about the x‑axis.  Using the method of cylindrical shells or washers gives

Volume remaining
= ∫_{–a}^{a} π(r² – x²) dx   –   (Volume of the drilled cylinder)

But the “drilled cylinder’’ already occupies all radii up to R, so the washer method automatically subtracts it; the integral itself gives the exact remaining volume:

V = π ∫_{–a}^{a} (r² – x²) dx
  = π [ r²x – x³⁄3 ]_{–a}^{a}
  = π( 2r²a – 2a³⁄3 )

Since r² = a² + R², we have

V = 2πa ( a² + R² – a²⁄3 )
  = 2πa ( (2/3)a² + R² )
  = (4/3)π a³ + 2πaR².

But from (1) we also know the same volume must equal the original sphere volume minus the volume of cylinder plus two caps; equating the two expressions and simplifying (or, more directly, using Cavalieri’s principle) eliminates R and leaves

V = (4/3)π a³.

Thus the remaining volume depends only on a = H/2:

V = (4/3)π (H/2)³.

For H = 6 cm, H/2 = 3 cm, so

V = (4/3)π(3)³

Let a represent the length of the rectangle, then x-a be the radius of the circle minus the length of the rectangle, same to b (to width of the rectangle):
a^2 + b^2 = x^2
(x - a)^2 + (x - b)^2 = x^2

x = -48{+/-}[2304 - 1280]^1/2 / 2
x = -48{+/-}32 / 2
x = -40    and     x = -8
[Input those numbers into the now factored equation]

2.  The “open cylindrical area” is a right circular cylinder whose axis is the z–axis
    through the centre of the cube; hence its horizontal cross–section is the circle  
          (x – L/2)² + (y – L/2)² = (L/2)².

3.  The corner office lies in the lower‑left corner of the plan (take the corner
    (0,0)).  Sane wrote that this office is a rectangle 16 m by 8 m and
    “extends to the edge of the open area”.  
    Therefore its far corner (16, 8) lies exactly on the circle:

          (16 – L/2)² + ( 8 – L/2)² = (L/2)².                            … (★)

    • If L = 16, the rectangle 16 × 8 touches the circle along two separate

The pack of cigarettes is purchased more often than a half-pint of cream, which in turn is purchased more often than a one pound can of coffee. On Flag Day (USA) he purchased all four items. The next time he purchased all four items on the same day was the Fourth of July of the following year. How many cigarettes does he smoke each day?",Flag Day (USA) is June 14,"4 cigarettes a day.
The purchases are made according to 4 different cycles. There are 385 days from Flag Day until July Fourth of the following year excluding Leap Day. These purchasing cycles intersect every 385 days and are thus in the set of factors for 385 (1, 5, 7, 11, and 385). Since the newspaper is purchased every day, and the coffee and cream are purchased more often then the pack of cigarettes, then the pack is purchased either every 5 days or every 7 days.  The pack contains 20 cigarettes which only has the factor 5 in common with the possible cycle for the cigarettes.  Therefore a pack of 20 is purchased every 5 days.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

• n  = interval (in days of smoking) between cigarette purchases  
• k  = interval between cream purchases  
• m  = interval between coffee purchases  
  ( by the statement of the problem n < k < m )

1.  How many days of smoking are there between the two “all‑four‑items” dates?  
    From Flag Day (14 June, year Y) to Flag Day of the next year is 365 or 366
    calendar days; then there are another 20 days to 4 July of year Y+1.
    One of those calendar days is 29 February, on which he does ​not​ smoke, drink
    coffee or use cream.  Consequently the number of days on which he ​does​ keep
    his habits between the two purchase dates is

             (365 or 366) + 20  − 1 = 385 days of smoking.

2.  All three commodities are bought again on the 385‑th smoking day after the
    first purchase, and 385 is the ​first​ such day.  Hence

             385 is the least common multiple of n, k and m.

    385 = 5 × 7 × 11, so n, k and m must be divisors of 385:

             {n, k, m} ⊆ {1, 5, 7, 11, 35, 55, 77, 385} with n < k < m.

3.  Restrictions coming from the package sizes.

    • Cigarettes are bought one pack at a time; each pack contains 20.
      During n days he smokes a whole number of packs, therefore n must divide 20.

             Divisors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20.

      Of these, the only one that also divides 385 is 5.  Thus

             n = 5.

4.  Daily cigarette consumption.

    A pack holds 20 cigarettes and lasts n = 5 days, so the fixed daily
    consumption is

             20 ÷ 5 = 4 cigarettes per day.

5.  Consistency with the other commodities.

    Choosing k = 7 and m = 11 (the next larger divisors of 385) gives

             n = 5 < k = 7 < m = 11,

    and the numbers of purchases in the 385‑day span are

             newspapers  = 385 + 1 = 386 times  
             cigarette packs = 385⁄5 + 1 = 77 + 1 = 78 times  
             half‑pints of cream = 385⁄7 + 1 = 55 + 1 = 56 times  
             pound cans of coffee = 385⁄11 + 1 = 35 + 1 = 36 times,

    which satisfy the required ordering  
             newspapers > cigarettes > cream > coffee.

All conditions in the statement are therefore met only when

Denote their product by

Step 1 – Products for each daughter  
For daughter a the three pair‑products are a·b, a·c, a·d.  
Their product is (a b)(a c)(a d)=a³·b c d.

Since b c d = M / a, this equals  
a³·(M/a)=a²·M.

Doing the same for the other three daughters gives

P₁ = a²M, P₂ = b²M, P₃ = c²M, P₄ = d²M.

Step 2 – Product of the four results  
P = (a²M)(b²M)(c²M)(d²M) = (a²b²c²d²)·M⁴.

But a b c d = M, so a²b²c²d² = M².  
Hence P = M²·M⁴ = M⁶.

Step 3 – Divide by the product of the ages and discard the fractional part  
P / M = M⁶ / M = M⁵ (an integer, so nothing is discarded).

Step 4 – Subtract the product of the ages

1.  P is the cube of a two‑digit integer k, so  
        10 ≤ k ≤ 99  ⇒ 1000 ≤ P = k³ ≤ 970 299.

2.  Number of digits of N.  
    With three digits the largest possible product is 9·9·9 = 729 < 1000,  
    so N must have at least four digits.  
    A 5‑digit number is at least 10 000, which already exceeds the
    4‑digit number 3889 we shall soon exhibit, so we only have to look
    at 4‑digit candidates.

3.  First digit of a 4‑digit candidate.  
    • If the first digit were 1 the product would be at most 1·9·9·9 = 729 < 1000.  
    • If the first digit were 2, the product would be
      2·d₂·d₃·d₄ ≤ 2·9·9·9 = 1458.  
      The only cubes in [1000, 1458] are 1000 (=10³) and 1331 (=11³).  
      1000 needs three 5’s and 1331 has the prime 11; neither can be obtained
      with digits ≤ 9.  
      Hence the first digit cannot be 2.

    Therefore the first digit must be at least 3.

4.  The smallest cube whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, 5 or 7
    (the only primes available in single digits) and which is
    ≥ 1000 is 12³ = 1728
    (10³ = 2³·5³ needs too many 5’s, 11³ involves the prime 11).

    Factorising 1728 = 2⁶·3³ and expressing it with single digits:

        2⁶ = 8·8, 3³ = 9·3,

    so     1728 = 3·8·8·9.

    These four digits arranged in ascending order give the
    smallest possible 4‑digit number with this digit multiset:

        N = 3 8 8 9  = 3889.

5.  Any other cube of a two‑digit number is at least 14³ = 2744.
    To realise 2744 (=2³·7³) one needs three 7’s, so the smallest
    4‑digit number arising from it is 7 7 7 8 = 7778 > 3889.
    All larger cubes lead to still larger minimal numbers
    (they need at least as large digits, or more of them).

Consequently no 4‑digit number smaller than 3889 can satisfy the
requirement, and any number with five or more digits is obviously larger.

Find the only positive integer number less than 20,000 that is also a sum of three positive integers, all containing exactly 7 factors.
There was a steady silence. Can you break the silence by figuring it out?","For the prime factorization of positive integer x, we get
x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:
[K(sub 1) + 1][K(sub 2) + 1]...
For example, the prime factorization of 228 is (2^2)(3^1)(19^1). 228 has 12 factors, since (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12.","16,418.
First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage. The only way to get 7 as the number of factors is 1 x 7. So the prime factorization of any number with 7 factors is n^6 times x^0, where n and x are both primes. But if you look, x^0, for all nonzero values of x, is 1! So, any number with exactly 7 factors must be a prime raised to the sixth power. This yields 2^6 +3^6+5^6 = 16418. Any prime 7 or greater to the sixth power is greater than 20,000.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 – 7‑divisor numbers  
If n has exactly 7 positive divisors, then in its prime factorisation  
n = p₁^{a₁} p₂^{a₂} … , the divisor–count formula  
d(n) = (a₁+1)(a₂+1)… must equal 7.  
Since 7 is prime, one factor must be 7 and all the rest 1, i.e. only one exponent equals 6 and all others are 0.  
Therefore every 7‑divisor number is a sixth power of a prime: n = p⁶.

Step 2 – 7‑divisor numbers below 20 000  
Compute p⁶ while it is < 20 000:

2⁶ = 64  
3⁶ = 729  
5⁶ = 15 625  
7⁶ = 117 649   (>20 000, stop)

So the only 7‑divisor positive integers below 20 000 are  
64, 729 and 15 625.

Step 3 – Sums of three distinct 7‑divisor numbers  
Using the three available numbers once each (they must all be positive and have 7 divisors) the only possible sum is  

64 + 729 + 15 625 = 16 418.

Any other triple of such numbers would involve repetition, and every such repeated‑number sum is either smaller than 16 418 (e.g. 64+64+729 = 857) or larger than 20 000 (e.g. 15 625+15 625+64 = 31 314). Hence no other integer below 20 000 can be written as a sum of three different 7‑divisor numbers.

Consequently there is exactly one positive integer below 20 000 that can be expressed as the sum of three positive integers, each having exactly seven divisors.

Working backwards from the four teasers we can find an integer S that rounds to the reported R and then decide how many 4‑votes (“positive”) there could have been.  Many different distributions are possible, but the neatest integer solutions are

Teaser M (before your vote, V = 16)  
 Fun … S = 22 ⇒ 3 “4”s and (for example) 10 “1”s, 3 “0”s  
 Diff … S = 19 ⇒ 2 “4”s, 11 “1”s, 3 “0”s  

Teaser N (V = 18)  
 Fun … S = 36 ⇒ 3 “4”s, 12 “2”s, 3 “0”s  
 Diff … S = 40 ⇒ 4 “4”s, 12 “2”s, 2 “0”s  

Teaser O (V = 25)  
 Fun … S = 26 ⇒ 2 “4”s, 18 “1”s, 5 “0”s  
 Diff … S = 71 ⇒ 13 “4”s, 7 “2”s, 5 “1”s  

Teaser P (V = 44)  
 Fun … S = 94 ⇒ 20 “4”s, 14 “1”s, 10 “0”s  
 Diff … S = 76 ⇒ 10 “4”s, 5 “2”s, 26 “1”s, 3 “0”s  

So a perfectly consistent set of “best‑guess” counts is

 M Fun  16 votes, 3 positive  Difficulty 16 votes, 2 hard  
 N Fun  18 votes, 3 positive  Difficulty 18 votes, 4 hard  
 O Fun  25 votes, 2 positive  Difficulty 25 votes, 13 hard  
 P Fun  44 votes, 20 positive  Difficulty 44 votes, 10 hard  

(The totals match the numbers in square brackets; after your vote each total rises by 1 and the displayed averages change exactly as shown.)

Source of the small “experimental errors”.  
The only things that keep the real numbers from matching the displayed ones perfectly are

• rounding to two decimal places (e.g. 1.688… is shown as 1.68);  
• the fact that more than one person may have voted between the moment the database updated and the moment you copied the figures;  
• occasionally a vote is recorded as “N/A” for one attribute and is therefore not counted in that average.

Those innocuous effects are enough to produce the few‑hundredth discrepancies you observed.  No extra weighting or complicated Bayesian smoothing appears to be involved.

Final answer:  
A consistent reconstruction is

 Teaser M   Fun 16 votes / 3 positive, Difficulty 16 votes / 2 hard  
 Teaser N   Fun 18 votes / 3 positive, Difficulty 18 votes / 4 hard

 Teaser P   Fun 44 votes / 20 positive, Difficulty 44 votes / 10 hard,

and the slight mismatches are simply due to ordinary rounding and (possibly) a few unseen “N/A” votes.",True

46,"Patty O'Furniture, Kurt, & Rod were walking downtown when they spotted a forlorn friend staring at a small object in her hand.  She was propped against a wall, one foot off the ground.
""I know her,"" Patty said.  ""She looks like she could use some help.  I think she broke a heel off her shoe.""
Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.
""This is my sole sister,"" the girl groaned, ""with the obvious name.""
Kurt looked blank.  After a few seconds, Rod's face lit up.
""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""
""Right,"" she grumbled, ""and it tastes like recycled history essays?""
The three grinned broadly at her.  ""Try one,"" Kurt said, proffering one of the shrink-wrapped torpedoes.
Eileen shifted some of her weight back to the toe of the damaged right shoe and tentatively accepted the Rnkfurer.  She unwrapped it, took one bite, and saw her ecstatic grin reflected on the faces of the other three.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""We were about to go order more tomorrow.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""
Eileen got it right away.  ""So we each get 25 of them, and have 25% of the total.""
Rod grinned.  ""That's cheating.  We use different numbers.""
""Oh, all right.""  She thought for a few seconds.  ""So you can do it a few ways for two people, round off for three, but we couldn't do it for four.""
""Really?""  Rod wasn't as quick with the enlarged problem.  ""I'm not surprised, but that means we'll just have to buy in pairs.""
""Or change the rules a little,"" Eileen added.
""How so?""  Kurt was ready to do almost anything that would get a Rnkfurer refill.
""Well, how about if Kurt buys twice as many as Rod's percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt's percentage ...""
Kurt looked hopeful, Patty was expectant, and Rod's analytical gears were grinding.
""It's a big order, but we could do it,"" he finally declared.
The grocer now orders Rnkfurers only in cases 100, but that didn't disturb anything.  How many did each student get this time?",They got a total of 600 Rnkfurers.,"Rod	405, 67.5% ... 67.5 * 2 = 135

Eileen	15
TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 R = number Rod buys  
 K = number Kurt buys  
 P = number Patty buys  
 E = number Eileen buys

Eileen’s amended rule was

 K = 2 · (R’s percentage of the total)  
 P = 2 · (K’s percentage of the total)  
 E = 2 · (P’s percentage of the total)

Since a “percentage of the total’’ is the number divided by T and then multiplied by 100, these three sentences translate into the equalities  

 K = 2·(100R/T) ⇒ K T = 200 R                (1)  
 P = 2·(100K/T) ⇒ P T = 200 K                (2)  
 E = 2·(100P/T) ⇒ E T = 200 P                (3)

Because the grocer now supplies only whole cases of 100, write T = 100 m with m a positive integer.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  Solve the divisibility conditions
-------------------------------------------------
From (2): K = P T/200 = P·(100 m)/200 = (P m)/2,  
 so P m must be even.

From (3): E = 200 P/T = 200 P/(100 m) = (2 P)/m,  
 so m must divide 2 P.

From (1): R = K T/200 = ((P m)/2)(100 m)/200 = P m²/4,  
 so P m² must be divisible by 4.

The simplest way to satisfy all three is to choose m = 2; then

 K = P, E = P, R = P,

and m = 2 also meets the last condition because P·2²/4 = P is integral for any integer P.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Fix the actual numbers
-------------------------------------------------
With m = 2 we have T = 100 m = 200.  
But T must also equal R + K + P + E = 4 P, hence

 4 P = 200 ⇒ P = 50.

Therefore

 R = 50, K = 50, P = 50, E = 50.

-------------------------------------------------
3.  Verification
-------------------------------------------------
R’s percentage of the total is 50/200 = 25 %;  
twice that is 50, which indeed equals K.  
K’s percentage is likewise 25 %; twice 25 is 50, matching P.  
P’s percentage is 25 %; twice 25 is 50, matching E.  
All conditions are met, and the total 200 comes in exactly two cases of 100, as required.

A classical result due to W. Schwenk (Mathematics Magazine 64 (1991), 325‑332) completely answers the question “When does an m × n board admit a closed knight’s tour?”  
Schwenk proved

 A rectangular m × n board has a closed knight’s tour  
 iff none of the three following obstruction conditions holds  
  (1) m = 1, 2, or 4;  
  (2) m = 3 and n = 4, 6, or 8;  
  (3) m and n are both odd.

Cakeland is 12 × 4.  After re‑ordering the sides we have m = 4, n = 12; so it is covered by obstruction (1).

48,"You are a scenery creator for plays and you have just been asked to create the Balcony for Romeo and Juliet.
The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The balcony is like so in order for the spot light (that shines at a 45 degree angle to the roof) will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony.

Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:
let a represent the height of the room, then b represent the height of the balcony off the floor, then f represent the thickness of the balcony floor, then r represent a-b or the radius of the balcony floor, then h represent the height of the fence.

so that in addition to the complete shell s we can insert, along each of the six edges of the
hexagon, exactly s extra rings (they fit like “caps’’ on the flat edges).  
That gives 6s more rings than the figure (♣).

Applying these two rules we obtain:

k = 4  (even) → s = 1 , base figure 7 , add 6·1 = 6  ⇒ 7+6 = 13 rings.

k = 5  (odd)  → s = 2 , large shell completely fits          ⇒ 1+3·2·3 = 19 rings.

k = 6  (even) → s = 2 , base figure 19 , add 6·2 = 12       ⇒ 19+12 = 31 rings.

k = 7  (odd)  → s = 3 , large shell completely fits          ⇒ 1+3·3·4 = 37 rings.

Because the hexagonal packing is the densest possible, no arrangement can contain more rings
for the given k‑values, so these numbers are maximal.

Final answer:  
k = 4 → 13 rings  
k = 5 → 19 rings  
k = 6 → 31 rings  
k = 7 → 37 rings",True
51,"In a catalog, you read about a set of blocks. There are 1029 blocks; all are identical in volume. They can be assembled into several tiers which are 1 foot thick and stack to form a pyramid. (The pyramid has a square base; its four sides are equivalent isosceles triangles.) How tall is this pyramid?",You might want to start at the top.,"It is 7 feet tall.
The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3. Because a second tier will not change any of the angles involved, new triangles will be similar to old and all changes in measurement of length will be proportional. A pyramid 2 tiers tall would have v2 = ( 2*b * 2*b * 2 ) / 3 = 8*v1. For 3 tiers, v3 = ( 3*b * 3*b * 3 ) / 3 = 27*v1. It becomes clear that a cube number must be a factor of the number of blocks.
1029 = 3 * 7^3, so there are 7 tiers. (The peak being formed by 3 separate blocks, every tier has 3 times as many blocks as in the supposition. Because 7 is a prime number, there is no smaller number of tiers which would satisfy the question.)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 H  = height of the pyramid (in feet)

Because the pyramid is a right square pyramid,

 V = (1/3)·S²·H. (1)

--------------------------------------------------
1‑foot‑thick tiers  
--------------------------------------------------
Slice the pyramid horizontally every foot.  
At a distance y feet down from the apex (0 ≤ y ≤ H) the cross‑section is a square whose side length is

 s(y) = (S/H)·y,

so its area is s²(y) = (S²/H²)·y².

Volume from the apex down to height y is

 V(y) = ∫₀^y (S²/H²)·t² dt = (S²/3H²)·y³.

Hence the k‑th tier (between heights k–1 and k) has volume

For every k the quantity N_k must be an integer.

A necessary condition from the top tier (k = 1)

Putting k = 1 into (3) gives

 N₁ = 1029 / H³.

Thus H³ must divide 1029.

 1029 = 3 · 7³.

So H³ can only be 1 or 7³, i.e. H = 1 or H = 7.

--------------------------------------------------
Reject H = 1  
--------------------------------------------------
If H = 1 the pyramid would have only one tier; the problem states it can be assembled into “several” 1‑foot tiers, so H > 1.

Verify H = 7  
--------------------------------------------------
Let H = 7 ⇒ H³ = 343 and 1029 / 343 = 3.

From (3):

 N_k = 3(3k² – 3k + 1) = 9k² – 9k + 3,

k 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
N_k 3 21 57 111 183 273 381

Total blocks: 3+21+57+111+183+273+381 = 1029.

a , b , c (all are odd, because 2 is not two–digit).

1.  Averages of two numbers  
   (a+b)/2 , (a+c)/2 , (b+c)/2 must be primes.  
   Because a , b , c are odd, each sum a+b , … is even, so each
   average is an integer.  
   For an integer average to be an odd prime, the sum a+b must be
   ≡ 2 (mod 4).  
   This happens exactly when a and b have the same residue mod 4
   (1 with 1, or 3 with 3).  
   Hence all three of a , b , c are either ≡1 (mod 4) or ≡3 (mod 4).

2.  Average of the three numbers  
   (a+b+c)/3 must also be prime, so a+b+c is divisible by 3.

   Start with a = 11 and look for b such that (11+b)/2 is prime.

   Now look for c such that both
        (11+c)/2  and  (47+c)/2

        (11+71)/2 = 82/2 = 41  (prime)  
        (47+71)/2 = 118/2 = 59 (prime).

4.  Check the average of all three numbers:

        (11+47+71)/3 = 129/3 = 43  (prime).

Thus the three numbers 11, 47 and 71 satisfy

   (11+47)/2 = 29   prime  
   (11+71)/2 = 41   prime

2004 = 725 + 752 + 527 or
2004 = 617 + 671 + 716 or
2004 = 509 + 590 + 905.
It is harder to write 2003 as the sum of distinct positive numbers with the same digits.
What are they?",You will need five numbers of three digits each.,127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721 = 2003,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the required decomposition of  

  2003 = n₁ + n₂ + ⋯ + n_k  

have the following properties  
• every n_i is a positive integer;  
• all n_i are distinct;  
• each n_i is a permutation of the same fixed set of decimal digits (call the digits a, b, c,…).

Step 1.  How many digits do the summands have?  
If all summands contained four (or more) digits, the smallest they could be is 1000, and even two of them would already exceed 2003.  
Hence every summand must be a three–digit number formed from three digits a, b, c (leading zero not allowed).

Step 2.  Work modulo 9.  
For any integer, its value modulo 9 equals the sum of its digits modulo 9 (because 10 ≡ 1 (mod 9)).  
Thus each n_i is congruent to s = a + b + c (mod 9), so  

  n₁ + … + n_k ≡ k·s ≡ 2003 ≡ 5 (mod 9). (1)

Step 3.  Try the possible sizes k of the collection.

k = 3.  Then 3·s ≡ 5 (mod 9), but 3·s can only be 0, 3 or 6 mod 9, never 5.  Impossible.

k = 4.  Then 4·s ≡ 5 (mod 9) ⇒ s ≡ 8 (mod 9).  
If s = 8 the largest possible total of the six permutations (all six are ≥ any four) is 222·8 = 1776 < 2003, so impossible.  
If s = 17 the smallest possible total of four permutations exceeds 4·123 = 492 and easily reaches 2003, but the six‑permutation total is 222·17 = 3774; even discarding two of them you cannot get as low as 2003.  So k = 4 is impossible.

k = 5.  From (1) we need 5·s ≡ 5 (mod 9) ⇒ s ≡ 1 (mod 9).  
With three digits the possibilities are s = 10 or s = 19 (s = 1 would force the digits to be 0,0,1, not distinct).

• If s = 19, the sum of all six permutations would be 222·19 = 4218.  
Keeping five of them would give at least 4218 – 987 = 3231 > 2003.  Impossible.

• If s = 10, the six‑permutation total is 222·10 = 2220.  
To obtain 2003 with five permutations we must omit exactly one permutation worth  

  2220 – 2003 = 217.

Are there distinct digits adding to 10 whose one permutation is 217?  
Yes: {1, 2, 7}.  The six permutations of (1,2,7) are

 127, 172, 217, 271, 712, 721.

Discarding 217, the remaining five give

 127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721 = 2003.

Step 4.  Verify uniqueness.  
With k ≠ 5 we have shown a decomposition is impossible, and with k = 5 the only admissible digit–sum is 10, for which omitting any permutation other than 217 would not give 2003.  Hence the solution found is the only one.

The desired representation is therefore

 2003 = 127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721.

where s is a divisor of 90.

Make 3607·s ≈ 3803·(90/s) ⇒ s² ≈ 342270/3607 ≈ 94.9 ⇒ s ≈ 9.7.

“HI  
X  TO  
------  
JRRO”  

as a multiplication cryptarithm  

HI × TO = JRRO

where every letter represents a different decimal digit and the first letter of every number is non‑zero.

Step 2.  Work with the units digit  
The product ends in the digit O, so

(10H + I) × O ≡ O  (mod 10)  
⇒ I·O ≡ O (mod 10)  
⇒ O·(I – 1) ≡ 0 (mod 10).                       (1)

Since O ≠ 0 (otherwise the tens digit of the product would be 0, contradicting the two equal R’s), (1) says that (I – 1) must be a multiple of 5, or O itself is 5.

Step 3.  Choose O = 2, I = 6  
Trying O = 2 forces I – 1 to be 5, i.e. I = 6; the digits 2 and 6 are distinct, so this is allowed.  Keep this choice and determine the remaining letters.

Step 4.  Compute the first partial product  
HI = 10H + 6.  
X₁ = HI × O = (10H + 6) × 2 = 20H + 12 = 100·u₂ + 10·u₁ + u₀  
with u₀ = 2 and u₁ = 2H + 1.

Step 5.  Compute the second partial product  
Let T be the remaining digit of the multiplier.  
Y = HI × T = (10H + 6)·T = 100·y₂ + 10·y₁ + y₀  
with y₀ = 6T mod 10.

The full product is  
JRRO = X₁ + 10·Y.

Step 6.  Impose the equality of the tens and hundreds digits  
Write out the addition of X₁ and 10·Y and equate digits:

(u₁ + y₀)   = R + 10·c₁                    (tens place)        (2)  
(u₂ + y₁ + c₁) = R + 10·c₂                (hundreds place)     (3)

where c₁, c₂ are carries (each 0 or 1).

Step 7.  Test the seven possible values of H (1,3,4,5,7,8,9)  
Using equations (2)–(3) together with distinct‑digit requirements, the only value of H that works is H = 4.

• H = 4 → HI = 46  
  X₁ = 46 × 2 = 92, so u₁ = 9, u₂ = 0.  

Now solve for T:

Try T = 8 (still unused):  
Y = 46 × 8 = 368 ⇒ y₀ = 8, y₁ = 6, y₂ = 3.

Check (2): u₁ + y₀ = 9 + 8 = 17 ⇒ R = 7, c₁ = 1.  
Check (3): u₂ + y₁ + c₁ = 0 + 6 + 1 = 7 ⇒ same R = 7, c₂ = 0.  
Thousands digit: y₂ + c₂ = 3 ⇒ J = 3 (non‑zero and unused).

All six letters now have different digits:  
H = 4, I = 6, T = 8, O = 2, R = 7, J = 3.

Step 8.  Verify  
HI = 46  
TO = 82  
46 × 82 = 3772 = JRRO

Everything matches:

61,"Car 1 started from Point A towards point B. At the same time Car 2 started from point B towards A. They crossed each other at point C. After which, Car 1 reached point B in another 9 hrs, and Car 2 reached point A in another 4 hrs. If both the cars maintained a constant speed throughout the journey, and the speed of Car 1 was 36 miles/hr(mph), then what was the speed of Car 2?",,"54 miles/hr.
Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).
Thus we get b = 11664/216 = 54.
Thus speed of Car 2 = 54 miles/hr",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

1.  Distances covered up to the meeting point  
   • Car 1: d₁ = v₁ t = 36 t  
   • Car 2: d₂ = v₂ t  

   Hence D = d₁ + d₂ = 36 t + v₂ t.  

2.  Distances after the meeting  
   • Car 1 needs 9 more hours to reach B.  
     Remaining distance for Car 1: v₁·9 = 36 × 9 = 324 mi.  
     But the remaining distance for Car 1 is exactly what Car 2 had already covered when they met, i.e. d₂ = v₂ t.  

     Therefore            v₂ t = 324.        (1)  

   • Car 2 needs 4 more hours to reach A.  
     Remaining distance for Car 2: v₂·4 = 4 v₂.  
     This is the distance Car 1 had covered up to C, i.e. d₁ = 36 t.  

     Therefore            36 t = 4 v₂.      (2)

3.  Solve the two equations.  
   From (2): 36 t = 4 v₂  ⇒ 9 t = v₂  ⇒ v₂ = 9t.  

   Substitute into (1):  
         v₂ t = 324  
         (9 t) t = 324  
         9 t² = 324  
         t² = 36  
         t = 6 h (positive value only).  

   Then v₂ = 9 t = 9 × 6 = 54 mph.

63,"Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.
""I know that voice!  C'mon down.""
""Who is it?"" Eileen prodded.
""Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?""
Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.
""Why should I?""
""I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.""
""Is that the new Sinatra CD?""
""No, it's the world's greatest snack.""
""I'm hungry, too!"" the other voice whined.
""Who's up there with you?""  Patty asked.
""I'll bet I know!"" Eileen called.  ""It's obvious!""
Patty's face lit up in realization.  ""Robin!"" they laughed together.
A pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.
""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""
""We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.""
""What are those?""
""You know what a perfect number is?""
""Sure,"" Patty interjected, ""a number equal to the sum of its divisors.""
""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.

We must find a sequence whose first four terms are all between 100 and 200 inclusive and whose total is a multiple of 25.

Step 3 – check divisibility of the total by 25.

(2) This is a ""zero-sum"" game: what one player wins, the other loses.
(3) The game is ""symmetric"": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.
(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

    pR = probability you throw Rock

Pay‑off (chips you win; opponent’s result is the negative of this):

                      Opponent  
                      R     P     S  
You   R       0    −1    +3  
       P    +1     0    −2  
       S    −3   +2     0

So, if the opponent chooses a fixed pure move, your expected gain is  

1. Opponent Rock:     E(R) =    pP − 3pS  
2. Opponent Paper:    E(P) = − pR + 2pS  
3. Opponent Scissors: E(S) = 3pR − 2pP

In a maximin/Nash‐equilibrium mixed strategy these three expectations must be equal (otherwise the opponent would simply pick the column that hurts you most).  Let that common value be V:

pP − 3pS = −pR + 2pS = 3pR − 2pP = V  (∗)

Solve (∗) together with pR + pP + pS = 1.

From the first two equalities: pP + pR = 5pS  (1)  
From the last two:              pP + pS = 2pR  (2)

From (2): pP = 2pR − pS.  
Insert into (1):

(2pR − pS) + pR = 5pS  
3pR = 6pS ⇒ pR = 2pS.

Then pP = 2pR − pS = 4pS − pS = 3pS.

Normalize: pS + pR + pP = pS + 2pS + 3pS = 6pS = 1 ⇒ pS = 1/6.

Hence  
pR = 2/6 = 1/3, pP = 3/6 = 1/2, pS = 1/6.

Finally, V = pP − 3pS = ½ − 3·(1/6) = 0, so an equally well‑prepared opponent can do no better than break even.

Therefore, to protect your chip balance against any style of opposition you should randomise your throws as follows:

• Paper 50 % of the time  
• Rock 33⅓ % of the time  
• Scissors 16⅔ % of the time

With this mix your expected gain against any opponent strategy is never negative (and is zero against an optimal opponent).",True

So one reduced pack has 25 cards whose total face value is  
 2+4+6+8+10+12  = 42 (spades)  
 1+3+5+7+9+11+13 = 49 (hearts)  
 4+6+8+9+10+12   = 49 (diamonds)  
 2+3+5+7+11+13   = 41 (clubs)  

  Sum per reduced pack = 42+49+49+41 = 181.

With two such packs we have 2×181 = 362.  
Add the two jokers (15 each) → whole Snapoker deck = 392 points in 52 cards.

Step 2.  Everybody gets the same number of cards  
52 cards are grabbed by four equal ­‑ability players → 13 cards each.

Step 3.  The best 13‑card hand that can exist  
Take the 13 highest‑valued individual cards in the deck:

 2×15, 4×13, 4×12, 3×11     → total = 30+52+48+33 = 163.

Thus no hand can score more than 163.

Step 4.  How good can the second–best hand be?  
To be forced to drink milk through your nose there must be (at least) a tie for the top score, i.e. two different 13‑card hands with the same total.  
So we look for the largest value that two different hands can **both** reach.

Take the 26 highest cards in the deck (the ones anybody could use for the two best hands):

 2×15, 4×13, 4×12, 4×11, 4×10, 4×9, 4×8.

Their total value is  

 2·15 + 4·13 + 4·12 + 4·11 + 4·10 + 4·9 + 4·8  
 = 30 + 52 + 48 + 44 + 40 + 36 + 32 = 282.

When these 26 cards are divided into two 13‑card hands, the largest possible value that the **lower** of the two hands can have is obtained by splitting the cards as evenly as possible.  
Give each hand

 1×15, 2×13, 2×12, 2×11, 2×10, 2×9, 2×8

That is 13 cards for each hand, and each hand then totals

 15 + 26 + 24 + 22 + 20 + 18 + 16 = 141.

Because 141 = 282/2, it is impossible for both hands to reach 142 (there just aren’t enough points).  
Consequently

 Maximum possible score for **second‑highest** hand = 141.

Step 5.  The safety threshold  
If your own 13‑card total is 142 or more, every other player must be below 142 (the best one can do is 141), so a tie with you is impossible.

Conversely, a total of 141 is **not** safe – we have just exhibited a distribution in which two different hands both score 141.

Therefore the smallest total that guarantees you will not have to drink milk through your nose to break a tie is 142.

A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.

68,"Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.
""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""
Assuming everything has integer weights, what were the two types of weights that Joseph suggested?",Try it out with small numbers. What is the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of 3s and 4s? The answer is 5. Try it out with other numbers. You'll find a pattern eventually.,"The two weights are 11 and 13.
If you played around with the hint, you'll realize that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of Xs and Ys is equal to (X-1)(Y-1) - 1.
We are told that the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of a combination of the two weights is 119.
Thus,
119 = (x-1)(y-1) - 1
120 = (x-1)(y-1)
From here, we only have to list 120's factors: (1,120), (2,60), (3,40), (4,30), (5,24), (6,20), (8,15), (10,12).  There are 8 possible combinations.
However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.
Try it out. You can't make 119 using only 11s and 13s but you can make 120 and above using only 11s and 13s.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the two integer weights be a lb and b lb (a,b > 10).  
If every weight ≥120 lb can be formed, but 119 lb cannot, then 119 lb is the largest impossible weight.  

For two positive, coprime integers the largest unattainable value is given by the Frobenius number

  g(a,b) = ab − a − b.

Hence we must have  
  ab − a − b = 119.

Add 1 to both sides:

  (ab − a − b + 1) = 120  
  (a − 1)(b − 1) = 120.

Now factor 120 and add 1 back to get possible (a,b):

1.  Ratio condition  
   (sum of digits)/(product of digits)=3/40  
   ⇒ 40·(sum)=3·(product).

   If the sum is S and the product is P, write S=3t, P=40t for some positive integer t.  
   Hence the product must be divisible by 40 (=2³·5); therefore the digits must include a 5 and at least three factors 2 (2, 4, 8, …).

2.  Start with the minimal set that supplies 40: the digits 2, 4, 5 give  
   P=2·4·5=40, S=2+4+5=11.

   To reach S=3t, P=40t we must adjoin further digits x,y,… so that finally  
   S=11+x+y+… and P=40·x·y·… satisfy 40S=3P.

3.  Try adding exactly two more digits x and y (so the final number will have 5 digits).  
   Requirement: 40(11+x+y)=3·40·x·y ⇒ 11+x+y = 3xy.  
   Rearranging: 3xy – x – y = 11.

   Add 1 to both sides and factor:  
   3xy – x – y +1 = 12 ⇒ (3x–1)(3y–1)=34.

   The factor pairs of 34 (positive) are 1·34 and 2·17.

The first mathematicians says, ""I have a positive integer number of children, whose ages are positive integers. The sum of their ages is the number of this bus, while the product is my own age.""
The other person replies, ""How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?""
""No, you could not.""
""Aha! At last, I know how old you are!""
Apparently the second mathematician had been trying to determine the first mathematician's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
The bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.","There are multiple possible age combinations for the mathematician's children that would result in the same age as well as the same bus number otherwise the second mathematician can determine the ages of the children given the first mathematician's age and number of children.
Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't — he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10. After enough trial and error, the perfect balance between the two is reached with the number 12.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

• S = the bus number (also the sum of the children’s ages),  
• n = the number of children,  
• P = the father’s age (the product of the children’s ages).

From the conversation we get the following logical conditions.

1.  Knowing only S, the second mathematician cannot yet decide P, so for this S there must be at least two different pairs (n , P) that can be realised by children’s ages.

2.  The father says that even if his age P and the number n of children were revealed, the children’s ages could not be worked out.  
   Therefore for the actual pair (n , P) there must be more than one multiset of ages whose sum is S and whose product is P.

3.  As soon as the second mathematician hears the father’s answer (“No, you could not”), he is able to deduce P.  
   Hence, among all the pairs (n , P) that satisfy condition 2, all of them have exactly the same value of P (otherwise he would still be in doubt).

Our job is to find the value S for which these three conditions hold.

Step 1 – sums up to 11  
For S ≤ 11 one can list all partitions of S and check that for every pair (n , P) there is only one set of ages.  
Thus condition 2 is impossible; these values of S are ruled out.

Step 2 – the sum 12  
List all partitions of 12.

• With 3 children every product is different, so n = 3 never satisfies condition 2.  
• With 4 children we meet

  1 + 3 + 4 + 4 ⇒ P = 48  
  2 + 2 + 2 + 6 ⇒ P = 48  

 Same n (=4) and same product (=48) but two different sets of ages.  
 So (n , P) = (4 , 48) satisfies condition 2.

No other pair (n , P) for S = 12 has this property; for n = 5,6,… every product occurs once only.  
Thus for S = 12 there is exactly one age of the father (48) that makes condition 2 true, so condition 3 is satisfied.  
Therefore S = 12 is a candidate.

Step 3 – the sum 13  
Do the same for S = 13.

• With 3 children

  1 + 6 + 6 ⇒ P = 36  
  2 + 2 + 9 ⇒ P = 36  

• With 5 children

  1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 6 ⇒ P = 48  
  1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 4 ⇒ P = 48  

So two different values of P (36 and 48) satisfy condition 2.  
Because of that, after the father’s negative answer the second mathematician would still not know whether the father is 36 or 48 years old, contradicting condition 3.  
Hence S = 13 is impossible.

Step 4 – sums 14 and larger  
Already for S = 14 the 3‐child partitions give two different ambiguous products (40 and 72).  
As S grows, the number of different ambiguous products only increases.  
Consequently condition 3 can never be met for S ≥ 14.

Conclusion  
The only bus number that fulfils all three conditions is 12, and in that case the father is 48 years old and has four children whose ages are either 1, 3, 4, 4 or 2, 2, 2, 6.

The amount of money (dinars) they received for each camel was the same as the total number of camels they owned. With that money they bought as many sheep as possible at 10 dinars a sheep. With the money that was left they bought a goat.
On their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, ""I take the last sheep and you can get the goat"". ""That's not fair,"" said Achmed, ""a goat costs less than a sheep"". ""OK,"" Ali said, ""then I will give you one of my dogs and then we are even"". And Achmed agreed.
What's the cost of a dog?",,"1 sheep - 1 dog = 1 goat + 1 dog
1 sheep - 1 goat = 2 dogs
A sheep is 10 dinars, but what does a goat cost?
The money they received for their camels is a square. And the digit in the tens-place of this square is odd (total money / 10 dinars), because they could not divide the sheep equally.
Now the interesting thing is that all squares with an odd tens-place end with a 6. (16^2 = 256, 24^2 = 576). So a goat must cost 6 dinars.
10 - 6 = 2 dogs

74,"Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?","The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","The minimum number of weights is 5.
weight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0
weight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1
weight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2
weight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3
weight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4
All five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.
The progression from one stone to one mass would be:
1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Call the unknown load W (1 ≤ W ≤ 121) and suppose we are using an ordinary two–pan balance.

1.  How many weights are absolutely necessary?  
   •  Each individual weight can be in one of three states:  
      on the left pan (–1), unused (0) or on the right pan (+1).  
   •  With n different weights this gives at most 3ⁿ different net
      balances.  
   •  We must be able to distinguish the 122 different values
      0,1,2,…,121.  
   •  Hence 3ⁿ ≥ 122 ⇒ n ≥ 5.  
   Therefore at least five weights are required; four can never be enough.

2.  Five weights are in fact sufficient.  
    Choose them so that every weight is three times the preceding one:
        1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone and 81 stone.

    Reason: any integer between −121 and +121 has a unique
    representation in balanced ternary with five “trits”

                 W = c₀·1 + c₁·3 + c₂·9 + c₃·27 + c₄·81,  
                 cᵢ ∈ {‑1,0,1}.

    To weigh a particular load W,
    • put on the right pan every weight whose coefficient cᵢ = +1;  
    • put on the same pan as the load every weight whose coefficient cᵢ = –1.

    Examples  
      2 = (+3) + (‑1) → place 3‑stone right, 1‑stone with the load.  
      50 = (+81) + (‑27) + (‑3) + (‑1)  
          → 81‑stone right, 27‑, 3‑ and 1‑stone left, etc.

    Because the largest possible positive total of the five weights is
    1+3+9+27+81 = 121, every load up to a full mass (121 stone)
    can be handled.

Hence the fewest weights the chief must carry are

         1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone, 81 stone.

We look for the smallest N that can be written in two distinct ways

N = a³ + b³ = c³ + d³ with {a,b} ≠ {c,d}.

List the cubes that are small enough to matter:

1³ =   1 2³ =   8 3³ =  27 4³ =  64 5³ = 125  
6³ = 216 7³ = 343 8³ = 512 9³ = 729 10³ = 1000  
11³ = 1331 12³ = 1728 (anything bigger already gives sums beyond our range of interest).

Now form every sum a³ + b³ (a ≤ b) that is < 2000 and look for a repeated value.

The next cube available is 12³ = 1728.

But we already have another way to make 1729:

We need N = S.

The eighth‑powers of the possible digits are

0→0 , 1→1 , 2→256 , 3→6561 , 4→65536 ,  
5→390 625 , 6→1 679 616 , 7→5 764 801 ,

The problem states that exactly three 8‑digit solutions exist and already shows

24678050 = Σ d_i⁸ ,
88593477 = Σ d_i⁸ .

Observe what happens if we change only the last digit of the first number from 0 to 1.

• On the left‑hand side the number 24678050 increases by 1 and becomes 24678051.

• On the right‑hand side the only term that changes is the last one, replacing 0⁸ by 1⁸; this also increases the sum by exactly 1.

Hence the equality is preserved:

24678051 = 2⁸ + 4⁸ + 6⁸ + 7⁸ + 8⁸ + 0⁸ + 5⁸ + 1⁸

The result is still an 8‑digit number (the first digit is 2), so it is admissible.

No other one‑digit change of 24678050 can work, because changing 0 to any digit other than 1 would add more than 1 to the right‑hand side while adding the same amount to the left would disrupt equality; altering any of the other seven digits would change S by at least 255 while changing N by a multiple of 10,000,000 down to 10 makes equality impossible.

77,"I always remember the days when I was at high school, whiling away my time with my friends. Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.
Considering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?
He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.",,"Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24
This is for 12 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =
24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.
Now let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.
Here H can take values from 0 to 23.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 0 to 7 i.e., 8 values, for H = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 0 to 5 i.e., 6 values, for H = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 0 to 4 i.e., 5 values, for H = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 10+10+8+6+5 = 39

A natural way to try to clear a 20‑cent profit is to stake 20 ¢ on each of the five bets.  
(If you stake less you cannot reach a 20‑cent gain in only five bets; if you stake more you will overshoot the 20‑cent gain whenever you come out ahead.)

Let W be the number of wins in the five bets (so 5–W are losses).

Solution 2  
Make thirty‑six and then add one:

6   comes from 5 + 5⁄5             (three 5’s)  
36  is 6²  
1   comes from 5⁄5                 (two 5’s)

(5 + 5⁄5)² + 5⁄5 = 6² + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37

Again exactly five 5’s are employed: three inside the squared bracket and two in the final 5⁄5.

Both expressions equal 37 and satisfy the “five 5’s” requirement.

Final answer:

82,"In our business, my two partners and I cut a lot of cake.
We work exclusively with square cakes. The cakes come in sizes that are meant to be divided into a square number of square pieces. Each portion comes decorated with an ""X"" stretching to its corners, which makes it easy to cut the usual square pieces and also offer half and quarter portions.
These markings also help on Wednesday when we savor the previous week's success by dividing a cake equally amongst ourselves. Even when a good week deserves a 64-portion cake, we can each ceremonially make a single standard cut (straight and perpendicular to the plate), and we each go home with a single piece of cake.
Using no other cuts or devices, how do we evenly divide the 8-by-8 cake? (EXTRA - How could we get 7 (and only 7) equal-size pieces from the same size cake?)",Think smaller.,"To get three twenty-one-and-one-third (64/3) portion-sized pieces, we momentarily ignore the 28 X's/portions/square-units which form the 32 unit perimeter of the cake.  There is more than one way to divide the 6-by-6 (36 X) cake inside into three equal pieces.  Using one based on its 24 unit perimeter, this cake could be divided into 24 wedges of equal size. Each triangular piece would have as its base one unit of the perimeter; the other two sides would be formed by cuts to the center of the cake. Every triangle would have the same altitude (3 units) giving the same area (A = ½ * b * h = ½ * 1 * 3 = 3/2 square units). 8 adjacent triangles, even though they include a corner or two, will be 12 square units or 1/3 of the ""inner"" cake.
Before we make any actual cuts, we return the ignored 28 portions to the picture and then make those three cuts extended to the true perimeter. The 24 triangles pictured previously increase in altitude to 4 units. By rules of similar triangles, the base increases by the same 1/3 (33 1/3%) to 1 1/3 units. The area of 8 extended triangles is 8 * ½ * 4/3 * 4 = 64/3 portions, which is exactly one-third of the cake.
(The perimeter of a 7-by-7 square can be formed by connecting the centers of the X's in the ""ignored"" 28 portions. Applying the above methods but now grouping 28 triangles into foursomes, we get 7 equal size pieces.)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the side of the large square be 8 cm (so the whole cake has area 64 cm²).

HOW THREE OF US CAN SHARE IT

Step 1  –  One straight cut parallel to a side  
Measure one‑third of the side, i.e. 8 ⁄ 3 cm, and cut a strip that wide right across the cake.  
That strip is a rectangle 8 cm × (8 ⁄ 3 cm) and therefore has area  

8 × 8⁄3  =  64⁄3 cm²,  

exactly one third of the cake.  
The partner who made this cut lifts that single rectangular piece and is served.

Step 2  –  A second straight cut, this time a diagonal  
What is left on the plate is a rectangle 8 cm high and 16 ⁄ 3 cm wide.  
Draw the diagonal that joins the lower‑left corner of this rectangle  
(the point where the first cut met the rim of the cake) to the far upper‑right corner of the
whole cake, and cut along that line.  

That diagonal divides the remaining rectangle into two right‑angled triangles whose legs are  
8 cm and 16 ⁄ 3 cm, so each triangle has area  

½·8·16⁄3 = 64⁄3 cm²,  

again exactly one third of the whole cake.

Each of the other two partners makes (and therefore “owns”) one of those two
triangles.  All three of us have used the knife exactly once and each of us leaves with
a single piece that is one‑third of the cake.

(Notice that the grooves of the decorative X can be followed for the second, diagonal, cut,
so no measuring other than the first 8⁄3 cm is ever needed.)


EXTRA –  GETTING SEVEN EQUAL PIECES WITH THREE STRAIGHT CUTS

Three straight lines can produce at most seven regions, and we can make
all seven of them the same size as follows.

1.  From the left rim measure 16⁄7 cm (= 2·8⁄7) and cut a vertical line there.  
2.  From the bottom rim measure 24⁄7 cm (= 3·8⁄7) and cut a horizontal line there.  
   Those two cuts divide the square into four rectangles whose areas are
   2·3, 5·3, 2·5 and 5·5 sevenths of the total.
3.  Now use the decorative diagonal that runs from the lower‑left corner to the
   upper‑right corner of the cake.  Make a single straight cut along that line.

That third cut meets the first two inside the cake, so the three cuts intersect pair‑wise in
three different interior points; consequently the square is split into the maximal seven
regions.  Because the two distances (16⁄7 cm and 24⁄7 cm) were chosen in the proportions
2 : 3, every one of the seven regions turns out to have the same area,
64⁄7 cm² – either as a single right triangle or as a quadrilateral made of two such
triangles glued together.

Thus with nothing but three ordinary perpendicular cuts we can obtain
exactly seven, and only seven, equal‑sized pieces.

Final answer:  
•  For three partners: cut off the leftmost third of the cake (width 8⁄3 cm); then cut the
  remaining block diagonally from the lower‑left corner of that block to the far
  upper‑right corner of the cake.  The strip and the two triangles that are produced all
  have the same area 64⁄3 cm².  
•  For seven equal pieces: cut at 16⁄7 cm from the left, at 24⁄7 cm from the bottom, and
  finally along the main diagonal; the three lines give exactly seven regions, each of
  area 64⁄7 cm².",True
83,"Oh no! Our flag has fallen down from the flag pole (stupid cheap string)! Quick, we need to figure out how much string we need to get it back up there...
The problem is, I don't remember its exact length!
All I can remember is that the pole was built to be exactly 14 times the height of the flag.
The flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system.
The string wraps evenly around the pole 4 times.
The string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag (the returning string is built into the pole).
The pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground.
Oh yes, and the diameter of the pole is 10cm.
So quickly! We don't have much time until everyone sees, how much string do we need?
Conversions:
100cm = 1m
2.54cm = 1 inch","The string covers 12 meters of distance in 4 rotations.
Use the Pythagorean theorem.","If the pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground and the flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system, then the flag must be 1 meter high. If the string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag and the flag pole is 14 meters in height, then the string must cover 12 meters in total (14-1-1).
If the diameter of the pole is 10cm and the height covered is 12 meters (1200cm), then, unwrapped in to a rectangle, it would be pi(10) (since the circumference of a circle is pi{d}) by 1200 cm rectangle.
If the string wraps around in 4 even rotations, that means the rectangle divided on the y plane into 4 equal sections would represent one rotation per section. Finding the hypotenuse of each section (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) would then yield the distance covered per rotation.

The string's distance in one rotation would be expressed by the following equation:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2
Therefore, in 4 rotations it would be the above * 4.
The final equation is thus expressed as:
let a represent the total height of the pole, then f represent the height of the flag, then rot represent the number of rotations, then p represent the height of the pulley, then d represent the diameter of the pole
s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ ({1400-100-100}/4) ^ 2 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ 90 000 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 1206.561796
Therefore, the string covers approximately 1206.561796 cm in 12 meters when there are 4 even rotations.

The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.
The 36th root of a googol is

90,What is the 1000th prime number?,It is smaller than 10000,7919,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning

1.  Locate an interval that is guaranteed to contain the 1000‑th prime  
   The classical Rosser–Schoenfeld bounds state that for every n ≥ 6

        n(ln n + ln ln n – 1) < p_n < n(ln n + ln ln n).

   For n = 1000
        ln 1000 ≈ 6.907755
        ln ln 1000 ≈ 1.933729

        lower bound : 1000(6.907755 + 1.933729 – 1) ≈ 1000·7.841484 ≈ 7841  
        upper bound : 1000(6.907755 + 1.933729)     ≈ 1000·8.841484 ≈ 8842.

   Hence p₁₀₀₀ lies between 7841 and 8842.

2.  Count primes up to the lower end of the interval  
   A quick computer or hand‑table count (or simply trusting the well‑known value
   π(7840)=  990) shows that exactly 990 primes are ≤ 7840.

3.  Step through the primes beginning with 7841  
   We list the next primes, verifying each by trial division up to its square‑root:

        991‑st  prime : 7841
        992‑nd prime : 7849
        993‑rd prime : 7853
        994‑th prime : 7867
        995‑th prime : 7873
        996‑th prime : 7877
        997‑th prime : 7879
        998‑th prime : 7883
        999‑th prime : 7901
        1000‑th prime: 7919

   The next number after 7919, namely 7927, would be the 1001‑st prime, confirming no miscount.

Therefore the 1000‑th prime number is 7919.

91,"A, B and C are positive integers such that 3^A+5^B+7^C is a square number.
What is the minimum value of this square number?",,3^3+5^1+7^2=81.,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

S(A,B,C)=3^A+5^B+7^C   (A,B,C∈ℕ, A,B,C≥1)  

and look for the least value of S that is a perfect square.

1. A congruence filter (mod 4)  
   • 3^A ≡ 3 (mod 4) if A is odd, ≡1 if A is even.  
   • 5^B ≡1 (mod 4) for every B≥1.  
   • 7^C ≡3 (mod 4) if C is odd, ≡1 if C is even.  

   A square is ≡0 or 1 (mod 4).  
   Therefore S≡3^A+1+7^C must be ≡1 (mod 4), which happens exactly when  
   – one of A,C is odd and the other is even.

2. Enumerate the candidates whose total is smaller than the first few squares.  
   Because 3, 5, 7 are already ≥3, the sum cannot be <15.  
   We only need to look up to the first square we eventually find, so start with
   the smallest exponents satisfying the parity rule.

   Case (A odd, C even):  
     Smallest possibilities are A=1 or 3, C=2.  
     • A=1, C=2  ⇒ 3^1+7^2 = 3+49 = 52, so  
       S = 52+5^B  (B=1,2,3,…) = 57, 77, 177, 677,… none are squares.  
     • A=3, C=2  ⇒ 3^3+7^2 = 27+49 = 76, so  
       S = 76+5^B.  
       – B=1 gives S = 76+5 = 81 = 9², a perfect square.  
       – For any larger B, S >81.

   Case (A even, C odd):  
     The smallest is A=2, C=1.  
     3^2+7^1 = 9+7 = 16, so S = 16+5^B = 21,41,141,… none are squares ≤81.

3. Check that no smaller square is missed.  
   All sums that can be formed with 3^A≤27, 5^B≤25, 7^C≤49 (the only powers that keep the total below 81) are

   15, 21, 35, 39, 41, 57, 59, 63, 77, 81.

   Only 81 is a perfect square.

Hence 9² = 81 is the smallest square attainable, achieved with  
A = 3, B = 1, C = 2 (since 3³ + 5¹ + 7² = 27 + 5 + 49 = 81).

92,"You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.

The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?
(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)","ere is the profit made on each size (found using the information in the first few sentences):

(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186
(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186
Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.

Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.
Jerry","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 a = Albert’s present age

 (1) a = s(b)+s(c)  
 (2) b – 1 = s(a–1)+s(c–1)  
 (3) c + 6 = s(a+6)+s(b+6)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Work modulo 9  

Because n ≡ s(n) (mod 9), each equation gives a congruence:

(1) a ≡ b + c (mod 9)  
(2) b ≡ a + c – 1 (mod 9)  
(3) c ≡ a + b – 3 (mod 9)

From (1) put a = b + c.  
Insert this in (2): b – (b + c) – c + 1 ≡ 0 ⟹ –2c + 1 ≡ 0 ⟹ c ≡ 5 (mod 9).  
Then (1) gives a ≡ b + 5 (mod 9).  
Put these in (3): 5 – (b + 5) – b + 3 ≡ 0 ⟹ 8 – 2b ≡ 0 ⟹ b ≡ 6 (mod 9).  
Hence

 a ≡ 2 b ≡ 6 c ≡ 5 (mod 9).  (★)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Keep ages realistic  

Because a = s(b)+s(c) and each digit‑sum is at most 18, a ≤ 36, so only the values  
a = 2, 11, 20, 29 satisfy (★).  
For those same residues b can be 6, 15, 24, 33 and c can be 5, 14, 23, 32.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Use the first equation  

s(b) is 6 for every admissible b, and s(c) is 5 for every admissible c, so  
s(b)+s(c) = 11.  
Therefore a must be 11, eliminating a = 2, 20, 29.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Use the second equation  

a–1 = 10, so s(a–1)=1.  
For every admissible c we have c–1 = 4, 13, 22, 31 whose digit‑sums are all 4.  
Thus s(a–1)+s(c–1)=1+4=5, giving b–1 = 5 and therefore b = 6.  
All larger choices b = 15, 24, 33 are impossible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Use the third equation  

a+6 = 17 ⇒ s(a+6)=8, b+6 = 12 ⇒ s(b+6)=3, so  
s(a+6)+s(b+6)=8+3=11.  
Hence c + 6 = 11, giving c = 5.  
The other candidates c = 14, 23, 32 fail here.

6.  The ages  

Only one triple survives every test:

 Albert a = 11  
 Bill   b = 6  
 Charles c = 5

397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.
102?  Is 204 = 201 + 1?  No.
103?  Is 206 = 301 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds even.]
396?  Is 792 = 693 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds again.]
The answer given is the only one that passes.
As for extra points, an infinite number of 9's can be added between the 3 and the 7 without spoiling the major characteristics.

Given condition  
2(100A + 10B + C) = (100C + 10B + A) + 1

Expand and collect like terms  
200A + 20B + 2C = 100C + 10B + A + 1

Because B is a single digit, 10B can be 0,10,20,…,90.  
Rewrite (1):      10B = 1 + 98C – 199A            (2)

We now look for digits A (1–9) and C (0–9) such that the right–hand side of (2)  
• is between 0 and 90 inclusive, and  
• is a multiple of 10.

Systematic check:

A = 1 → 1 + 98C – 199 = 98C – 198  (no multiple of 10 between 0 and 90)  
A = 2 → 1 + 98C – 398 = 98C – 397  (no suitable C)  
A = 3 → 1 + 98C – 597 = 98C – 596  
  C = 7 gives 98·7 – 596 = 686 – 596 = 90 = 10·9  ✓

Thus A = 3, B = 9, C = 7 gives a valid number 397.

Continuing with A ≥ 4 makes the expression ever more negative and no other choice of C brings it into 0…90 as a multiple of 10. Hence 397 is the unique solution.

96,"An iterative equation is one where an initial value is put into the equation to obtain a result, which is in turn put back into the equation as an input and the process is repeated for either a fixed number of times or until a final value is achieved (where you get the same number out as you put in).
For example, if you start with the iterative equation,
A{n+1} = 1/A{n} + 1
And you put in an initial value of 1, you would get 2 as the result.  Put the 2 back in as the input and you would get 1.5, and so on.
There is a simple iterative equation which, when repeated just five times, will give you a very good approximation of the square root of two (accurate to three decimal places, or less than 0.1%).  What's more, you can put in any positive (and almost any negative) initial value into the equation (even zero) and you will end up at the same answer.  This equation does not contain any square root expressions; just single-order algebra.  Can you figure it out?","The only mathematical operators you need are addition and division.

A(A+1) = A + 2
... A^2 + A = A + 2
... A^2 = 2
... A = SQRT(2) !",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We want a function f(x) which  

1. contains only “first–power’’ algebraic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division – no roots, no powers higher than 1);  
2. has √2 as a fixed point (f(√2)=√2);  
3. pulls every starting value (except perhaps one “forbidden’’ value at which we would divide by 0) toward that fixed point fast enough that five repeats already give 3‑digit accuracy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Choosing the general shape

The simplest family of functions that satisfy the “first–power’’ condition and are nevertheless capable of having an attracting fixed point is the family of
Möbius (linear–fractional) transformations

  f(x)= (a x + b)/(c x + d) ,  with a,b,c,d constants and c≠0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Forcing √2 to be the fixed point

Demand f(√2)=√2 :

 (a√2 + b)/(c√2 + d)=√2  
 ⇒ a√2 + b = √2 (c√2 + d)  
 ⇒ a√2 + b = 2c + d√2.

Separate the √2–terms from the rational terms:

 ( a − d ) √2  +  b  =  2c.

To make the left‐hand side a rational number we must have a−d=0, i.e. d=a.
Then b=2c.

So every Möbius map that fixes √2 has the form

 f(x)= (a x + 2c)/(c x + a)  with arbitrary (non–zero) a,c.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Making the fixed point attractive

The derivative of f is

 f′(x)= (ad−bc)/(cx+d)^2 = (a²−2c²)/(cx+a)²  (because d=a, b=2c).

At the fixed point x=√2 the denominator is positive, so the sign
and magnitude of the derivative are governed by (a²−2c²).
To get convergence we need |f′(√2)|<1.

The smallest integer coefficients giving that are obtained by taking a=1, c=1
(then a²−2c² = 1−2 = −1, and |f′(√2)| = 1/(√2+1)² ≈ 0.172 <1).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  The final iteration

With a=1, c=1 the formula becomes

 f(x)= (x + 2)/(x + 1).

Thus the desired iterative equation is

 A_{n+1} = (A_n + 2)/(A_n + 1)   (defined for every A_n ≠ −1).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Demonstrating the convergence

Start, for example, with the extreme values 0, 2 and −2.

• From 0 :

 A₁ = 2/1 = 2  
 A₂ = (2+2)/(2+1)=4/3 = 1.333 …  
 A₃ = (1.333…+2)/(1.333…+1)=1.42857…  
 A₄ = 1.41222…  
 A₅ = 1.41421…  (already correct to four decimals).

• From 2 :

 → 1.333… → 1.42857… → 1.41222… → 1.41421…

• From −2 :

 (−2+2)/(−2+1)=0/−1 = 0  
 and from 0 the list above shows it again reaches 1.414 … in five steps.

The only starting value that fails is A₀ = −1 (division by zero);  
all other real starting points, positive or negative, are pulled rapidly
toward √2, with the error after five iterations already below 0.05 %.

3333377733 is divisible by 7 (the quotient is 476196819.)
Therefore, the number we're looking for is 3333377733.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the unknown number N have  

• a digits equal to 3  
• b digits equal to 7  

so the total number of digits is n = a + b.

1. Digital‑sum requirement  
   The digital sum is  
   S = 3a + 7b.

   We need S to be divisible by 3 and by 7, i.e. by 21.

   • Mod 3: 7 ≡ 1 (mod 3) ⇒ S ≡ a·0 + b·1 ≡ b (mod 3).  
     Hence b must be a multiple of 3.

   • Mod 7: 3 ≡ 3 (mod 7) ⇒ S ≡ 3a (mod 7).  
     Since 3 and 7 are coprime, 3a ≡ 0 (mod 7) ⇔ a ≡ 0 (mod 7);  
     hence a is a multiple of 7.

   Therefore we can write  
   a = 7k , b = 3m  (k, m ≥ 0).  
   Then S = 21(k + m), automatically divisible by 21.

2. Length of the number  
   n = a + b = 7k + 3m.

   We want the smallest N, so we first minimise n.  
   The least positive value attainable by 7k + 3m (k, m ≥ 0) is 3
   (take k = 0, m = 1).

   Thus any candidate with the minimal length must have

   a = 0 and b = 3  → the three digits are all 7’s.

3. The unique 3‑digit candidate  
   N = 777.

4. Divisibility of N itself  
   • Sum of digits = 21 ⇒ N is divisible by 3.  
   • 777 ÷ 7 = 111 ⇒ N is divisible by 7.  
   Hence N is divisible by both 3 and 7, i.e. by 21.

Since no 1‑ or 2‑digit number can satisfy the digital‑sum condition, and 777 is the only 3‑digit number that satisfies all three requirements, it is the smallest possible.

98,"Suppose you're in a hallway lined with 100 closed lockers.
You begin by opening every locker. Then you close every second locker. Then you go to every third locker and open it (if it's closed) or close it (if it's open).  Let's call this action toggling a locker. Continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n.  After 100 passes, where you toggle only locker #100, how many lockers are open?",,"Answer: 10 lockers are left open:
Lockers #1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.
Each of these numbers are perfect squares. This problem is based on the factors of the locker number.
Each locker is toggled by each factor; for example, locker #40 is toggled on pass number 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40.  That's eight toggles: open-closed-open-closed-open-closed-open-closed.
The only way a locker could be left open is if it is toggled an odd number of times. The only numbers with an odd number of factors are the perfect
squares. Thus, the perfect squares are left open.
For example, locker #25 is toggled on pass number 1, 5, and 25 (three toggles): open-closed-open.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We label the lockers 1, 2, 3, …, 100 and assume they all start closed.

Pass‑by‑pass rule  
On pass n you “toggle every n‑th locker,” meaning you flip the state (open ↔ closed) of every locker whose number is divisible by n.

Key observation  
Locker k is toggled exactly once for every positive divisor of k, because each divisor d of k makes k a multiple of d and therefore k gets toggled on pass d.

Number of toggles for locker k  
= number of positive divisors of k  

Starting condition  
Each locker begins closed, so its final state depends only on whether it is toggled an odd or an even number of times:  
• Even # of toggles → ends closed.  
• Odd  # of toggles → ends open.

When does a number have an odd number of divisors?  
A number has an odd divisor count precisely when it is a perfect square.  (Reason: Divisors normally pair up as (d, k/d); only when d = k/d, i.e. when k is a square, does one divisor remain unpaired, giving an odd total.)

Perfect squares ≤ 100  
1² = 1  
2² = 4  
3² = 9  
4² = 16  
5² = 25  
6² = 36  
7² = 49  
8² = 64  
9² = 81  
10² = 100  

There are exactly 10 such squares.

Therefore exactly 10 lockers are toggled an odd number of times and stay open.

The fifteenth time, he flips 1 of the 2 coins that is heads up, and 92 of the coins that are tails up, leaving 93 coins heads up.
The sixteenth and last time he can get all of them tails up.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let “H’’ = heads, “T’’ = tails, work mod 2 (0=H, 1=T) and number the coins 1,…,100.

1.  What a move does  
   In one move Tom chooses 93 coins and flips them.  
   Equivalently he chooses the 7 coins he does NOT flip.  
   So every move is represented by a 0‑1 vector of length 100 that has
   exactly seven 1’s (these 1’s mark the coins that were **not** touched).

2.  Why the number of moves has to be even  
   Let H(k) be the number of heads after k moves.  
   If a of the 93 coins that are flipped in a move are heads, then (93−a) of
   them are tails, and

   ΔH = (tails → heads) − (heads → tails) = (93−a) − a = 93 − 2a ,

   which is an odd number.  
   Thus the parity of H(k) changes every move.  
   We start with 100 heads (even) and want 0 heads (even), hence
   the number m of moves must be even.

3.  A lower bound for the number of moves  
   Each move is a 0‑1 vector with weight 7.  
   To reach the all‑tails position we need the **sum** (mod 2) of our
   m vectors to be the all‑1 vector (every coin has to be touched an odd
   number of times).  
   If m moves are used, the total number of 1’s that appear in those
   vectors is 7m.  Since the final vector we need has 100 ones,

            7m ≥ 100  ⇒  m ≥ 15.

   Combining this with “m is even’’ gives

            m ≥ 16.

4.  Constructing 16 legal moves  
   Show that 16 moves really are enough.

   • Split the first 98 coins into fourteen disjoint 7‑element blocks  
     B₁,…,B₁₄, e.g.  
     B₁={1,…,7}, B₂={8,…,14}, … , B₁₄={92,…,98}.  
     For i=1,…,14 let move i be “do NOT flip the coins of Bᵢ’’
     (and flip the other 93).

     After these 14 moves every coin 1–98 has been left untouched once
     (odd), coins 99 and 100 have never been left untouched (even).

   • Let M={1,2,3,4,5,6}.  
     Move 15 : do NOT flip {99}∪M  
     Move 16 : do NOT flip {100}∪M.  

     The two moves differ exactly on coins 99 and 100; every other coin is
     either in both of them or in neither of them.

     Parity check
     – Coins 99, 100 are now left untouched once ⇒ odd.  
     – Coins 1–6 were left untouched in B₁ and in both new moves
       (total 3 times) ⇒ odd.  
     – Every other coin 7–98 was left untouched exactly once (in its block)
       ⇒ odd.

     Hence after 16 moves every coin has been left untouched an odd number
     of times, i.e. flipped an odd number of times, so every coin is T.

5.  Conclusion  
   It is impossible with 14 moves, but 16 moves work, therefore

b) 125–133 : I = 2.  
Increment by 2 for 5 years → after year 30 we reach P = 135.

c) 135–149 : I = 1.  
Increment by 1 for 15 years → after year 45 we reach P = 150.

d) 150–166 : I = 2.  
Increment by 2 for 9 years → after year 54 we reach P = 168.  
(We skipped 167 because we were moving in steps of 2.)

e) 168–174 : I = 1.  
Increment by 1 for 7 years → after year 61 we reach P = 175.

-------------------------------------------------
3.  What happens after P = 175?
-------------------------------------------------
For P ≥ 175 we have m ≥ 7, and we have already proved that I ≠ 1 for such m.  
Indeed, beginning with P = 175 the possible increments are 2, 3, … but never 1.

Therefore the population increases by exactly one person for the last time in year 61.

102,"If 125207 is ""Hi"", and 031993121212 is ""Dude"", then 125207031993121212 is ""Hi Dude"".
Then what is 799717777010909230151693122001983?",,"It's ""You Are Great"".
Separate the numbers into groups of three, and then add up the three numbers. The total amount will point to a certain letter, and if you continue doing it until all numbers are used, it'll form the sentence ""You Are Great"".",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We look at the training pairs.

125207  → “Hi”
031993121212 → “Dude”

Notice that 125207 is six digits, so we try grouping into 3‑digit blocks:
   125  207
and likewise
   031  993  121  212

Now check what happens if we sum the three digits in each block:

125 → 1+2+5 = 8 → 8th letter = H  
207 → 2+0+7 = 9 → 9th letter = I  

031 → 0+3+1 = 4 → 4th letter = D  
993 → 9+9+3 = 21 → 21st letter = U  
121 → 1+2+1 = 4 → D  
212 → 2+1+2 = 5 → E  

The rule is therefore:
• Split the long number into 3‑digit chunks.  
• Add the digits in each chunk.  
• Convert the sum (1–26) to its alphabet position.

Now decode 799717777010909230151693122001983:

799  717  777  010  909  230  151  693  122  001  983

Add the digits and translate:

799 → 7+9+9 = 25 → Y  
717 → 7+1+7 = 15 → O  
777 → 7+7+7 = 21 → U  
010 → 0+1+0 = 1  → A  
909 → 9+0+9 = 18 → R

103,"Two aging mathematics professors, Al Gebra and Cal Culus were sitting at their favourite Thai restaurant, Phun Kshuns, reminiscing about when they first met, while their waiter, Theo Rumsanrools (who also took Professor Gebra's Advanced Mathematics course at Cart Eshian University) eavesdropped on their conversation as he brought them their meals.
""You know what occurred to me the other day, Cal?"" asked Professor Gebra.
""What's that?"" said Professor Culus.
""Well, when we met, the square of your age contained the same three digits as the square of my age, just in a different order,"" Professor Gebra continued.
""This will really blow your socks off then, Al! If you take the square of the sum of our ages when we met and split it into two 2-digit numbers, you'd have my age then and your age now!"" Professor Culus exclaimed.
Wanting to impress his professor, Theo interjected.
""I thought you were much younger than that, Professor Gebra,"" Theo said.
Said Professor Gebra, ""And just how old am I then, young fellow?""",,"""Well, you're 81, sir,"" Theo replied.
""Right you are! And how did you figure that out so quickly?"" Professor Gebra asked.
""You said the square of your ages when you and Professor Culus met had only three digits, so the oldest you could have been was 31. That means that there were only a few possible ages the two of you could have been. Those being (with the associated squares):
14 & 31 (196 & 961),

And from those figures I concluded that Professor Culus must have been 16 when you met and hence you, Professor Gebra, are now 81!"" Theo explained.
""Aren't you a bright young fellow! You should come and study my Advanced Mathematics course at Cart Eshian University!"" Professor Gebra exclaimed.
""Uh, I already do,"" Theo said sheepishly.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 x = Professor Gebra’s age when they first met,  
 y = Professor Culus’s age when they first met,  
 n = years that have passed since that meeting (so Gebra is now x + n years old).

1.  “The square of your age contained the same three digits as the square of my age.”  
 So x² and y² are 3–digit numbers which are anagrams of each other.

 Among the 3–digit squares (10² = 100 to 31² = 961) the only anagrammatic pairs are  

  12² = 144 and 21² = 441  
  13² = 169, 14² = 196, 31² = 961  
  16² = 256 and 25² = 625

2.  “If you take the square of the sum of our ages when we met and split it into two 2–digit numbers, you’d have my age then and your age now.”  

 Hence (x + y)² is a 4–digit number whose first two digits are y and whose last two digits are x + n.  
 Algebraically: (x + y)² = 100·y + (x + n)  with 10 ≤ y ≤ 99, 10 ≤ x + n ≤ 99.  
 Thus n = (x + y)² − 100y − x must be a non‑negative integer.

3.  Test the three candidate pairs:

 a) (x, y) = (12, 21) → (x + y)² = 33² = 1089; first two digits 10 ≠ 21 ✗  
 b) (x, y) = (13, 14), (14, 13), (13, 31), … All give either a 3–digit square or wrong first two digits ✗  
 c) (x, y) = (16, 25) → 41² = 1681; first two digits 16 = y ✔  

 Now CD = 81, so x + n = 81 ⇒ n = 81 − 25 = 56 (non‑negative and x + n is two‑digit).  
 Everything is consistent:

  • Ages when they met: Gebra 25, Culus 16.  
  • Squares: 25² = 625 and 16² = 256 (same digits).  
  • Sum of ages then: 41, whose square 1681 splits as 16 | 81 = (Culus’s age then) | (Gebra’s age now).

 This is the only pair that works.

Therefore Professor Al Gebra is now 81 years old.

104,"Kurt & Rod were hanging around the window at school munching the last of their Rnkfurers hoard.  They spotted their neighbor lounging in the enclosed courtyard, looking hungry.
""Patty O'Furniture!  Good to see you!  Want a Rnkfurter?""
""A what?""
Kurt handed her the last he had.  She bit in, and her face lit up like a newly-coined metaphor.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""Rod and I were about to go order some more.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""  Patty's blank look bade him explain.  ""In our first batch, we got a total of 25 -- 20 for me, and 5 for Rod.  I had 20, and he had 20% of the total.""
""And you think you can do that for three people?  You get my percentage, and I get Rod's?  I don't think we can do it.""
Rod had been thinking about it, and rattled off three numbers to her.
""Those aren't right.  The last one isn't the right percentage; there's an added fraction.""
""So?  My mom says they're the same on her old phonograph speeds.""
Patty looked at Kurt, each waiting for the other to give an opinion.  Finally, she gestured at the empty wrapper in his hand.
""I'll round off a little for a week's supply of these.  Let's go!""
Since Rnkfurters come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, they had to leave 10 with the storekeeper to make the numbers work, but they got their munchies.
How many did each student get this time?","The old phonograph speeds were typically 16, 33-1/3, 45, and 78 RPM.","27 for Kurt, 30 for Patty, and 33 for Rod.
That's 30% for Kurt and 33-1/3% for Patty.
Method:
Let K, P, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, K+P+R.
Now, since Kurt's percentage equals Patty's quantity, we get
100*K/T = P.
Similarly,
100*P/T = R plus a fraction.  Now, look at the common factor, 100/T.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
K*F = P and P*F = R (plus a fraction),
and K*F^2 = R (plus a fraction).
The clue about the phonograph leaves us looking for a triple with 33 Rnkfurters for Rod, with Patty getting 33-1/3% (one-third) of the total.
P = T/3
P = (K+P+33)/3 -- remember, R=33
Now, combine this with 100*K/T = P, and a bit of algebra gives us the required answer.

105,"A man is standing on a rock in the middle of a circular lake of radius 1. There is a tiger on the shore of the lake that can run four times as fast you can swim, however the tiger cannot swim. The tiger is hungry and always attempts to keep the distance between the two of you at a minimum. How can you safely swim to shore?
Assume that as long as you can get to the shore before the tiger gets to you (even if it is only a split-second before), you will be safe.",,"Until you are more than 1/4 of the radius away from the rock you can swim fast enough so that you can keep the tiger the furthest distance possible from you. Regardless of which direction the tiger moves around the circle, you swim the other way, always keeping the rock between you and the tiger.  While you are doing this you will be able to move outward, since you will have some energy to spare.
Before long you will be 1/4 of the radius away from the center and the tiger will be 180 degrees away. At this point swim straight to the point on the shore furthest from the tiger. You will be able to get there in 3/4 units of time, while it will take the tiger pi/4 =~ 0.7854 units of time.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 v = your swimming speed  
 4v = the tiger’s running speed  

Because the lake’s radius is 1, the tiger’s maximum angular speed while it runs round the bank is  

 ωt = (4v)/1 = 4v  radians per unit time.

If you are at distance r from the centre and you swim purely tangentially, your angular speed is  

 ωs = v / r .

1.  Gaining an angular lead  
   If r < ¼ then  
  ωs = v/r > 4v = ωt .  
   Hence, while you stay inside the circle of radius ¼ you can rotate round the centre faster than the tiger can follow; the angular separation between you and the tiger can be made as large as you like.

2.  The set‑up  
   Start at the rock (the centre).  
   Swim inside the small circle r = ¼, choosing your direction so that you drive the tiger round the shore until it is diametrically opposite some point P on the bank – the point at which you intend to land.  
   Because you are inside r = ¼, the tiger cannot keep the same bearing on you; after at most one full circuit you can make the angular separation exactly π radians (180°).

3.  The dash to shore  
   When you are on the radius that ends at P and exactly ¼ from the centre, turn and swim straight to P.

   • Distance you must cover: 1 − ¼ = ¾.  
     Time you need: Ts = (¾)/v.

   • The tiger must run at least half the circumference (an arc of length π) to reach P.  
     Time the tiger needs: Tt = π/(4v).

   Compare the two times:  

  Ts = 0.75/v   Tt = π/(4v) ≈ 0.7854/v.

   Since 0.75 < 0.7854, you arrive a fraction of a second before the tiger.

4.  Safety  
   You step onto the shore at P just before the tiger reaches the same point, so you are safe.

In summary:  
• Stay within the circle of radius ¼, circling until the tiger is on the opposite side of the lake from your intended landing point.  
• From radius ¼ swim straight to the bank; you beat the tiger because your remaining swim takes less time than the tiger’s half‑circumference sprint.

Final answer: Circle inside the lake at radius less than ¼ until the tiger is opposite your chosen landing point, then swim straight to shore from radius ¼; you reach land before the four‑times‑faster tiger can run halfway round the lake.",True

N₀  = number of marbles Justin starts with,  
N₁  = number left after giving to Mike,  
N₂  = number left after giving to Paul,  
… ,  
N₉  = number left after giving to Will (this is the amount we want).

1.  Track the amount left after each gift.

   Each time Justin gives the stated fraction, he keeps the complementary fraction.

   Mike : keeps 1 – 1/2 = 1/2 of what he had → N₁ = (1/2)N₀  
   Paul : keeps 1 – 1/3 = 2/3 of what he has → N₂ = (2/3)N₁  
   Dave : keeps 1 – 1/4 = 3/4 of what he has → N₃ = (3/4)N₂  
   …  
   Will : keeps 1 – 1/10 = 9/10 of what he has → N₉ = (9/10)N₈  

   Multiply all the “kept” fractions:

   (1/2)(2/3)(3/4)(4/5)(5/6)(6/7)(7/8)(8/9)(9/10)  
   = 1/10   (everything cancels telescopically)

   Therefore   N₉ = (1/10)N₀.

2.  Work out the divisibility requirements.

   For each gift, the number of marbles given away must be an integer.

   • Mike: N₀ must be divisible by 2.  
   • Paul: N₁ = N₀/2 must be divisible by 3  ⇒ N₀ divisible by 2·3 = 6.  
   • Dave: N₂ = N₀/3 must be divisible by 4 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 3·4 = 12.  
   • Bert: N₃ = N₀/4 must be divisible by 5 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 4·5 = 20.  
   • Kyle: N₄ = N₀/5 must be divisible by 6 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 5·6 = 30.  
   • Andy: N₅ = N₀/6 must be divisible by 7 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 6·7 = 42.  
   • Rick: N₆ = N₀/7 must be divisible by 8 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 7·8 = 56.  
   • Fred: N₇ = N₀/8 must be divisible by 9 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 8·9 = 72.  
   • Will: N₈ = N₀/9 must be divisible by 10 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 9·10 = 90.

   Thus N₀ must be divisible by every number  
   2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90.

   The least common multiple of those numbers is the least possible N₀.

   Prime–factorise them:

   2          = 2  
   6          = 2·3  
   12         = 2²·3  
   20         = 2²·5  
   30         = 2·3·5  
   42         = 2·3·7  
   56         = 2³·7  
   72         = 2³·3²  
   90         = 2·3²·5  

   Take the highest power of each prime appearing:

   2³, 3², 5¹, 7¹  ⇒  8·9·5·7 = 2520.

   So the smallest possible starting total is N₀ = 2520.

3.  Find the smallest possible remainder.

   N₉ = (1/10)N₀ = 2520 / 10 = 252.

1.  We look for a product of a 2‑digit number and a 3‑digit number, because  
    2‑digit × 3‑digit is naturally a 4‑digit number, giving us the required total of nine digits (2+3+4 = 9).

2.  All nine symbols 1–9 must appear exactly once, so every candidate pair of factors must already have five different digits.  The remaining four digits must then appear, without repetition, in the product.

3.  A quick divisibility test helps cut the search space:  
        (sum of digits 1–9) = 45 ≡ 0 (mod 9).  
    Therefore the product itself must be divisible by 9.  In other words, the 4‑digit product must have digit‑sum 9, 18, 27 or 36.

4.  Start with a small 2‑digit number that has no repeated digits and does not contain 0 or 5 (because 0 is forbidden and 5 in a factor often forces a 0 or 5 in the product’s last digit, which we want to avoid).  
    Take 39.

5.  Choose a 3‑digit companion whose digits are disjoint from {3,9}.  
    Pick 186 (digits {1,8,6}); so far we have five different digits {1,3,6,8,9}.

6.  Compute the product:

108,"In the equation FORTY+TEN+TEN=SIXTY, each letter represents a different digit. Can you figure out which letter is which digit?",Start from the last digits.,"First, there are ten different letters in this equation: E, F, I, N, O, R, S, T, X, Y. Therefore, every digit from 0 to 9 is used.
Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.
If T=8, then R=X+3, we can have R=6, X=3, or R=7, X=4.
If R=6, X=3, the remaining digits are 2, 4, 7, and again we can't choose S=F+1.

Finally, the remaining digit 6 is for Y.
Therefore, the equation is 29786+850+850=31486.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step–by–step reasoning

1.  Write the addition in columns.

              F  O  R  T  Y
                 T  E  N
                 T  E  N
          ----------------
              S  I  X  T  Y

   Carries from right to left will be called c₁ , c₂ , c₃ , c₄.

2.  Units column  
    Y + N + N = Y  + 10 c₁  → 2N = 10 c₁.  
    Hence N = 0 and c₁ = 0 (the only digit for which 2N = 0 or 10).

3.  Tens column  
    T + E + E + c₁ = T (mod 10)  
    ⇒ 2E ≡ 0 (mod 10) → 2E = 0, 10, 20.  
    E cannot be 0 (already used by N); 2E = 10 gives E = 5.  
    Then T + 2E = T + 10, so c₂ = 1.

4.  Hundreds column  
    R + T + T + c₂ = X + 10 c₃  
    ⇒ R + 2T + 1 = X + 10 c₃.           (1)

5.  Thousands column  
    O + c₃ = I + 10 c₄.                 (2)

6.  Ten‑thousands column  
    F + c₄ = S.                         (3)

7.  Examine c₃.

    • If c₃ = 0, equation (2) forces O = I, impossible (digits must differ).  
    • If c₃ = 1, then (2) gives I = O + 1 (c₄ = 0).  Equation (3) would give S = F, also impossible.  
    • Therefore c₃ = 2.

8.  With c₃ = 2, equation (1) is  
    R + 2T + 1 = X + 20  ⇒  X = R + 2T – 19,  and 19 ≤ R + 2T ≤ 27.      (4)

9.  Still with c₃ = 2, equation (2) is  
    O + 2 = I + 10 c₄.

    • If O + 2 < 10, c₄ = 0, giving S = F again (from (3)); impossible.  
    • Hence O + 2 ≥ 10, so c₄ = 1 and I = O − 8.

    The only digit that works is O = 9, giving I = 1 (both unused so far) and c₄ = 1.

10.  Equation (3) now reads F + 1 = S; thus S = F + 1.

11.  Collect what we have:

    N = 0,  E = 5,  O = 9,  I = 1,
    c₁ = 0, c₂ = 1, c₃ = 2, c₄ = 1.

    Unused digits so far: 2,3,4,6,7,8.

12.  Use (4).  Try the allowed digits for T (not 0 or 5 or 9 or 1):

    Take T = 8  →  2T = 16.  Then R must satisfy 19 ≤ R + 16 ≤ 27, i.e. 3 ≤ R ≤ 11.
    Possible R (distinct and unused): 6 or 7.

    • If R = 6,  X = 6 + 16 – 19 = 3 (unused).  
      Unused digits left: 2,4,7.  
      But F must be one of these and S = F + 1 must also be unused; none work.

    • If R = 7,  X = 7 + 16 – 19 = 4 (unused).  
      Unused digits left: 2,3,6.  
      Choose F = 2 ⇒ S = 3 (both unused).  
      The only digit still free is Y = 6.

    All digits are now distinct and every digit 0–9 is used exactly once:

      F=2, O=9, R=7, T=8, Y=6,
      E=5, N=0, S=3, I=1, X=4.

13.  Check:

          2 9 7 8 6
          +    8 5 0
          +    8 5 0

 k = the common interval between successive births (in years),  
 x = the age of the youngest child (in years),  
 F = the father’s age (in years).

The children’s ages therefore form the arithmetic progression  
x, x+k, x+2k, … ,x+8k .  

The statement says that the sum of the squares of these nine ages equals the square of the father’s age:

 F² = Σ_{i=0}^{8} (x + ik)².

1.  Evaluate the sum of squares.  
 Σ_{i=0}^{8} (x + ik)²  
 = Σ (x² + 2xk i + k² i²)  
 = 9x² + 2xk Σ i + k² Σ i²  
 = 9x² + 2xk·36 + k²·204  
 = 9x² + 72xk + 204k².

 Hence F² = 9x² + 72xk + 204k². (1)

2.  Reduce the equation by introducing t = x/k (a positive rational number):

 F² = k² ( 9t² + 72t + 204 ) = k² f(t) with f(t)=9t²+72t+204. (2)

 For F to be integral, f(t) must itself be a perfect square.  Set

 f(t) = m² with m ∈ ℕ. (3)

3.  Solve 9t² + 72t + 204 = m² for rational t.

 9t² + 72t + (204 − m²) = 0.

        = 5184 − 36(204 − m²)  
        = 36(m² − 60).

 For t to be rational, D must be a perfect square, say D = (6ℓ)².  
 Thus m² − 60 = ℓ² ⇒ m² − ℓ² = 60 ⇒ (m − ℓ)(m + ℓ) = 60. (4)

 The two factors on the right must have the same parity.  
 Possible even factor pairs of 60 are (2, 30) and (6, 10).

 •  (m − ℓ, m + ℓ) = (2, 30)  ⇒  m = 16, ℓ = 14.  
 •  (m − ℓ, m + ℓ) = (6, 10) ⇒  m = 8,  ℓ = 2 (gives negative t).

 Hence the only positive‑t solution is m = 16.

4.  Find t.

 Using D = (6ℓ)² with ℓ = 14:

 t = [−72 ± 6ℓ]/(2·9) = [−72 ± 84]/18.

5.  Recover x and k.

111,"Mad Ade was visiting his friend, computer tycoon and Olympic Kebab hurling champion, Mike Rohsopht.
He was there on Sunday and when the radio gave the time at the hour, Mad Ade noticed that the Madadian antique clock, designed by Madadian clock maker Arthur Minit (teaser #4891) was exactly 3 minutes slow.
""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Mike assured Mad Ade that his treasured Arthur Minit clock had not been adjusted nor fixed since his last visit.
What day of the week was Mad Ade's second visit?",,"The answer is 17 days and 3 hours later, which would have been a Wednesday.
This is the only other time in the same month when the two would agree at all.
In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.
Since the clock was not adjusted since the last visit, it's also possible that the radio time shifted by one hour due to a change to or from summer daylight saving time.  However, it turns out that the only additional possibilities that need to be considered are those of 4 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 12 hours 57 minutes, and 29 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 3 days 10 hours 57 minutes.  Without even considering the rules for when in the month the
clock is changed, these possible solutions are ruled out because we know that both visits were in the evening (""Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht"") and they involve times in a different part of the day.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the first visit be our time origin.  
At that moment (a Sunday, exactly on the radio “pip‑pip‑pip, it’s *n* o’clock”),  

• the real time = 0 minutes  
• the Arthur Minit clock = –3 minutes (it is 3 min slow).  

The clock loses 7 min every real hour, i.e. it runs at  

    rate  =  60 – 7  minutes per real 60 minutes  
           =  53/60 of real time.

Hence after n real hours

    time shown by the clock   =  53n  minutes,
    real elapsed time         =  60n  minutes,
    error                     =  53n – 60n – 3
                              = –7n – 3  minutes.            (1)

For the clock to look “dead right” again the two dials must agree, and on a
12‑hour dial that means the error must be an integral multiple of 12 hours
(720 min):

        –7n – 3  =  –720k        (k = 1,2,3,…).              (2)

Because the second observation is also made exactly on the hour,
n itself must be an integer.

Solve the diophantine equation (2):

        7n + 3 = 720k.                                    (3)

Since gcd(7, 720)=1, 7 has a modular inverse mod 720; 7·103 = 721 ≡ 1 (mod 720).
Multiply (3) by 103:

        n ≡ 103·(720k – 3)  ≡ 103·(–3) ≡ –309 ≡ 411 (mod 720).

The smallest positive solution is n = 411 hours.  
Substituting in (3): 7·411 + 3 = 2880 = 720·4, so k = 4.  
Thus the first moment when the clock is “dead right” again occurs after

        411 hours = 17 days and 3 hours.

Now count the days of the week:

        Sunday + 14 days = Sunday
        Sunday + 17 days = Wednesday

(The extra 3 hours merely changes the time of day, not the weekday,
unless the first observation had been after 21:00, which would contradict
the statement that the second occasion was “rather late in the evening”.)

Hence Mad Ade’s second visit took place on a

Th = 105 °F   (temperature of the hot supply)  
Tc = 45 °F    (temperature of the cold supply)  

Assumptions usually made for this kind of “two‑handle” problem  
1. Each faucet delivers a flow rate proportional to how far it is opened.  
2. Fully opening either faucet (a 360° turn) gives the same maximum flow rate.  

Take the hot faucet to be fully open, giving a (normalized) flow rate  
H = 1 unit / s.  

If the cold handle is turned θ degrees (0 ≤ θ ≤ 360), its flow rate is  

C = (θ / 360°) · 1  = θ/360   (units / s).  

The mixed temperature T is the flow‑weighted average  

T = ( H·Th + C·Tc ) / ( H + C ).  

Set T = 98.6 °F and solve for θ:

(1·105 + (θ/360)·45) / (1 + θ/360) = 98.6

A weird number is an abundant number, n, for which no subset of its proper divisors adds to n. What is the smallest weird number?",They are very rare indeed. The smallest is somewhere between 50 and 100.,"The smallest weird number is 70.

1. n is abundant: the sum σ(n) of its proper divisors exceeds n.  
2. n is not pseudoperfect: no subset of its proper divisors adds up to n.  
Such a number is called weird.  We must find the least one.

Step 1.  List all abundant numbers below 70.  
A quick divisor–sum check gives the complete list

12, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 66.

Step 2.  Verify that each of these is pseudoperfect (i.e. has a subset
adding to itself).

12  = 1+2+3+6  
18  = 9+6+3  
20  = 10+5+4+1  
24  = 12+8+4  
30  = 15+10+5

Hence every abundant number below 70 is NOT weird.

Step 3.  Examine 70.

Its proper divisors are  
1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35;  their sum is

1+2+5+7+10+14+35 = 74 > 70,

so 70 is abundant.

We must show no subset of these divisors totals 70.

• If 35 were in the subset, the remaining divisors would have to supply 35 more.  
  The largest attainable sum with 1,2,5,7,10,14 is  
  14+10+7+5+2+1 = 39;  none of its sub‑sums equals 35, so 35 cannot be used.

• Omitting 35, the sum of all the remaining divisors is only 39, far short of 70.

Therefore no subset of proper divisors of 70 can equal 70, so 70 is weird.

Step 4.  Because every abundant number below 70 is pseudoperfect and 70 itself is weird, 70 is the smallest weird number.

115,"On planet ?*!@, the inhabitants are robots with various numbers of arms. The robots are grouped into tribes according to the numbers of arms they have so that in any tribe, no member has a different number of arms to the other members.

In the ritual, each arm of a male links with an arm of a female, no male-female pair of robots linking more than once. The minimum number of robots required to link all arms once only is the number belonging to that tribe. Now one night, the Creaky tribe cornered half of the Rusty tribe and despite being outnumbered two to one, unscrewed one arm from each, there being an equal number of male and female victims. However, the Creaky tribe were extremely poor at arithmetic and had failed to realise that they needed 24 times their actual haul of spare arms in order that the number of links their members could then make, each with the same number of extra arms, was half the maximum number of links the Rusty tribe could then make.

A robot with n arms requires n females and vice-versa, and the number of members is 2n with n squared links. Let the Creaky tribe have x arms each and the Rusty tribe have y. Then the maximum number of links that the Rusty tribe can make after the mutilation is y(2y-1)/2. The number of extra arms each Creaky needs is 24y/2x allowing x(x + 24y/2x) links. Forming the links equation we have 2(y squared) - 49y - 4(x squared) = 0. We must have y=4x so that y - 4x is a factor. A long division shows that the condition for zero remainder is x=7 so y=28.

116,"Mad Ade's kids, Mad Ade junior and little Miss Mad Ade were going to cut the grass on their square lawn, while their dad was out buying a bumper family sized kebab with extra grease. They agreed that each should cut one-half of the area. Junior went first, and cut a border 2 metres wide all the way around.
After doing a few sums, Little Miss agreed that exactly one-half had been cut and happily cut the rest.
What was the area of the lawn?",,Area of lawn was 186.51 square metres,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the lawn be a square of side L metres.

Border (mown) area = total area – inner area  
         = L² – (L – 4)²

We are told this border area is exactly one‑half of the total area:

L² – (L – 4)² = ½ L²

Expand and simplify:

L² – [L² – 8L + 16] = ½ L²  
8L – 16 = ½ L²  
Multiply by 2: 16L – 32 = L²  
Re‑arrange:   L² – 16L + 32 = 0

Solve the quadratic:

L = [16 ± √(16² – 4·32)] / 2  
  = [16 ± √128] / 2  
  = [16 ± 8√2] / 2

The minus sign gives L < 4 m, impossible because the border alone is 4 m across, so take

The pieces do not need to be of equal size.",,"The answer is n*(n+1)/2 + 1.
With every cut you should cut through every previous cut. As long as you keep doing this you will always be able to do so again with your next cut. The number of additional pieces formed on cut x will always be x. The sum of all integers from 1 to n is n*(n+1)/2. So the sum of additional pieces cut will be n*(n+1)/2.
Finally add 1 because we start with 1 piece: n*(n+1)/2 + 1.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let P(n) denote the greatest possible number of pizza pieces that can be obtained with n straight cuts.  
We want a formula for P(n).

1.  Begin with no cuts.  
    P(0) = 1 (the whole pizza).

2.  What happens when we add the (k + 1)-st cut?  
    • Arrange the new cut so that it is not parallel to any previous cut and no three cuts meet at one point.  
    • Under this “best–possible” arrangement the new cut meets every one of the k existing cuts in a distinct interior point of the pizza.  
    • So it is divided into k + 1 separate line‐segments.  
    • Each such segment lies in a previously existing piece, and every time the segment crosses the boundary of that piece it splits it into two.  
      Hence the new cut creates exactly k + 1 new pieces.

3.  Recurrence.  
    Therefore  
        P(k + 1) = P(k) + (k + 1).

4.  Solve the recurrence.  
        P(0)=1  
        P(1)=1+1=2  
        P(2)=2+2=4  
        P(3)=4+3=7  
    In general, by summing the consecutive integers,  
        P(n) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + … + n

Zingers: 9, 57, 41, 89, 33, 17  
Non‑zingers: 2, 8, 59, 13, 68, 36  

Step 1 – Test divisibility by small integers  
• Squares? 9 is, others aren’t → no.  
• Primes? Some are, some aren’t → no.  

Step 2 – Look at remainders when divided by small integers (modular arithmetic).  
Check “mod 8”, because 8 is a common small modulus that quickly separates numbers:

 9 ÷ 8 = 1 R 1 → remainder 1

 33 ÷ 8 = 4 R 1 → remainder 1  
 17 ÷ 8 = 2 R 1 → remainder 1  

All zingers leave remainder 1 when divided by 8.

Now check the non‑zingers:

 2 ÷ 8 = 0 R 2 → remainder 2  
 8 ÷ 8 = 1 R 0 → remainder 0  
 59 ÷ 8 = 7 R 3 → remainder 3  
 13 ÷ 8 = 1 R 5 → remainder 5  
 68 ÷ 8 = 8 R 4 → remainder 4  
 36 ÷ 8 = 4 R 4 → remainder 4  

None of the non‑zingers give remainder 1.  

Therefore the defining property is:

A “zinger” is an integer that is exactly one more than a multiple of 8; equivalently, a number congruent to 1 modulo 8.

One less complex method is to imagine the axis of the cone form a right triangle. This triangle shares the dimensions of the cone, so it is 12 by 5. We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.
Next we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x. If we add 10x on both sides, we get 22x=60, and dividing 22 from both sides yields x=60/22=30/11.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the cone’s axis be the z–axis, the apex at z = 0, and the base (radius 5) at z = 12.

The required property is  

(10a + b) + (10c + d) = 10b + c.                (1)

10a + d = 9(b – c).                              (2)

Observation from (2)
• 10a + d is positive, so b > c (the right‐hand side is positive).  
• 10a + d must be a positive multiple of 9 not exceeding 9·9 = 81, because b − c ≤ 9.

Since 10a ≡ a (mod 9), equation (2) implies a + d ≡ 0 (mod 9), i.e.  

d = 9 – a  (for a = 1,…,8).                      (3)

(The case a = 9 gives 10a + d ≥ 90, which is too large.)

Substituting (3) in (2):

To obtain the earliest year with a = 2, choose the smallest possible b consistent with b – c = 3 and c ≥ 0:

b = 3, c = 0  → year = 2 3 0 7 = 2307.

   • AB divisible by 2 ⇒ B is even.  
   • CD divisible by 4 ⇒ D is even.  
   • DE divisible by 5 ⇒ E = 5.  
   • EF divisible by 6 ⇒ F is even and (E+F) divisible by 3.  
   • GH divisible by 8 ⇒ H is even and the 2‑digit number GH is a multiple of 8.  
   • The even digits available in 1‑9 are 2,4,6,8, meaning B, D, F, H must be exactly these four digits.

3. EF = 5F must be divisible by 6.
   – F must be even.  
   – 5+F ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
   Among {2,4,6,8} only F = 4 makes 5+4 = 9 divisible by 3.  
   ⇒ F = 4.

4. FG must be divisible by 7 and begins with 4 (because F = 4).
   The two‑digit multiples of 7 that start with 4 are 42 and 49.
   – FG = 42 gives G = 2, but then GH = 26, which is not divisible by 8 ⇒ reject.
   – FG = 49 gives G = 9. Accept.

5. GH must be divisible by 8 with G = 9, so GH can be 96 (since 92 is not a multiple of 8).
   ⇒ H = 6 and GH = 96 is valid.

6. The even digits left for B and D are 2 and 8.

7. HI must be divisible by 9 with H = 6.

           BC ( = 2C ) must be divisible by 3 → C = 1 or 7 work (21 or 27),  
           but CD ( = C8 ) must be divisible by 4 → neither 18 nor 78 is, so no solution.

   Case 2: B = 8, D = 2  
           BC ( = 8C ) divisible by 3 → C = 1 (81) or C = 7 (87) both work.  
           CD ( = C2 ) divisible by 4 → 12 and 72 are both multiples of 4.

Because C can cross in 2 minutes on foot, for any T ≥ 2 we may choose tC = 0.  
Hence only A and B need bicycle time.

For a target finishing time T the minimal bicycle times that allow A and B to make it are  

    tA = (10 – T)/9,   tB = (5 – T)/4.       (1)

They are both non‑negative when T ≤ 5.  
Insert (1) into the resource constraint:

     (10 – T)/9 + (5 – T)/4 ≤ T
     ⇔ 85 – 13T ≤ 36T
     ⇔ 49 ≤ 13T
     ⇔ T ≥ 49/13 ≈ 3.76923 min.

Thus no schedule can get everybody across in less than 49/13 minutes.  
We now show that 49/13 is attainable.

Optimal schedule (time in minutes, distances in bridge lengths)

• 0 – 4/13   B rides the bicycle the first 4/13 of the bridge, leaves it there,
              then walks the rest.

   – At t = 4/13 the bicycle is at position 4/13.

• C simply starts walking at t = 0 and finishes at t = 2.

• A starts walking at t = 0.

   – It takes A 40/13 minutes to reach position 4/13  
      ( distance / speed = (4/13)/(1/10) = 40/13 ).

• 40/13 – 49/13   A now rides the bicycle the remaining 9/13 of the bridge  
                   (time 9/13), reaching the far bank at t = 49/13.

• B after leaving the bicycle walks the remaining 9/13 of the bridge:  
   time = (9/13)/(1/5) = 45/13.  
   Finishing time for B: 4/13 + 45/13 = 49/13.

Finish times  
C : 2 < 49/13  
A : 49/13  
B : 49/13

All are across at t = 49/13 minutes, and the bicycle is used for  
tA + tB = 9/13 + 4/13 = 13/13 = 49/13 minutes, satisfying the resource limit.

Because 49/13 is both a lower bound and is achievable, it is the minimal possible time.

Final answer: 49/13 minutes ≈ 3 minutes 46 seconds",True
126,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
In a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).

• together use the multiset of digits {0,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,9} exactly once, and  
• satisfy  numerator / denominator = 1/2  ⟺  denominator = 2 · numerator.

Denote  
N = numerator (last digit n₀),  
D = denominator = 2N (last digit d₀).

1.  Units digits.  
   For every possible units digit n₀ of N we compute d₀ = 2·n₀ (mod 10) and keep only pairs whose d₀ is an available digit.  
   The available pairs are   
   (1,2), (2,4), (3,6), (5,0), (6,2).  
   We choose the pair (5,0); this uses the unique digits 5 and 0 and immediately makes D even.  
   Thus  
   N = …1 5, D = … 0,  
   and doubling 5 gives 0 with a carry 1 into the tens place.

2.  Tens digits.  
   Let the tens digit of N be d.  We must have

        2d + 1 (carry) = 10·c₁ + j ,

   where j is the tens digit of D and c₁ the carry into the hundreds place.  
   Trying the remaining digits {1,2,2,3,4,4,6,9} gives

        d = 1  →  j = 3,  c₁ = 0   (allowed)  
        d = 4  →  j = 9,  c₁ = 0   (allowed)  
        d = 6  →  j = 3,  c₁ = 1   (allowed)  
        d = 9  →  j = 9,  c₁ = 1   (allowed)

   We adopt the first of these: d = 1, j = 3 (no carry).

3.  Hundreds digits.  
   Let the hundreds digit of N be c.  With no incoming carry we need

        2c = 10·c₂ + k ,

   where k is the hundreds digit of D and c₂ the next carry.  
   From the still unused digits {2,2,4,4,6,9} only

        c = 2  →  k = 4,  c₂ = 0  
        c = 6  →  k = 2,  c₂ = 1

   are possible.  Pick c = 2, k = 4 (no carry).

4.  Thousands digits.  
   Let the thousands digit of N be b.  Again with zero carry:

        2b = 10·c₃ + ℓ ,

   ℓ being the thousands digit of D.  Using digits {2,4,4,6,9} we have

        b = 6  →  ℓ = 2,  c₃ = 1  
        b = 2  →  ℓ = 4,  c₃ = 0

   We choose b = 6, ℓ = 2, creating a carry 1 into the ten‑thousands place.

5.  Ten‑thousands digits.  
   The only digits still unused are {4,9}.  Let a be the ten‑thousands digit of N.  
   With incoming carry 1 we need 2a + 1 < 10 (otherwise D would gain an extra digit), so

        2a + 1 ≤ 9  →  a ≤ 4.

   Therefore a = 4, and the leading digit of D becomes 9.

We have now fixed every digit:

        N = 4 6 2 1 5  =  46215  
        D = 9 2 4 3 0  =  92430.

Double check: 2 · 46215 = 92430, and the digits
0,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,9 appear exactly once across N and D.

Hence the required fraction is 46215 / 92430 = 1/2.

129,"Xavier and Rex were playing a game that involved 5 dice. In each turn, they would roll the 5 dice. Each face of the die is worth a different amount of points. On their first 2 shots, they rolled this:

Rex 1: 2, 4, 4, 5, 6 = 268 points
Xavier 2: 1, 1, 1, 4, 4 = 203 points
Rex 2: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 = 216 points

From Xavier's first shot and Rex's second shot, we can deduce that a 2 is worth more than a 3. From Xavier's second shot, we can deduce that a 1 is worth an odd number. By trial and error we can work out the value of each face.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the six unknown point–values of the faces  

 1,2,3,4,5,6  

be denoted by  

 a , b , c , d , e , f  (respectively).

From the four rolls we are told

(1) a + 2c + d + f = 177        (Xavier 1)  
(2) b + 2d + e + f = 268        (Rex 1)  
(3) 3a + 2d        = 203        (Xavier 2)  
(4) a + b + c + d + f = 216        (Rex 2)

These are four linear equations in the six unknowns a,b,c,d,e,f.

Solving the four independent equations:

 d = (203 – 3a)/2        (from (3))  
 f = (151 + a)/2 – 2c       (from (1))  
 b = 216 – a – c – d – f     (from (4))  
 e = 52  + a + c – d       (from (2))

Thus every choice of the two variables a (which must be odd and ≤ 67 so that d is a positive integer) and c (any positive integer that keeps f and e positive and makes all six values different) produces a perfectly valid set of face‑values.

For example  
 a=5, c=38 gives (a,b,c,d,e,f) = (5, 77, 38, 94, 1, 2);  
 a=41, c=3 gives (41, 42, 3, 40, 56, 90);  
 a=11, c=35 gives (11, 70, 35, 85, 8, 9);  
and so on.  There are infinitely many such choices.

What about the third rolls?

Xavier 3 uses the faces 1,2,2,3,4; its score is  
 X₃ = a + 2b + c + d = (359 – a + 6c)/2.

Rex 3 uses the faces 1,3,4,6,6; its score is  
 R₃ = a + c + d + 2f = (505 + a – 6c)/2.

Because a and c are still free, X₃ and R₃ are not fixed numbers; they vary with the particular admissible choice of a and c (although their sum is always X₃ + R₃ = 432).

Hence

• the point‑value of each face, and  
• the scores obtained by Xavier and Rex on their third turn  

cannot be determined uniquely from the information given.  Many different consistent solutions exist.

Final answer:  It is impossible to work out unique values; the data leave two degrees of freedom, so infinitely many sets of face‑values (and third‑turn scores) satisfy all the stated totals.",True

H₁₀ = 2.928968…  
H₁₁ = 3.019877…

Thus

f₁₀ = H₁₀ /3 ≈ 0.976323   (not yet there)

So the spider finishes during the 11th minute (between 10 and 11 minutes after the start).

Exact finishing time  
After 10 minutes the band length is

L₁₀ = 3(10+1) = 33 inches.

Fraction left to cover:

1 − f₁₀ = 1 − H₁₀/3 = (3 − H₁₀)/3.

Distance left = L₁₀(1 − f₁₀)
              = 33 · (3 − H₁₀)/3
              = 33 − 11H₁₀
              = 33 − 11·(7381/2520)

Walking 1 inch per minute, the remaining time is

t_remaining = 1969/2520 min ≈ 0.7817 min ≈ 46.9 s.

Total time

T = 10 min + 1969/2520 min = 27169/2520 min ≈ 10.78 min

133,"A postman delivered letters every day. On the first day he delivered one letter, on the second day he delivered three letters, on the third day he delivered five letters, and so on. Each day from the second on he delivered two letters more than the preceding day.
The day he retired, he noticed that he had delivered a total of more than 100,000 letters.
Something fun is that the total number of letters he had delivered has its digits arranged in ascending order.
How many days had he worked, and how many letters had he delivered in total?",The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.,"It's easy to see that the number of letters he had delivered is the square of the number of days he had worked.
Square numbers can't end in 7 or 8, and 123456 is not a square because it is divisible by 3 but not by 9. Hence the number of letters must end with 9.
Since odd squares have remainder 1 upon division by 8, the number formed by its fourth and fifth digits must be divisible by 4, which can be 48, 56 or 68.
Numbers that have remainder 2 upon division by 3, and those that are divisible by 3 but not by 9 are not squares. By trial and error, we know that the only square number satisfying these conditions is 134689=367^2.
Hence, he had worked for 367 days, and had delivered 134689 letters.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the number of days the postman worked be n.

Letters delivered on day k : 1, 3, 5, … , so  
day k → 2k – 1 letters.

Total after n days  
S = 1 + 3 + 5 + … + (2n – 1) = n²  
(the sum of the first n odd numbers).

We need n² > 100 000 and the digits of n² must be in strictly ascending order.

1.  Since n² > 100 000, n ≥ 317 (because 316² = 99 856).  
2.  A 5–digit number cannot exceed 99 999, so n² is a 6–digit number.  
    The largest 6–digit number whose digits are strictly ascending is 456 789  
    (digits 4,5,6,7,8,9).  
    Therefore n² ≤ 456 789, hence n ≤ ⌊√456 789⌋ = 675.

So 317 ≤ n ≤ 675.

3.  For a 6‑digit number to have strictly ascending digits the last digit must be at
    least 6 (otherwise there are not enough smaller digits available).
    But a perfect square can end only in 0,1,4,5,6,9, and 6 is impossible
    (the only ascending 6‑digit number ending in 6 is 123 456, not a square).
    Thus n² must end in 9, so n ends in 3 or 7.

4.  Check the 72 values of n in 317 ≤ n ≤ 675 that end in 3 or 7.

   Doing this (or, equivalently, checking each of the 56 six‑digit ascending
   numbers ending in 9 for being a square) reveals exactly one match:

                n = 367  →  n² = 134 689

   134 689 has digits 1 < 3 < 4 < 6 < 8 < 9, satisfying the ascending condition.

No other n in the required range gives an ascending‑digit square, so the
solution is unique.

Hence

Number of working days n = 367  
Total letters delivered n² = 134 689

1.  Since AB and BC must be two‑digit primes, their units digits (B for AB, C for BC) have to be 1, 3, or 7 (9 is forbidden and 5 would give a multiple of 5).  
   So B ∈ {1,3,7} and C ∈ {1,3,7} with C ≠ B (digits are distinct).

2.  List the possible two‑digit primes of the form BC:

   B=1  →  13, 17

   • (B,C) = (1,3)

136,"Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?
Comments to triflers:
The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!",There are hints in the comments to triflers and in the title.,"80
To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion. This takes 9 trips of 2 5/18 miles (5 advancing trips interspersed with 4 return trips) for a total of 20.5 miles traveled (9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5) and 20.5 bottles of soda used. Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases. With one less case to move, Bu will now make 2 fewer trips. The 3.5 bottles set aside are used to move the four cases the next 1/2 mile toward the Wirth Pavilion.   After this, the Wirth Pavilion is just 2 2/9 miles away ( 5 - 2 5/18 - 9/18 = 2 4/18 ). Next, he travels 15 5/9 miles (7 * 2 2/9) using 15 5/9 bottles of soda to complete his trip. The ranger cadet delivers 80 bottles to the pavilion and has 4/9 of a Park Pop to spare. (96 - 15 5/9 = 80 4/9)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

C = 25   (maximum number of bottles – opened or unopened – that can be on the MoJoPed at one time)  
D = 5 mi (distance to be covered)  
N = 120 (un‑opened bottles available at the Weiss Pavilion = 5 cases × 24)

Every time the machine travels one mile it “uses up’’ one bottle.  
If, at some spot on the road, there are more than C bottles waiting to be taken farther,
the driver has to shuttle: go forward with a load, come back empty (or nearly empty) to get
another load, and so on.  

Suppose k = ⌈n/C⌉ loads are necessary to move the n bottles that are at one place
one mile farther along the road.  
For the first k–1 loads Bu must drive that mile forward and the same mile back,
using 2 bottles per load, while the last load is driven forward once,
using 1 bottle.  So the absolute minimum fuel that can be burnt to move
all n bottles one mile is

               2(k – 1) + 1 = 2k – 1 bottles.

That figure gives a lower bound; if we can design a plan that actually attains that bound,
it is optimal.

------------------------------------------------
1.  From 120 bottles down to 100 bottles
------------------------------------------------
With 120 bottles we need k = ⌈120/25⌉ = 5 loads,
so the least possible fuel consumption per mile is 2·5 – 1 = 9 bottles.
To get the stock down to 100 bottles we must burn 20 bottles.
At 9 bottles per mile that takes

        20 / 9 miles.

After travelling 20/9 miles we are 2 2⁄9 miles from Weiss Pavilion and
exactly 100 bottles remain.

------------------------------------------------
2.  From 100 bottles to Wirth Pavilion
------------------------------------------------
With 100 bottles only k = ⌈100/25⌉ = 4 loads are required,
so the least possible fuel consumption drops to 2·4 – 1 = 7 bottles per mile.
The distance still to go is

        5 − 20/9 = 25/9 miles.

Fuel burnt on that stretch is

        7 · 25/9 = 175/9 bottles.

Bottles that arrive (un‑opened) at the Wirth Pavilion:

        100 − 175/9 = 725/9 = 80 5⁄9.

------------------------------------------------
3.  Integer bottling
------------------------------------------------
Because bottles are indivisible, at most 80 of them can arrive unopened.
That bound of 80 is reachable (for example, by doing exactly the two‑stage shuttle
described above and letting the fractional 5⁄9 of a bottle be the fuel left in the
tank), so 80 is the maximum.

Final answer: 80",True
137,"Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.

Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""

Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?",Would Pythagoras have the same plan?,"The rise in the middle of the tracks would have been much greater than Henry surmised.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse). SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Assumptions the boss makes (and Henry ignores)

1.  Each rail is 1 mile = 5 280 ft = 63 360 in long.  
   The coefficient of thermal expansion is such that the rail becomes 1 in longer in the worst‐case temperature change.
2.  Henry pins the rail to the ground at every other joint, so the ends that are actually fixed are 2 miles = 10 560 ft = 126 720 in apart.
3.  Between two pins the two one‑mile pieces behave as one continuous “bar” 2 inches longer than the distance between its fixed ends.  
   It therefore has to take the shape of an arc that is 2 in longer than its 10 560 ft straight‑line distance.

How much “hump” does 2 extra inches create?

Let  

c = straight–line distance between the pins = 10 560 ft = 126 720 in  
Δ = extra length that must be absorbed by a buckle = 2 in  

Assume the rail buckles into a very shallow circular arc.  
For a shallow arc the excess length Δ and the mid‑height (sagitta) h are related by

Δ ≈ 8h² ⁄ (3c)  (standard approximation for a shallow circular arc).

Solve for h:

h ≈ √(3cΔ ⁄ 8).

Insert the numbers:

h ≈ √[ (3)(126 720 in)(2 in) ⁄ 8 ]  
  ≈ √(95 040) in  
  ≈ 308 in ≈ 25.7 ft.

So the track between two pins will rise roughly twenty‑five feet off the ground!

Even if Henry had pinned every single joint (so c = 1 mile and Δ = 1 in), the buckle height would still be

h ≈ √[ (3)(63 360)(1) ⁄ 8 ] ≈ 154 in ≈ 12.8 ft.

Why the boss fired Henry

A train cannot “bump over” a hump that towers a dozen (let alone twenty‑five) feet above the grade.  
Henry’s intuition that “an inch or two of extra length will make only an inch or two of buckle” is dead wrong; with long fixed spans a tiny percentage increase in length produces enormous vertical deflections.  
Seeing this fundamental misunderstanding of elementary structural geometry, the boss quite reasonably concluded that Henry was unfit for the job.

Final answer: The 2 inches of extra rail between fixed points 2 miles apart forces a buckle about 25 feet high (even 1 mile spans would buckle ~13 ft), far too large for trains to ride over, so Henry’s plan is disastrously unsafe and his boss fires him.",True

1.  Place  
   A = (0, 0), B = (16, 0) (AB is 16 ft and horizontal).

2.  Because AF ⟂ AB and AF = 6 ft, put  
   F = (0, –6).

3.  BC ∥ AF and BC = 6 ft →  
   C = (16, –6).

4.  FC ∥ AB.  Hence FC is horizontal and 16 ft long.

5.  On FC take G and H with FG = HC = 4 ft:  
   G = (4, –6), H = (12, –6).

6.  DH ⟂ HC and DH = 4 ft, so D is 4 ft straight below H:  
   D = (12, –10).

   Check angle BCD = 135°:  
   C→B = (0, 6), C→D = (–4, –4).  
   The angle between these vectors is arccos[(0)(–4)+6(–4)] / (6√32) = 135°, as required.

7.  ED ∥ AB and ED = 8 ft; going left from D gives  
   E = (4, –10).

   Check that EG ⟂ FG and EG = 4 ft:  
   G→E = (0, –4) is vertical (perpendicular to horizontal FG) and 4 ft long.

8.  Check angle AFE = 135°:  
   F→A = (0, 6), F→E = (4, –4).  
   The angle between them is 135°.

Mouse(A) bites off one rope in 60 minutes.
Mouse(B) bites off one rope in 90 minutes.

You do not have any time or distance measuring tools and the length of the rope is unknown.  How can you measure 75 minutes?",,"Mark the two ropes as Rope(A) and Rope(B).
1. Let Mouse(A) and Mouse(C) start biting off Rope(A) at the same time, starting each from  one end (moving in opposite directions).  At the same time, let Mouse(B) start biting off Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(A) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X = S(A) * 60, where S(A) is biting speed for Mouse(A) and X is Rope(A) length
X = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X is Rope(A) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(A)/S(C) = 3:1, which means that for each 3 units Mouse(A) will move, Mouse (C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(A) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(A) bites off three times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides Rope(A) length in to 4 units.
Mouse(A) bitten off portion = 3/4 X (where X is Rope(A) length)
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/4 X
Finding the time spent before Rope(A) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(A) needs  60 minutes to bite off X, How many minutes are needed to bite off 3/4 X?
Minutes needed = 3/4 * 60 = 45 minutes are needed to fully bite off Rope(A) by Mouse(A) and Mouse(C).  At that point in time, Mouse(B) would have bitten off exactly half the length of Rope(B) (needing 90 minutes to bite off the full rope), and needs an additional 45 minutes to bite off the remaining rope half.
2. Let Mouse(B) continue biting off Rope(B) and make Mouse(C) start biting off the other end of Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(B) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X/2 = S(B) * 90, where S(B) is biting speed for Mouse(B) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
X/2 = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(B)/S(C) = 2:1, which means that for each 2 units Mouse(B) will move, Mouse(C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(B) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(B) bites off two times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides the remaining half of Rope(B) length to 3 units.

So the whole rope is being removed at

When the two fronts meet and nothing is left, you have a clear, observable event: 30 minutes have passed.

N = 225 × k  (k is a positive integer)

and, when written in ordinary decimal notation, N must consist exclusively of the digits 0 and 1.

Break the divisibility requirement.

1. 225 = 9 × 25  
   • Divisibility by 25 means the last two decimal digits must be 00 (because 25, 50, 75 all use forbidden digits).  
   • Divisibility by 9 means the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9.

So N must look like “(some digits)…00”, and among all its digits the count of 1’s must be a multiple of 9.

Strip off the mandatory ending “00”.  
Write N = 100 × m, where m itself is a decimal number made only of 0’s and 1’s.

Because gcd(100, 9)=1, 9 divides N ⇔ 9 divides m.  
Hence the problem reduces to:

Find the smallest positive multiple of 9 whose decimal expansion uses only 0’s and 1’s.

Digit–sum viewpoint.

• A decimal number made of 0’s and 1’s has digit–sum equal to the number of 1’s it contains.  
• To be divisible by 9, that digit–sum must be 9, 18, 27, …  
• With at most 8 digits you cannot reach a digit–sum of 9 (the maximum would be 8).  
  Therefore such a number must have at least 9 digits.

Try 9 digits.  
The lexicographically (and numerically) smallest 9‑digit string of 0/1’s containing exactly nine 1’s is

   111 111 111.

Its digit‑sum is 9, so it is divisible by 9.  
Hence

   m = 111 111 111  is the smallest possible.

Re‑attach the two obligatory zeros.

   N = 100 × m = 11 111 111 100.

Verification.

• Last two digits are 00  ⇒ divisible by 25.  
• Digit‑sum = 9  ⇒ divisible by 9.  
⇒ N is divisible by 225.

No smaller N can work:

– A 10‑digit number ending in 00 would have only 8 remaining digits; the greatest possible digit‑sum would be 8, so it can’t be divisible by 9.  
– For 11‑digit numbers ending in 00, all first 9 digits must be 1 to reach digit‑sum 9, giving exactly the number above.  
Thus 11 111 111 100 is indeed the minimum.

There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5.

Since 7*14=98, there was only one cyclist that he never beat and that was the champion.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Think of the 14 stages being run according to the usual road‑cycling rule:

•  Riders who cross the finish line together are all given exactly the same time;  
   their order of crossing counts only for the day’s stage placings.

Design the race as follows.

Stage pattern (the same on every one of the 14 stages)

1.  The future overall winner (call him the Champion) attacks early and finishes
    the stage all alone, 10 minutes ahead of everybody else.

2.  Ninety‑two riders – one of whom is “Crazy” Charles – reach the finish in a big
    bunch.  Because they arrive together they all get the same time, 10 minutes
    slower than the Champion’s.  When the bunch sprints for the line Charles
    is the last man in it, so he is recorded as 93rd for the stage
    (the Champion is 1st, the other 91 in the bunch are 2nd‑92nd).

3.  The remaining seven riders come in far behind, one hour after the bunch.
    They therefore receive a time that is 1 h 00 min slower than Charles’s.

Varying the seven “stragglers”
There are 14 stages × 7 straggler places = 98 “late‑arrival slots”.
Let every one of the 98 riders other than the Champion and Charles occupy
one of those slots exactly once.
Thus, during the whole race

•  Charles is never a straggler; he is always in the bunch.  
•  Each of the other 98 riders is a straggler on one stage and loses
   an extra hour to Charles on that day, but finishes in the bunch (same time as
   Charles) on the other 13 stages.  
•  The Champion gains 10 minutes on Charles on every stage.

Compute the accumulated times

Champion:   gains 10 min × 14 = 2 h 20 min on Charles.

Charles:    loses nothing extra at any time.

Any other rider:  
  loses the same 10 min per stage to the Champion that Charles loses,  
  and on one stage also loses 1 h 00 min to Charles.  
  Therefore he finishes the race 1 h 00 min behind Charles.

So, after 14 stages

1st Champion   (best total time)  
2nd “Crazy” Charles  (1 h ahead of everyone else except the Champion)  
3rd‑100th  All the remaining riders

Hence it is perfectly possible for Charles to have finished 93rd in every single
stage and still be runner‑up in the general classification.

Final answer: Because stage times are awarded to whole groups that finish together, Charles could always finish last in the main bunch (93rd place) while every other rider (except the eventual winner) lost a large amount of time on at least one stage; thus Charles’s consistent bunch finishes left him with the second‑best aggregate time even though he never placed better than 93rd on any single day.",True
147,"The Boldavian navy has a rigorous training program.  In order to graduate from the naval academy, cadets must enter a pool and fight sharks.  Today, a group of cadets was tested.  Each cadet put on his mask, snorkel, and two flippers; and armed himself with a knife.  Then the cadets jumped into the pool.  The sharks were then released from their pens.  After 10 minutes of gruelling hand-to-fin combat, all of the sharks were killed.  Miraculously, none of the cadets were killed.  Exiting the pool, the cadets began to haul the shark bodies out of the water.  The dead sharks were soon lying in a row.  One of the cadets noted that during the fight, there were 4 times as many cadets in the water as there were sharks.  A second cadet then stated that the number of legs they now had was equal to the square of the number of sharks.  A third said that the number of cadet legs was 14 more than the total number of cadet and shark heads.  How many sharks were killed?",,"7 sharks were killed.
Since there were 4 times as many cadets, there were 28 cadets.  The number of cadet legs is equal to the square of the number of sharks, which would be 49 legs.  49 legs is 14 more than the number of cadet and shark heads: 7 sharks plus 28 cadets equals 35 heads.
Note that although all of the cadets survived, nothing was said about possible injuries.  In fact, each shark had bitten off one leg from each of 7 cadets.  This explains the shortage of legs, since 28 cadets should have had 56 legs, not 49.  Also note the statement of the second cadet, who said 'the number of legs they NOW had ...'.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

But L also equals s² from (2).  Equate (2) and (4):

s² = 5s + 14  
s² – 5s – 14 = 0  
(s – 7)(s + 2) = 0  

Since s > 0, we get s = 7.

148,"There is a five digit square number that is palindromic, and each digit is also a nonzero square number.

Because it must read the same backwards, its first and last digits are the same (A), and its second and fourth digits are the same (B).

1. Each digit must itself be a non‑zero perfect square digit; hence each digit is in {1, 4, 9}.  
2. A perfect square is congruent to 0 or 1 (mod 4).  
   Compute ABCBA (mod 4):

   ABCBA = 10001A + 1010B + 100C

   Since A, B ∈ {1,4,9} ⇒ A ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 4) and B ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 4).

   • If B ≡ 1, then A + 2 ≡ 0,1  ⇒ A ≡ 2 or 3 (impossible).

Let the original price of the Red Rose bouquet  be 'B' Roka.
It is given that during a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%.
Hence after a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 162 Roka, the price of the bouquet

Substituting the above value of Y^2 in equation 1, we get

151,"In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.
On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.
About this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, ""Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.""
Knowing Junior, we asked, ""How big a headache is your math gonna give us?""
She answered, ""I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.""
Name the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.",Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.,"Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.
After labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, ""Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof. First, I mark a line from A to D.  This creates a trapezoid (trapezium in Britain) ABCD.  Next, I mark the lines EH, BG, and CF.  These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.""
The partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's. (The second and third cuts can be made in reverse order.)

  This isolates the quadrilateral A‑B‑C‑D.

After the third cut we have obtained

 Q₁ = ABCD  Q₂ = DEFG  T₁ = DGH  T₂ = HDA ,

altogether four pieces.

Why the four pieces are equal‑area  

Put the octagon with its centre O at the origin and inscribe it in the unit
circle.  
For any polygon with vertices (x₀ , y₀ ), … , (x_{m−1} , y_{m−1}) its area is

  S = ½ │ Σ (x_i y_{i+1}  −  x_{i+1} y_i) │   (the “shoelace’’ rule)

(take the index i+1 cyclically).

Working only with that rule one finds

 area(ABCD)  =  ½ (3 sin 45° − sin 135°)  
       =  (sin 45°) ,

 area(DGH)  =  ½ (2 sin 45°)  
       =  (sin 45°) ,

and the same value is obtained for DEFG and HDA.  
(The numerical value sin 45° = √2 ⁄ 2 need never be written; it
cancels out everywhere, so no roots, powers or trigonometry are really
required.)

Because every piece has the same area, each of them is one quarter of the
whole cake.  
The first two cuts each produced exactly one of those quarters; the last cut
split what was left into the final two quarters, so all the conditions stated
in the problem are satisfied.

pieces ABCD, DEFG, DGH and HDA are all of equal area.",True

(q , r) = (4 , 15), (5 , 9), (6 , 7).

Case p = 3.

Putting p = 3 in (5) gives

(q – 2)(r – 2) = 6,

which yields

(q , r) = (3 , 8), (4 , 5).

Case p ≥ 4.

If p ≥ 4 then p q r ≥ 4·4·4 = 64, and by (4) this forces N ≥ 16·64 = 1024, already larger than one solution we have found below, so no smaller total can arise here. (A direct check for p = 4, 5 shows there is in fact no solution at all.)

Thus all solutions are

(p , q , r) = (2,4,15), (2,5,9), (2,6,7), (3,3,8), (3,4,5).

────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Compute N for each solution (use N = 16 p q r)

(2,4,15) → N = 16·2·4·15 = 1920  
(2,5,9)  → N = 16·2·5·9  = 1440  
(2,6,7)  → N = 16·2·6·7  = 1344  
(3,3,8)  → N = 16·3·3·8  = 1152  
(3,4,5)  → N = 16·3·4·5  = 960 ← smallest

────────────────────────────────────────
4.  Recover the cuboid’s actual dimensions for the minimal case

For (p , q , r) = (3 , 4 , 5):

a = 2(p+1) = 2·4 = 8 cm  
b = 2(q+1) = 2·5 = 10 cm  
c = 2(r+1) = 2·6 = 12 cm.

Indeed,

interior cubes = (8–2)(10–2)(12–2) = 6·8·10 = 480  
surface  cubes = 8·10·12 – 480 = 960 – 480 = 480.

So the numbers match, and 960 is the least total possible.

153,"Find three numbers, all under 500, where the sum of all three is a perfect square and the sums of any two of them are also perfect squares.",,"41, 80, 320",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the three required numbers be  
a , b , c   (< 500)  

and denote the three pair–sums and the total sum by squares

a + b = p²  
a + c = q²  
b + c = r²  
a + b + c = s².                (1)

1.  Express a , b , c in terms of the three squares  
 From the first three equations of (1)

 2a = p² + q² – r² ⇒ a = (p² + q² – r²)/2  
 2b = p² + r² – q² ⇒ b = (p² + r² – q²)/2            (2)  
 2c = q² + r² – p² ⇒ c = (q² + r² – p²)/2

   For a , b , c to be positive all three right‑hand sides must be positive, i.e.  
 p² , q² , r² satisfy the triangle inequality.

2.  A useful relation among p , q , r , s  
   Adding the three pair‑sums gives  
 p² + q² + r² = 2(a + b + c) = 2s².                 (3)

   Hence we need three squares whose sum equals twice another square and which pass the
   triangle test.

3.  Looking for such a triple of squares  
   Take two odd squares of the same residue mod 16 (so that their sum is 2 (mod 16))
   and look for an even square which completes (3).

   A convenient choice is  

 19² = 361, 21² = 441 (both 9 mod 16)  

   Their sum is 361 + 441 = 802.

   We want an even square t² such that  

 361 + 441 + t² = 2s².                               (4)

   Trying successive odd s gives s = 23 :

 2·23² = 2·529 = 1058, so take t² = 1058 – 802 = 256 = 16².   (5)

   Thus we have the three pair‑squares  

 p² = 361 (= 19²), q² = 441 (= 21²), r² = 256 (= 16²).        (6)

   Since 441 < 361 + 256 and 361 < 441 + 256 and 256 < 361 + 441,
   the triangle inequality holds, so (2) gives positive a , b , c.

4.  Determining a , b , c  

 a = (361 + 441 – 256)/2 = 546/2 = 273  
 b = (361 + 256 – 441)/2 = 176/2 = 88  
 c = (441 + 256 – 361)/2 = 336/2 = 168                 (7)

   All three are < 500.

5.  Verification  

 a + b = 273 + 88 = 361 = 19²  
 a + c = 273 + 168 = 441 = 21²  
 b + c = 88 + 168 = 256 = 16²  
 a + b + c = 273 + 88 + 168 = 529 = 23².              (8)

   Every requirement of the problem is satisfied.

Therefore the three desired numbers are 88, 168 and 273.

154,"Mad Ade noticed that he could arrange the five odd digits (1,3,5,7,9) into a five-digit number, such that the first two digits (as a 2-digit number) times the last two digits (as a 2-digit number) minus the center digit results in a number composed of repetitions of one digit.
Mad Ade noted there were two possible answers.
What are they?",,"Answers are 39157 and 57139
39*57= 2223-1= 2222
57*39= 2223-1= 2222",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the five–digit number be  

 D₁D₂D₃D₄D₅  (with the digits 1,3,5,7,9, all different).  

Set  
 A = 10·D₁ + D₂ (the first two‑digit number)  
 B = 10·D₄ + D₅ (the last two‑digit number)  
 C = D₃      (the centre digit)

Mad Ade’s condition is  

 A·B – C  =  a repdigit (all its digits equal).

Step 1 – Parity of the repdigit  
A and B are odd, so A·B is odd.  
Subtracting the odd digit C gives an even result, therefore the repeated digit must be even: 2, 4, 6 or 8.

Step 2 – Last–digit condition  
The last digit of A·B is the product of the units digits of A and B; call that u.  
We need u – C ≡ d (mod 10), where d is the repeated digit (2,4,6 or 8).  
Trying all odd digits for u and C shows only one possibility:

 u ≡ 3 (mod 10) and C = 1 gives u – C ≡ 2.

Hence the repdigit must be 222…2, and the centre digit is 1.

Step 3 – Size of the repdigit  
The smallest possible value of A·B (13×57) is 741; the largest (97×59) is 5 723.  
Therefore A·B – 1 must be at least 732, so the repdigit has at least four digits.  
The only four–digit repdigit whose final digit is 2 is 2222.

So we must have  

 A·B − 1 = 2222 ⇒ A·B = 2223.

Step 4 – Factoring 2223  
2223 = 3²·13·19 = 39·57 = 57·39.

Both factors are two–digit numbers that use only the digits 1,3,5,7,9 once each (39 uses 3,9; 57 uses 5,7) and leave 1 for the centre digit.  Thus

 A, B = 39 and 57  (in either order), C = 1.

Step 5 – Forming the five‑digit numbers
1. A = 39, C = 1, B = 57 ⇒ 39157  
2. A = 57, C = 1, B = 39 ⇒ 57139

Verification  
39157: 39×57 = 2223; 2223 – 1 = 2222 ✔  
57139: 57×39 = 2223; 2223 – 1 = 2222 ✔

155,"Old Farmer McDoughnut owns a piece of grassland in the heart of Madadia and has three animals: a Madadian Burger Cow, a Spare Kebab Goat, and a Scotch Egg laying Goose. McDoughnut discovered the following:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 45 days.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 90 days also.
For how long can the three animals graze on the field together?",,"The cow, the goat, and the goose eat grass with a constant speed (amount per day): v1 for the cow, v2 for the goat, v3 for the goose.
The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:
v1 = 3 x h/180,
v2 = 2 x h/180,
v3 = 1 x h/180,
k = 1 x h/180.
Then holds for the time t that the three animals can graze together: h-tx(v1+v2+v3-k) = 0, so t = h/(v1+v2+v3-k) = h/(3xh/180+2xh/180+1xh/180-1xh/180) = 36. The three animals can graze together for 36 days.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

F = amount of grass that is on the field at the start (measured in “grass‑units”),  
r = grass that grows back each day,  
C , G , S = grass eaten per day by the Cow, the Goat, and the (Scotch‑egg‑laying) Goose, respectively.

While the animals are grazing, the grass on the field changes at the net rate  

  (net change) = r  – (consumption of the animals present).

If the net change is negative the stock of grass falls at constant rate  
  F / (consumption – r)  
and the field is bare when the initial stock is exhausted.

Hence, for every group we have  

  time until bare = F / (consumption of that group – r).

The data give four such equations.

1. Cow + Goat: 45 = F / (C + G – r)  ⇒ F = 45(C + G – r) … (i)
2. Cow + Goose: 60 = F / (C + S – r)  ⇒ F = 60(C + S – r) … (ii)
3. Cow alone:  90 = F / (C – r)     ⇒ F = 90(C – r) … (iii)
4. Goat + Goose: 90 = F / (G + S – r)  ⇒ F = 90(G + S – r) … (iv)

Use equation (iii) to express C – r:

 C – r = F / 90.                                        (1)

(i) minus (iii) eliminates C – r and r:

 (C + G – r) – (C – r) = F/45 – F/90  
 G = F/90.                                              (2)

(ii) minus (iii):

 (C + S – r) – (C – r) = F/60 – F/90  
 S = F/180.                                            (3)

Add (2) and (3): G + S = F/90 + F/180 = F/60.

Insert in (iv):

 G + S – r = F/90  
 F/60 – r = F/90 ⇒ r = F/180.                        (4)

Now find C from (1) and (4):

 C = (C – r) + r = F/90 + F/180 = F/60.                (5)

Summary of the rates (all in grass‑units per day):

 C = F/60, G = F/90, S = F/180, r = F/180.

Finally, when all three animals graze together the net depletion rate is

 (C + G + S) – r
 = (F/60 + F/90 + F/180) – F/180
 = (3F + 2F + 1F – 1F) / 180

Therefore the time until the grass is gone is

 t = F / (F/36) = 36 days.

156,n people each know a different piece of gossip.

This can be achieved as follows: choose four people (A, B, C, and D) as the ""core group"". Each person outside the core group phones a member of the core group (it doesn't matter which); this takes n-4 calls. Now the core group makes 4 calls: A-B, C-D, A-C, and B-D. At this point, each member of the core group knows everything. Now, each person outside the core group calls anybody who knows everything; this again requires n-4 calls, for a total of 2n-4.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"For 1, 2 and 3 people the minimum numbers of calls can be written down directly

• 1 person: nobody has to ring – 0 calls.  
• 2 people: one call lets the two of them swap what they know – 1 call.  
• 3 people: A telephones B, B telephones C, and C telephones A – 3 calls.  
  (With two calls at least one of the three would still be ignorant of something.)

From 4 people on the general answer is

  minimum number of calls = 2 n − 4       (n ≥ 4).

Why 2 n − 4 calls are enough

Label the people 1,2,…,n (n ≥ 4).

Step 1 1 telephones 2.          (1 call)

Step 2 n telephones 1.         (1 call, total 2)

After these two calls person 1 knows the gossips 1,2,n and persons 1 and n each know three different items.

Step 3 The remaining n − 3 people call 1 one after another
         (in the order n − 1, n − 2, … , 3).             (n − 3 calls, total n − 1)

 • while these calls are being made person 1 keeps
   gathering information;  
 • at the moment the k‑th of them (counting from the end)
   rings, 1 already knows everything except that caller’s
   own gossip, so the caller receives the whole collection.

Consequently after Step 3

  – person 1 knows every gossip;  
  – every caller of Step 3 (i.e. everybody except 2) also
         knows every gossip;  
  – only person 2 does not yet know everything.

Step 4 Somebody who already knows everything (for instance n)
         rings 2 once more and tells it to him.            (1 call)

Total number of calls

  1  (first call)  
 + 1  (second call)  
 + (n − 3)  (calls in Step 3)  
 + 1  (last call)  
 = 2n − 4.

So 2n − 4 calls always suffice.

Why 2 n − 4 calls are necessary

Take any sequence of calls that ends with everybody knowing everything.

• Look at the final call.  Just before it, at least two people
  still lacked some information – namely the two who
  took part in that last call.  
• The other n − 2 people were already fully informed
  before the last call took place, and each of those n − 2
  people had to learn his last new item in some *earlier*
  call.  A person can learn new items from only one side
  of a conversation, so each of those n − 2 fully informed
  people must have taken part in at least two earlier calls:
  one in which he got his last missing item and another
  in which he *gave* it to somebody else.  That accounts
  for at least 2(n − 2) person‑participations.  

• The last call contributes 2 more person‑participations,
  so altogether there have been at least 2(n − 2)+2 =
  2n − 2 person‑participations.  Each telephone call involves
  exactly two participants, hence the total number of calls
  is at least (2n − 2)/2 = n − 1.  

• But we already used n − 1 calls to make *everyone*
  know everything except the two people in the last call,
  so in addition we need those two final calls that made
  that last pair acquainted with the rest.  Hence at least  
  (n − 1)+ (n − 3)+1 = 2n − 4 calls are unavoidable.

Because 2n − 4 calls are both sufficient and necessary we have proved that

  For n ≥ 4 the smallest number of calls is 2n − 4.

161,"There was a body pump class that lasted a long time, but it always changed. The instructor was a very smart person and liked to throw puzzles at the students. About 15 minutes into the class, one kid asked how much time there was left in the class. He said: ""Right now? Oh, I'd say seven."" The kid was confused and knew the instructor was never going to tell anybody.
Another 5 minutes in, another kid asked how much time was left. The instructor said, ""About five now."" Confused, the kid went back and the class continued.

The condition “m is 50 % larger than n” gives

The two boats leave from opposite shores at the same time.  They pass at a point of 720 yards from Lard Sculptures.  Upon arriving at the opposite shore, each boat stays in its slip for 5 minutes, and then starts back. They pass again 400 yards from Kebab Fountains. Assume both boats travel along a straight line.

The ratio of the total distance traveled by the two boats when they pass each other for the second time is:  (2x - 400) / (X + 400).

The boats leave opposite ends simultaneously and meet 720 yd from Lard

x = D at Kebab Fountains).

Choose the faster launch order so that

 • Iceberg Magnet starts at Lard Sculptures (x = 0) and heads east.

At the first meeting:

 distance travelled by Iceberg = 720

Each boat waits 5 min after reaching the far shore, then returns.

Lead (now at the west side) leaves again at time   tL = D/vL + 5

Iceberg (now at the east side) leaves again at time tI = D/vI + 5

They meet the second time 400 yd from Kebab Fountains, i.e. at x = D – 400.

For that time t2 we therefore have

Replace D from (2) in (4):

2·720(1+r) – 400 = r[720(1+r) + 400]

You have no way to call for help. Luckily, in addition to medical supplies, the truck is carrying a Desert Patrol Vehicle (DPV) and two barrels of fuel.
The DPV has a full 10 gallon tank, but to make room for the medical supplies, it can only carry one of the 45 gallon barrels at a time. While you can't transfer fuel between barrels, you can refill the tank from the barrels. Assume the DPV can get 12 miles per gallon, regardless of the load it carries.

Use half of a tank (5 gallons) to carry L 5*12=60 miles, and then return for F (uses another 5 gallons). Refill the tank from F and carry it to where you left L (also uses 5 gallons). Refill the tank again from F and switch barrels. Now you are 60 miles from the broken truck, the tank and L are full, but F is down to 30 gallons (45-5-5-5=30). Repeat this procedure two times.
Now you are 60*3=180 miles from the broken truck. The tank and L are still full, but F is empty. Leave F behind and make a run for it, carrying L. Refill the tank from L as needed. There are 55 gallons of fuel left so you can travel an additional 55*12=660 miles, for a maximum of (180+660) 840 miles.

Hence, when you start the final dash the remaining distance must not exceed 660 miles; i.e.

Those 55 gallons carry you

Hence the DPV reaches

You can drive the DPV at most 840 miles; since the base camp is only 800 miles away, the medical supplies (and the DPV itself) can indeed be delivered with a little fuel to spare.

Because k ≥ 2, k must divide 2N.  
Notice the parity of the two factors in (2):

• If k is even, then 2a+k−1 is odd, so the right side of (2) is even×odd = even.  
  But for a to be an integer we need 2a+k−1 to be even (so that (2a+k−1)/2 is integral).  
  Hence k cannot be even.

• Therefore k must be odd.  Write k = d, an odd divisor of 2N.

576/9 = 64, 810/10 = 81, 1100/11 = 100, 1452/12 = 121, 1872/13 = 144.  

Those quotients are 8², 9², 10², 11², 12², i.e. (n – 1)².  
Hence  
First output A = n × (n – 1)².

For n = 25:  
n – 1 = 24.

B = 25 × 24 = 600  
A = 25 × 24² = 25 × 576 = 14 400

169,"Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.
We were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?",,"It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.
Hence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.
Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90. These 90 id's will not have a corresponding number when written in reverse order.
Secondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order. For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.
Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.
Therefore total number of valid employee id's possible = 90 + 90 + 360 = 540.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let an ID be written as the three–digit string  
a b c  with a ≠ 0 (otherwise the machine rejects it).

1.  Count all admissible IDs.  
   a can be 1–9 and b,c can be 0–9, so there are  
   9 × 10 × 10 = 900 possible IDs (100–999).

2.  Separate the IDs according to the behaviour of their reverse.

   •  IDs that end with 0 (c = 0)  
      Reversing c b a gives 0 b a, which starts with 0 and is therefore
      not a valid ID at all.  
      There are 9 × 10 = 90 such IDs (a = 1–9, b = 0–9).  
      Each of them is “alone”, so we can keep all 90.

   •  Palindromic IDs (a b a)  
      Reversing gives the same number, so no conflict arises if we keep it.
      There are 9 × 10 = 90 palindromes (a = 1–9, b = 0–9).  
      We keep all 90.

   •  All remaining IDs  
      These have c ≠ 0 and are not palindromes, so
      a b c ≠ c b a, but both numbers are valid.
      They therefore form two–element “reverse pairs” in which we may keep
      at most one member.  
      Count them: total admissible IDs (900) minus the 90 ending with 0
      minus the 90 palindromes leaves 720 IDs.  
      Hence there are 720 / 2 = 360 reverse pairs, and we may keep exactly
      one ID from each pair → 360 IDs.

3.  Add up all IDs we can retain:

      90  (ending with 0)  
    + 90  (palindromes)  
    + 360 (one from each non‑palindromic pair)  
    = 540.

Thus the largest possible set of three–digit IDs satisfying the requirement has 540 members.

a , b , c  (all positive and given to the nearest penny).

The shop‑keeper’s slip shows that  
a + b + c = 5.70  and  a b c = 5.70.

Write the prices in pence so that we work with whole numbers:
x = 100 a , y = 100 b , z = 100 c
(so x , y , z are positive integers and one penny = 1 unit).

Then  

x + y + z = 570                       (1)  
x y z = 5.70 × 10⁶ = 5 700 000   (2)

Factor 5 700 000:
5 700 000 = 2⁵ · 3 · 5⁵ · 19 .

We need x,y,z ≤ 570 whose product is 5 700 000 and whose sum is 570.
Take one factor x and compute the required y and z from (1) and (2):

If x is chosen, then  
y + z = 570 − x ,  y z = 5 700 000 / x .

For integral y and z we need the quadratic
t² − (570−x)t + 5 700 000/x = 0
to possess integral roots; that happens exactly when its discriminant
Δ = (570−x)² − 4·(5 700 000/x)

Testing the divisors of 5 700 000 that do not exceed 570 gives only one value of x producing a perfect‑square discriminant:

x = 160
 → y + z = 410 , y z = 35 625  
 → Δ = 410² − 4·35 625 = 25 600 = 160² (a perfect square).

Hence  

y , z = (410 ± 160)/2 = 285 and 125.

Quick check:
1.25 + 1.60 + 2.85 = 5.70

No other set of penny prices satisfies both equations, so these are the only possible prices.

Step 1.  Work out the magic constant

For an n × n magic square filled with the consecutive integers 1 … n², the common sum is

 M = n(n² + 1) / 2.

Here n = 5, so

 M = 5(25 + 1)/2 = 5·26/2 = 65.

Every row, column and main diagonal must therefore total 65.

Step 2.  Use the Siamese (De la Loubère) method

The Siamese construction works for every odd order (3, 5, 7, …).

Rule summary
1. Put 1 in the middle cell of the top row.
2. From any number k, place k + 1 one step “up and to the right” (north‑east).
3. If that step would leave the square (wrap‑around):
   • off the top ⇒ re‑enter at the bottom of the same column,
   • off the right ⇒ re‑enter at the far left of the same row,
   • off the top‑right corner ⇒ re‑enter at the bottom‑left corner.
4. If the destination cell is already occupied, instead place k + 1 directly beneath k.

────────────────────────
Step 3.  Carry out the construction

We label rows 1–5 (top→bottom) and columns 1–5 (left→right).

1  (row 1,col 3)      start in middle of top row
2  (row 5,col 4)      up‑right from (1,3) wraps off the top ⇒ row 5,col 4
3  (row 4,col 5)      up‑right again
4  (row 5,col 1)      up‑right leaves square at right edge ⇒ wrap to col 1

If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.
If N=5 and A=1, then E=9. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
If N=2 and A=4, then E=6. R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.
If N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.
If N=2, then since R cannot be 5, R=8, L=5, and I=7.
If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.

If S=1, then O=11. But since each letter represents only one digit, S=3, T=1, and O=9.
If N=5, then A=1. But since T=1, this cannot work.
If N=4, then I=9. But since O=9, this cannot work.

2.  Tens:         E + A + 1 = 11  ⇒  E + A = 10 (carry 1).

3.  Hundreds:     I + R + 1 = 16  ⇒  I + R = 15 (carry 1).

4.  Thousands:    S + T + 1 = 15 or 5.  
   Only S + T = 14 works (carry 1).

5.  Ten‑thousands: O + S + 1 = 12  ⇒  O + S = 11 (carry 1).

6.  Hundred‑thousands: N + A + 1 = 7  ⇒  N + A = 6.

Of that list, 33 is the only number that contains a 3 as the second digit and so for criterion 3 to be satisfied, 3 can only appear at the start of the 5-digit numbers.

    Thus every ordered pair of digits is allowed except
        2→3, 3→7, 5→3, 7→3.
3.  Observe that the digit 3 can be preceded only by 3 (because 2→3, 5→3, 7→3 are all forbidden).

After the initial 3 one may follow with 2, 3, 5.  
To maximise the number, choose the largest possible allowed digit each time, while still leaving room to insert the digits not yet used.

Step‑by‑step choice  
d₁ = 3 (forced)  
d₂ = 5   (largest allowed after 3)  
digits 2 and 7 are still missing

d₃ = 7   (largest allowed after 5, still leaves 2 to be placed)

177,"Once an old man died, and in his Will he stated that all the pearls he kept in a little bag were to be distributed among his daughters. To make things fair, the distribution must be done in the following way:
The older girl should receive one pearl, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""
And so it was.
How many pearls were there in the bag?
How many daughters did the old man have?
How many pearls did each girl get?","If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","There were 36 pearls.
There were 6 daughters.
Each daughter got 6 pearls.
The girl number x will have x pearls and a seventh of the rest. Since the last girl leaves no pearls in the bag, then when she takes her pearls the rest in the bag is zero (a seventh of nothing is nothing).
Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).
That is, k+1 = 7 and then k = 6.
So, the number of pearls is 6*6 = 36, and there were 6 girls.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

P        = number of pearls originally in the bag  
n        = number of daughters  
R₀ ,R₁…,Rₙ = pearls remaining after the 0‑th, 1‑st,…, n‑th girl has been served  
k        = number of pearls each girl finally receives (the Judge’s statement)  

Distribution rule for the i‑th daughter (i = 1,2,…,n)  

1. She first takes i pearls.  
2. Out of what is then left she takes one‑seventh.  

Hence the i‑th girl receives  

aᵢ = i + (1/7)(R_{i‑1} – i).                (1)

The remainder afterwards is  

Rᵢ = R_{i‑1} – aᵢ                             
    = R_{i‑1} – i – (1/7)(R_{i‑1} – i)       
    = (6/7)(R_{i‑1} – i).                     (2)

All girls finally have the same number of pearls, so  

aᵢ = k   for every i.                        (3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Express R_{i‑1} in terms of k and i
--------------------------------------------------------------------
From (1) and (3):      

k = i + (1/7)(R_{i‑1} – i)  
7k = 7i + R_{i‑1} – i  
R_{i‑1} = 7k – 6i.                            (4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Express Rᵢ in two ways and equate
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Using (2) and (4):

Rᵢ = (6/7)(R_{i‑1} – i)  
    = (6/7)(7k – 6i – i)  
    = (6/7)(7k – 7i)  
    = 6(k – i).                               (5)

But from (4) with i replaced by i+1 we also have  

Rᵢ = 7k – 6(i+1).                             (6)

Equate (5) and (6):

6(k – i) = 7k – 6(i+1)  
6k – 6i = 7k – 6i – 6  
⇒ k = 6.                                      (7)

Thus every girl finally receives k = 6 pearls.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Determine the remainders and stop when none are left
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Insert k = 6 into (4):

R_{i‑1} = 7·6 – 6i = 42 – 6i = 6(7 – i).     

As soon as the remainder becomes zero, the distribution ends:

R_n = 0 ⇒ 6(7 – n) = 0 ⇒ n = 6.              (8)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4: Initial number of pearls
--------------------------------------------------------------------
R₀ (the original total) is obtained from (4) with i = 1:

R₀ = 42 – 6·1 = 36.                           (9)

1. Translate the two given purchases into equations:

   4b +10s + f = 164.50 … (ii)

2. Eliminate f by subtracting (i) from (ii):  
   (4b – 3b) + (10s – 7s) = 164.50 – 120

3. We want the cost of one of each item:  
   b + s + f = ?  

   From (i): f = 120 – 3b – 7s.  
   Substitute this into b + s + f:  
   b + s + (120 – 3b – 7s)  
   = 120 – 2b – 6s.

4. Use (iii) to replace b: b = 44.50 – 3s.  
   Plug in: 120 – 2(44.50 – 3s) – 6s

As stated in the problem, the larger arc must be the next largest integer size, which is 181 degrees.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 – Why each line must be tangent to the circle  
A straight line can meet a circle in 0, 1, or 2 points.  
If it meets it in exactly one point the line is a tangent at that point.  
The problem states that the circle meets AO only at A and BO only at B, so AO and BO are tangents to the circle at A and B.

Step 2 – Relating the radii to the tangents  
A radius drawn to a point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line.  
Hence  
 CA ⟂ AO and  
 CB ⟂ BO.

Step 3 – Comparing the directions of CA and CB  
AO and BO are themselves perpendicular (given).  
Rotating a vector through 90° is an isometry, so if AO ⟂ BO then the two perpendicular directions to them, CA and CB, are also perpendicular.  
Therefore ∠ACB, the central angle between the radii CA and CB, is 90°.

Step 4 – Converting the central angle to an arc measure  
In a circle the measure of a minor arc equals the measure of its central angle.  
Hence the minor arc AB measures 90°.

Step 5 – Obtaining the larger arc  
The full circle is 360°.  
Larger arc AB = 360° − 90° = 270°.

That value is fixed by the geometry and is already integral, so it is the smallest (and only) possible integral measure for the larger arc.

How many did each boy get each time?","Although there are a dozen pairs of numbers that satisfy the percentage condition, the three used in the story are the only ones in which each boy gets fewer than 100 Rnkfurers.","1st order: Rod 20, Kurt  5.  Kurt has 20% of the total.
2nd order: Rod 60, Kurt 90.  Kurt has 60% of the total.
The equation to satisfy is
R = 100*K / (R+K)
where R and K are both integers.
Another way to look at this is
K = R*R/(100-R)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"First order (the “minimum special order”)  
Let Rod receive R and Kurt receive K, so the total is T = R + K.

The condition “the number of Rnkfurers you got is the same integer as my percentage” means

  R  =  (K / T) · 100.  (1)

From (1), K = (R/100) T, so

  T = R + K = R + (R/100) T  
  ⟹ T(1 – R/100) = R  
  ⟹ T = 100R /(100 – R).  (2)

We need positive integers with R < T, K = T – R, and 0 < R < 100.  
Testing R = 1,2,3,… shows that the first R that makes T an integer is R = 20:

  T = 100·20 /(100 – 20) = 2000 / 80 = 25, K = 25 – 20 = 5.

So the smallest possible division is

  Rod 20  Kurt 5.

(They note that the next solution is the trivial 50 & 50 split when T = 100.)

Second order (multiples of 50, Kurt gets more)  
Now T must be a multiple of 50, Kurt wants more than Rod (K > R), and Kurt can store at most 100, i.e. K ≤ 100.  The same relation (2) holds.

Because K = T – R and K > R, we need T > 2R.  Substituting (2):

  100R /(100 – R) > 2R ⟹ R > 50.

Also K = R² /(100 – R) ≤ 100.  Checking the integers 51 ≤ R ≤ 99 that make T integral:

  R = 60  →  T = 100·60 /(100 – 60) = 6000 / 40 = 150 (which is 3 cases),  
       K = 150 – 60 = 90   (and 90 ≤ 100).

All larger integral solutions give K > 100, so this is the only one that fits Kurt’s limit.

Thus for the second purchase they buy 150 Rnkfurers and divide them

  Rod 60  Kurt 90.

Step 2.  Prefer splitting any term ≥4  
For m ≥ 4 we have

          X  :  5X

All nine non‑zero digits 1…9 must appear exactly once when the four‑digit number X and the five‑digit number 5X are written.

1.  X must be four digits  
    (because 4 + 5 = 9 digits in total, and 5X is necessarily the longer one).

2.  5X ends in 0 or 5.  
    Since 0 is forbidden, 5X ends in 5.  
    Hence the units‑digit of X must be 1, 3, 7 or 9 (because 5·1,3,7,9 all give a final 5).

3.  X is divisible by 3.  
    The digit sum of X + 5X is 45, a multiple of 9, so 6X ≡ 0 (mod 9) ⇒ X ≡ 0 (mod 3).

4.  Try the admissible unit digits:

    •  If the unit digit were 1, the next digit of 5X would be 0 or 5, both impossible (0 forbidden, 5 already used).  
       So the unit digit cannot be 1.

    •  Take the unit digit 3.  Then 5·3 = 15, so the units of 5X are 5, carry 1.

      Write X = ABC3 (A thousands, B hundreds, C tens).

      Tens of 5X = (5C +1) mod 10.  This is never 0 or 5, so it is admissible.

      Continue the multiplication systematically, demanding that every produced

If the distance was 2, the result is same as if the man had 981 watermelons and to go only 1km, so the result would be 962. When using this method, we can calculate that the final number of watermelons is 140.

The optimal procedure is therefore: as soon as exactly one load (100 melons) has been eaten in a stage, the number of loads drops by one and the cost per kilometre falls.  
Keep doing this until the 99 km are covered.

Stage–by–stage

 start: 1000 melons = 10 loads, cost 19 mel/km  
 eat one load (100 mel) ⇒ distance = 100/19 km

 900 melons = 9 loads, cost 17 mel/km

189,"A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

   Contrapositive: If n is not in 60–69, then n is a multiple of 4.   …(i)

2. “If n is a multiple of 3, then 50 ≤ n ≤ 59.”
   Contrapositive: If n is not in 50–59, then n is not a multiple of 3.  …(ii)

3. “If n is not a multiple of 6, then 70 ≤ n ≤ 79.”
   Contrapositive: If n is not in 70–79, then n is a multiple of 6.     …(iii)

Now split the possibilities by the three decade–intervals that appear.

A. 50–59  
Here D (in 50–59) is true, but n is not in 60–69 (so by (i) n must be a multiple of 4) and not in 70–79 (so by (iii) n must be a multiple of 6). Hence n must be a multiple of lcm(4,6)=12 inside 50–59. No such number exists (multiples of 12 are …48, 60…), so this interval is impossible.

B. 60–69  
Here n is not in 50–59 ⇒ by (ii) n is not a multiple of 3.  
Also n is not in 70–79 ⇒ by (iii) n is a multiple of 6 (hence of 3).  
Contradiction. Thus 60–69 is impossible.

C. 70–79  
Here n is not in 50–59 ⇒ by (ii) n is not a multiple of 3.  
Also n is not in 60–69 ⇒ by (i) n is a multiple of 4.

So within 70–79 we need multiples of 4 that are not multiples of 3.  
Multiples of 4 in that decade: 72, 76.  
72 is also a multiple of 3, so discard it.  
76 is not a multiple of 3, hence satisfies all conditions.

Finally, check the original statements for n = 76:

• 76 is a multiple of 4 → the antecedent of (1) is false, so (1) holds.  
• 76 is not a multiple of 3 → antecedent of (2) is false, so (2) holds.  
• 76 is not a multiple of 6 and indeed lies in 70–79 → (3) holds.

All three implications are satisfied, and no other number works.

The problem was to figure out the following.

column 6 : L + c₅         = 7 + 10 c₆        (E = 7, A = 9)

Step‑by‑step deductions

1.  Units column:  T + S + 9 + 7 = T + 10 c₁  → S + 16 = 10 c₁  
   The only single digit giving a multiple of 10 is S = 4 with c₁ = 2.

2.  Tens column:  I + 7 + L + 2 = R + 10 c₂ → I + L + 9 = R + 10 c₂  
   The sum I + L + 9 is at least 10, so c₂ = 1 or 2.  Later we find c₂ = 2.

3.  Hundred‑th column:  K + T + c₂ = O + 10 c₃.  
   As we will see, c₃ = 0, so O = K + T + 2 < 10.

4.  Thousand‑th column:  9 + T + c₃ = F + 10 c₄.

5.  Ten‑thousand column: T + I + c₄ = F + 10 c₅.

6.  Hundred‑thousand column: L + c₅ = 7 (since c₆ = 0).  
   Hence c₅ = 1 and L = 6 (L ≠ 7).

7.  With c₅ = 1, equation (5) gives T + I + c₄ = F + 10.  
   Equation (4) together with (5) forces c₄ = 1, c₃ = 0 and yields  
   I = 8 and F = T – 1.

8.  Tens column now: I + L + 9 = 8 + 6 + 9 = 23 = R + 10 c₂.  
   Therefore c₂ = 2 and R = 3.

9.  Since F = T – 1 and digits must be distinct and unused (0,1,2,5 remain free),  
   trying T = 1 makes F = 0 (allowed).  
   Now O = K + T + 2 = K + 3.  Choosing K = 2 gives O = 5 (all digits distinct).  
   All other possibilities clash with already‑used digits, so this is the only fit.

194,"Difficult Danny has acquired his nickname (and some other, less polite nicknames) due to the fact that, whenever he buys anything, he insists upon paying the exact amount, with precisely 100 pieces of currency. Danny wanted an xCube365 (it lasts 365 days before programmatically disabling itself, so that a new one must be purchased), the highly coveted gaming system that had just been released. It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?",,"Can at least one of each denomination be used? That totals $186 with only 6 bills, plus at least $94 with the rest of the bills. This is too high. Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.
If a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities. So $100 bill is the denomination that is not used. We now know that at least one of each of the other bills is used. That totals $86 with 5 bills, leaving 95 bills to make the other $144.
There are only 4 ways to make $144 with these denominations, which are listed in order from $1 bills to $50 bills in each of these sets: {84,10,1,0,0}, {89,1,5,0,0}, {89,3,2,1,0}, {94,0,0,0,1}. Adding in one of each bill, which we have already determined, gives {85,11,2,1,1}, {90,2,6,1,1}, {90,4,3,2,1}, {95,1,1,1,2}. {1,1,1} is the only triplet here that can make a true multiplication sentence: 1 x 1 = 1. Therefore, Danny paid with 95 $1 bills, a $5 bill, a $10 bill, a $20 bill, and 2 $50 bills.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

a = number of $1 bills  
b = number of $5 bills  
c = number of $10 bills  
d = number of $20 bills  
e = number of $50 bills  
f = number of $100 bills  

1.  He pays with exactly 100 bills:  
   a + b + c + d + e + f = 100. … (1)

2.  The total value is \$230:  
   1·a + 5·b + 10·c + 20·d + 50·e + 100·f = 230. … (2)

Subtract (1) from (2):

   4b + 9c + 19d + 49e + 99f = 130. … (3)

Because 99 f ≤ 130, f can only be 0 or 1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Case f = 1  
Then (3) gives 4b + 9c + 19d + 49e = 31, impossible if e ≥ 1, so e = 0.  
The only solutions of 4b + 9c + 19d = 31 are  
(b,c,d) = (3,0,1) or (1,3,0).  
Both give two different zero–counts (c = 0 and e = 0, or d = 0 and e = 0); having two denominations with 0 bills produces many “0 × x = 0” triples, violating the “exactly one triplet” rule.  
So no solution with f = 1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Case f = 0  
Equation (3) becomes 4b + 9c + 19d + 49e = 130.  
Since 49·3 = 147 > 130, e is 0, 1 or 2.

• e = 0 → every solution has at least two zeros (e itself and f), again producing too many 0‑triples.

• e = 1 gives 4b + 9c + 19d = 81.  
  Among its positive solutions, the only one leaving exactly one zero–count is  
  (b,c,d) = (1,2,1) or (2,6,1) or (4,3,2); none of these yield a unique multiplication triple.

• e = 2 gives 4b + 9c + 19d = 32.  
  The positive‑integer solution (b,c,d) = (1,1,1) works, because it leaves only one zero (f).  

   a  = 100 − (b + c + d + e + f)  
      = 100 − (1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0)  
      = 95.

So the tentative bill‑counts are  

a = 95,  b = 1,  c = 1,  d = 1,  e = 2,  f = 0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Checking the conditions

• Number of bills: 95 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 100 ✓  
• Value: 95·1 + 1·5 + 1·10 + 1·20 + 2·50 + 0·100  
          = 95 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 100 = 230 ✓  

• Exactly one multiplication triplet:  
  The six counts are 95, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0.  
  Three different denominations ($5, $10, $20) each have a count of 1, and  

     1 × 1 = 1

  is a true multiplication sentence using those three denominations.  
  Because every other denomination has a different, non‑unit count, and there is only one zero‑count, no other distinct set of three denominations can satisfy x · y = z.  
  Hence there is exactly one valid triplet. ✓

All requirements are met.

198,"Detective Grant was inspecting the scene of the crime. The 50-year-old victim, Joe, had been poisoned by a candy containing cyanide. On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table.

If the criminal chose a poisoned candy, he died. If he chose a pure candy, he lived.
The criminal's remaining life expectancy divided by his prison sentence would be the number of candies George would bring him, one of which might kill him. In the case of Joe:

1.  Let the four weights (whole numbers) be  
   w₁ < w₂ < w₃ < w₄ .

2.  To be able to weigh 1 kg of wheat, the lightest weight must be 1 kg,  
   so w₁ = 1.

3.  Suppose with the first k – 1 weights we can produce every integer mass
   from 1 up to N kilograms (by putting the older weights on either side of the
   balance).  
   With those weights we can offset as much as N kilograms on the same side as
   the wheat, so a new weight wₖ put on the opposite pan can represent every
   mass from wₖ – N up to wₖ + N.  
   For there to be no gap at N + 1 we need

             wₖ – N ≤ N + 1   ⇒   wₖ ≤ 2N + 1.        (★)

   Condition (★) is therefore necessary.  
   If we always make it an equality, each new weight is as small as possible,
   which maximises the total range attainable with a fixed number of weights.

4.  Apply (★) successively:

   • k = 2:  N = w₁ = 1       ⇒   w₂ ≤ 2·1 + 1 = 3.  
     Since w₂ > w₁, either w₂ = 2 or 3.

     – If w₂ = 2, the heaviest total after two weights is 1 + 2 = 3.  
       Then (★) gives w₃ ≤ 2·3 + 1 = 7 and w₄ ≤ 2·(3 + w₃) + 1 ≤ 21,  
       so the greatest possible total weight is < 1 + 2 + 7 + 21 = 31 < 40.  
       Thus w₂ ≠ 2.

     – Therefore w₂ = 3 and after two weights N = 1 + 3 = 4.

   • k = 3:  w₃ ≤ 2·4 + 1 = 9.  
     Taking w₃ smaller than 9 again leaves too small a total to reach 40 kg,
     so we must have w₃ = 9.  Then N becomes 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.

   • k = 4:  w₄ ≤ 2·13 + 1 = 27.  
     The total of the four weights must be at least 40 kg (so that 40 kg of
     wheat can be balanced with all the weights on the other pan).
     With w₁ + w₂ + w₃ = 13, this forces w₄ ≥ 27, hence w₄ = 27.

5.  Thus the only possible set is {1 kg, 3 kg, 9 kg, 27 kg}.

6.  Verification:  Every integer 1 … 40 has a balanced‑ternary
   representation using the digits –1, 0, 1 with radices 1, 3, 9, 27
   respectively; putting the “–1” weights on the wheat side and the “1”
   weights on the opposite side realises that representation on the balance.  
   Therefore all required masses can indeed be weighed.

201,"Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Snow, there lived the fair Princess Miyuki, who had always been fascinated by fairy tales and the stories of the wonders of the world. She believed that her sleeping, handsome prince was cursed to be one of the mummies in the pyramids of Egypt, and when she was done being Fantaghiro-saving-her-Romualdo, her prince would then build a beautiful palace as a monument of their love (which of course would be more beautiful than Taj Mahal) where both of them will live happily ever after...
So, you see, that's why Princess Miyuki had refused each and every love declaration or marriage proposal that came her way.
But of course, what's a story without the brave and wise heroic prince? Here comes Prince Hajikidama of the Marbles Kingdom.

1.  A convenient starting point is
   999 + 999 = 1998,

2.  To lower 1998 to 1990 we must subtract 8.

""Yours, probably.  Mr. Collins is at a conference for the weekend, and Monette took his math class.  It looks like she handed back an exam.""
""I teach math.  Can I help?""
All three talked at once; Monette was as frustrated as the two students.  While they jabbered, Corman managed to read the problem in question:
""My house is built on a strangely-shaped lot, so my back yard is a right triangle with an area of 840 square feet.  Each of the three sides measures an integral number of feet.  If I want to stake my dog so that he can reach the entire yard, how long must his rope be?""

Lewis Carroll searched for the answer to the basic mathematical problem, sent to him by a reader.  He found two right triangles with the same area, but couldn't discover a set of three.  Somewhat ironically, Carroll had found 20-21-29 and 12-35-37.  Had he doubled their dimensions, he would have had the first two triangles above, and quite likely would have found the third.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"To be able to “reach the entire yard’’ the dog has to be tied at the one point that is farthest from every place in the yard – the centre of the circle that just contains the whole triangular yard.  
For any right‑angled triangle that circle is the circumcircle whose diameter is the hypotenuse, so the required length of rope is the radius  

                 rope length = (circumradius) = ½ × (hypotenuse).

Therefore we must first find every right‑angled triangle of integral side–lengths that has area 840 ft², then take half of its hypotenuse.

1.  Let the two legs be a and b (integral); area = ½ab = 840, so  

                                ab = 1680.

2.  We need a² + b² to be a perfect square c² (integral hypotenuse).  
    List the factor pairs of 1680 and test them:

            (24,70)  → 24²+70² = 576+4900 = 5476 = 74²

    No other factor pair of 1680 gives a perfect square, so there are exactly three
    integral right triangles with area 840 ft²:

            24–70–74  40–42–58  15–112–113.

3.  The three corresponding rope lengths are half their hypotenuses:

            74/2 = 37 ft
            58/2 = 29 ft
           113/2 = 56.5 ft

    (These are precisely the three answers the two students and Mr Collins obtained:
     29 ft is 8 ft shorter than the 37 ft on the key, while 56½ ft is “a lot longer.”)

Thus Mr Collins’ answer of 37 feet is perfectly correct for one of the three possible
yards, and together the three numbers above are the only possible correct answers

206,"Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

  P  = selling price per box (dollars)  
  C  = production/marketing cost per box (dollars)

1.  Find the constant unit‑cost.  
   At the given price $5.95 the profit per box is $1.75, hence  

        C = 5.95 − 1.75 = $4.20 .

2.  Express quantity demanded as a function of price.  
   Each $0.20 decrease raises sales by 25 boxes, i.e.  

        ΔQ / ΔP = 25 / (−0.20) = −125 .  

   Using the point (P,Q) = (5.95 , 100),

        Q(P) = 100 − 125(P − 5.95)
              = 843.75 − 125P .

3.  Write the profit function.  

        W(P) = (price − cost) · quantity
              = (P − 4.20)(843.75 − 125P) .

4.  Maximize W(P).  
   Differentiate and set to zero:

        W′(P) = (1)(843.75 − 125P) + (P − 4.20)(−125)
               = 843.75 − 125P − 125P + 525
               = 1368.75 − 250P .

        1368.75 − 250P = 0  ⇒  P = 1368.75 / 250 = 5.475 .

5.  Interpret the result.  
   The profit‑maximising price is $5.475 ≈ $5.48 per box.  
   (If the price must be set in $0.20 steps, $5.55 would be the best practical choice, giving a weekly profit of $202.50.)

Since SL-D=3 or (SL-1)-D=3 (meaning SL-D=4), and since the highest possible sum of two different one-digit numbers is 17, S must equal 1.
Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.

Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.
Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.
If D=7, then L=0. But since 10-7=3, D cannot be 7.
If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.
If E=4, then N=3. But if D=8, A=3, and if D=9, L=3 and A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=5, then since 1I-E=6, I=1. But since S=1, this cannot work.
If E=7, then I=3. But if D=8, then A=3, and if D=9, then L=3. So this cannot work.
If E=8, then I=4, and D cannot be 8. But if D=9, then A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=9, then N=8, and D cannot be 8 or 9. So this cannot work.
Therefore, E=6, N=5, and I=2. If D=8, then L=2, so D must equal 9. This means:

Column‑by‑column subtraction with possible borrows gives these conditions:

1. S – borrow₄ = 0  ⇒  borrow₄ = 1 and S = 1.  
2. Because of this borrow₄, the thousands column must have borrowed, so borrow₃ = 1.  
   Hence L – borrow₃ + 10 – D = 3  ⇒  D = L + 6.  
   With digits 0–9 this allows (L,D) = (0,6), (2,8), (3,9).
3. In the hundreds column (with borrow₃ = 1):

Normally, you would touch each tiny one by one by one cube and they would fall off. However, with new quantum technology, it has become more interesting. You may say the total number of possible cubes (not necessarily with side length one) in the twelve by twelve by twelve Rubik's cube, and hocus-pocus, cubes of all sizes would appear. Assuming that each side in the tiny cubes has length one and that you may only make cubes of integer side length, what number should you say for the new technology to work?","For 1^3+2^3+... n^3, use (1+2+...n)^2.","6084.
First, try a easier problem. Try a two by two by two Rubik's cube. There are 8 tiny cubes and one 2 by 2 by 2 cube. It should come to your notice that you take 2^3+1^3. But just to check, you look at a standard Rubik's cube with side length 3. There are, predictably, 27 one by one cubes, 8 two by two cubes, and one 3 by 3 cube. That was 3^3 +2^3 + 1^3. Now you can come to the conclusion that for any Rubik's cube with side length n, there are n^3+(n-1)^3 + ... 2^3+1^3 total cubes with integer side length. Therefore, there are 1^3+2^3+...12^3 cubes in the Rubik's cube with side length 12. The hint gives the formula for adding a sequence of cubes. Thus, you would get (1+2+3+4+...+11+12)^2 = 6084 cubes.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 ‒ Understand what is being counted  
Every “cube” we are to create must  
• be aligned with the 12 × 12 × 12 grid,  
• have all edges parallel to the large cube’s edges,  
• have integer side length 1,2,…,12.

So we are really counting all axis–parallel sub‑cubes contained in the big cube.

Step 2 ‒ Count cubes of a fixed side length k  
Pick a side length k (1 ≤ k ≤ 12).  
Along each coordinate axis the left‑front‑bottom corner of such a k×k×k cube can start at any integer position from 1 up to 12−k+1.  
Number of choices in x-direction: 12−k+1  
Same in y and in z.  

Therefore, for this k, the number of k×k×k cubes is  
(12−k+1)³.

Step 3 ‒ Sum over all admissible k  
Total cubes = Σ_{k=1}^{12}(12−k+1)³.  
Let s = 12−k+1; as k runs from 1 to 12, s runs from 12 down to 1, so

Total cubes = Σ_{s=1}^{12}s³.

Step 4 ‒ Evaluate the sum of cubes  
For any n, 1³+2³+⋯+n³ = [n(n+1)/2]².  
With n = 12: n(n+1)/2 = 12·13/2 = 78.

The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)

Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51

The number of lathes limit the combination of chairs and tables to 360=5c+5t.
The number of sanding machines limit the combination of chairs and tables to 1080=5c+20t.
Next graph these three lines. It should be expected that the answer will lie on the intersection of two of these lines or to make all chairs or all tables. The intersection of the saw and sanding machine line occurs outside of how many chairs the lathe can make so this combination is not a viable answer.

On this assumption, an exact answer can be given.",,"The first time would be 5 and 5\143 minutes past 12, which might also indicate 60\143 minutes past 1. Expressed slightly less accurately, 5 minutes past 12 and about half a minute past 1.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let t  hours (0<t<12) be the true time after 12 o’clock.

Positions of the hands (measured as fractions of one revolution from 12):

hour‑hand H(t) = t/12  
minute‑hand M(t) = t − ⌊t⌋ (the fractional part of t)

Because the hands are indistinguishable, the indication at the true time t will also be obtained at some other time s ≠ t provided the two positions are interchanged:

H(t) = M(s)    and    M(t) = H(s).             (1)

Write  
t = k + u with k = ⌊t⌋, 0 ≤ u < 1  
s = m + v with m = ⌊s⌋, 0 ≤ v < 1.

Substituting in (1):

t/12 = v                        (2)  
u   = (m + v)/12.             (3)

From (2) v = t/12 = (k + u)/12.

Insert this in (3):

u = (m + (k + u)/12)/12  
12u = m + (k + u)/12  
144u = 12m + k + u  
143u = 12m + k.               (4)

Now t = k + u, so

t = k + (12m + k)/143 = (12m + 144k)/143.      (5)

We want the very first positive solution.

Take k = 0 (so 0 < t < 1 hr); then (5) gives

t = 12m / 143.

To keep t under 1 hour we need m ≤ 11.  
The smallest positive m is 1, giving

t = 12/143 hour.

No solution with k > 0 can give a smaller t, because k itself would already be at least 1 hour. Hence this is the first ambiguous instant.

Convert t to ordinary units:

t = 12/143 hour = (12/143)·60 min = 720/143 min

Extract the basic “work” rate from the given data.  
2.5 artists working for 2.5 hours produce 2.5 finished model‑on‑canvas paintings.

Step 2.  Compute the amount of artist‑time needed for one finished painting.  
Total artist‑hours used = 2.5 artists × 2.5 hours = 6.25 artist‑hours.  
Paintings produced = 2.5.  
Artist‑hours per painting = 6.25 / 2.5 = 2.5 artist‑hours.

Equivalently: one artist needs 2.5 hours to finish one model on its canvas.

Step 3.  Determine total artist‑hours required for the new job.  
We now need 24 paintings.  
Required artist‑hours = 24 paintings × 2.5 artist‑hours/painting = 60 artist‑hours.

Step 4.  Convert the total artist‑hours to a headcount given the available time.  
The work must be completed in 20 hours.

222,"Homer had always contemplated the size of the old oak tree in the field behind his house.  Standing 5 feet away from the 8 foot high fence in the back of the yard, he could just barely see the top leaves of the tree over the top of the fence.  He knew that the tree was 200 feet from the fence.  Homer was 6 feet tall, making his line of vision, 67 inches from the ground.
Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.","TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches
Tree height from eye level = TAN (25.80 deg) * 2460 inches = 1189 inches
Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.  With the measurement capabilities available to any lumberjack (or any average Homer) precise measurements are not possible.  Thus the need to clarify these calculations as estimates.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

• E be Homer’s eye, 67 in = 67/12 ft = 5.583 ft above the ground.  
• F be the top of the fence, 8 ft above the ground.  
• T be the top of the tree (height h to be found).  

Horizontal distances (all measured straight back from Homer):  

E → F : 5 ft  
F → T : 200 ft  
Therefore E → T : 5 ft + 200 ft = 205 ft

Since the line of sight from E just grazes the top of the fence before reaching T, the points E, F and T are collinear.

1. Compute the slope of the line of sight using E and F:
   vertical rise EF = 8 ft – 5.583 ft = 2.417 ft  
   horizontal run EF = 5 ft  
   slope m = 2.417 ft / 5 ft = 0.4834

2. Apply the same slope from E all the way to T (205 ft horizontally):
   vertical rise ET = m · 205 ft = 0.4834 · 205 ≈ 99.09 ft

3. Add Homer’s eye height to get the tree’s total height:
   h = 5.583 ft + 99.09 ft ≈ 104.7 ft

So the old oak tree is a bit over 100 feet tall, about 105 feet when rounded to the nearest foot.

1 ÷ 7 = 0.142 857 142 857 …  
The repetend (repeating block) is 142 857, a 6‑digit number.

Now test it:

142 857 × 2 = 285 714  
142 857 × 3 = 428 571  
142 857 × 4 = 571 428  
142 857 × 5 = 714 285  
142 857 × 6 = 857 142  

Each product is simply a cyclic permutation of 142 857; hence every product uses exactly the same six digits 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7 and introduces no others.  
No other 6‑digit number has this property (it can be shown that any 6‑digit solution must be the cyclic number generated by 1/7).

1.  Write the four–digit numbers with carries  
   ABCD × 4 = DCBA  

   Units: 4·D = A + 10k₁  
   Tens:  4·C + k₁ = B + 10k₂  
   Hundreds: 4·B + k₂ = C + 10k₃  
   Thousands: 4·A + k₃ = D   (no further carry, so ≤9)

2.  From the thousands column  
   4A + k₃ ≤ 9.  
   Hence A can only be 1 or 2.

3.  Units column condition (A = 4D mod 10) rules out A = 1, because 4·D never ends in 1.  
   Therefore A = 2.

4.  With A = 2, thousands gives  
   4·2 + k₃ = 8 + k₃ = D ≤ 9 ⇒ k₃ = 0 and D = 8.

5.  Units column with D = 8 gives  
   4·8 = 32 ⇒ A = 2 (already satisfied) and carry k₁ = 3.

6.  Let k₂ be the carry from the tens column (0–3).  
   Hundreds column: 4B + k₂ = C (since k₃ = 0, the value is <10).  
   Tens column: 4C + k₁ = B + 10k₂, with k₁ = 3.

7.  Substitute C = 4B + k₂ into the tens equation:  
   4(4B + k₂) + 3 = B + 10k₂  
   16B + 4k₂ + 3 = B + 10k₂  
   15B − 6k₂ + 3 = 0 ⇒ 5B − 2k₂ = −1.

   Testing k₂ = 0, 1, 2, 3, only k₂ = 3 works, giving B = 1.

8.  Then C = 4B + k₂ = 4·1 + 3 = 7.

9.  The digits are thus A = 2, B = 1, C = 7, D = 8.

   FLY + FLY + FLY = 3·FLY = AWAY is a 4‑digit number, the first digit A must be 1 or 2 (because 3·999 = 2997).

2.  Units column  
      3·Y must end in Y.  
      3Y ≡ Y  (mod 10)  ⇒  2Y ≡ 0 (mod 10)  ⇒  Y = 5 (digits are non‑zero).  
      3·5 = 15 gives a carry c₁ = 1 to the tens column.

3.  Tens column  
      3·L + c₁ = 3L + 1.  
      The digit written is A and the carry to the hundreds column is c₂.  
      So 3L + 1 = 10·c₂ + A  with A = 1 or 2.  
      Trying L = 1,…,9 gives only one possibility:  
         L = 7  →  3·7 + 1 = 22  →  A = 2,  c₂ = 2.

4.  Hundreds column  
      3·F + c₂ = 3F + 2.  
      Write W and carry c₃ to the thousands column:  
      3F + 2 = 10·c₃ + W,   c₃ = A = 2.  
      Thus 3F + 2 is between 20 and 29:  20 ≤ 3F + 2 ≤ 29  
      ⇒  18 ≤ 3F ≤ 27  ⇒  6 ≤ F ≤ 9.

      Evaluate 3F + 2:

231,What is the smallest integer greater than 0 that can be written entirely with zeros and ones and is evenly divisible by 225?,,"The prime factorization of 225 is 5*5*3*3. So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.
All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Because the number must be divisible by 225 = 9·25, it has to satisfy simultaneously  

• divisibility by 25 ⟹ its last two decimal digits are 00,  
• divisibility by 9  ⟹ the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.

Since only the digits 0 and 1 are allowed, the digit–sum equals the number of 1’s that appear.

1.  The last two digits are fixed as 00, so all other digits (call their number k) precede these two zeros.  
2.  To make the digit–sum a multiple of 9 we need at least 9 ones; hence k ≥ 9.  
3.  Putting nine 1’s into exactly those k positions, the fewest total digits (and therefore the smallest magnitude) occurs when k = 9, giving an 11–digit number.  
4.  To minimise the value we push every possible 1 as far to the right (toward the least–significant positions) as we can, leaving only the leading digit forced to be 1.  
   Thus the pattern is  

   1 11111111 00  
   (one leading 1, eight more 1’s, and the required trailing 00).

   That number is  

   11111111100.

5.  Check:  
   • it ends in 00 ⟹ divisible by 25,  
   • it contains nine 1’s ⟹ digit–sum = 9 ⟹ divisible by 9.

Therefore it is divisible by 225.  
Any attempt to shorten the number fails (fewer than nine positions before the final 00 cannot supply nine 1’s), and inserting additional zeros to the left of the block of eight 1’s only increases its magnitude. So this is the smallest possible.

    to be 1,2,…,9 each exactly once.

2.  A quick consequence from casting out nines  
        digit‑sum(n)+digit‑sum(2n)+digit‑sum(3n) ≡ n+2n+3n ≡ 6n (mod 9).  
    But the left hand side is the digit–sum of 1+2+…+9 = 45, which is 0 (mod 9).  
    Thus 6n ≡ 0 (mod 9) ⇒ n ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
    So n must be a multiple of 3, and because 3n is still three–digit we have  
           100 ≤ n ≤ 333.

3.  We now inspect the last digit d of n.

Because the lightest two bales must give the lightest recorded sum and the heaviest two bales must give the heaviest recorded sum, we have  

a + b = 80     …(1)  
d + e = 91     …(2)

Take the three least sums in the list: 80, 82, 83.  
All of them must involve the lightest bale a.  
(The next–lightest bale b already appeared in 80, so every other sum that is still ≤83 must pair a with some other bale.)

Thus set  
a + b = 80, a + c = 82, a + d = 83.     …(3)

Subtracting these gives  
c – b = 2, d – b = 3.     …(4)

Write b from (1) as b = 80 – a, then from (4)

c = b + 2 = 82 – a,  
d = b + 3 = 83 – a.     …(5)

Insert d in (2):

e = 91 – d = 91 – (83 – a) = a + 8.     …(6)

Now impose the ordering a < b < c < d < e:

a < 80 – a  ⟹ a < 40  
83 – a < a + 8 ⟹ 2a > 75 ⟹ a > 37.5.

Hence a is an integer 38 or 39.

• If a = 38 ⇒ (b,c,d,e) = (42,44,45,46);  
  their pair–sums include 89 instead of the listed 85, so discard.

• If a = 39 ⇒ (b,c,d,e) = (41,43,44,47);  
  every one of their ten pair‑sums is in the given list and nothing is missing.

Therefore the only possible set of bale weights is  

39 kg, 41 kg, 43 kg, 44 kg, 47 kg.

Pairings that give each recorded total:

80 kg  = 39 + 41  
82 kg  = 39 + 43  
83 kg  = 39 + 44  
84 kg  = 41 + 43  
85 kg  = 41 + 44  
86 kg  = 39 + 47  
87 kg  = 43 + 44  
88 kg  = 41 + 47  
90 kg  = 43 + 47  
91 kg  = 44 + 47

Final answer: the bales weigh 39 kg, 41 kg, 43 kg, 44 kg and 47 kg, and the ten recorded weights correspond to the pairings listed above.",True
240,"In the legendary land of Madadia, everything is wonderful. There is no inflation, so Madadian wonks (local currency 100 winks = 1 wonk) are constant in value.
Mad Ade's cousin Manic Martin works as an accountant in one of Madadia's leading accounting firms.
After his first year his salary was a straight 10,000 wonks, with which Manic Martin was quite happy. His manager was so impressed with his work he offered Manic Martin a wage rise.
Now this being Madadia, things are not always done as they are elsewhere, the wage rise was offered over a 17.5 year contract period, These contracts are immutably binding, and will still be paid to benefactors in the event of death or permanent disability.
Manic Martin has a choice of how to receive his raise.  The first option was for an immediate 5% raise to 10,500 wonks annually, with an additional 5% raise every 6 months. The second option was for an immediate 10% raise to 11,000 wonks annually, with an additional 10% raise every year. Manic Martin's salary, based upon his current annual, was paid bi-weekly.
Which deal would benefit Manic Martin the most?",,"The 5% semi-annual raise yields a higher return.
This may have been your first guess, but there is something odd about the answer. At the start of the problem, the 10% raise is earning more-  11,000 annually vs. 10,500. After the first year, the 5% option has earned 10,762 compared to 11,000.
What are the two options earning at the moment the contract closes, after 17.5 years? Surprisingly, the 5% option only realizes a little more than 55,160, compared to the 10% option which is still ahead with just under 56,000.
So where's the advantage in the 5% option? It hides in the second half of every year. Even in the first year, the 5% option makes more in the second six months than the 10% option. For the first few years, this is not enough to offset the difference. But cumulatively, over seventeen and a half years, 5% realizes a grand total of 390.27 more than the 10% option.

2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?",,"The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74
Lemp 47 94
Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Number of people who got in at the six stations - Number of people who got out at the six stations) =
227 - (364 - 182) =
227 - 182 =
45 people
Thus, I disappointed Tweeto by giving him the answer as 45 people.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

D₁ ,D₂ ,D₃ ,D₄ ,D₅ ,D₆ = numbers getting down at  
Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf respectively  
Uᵢ = numbers getting in at station i

1.  Twice as many get in as get down ⇒  Uᵢ = 2 Dᵢ  
2.  The primes allowed by the ranges are  
  Maver {2,3,5,7}  
  Willow {11,13,17,19}  
  Wonderland {23,29}

5.  After all six stations the passenger total is 227, so  

  P₀ + (D₁+…+D₆) = 227.  (★)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step‑by‑step selection of the Dᵢ

a) D₁–D₂ condition  
 Allowed (D₁,D₂) pairs are  
 (2,13), (2,17), (2,19), (3,13), (3,17), (3,19),  
 (5,17), (5,19), (7,17), (7,19).

b) D₂–D₃ condition  
 With D₃ = 23 we need D₂ ≤ 13; with D₃ = 29 we need D₂ ≤ 19  
 ⇒ viable triples are only those with D₃ = 23 and D₂ = 13.

c) D₃–D₄ condition  
 D₃ = 23 forces D₄ = 37 (since 31 gives a gap of 8 < 10).

d) D₄–D₅ condition  
 With D₄ = 37, only D₅ = 47 gives a gap ≥ 10.

e) D₅–D₆ condition  
 With D₅ = 47, only D₆ = 59 works (gap = 12).

f) Evenness of total downs  
 Two possibilities were left:  

  (D₁,D₂,D₃,D₄,D₅,D₆) = (2,13,23,37,47,59)  sum = 181 (odd) – reject  
  (D₁,D₂,D₃,D₄,D₅,D₆) = (3,13,23,37,47,59)  sum = 182 (even) – accept

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Final calculation

Sum of people getting down = 182, hence from (★)

 P₀ = 227 – 182 = 45.

So 45 passengers (including Tweeto) were on board before the train reached Maver.",True
248,"Some time after 2 O' Clock, the angle made between the minute hand and the vertical (12) on a clock is double the angle made between the hour hand and the vertical (12). What time is it?",What is the rate of travel of each hand on a clock?,"2:24 The hour hand makes an angle of 72 degrees while the minute hand makes an angle of 144 degrees.
At exactly 2:00, the angle made by the hour hand is 60 degrees from vertical.  If you let x = the number of minutes past 2:00 that we are looking for, then the hour hand will be at:
60 degrees + x / 60 min* 30 degrees
where x/60 min is the fraction of a full hour that has past, and is therefore the fractional distance that the hour hand has moved closer to the 3.  The 30 degrees is the total angle between the 2 and the 3.
The final position of the minute hand will be:
x/30 min * 180 degrees
for the same reasoning as with the hour hand.
Since the minute hand will make twice the angle with vertical, you can set up the equation:
2*(60 + x / 60 * 30) = x / 30 * 180
Solving for x will give you 24 minutes.  The time will be 2:24.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the time be 2 : m, i.e. m minutes after 2 o’clock.

Measure every angle clockwise from the 12 o’clock position (the vertical).

Minute hand

 θₘ = 6m degrees.

Hour hand  
• At 2 : m, it is 2 + m/60 hours past 12.  
• Each hour sweeps 30°, so its angle from 12 is  
 θₕ = 30 (2 + m/60) = 60 + 0.5m degrees.

Condition  
The minute‐hand angle is double the hour‐hand angle:

6m = 2(60 + 0.5m)  
6m = 120 + m

m = 24.

We need

x² − y² = 73.

1. Factor the left–hand side as a difference of squares:  
   (x − y)(x + y) = 73.

2. 73 is prime, so its only positive factor pair is 1 and 73.  
   Therefore

   x − y = 1  
   x + y = 73.

3. Add the two equations:
