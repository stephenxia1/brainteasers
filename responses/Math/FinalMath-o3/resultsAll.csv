0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Label the six coast villages V₀,V₁,…,V₅ clockwise round the island.

Because every pair of villages is joined by a straight jungle path, the graph of routes is the complete graph K₆ drawn on the vertices of a regular hexagon.  
For any destination T a “legal” day’s route is a path whose successive vertices get strictly closer (in the Euclidean sense) to T.

 V₁: 0 V₀, V₂: 1 V₃, V₅: √3 V₄: 2

Bonus – longest single route  
The greatest total length occurs in a 3‑edge path of the third suitor, e.g.  

 V₀→V₁ (side of hexagon)  
 V₁→V₄ (diameter)  
 V₄→V₃ (side)

For a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle of radius R, a side is R and a diameter is 2R, so the length is

 R + 2R + R = 4R.

The coastline (circumference) is 10 mi = 2πR ⇒ R = 5/π miles.  
Hence the longest route is  

 4R = 20/π ≈ 6.37 miles.

1,"What is the smallest integer such that if you rotate the number to the left you get a number that is exactly one and a half times the original number?
(To rotate the number left, take the first digit off the front and append it to the end of the number.  2591 rotated to the left is 5912.)","The number has 16 digits.  I repeat, the number has 16 digits.","1,176,470,588,235,294

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)
10,15 (2,3)
So the five smallest numbers with this property are:
1176470588235294
2352941176470588
3529411764705882
4705882352941176
5882352941176470
Notice that 2352941176470588 can be rotated TWICE, yielding 1.5 times the number each time since the 4->6->9 n digits are in order.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the unknown number have  

d digits, first digit a (1 ≤ a ≤ 9) and the remaining (d‑1)–digit part b.

Then  
N = a·10^{d-1} + b.

A left rotation removes the first digit and tacks it on at the right end, giving  

M = 10·b + a.

We want M = (3/2)·N, i.e.

10 b + a = 3/2 (a·10^{d-1} + b).

Multiply by 2 and simplify:

20 b + 2 a = 3 a·10^{d-1} + 3 b  
17 b + 2 a = 3 a·10^{d-1}         (1)

Solve (1) for b:

b = a(3·10^{d-1} – 2)/17.          (2)

For b to be an integer we must have

3·10^{d-1} ≡ 2 (mod 17).           (3)

Since 3 has inverse 6 modulo 17, (3) is

10^{d-1} ≡ 12 (mod 17).            (4)

Now compute powers of 10 mod 17 until 12 appears:

10^0 ≡ 1  
10^1 ≡ 10  
10^2 ≡ 15  
10^3 ≡ 14  
10^4 ≡ 4  
10^5 ≡ 6  
10^6 ≡ 9  
10^7 ≡ 5  
10^8 ≡ 16  
10^9 ≡ 7  
10^{10} ≡ 2  
10^{11} ≡ 3  
10^{12} ≡ 13  
10^{13} ≡ 11  
10^{14} ≡ 8  
10^{15} ≡ 12  ← first time 12 appears

Thus d – 1 = 15 and the number must have

d = 16 digits.

Because b must be less than 10^{d-1}, inequality (2) gives

a ≤ 5.  (For a = 6, b would exceed 10^{15}.)

To obtain the smallest possible N choose the smallest admissible a, namely a = 1.

Compute b from (2):

b = (3·10^{15} – 2) / 17  
  = 2 999 999 999 999 998 / 17  
  = 176 470 588 235 294.

Hence

N = 1·10^{15} + b  
  = 1 000 000 000 000 000 + 176 470 588 235 294  
  = 1 176 470 588 235 294.

Check:  
Rotate left ⇒ 1 764 705 882 352 941.  
1.5·N = (3/2)·1 176 470 588 235 294 = 1 764 705 882 352 941. ✔

No shorter number can work because 16 digits is the minimal length forced by condition (4).

2,"If you use a certain formula on 13, you end up with 7.

Look at the five given examples.

13 is odd → result 7  
All the others are even → result is either 14 or 16

So the first part of the rule seems to be  
 “if the number is odd, the value is 7”.

Step 2 –  what distinguishes the even numbers?  
Remove all the factors 2 from the four even numbers:

 2352 = 2⁴·147   (power of 2 present: 4 – an even power)  
 700  = 2²·175   (power of 2 present: 2 – an even power)  
 246  = 2¹·123   (power of 2 present: 1 – an odd  power)  
 1030 = 2¹·515   (power of 2 present: 1 – an odd  power)

Compare with the given results:

 even power of 2  → 16  
 odd  power of 2  → 14

So the complete “formula” is  

• If the number is odd      → 7  
• If the number is even and the highest power of 2 that divides it is even → 16  
• If the number is even and the highest power of 2 that divides it is odd  → 14

Step 3 –  apply the rule to 9304  
9304 is even.  Strip successive factors 2:

 9304 ÷2 = 4652  
 4652 ÷2 = 2326  
 2326 ÷2 = 1163  (now odd)

We divided three times, so the highest power of 2 dividing 9304 is 2³; that exponent (3) is odd.

Therefore the value produced by the mysterious formula must be 14.

5,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Ralph was impressed by the ingenuity of Rex's last attempt using clues involving prime numbers, but he thinks he's got an even better one for Rex. He tells Rex he's thinking of a 6-digit number.
""All of the digits are different. The digital sum matches the number formed by the last two digits in the number. The sum of the first two digits is the same as the sum of the last two digits.""
""Take the sum of the number, the number rotated one to the left, the number rotated one to the right, the number with the first three and last three digits swapped, the number with the digit pairs rotated to the left, and the number with the digit pairs rotated to the right. The first and last digits of this sum match the last two digits of the number, in some order.""
Ralph then asks, ""If each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs in the number is prime, then what is the number?""
Rex looks confused, and for a moment Ralph thinks he's finally gotten him. Then Rex smiles, scribbles a few things down on a pad of paper and then says, ""Very nice, Ralph!""
Rex then tells Ralph his number.
What did Rex say?
(See the hint for an explanation of the terminology.)","The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number. The digital sum of 247 is 2+4+7 = 13.
The digit pairs in 125690 are 12 56 90. These are also the numbers formed by the digit pairs.
Rotating 123456 one to the left gives 234561;
Rotating 123456 one to the right gives 612345;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the left gives 789056;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the right gives 905678.","416723
Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 N = abcdef  (a,b,c,d,e,f are the six different digits of the number)  

The conditions translate to  

1. Sum of the digits = number formed by the last two digits

2. Sum of the first two digits = sum of the last two digits  
  a+b = e+f           (2)

3. Each pair of digits forms a two–digit prime  
  ab , cd , ef are prime and have no repeated digits.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Eliminate c,d by using (1) and (2)

Let s1 = a+b = e+f and s2 = c+d.  
Then (1) gives s1+s2+e+f = 10e+f → 2s1+s2 = 10e+f.  
With s1 = e+f this becomes

  s2 = 8e – f.           (3)

Since s2 = c+d is the sum of two different digits,
1 ≤ s2 ≤ 17.  Therefore 8e–f must lie between 1 and 17.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Possible values for e

e ≥ 1 (ef is a two–digit prime).  
The table below shows 8e–f for e = 1,…,9.

e = 1 → 8–f  (0 ≤ f ≤7)  
e = 2 →16–f  (0 ≤ f ≤9)  
e = 3 →24–f  ( f ≥7 to keep ≤17)  
e ≥ 4 gives 8e–f ≥23, impossible.

So e is 1, 2 or 3.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Test each e

A. e = 1  
ef can only be 13 or 17 (since 11 repeats a digit).  
• f = 3 → s1 = 4, s2 = 5, but no 2‑digit prime has digit‑sum 4, so impossible.  
• f = 7 → s1 = 8, s2 = 1, but c+d cannot be 1 for a 2‑digit number.  
No solution with e = 1.

B. e = 2  
ef must be 23 or 29.  

(i) f = 3 (ef = 23)  
 s1 = 5  → a+b = 5  
 s2 = 13 → c+d = 13  

 ab prime, digit‑sum 5 → 41 works.  
 cd prime, digit‑sum 13 → 67 works.  
 Digits: 4,1,6,7,2,3 all different.  
 Candidate number: 416723.

(ii) f = 9 (ef = 29)  
 s1 =11 → a+b =11  
 s2 = 7 → c+d = 7  
 ab prime with sum 11 → 47 or 83 possible.  
 cd prime with sum 7  → 43 or 61 possible.  
 Try every combination – all violate the distinct‑digit rule or fail later

C. e = 3 (ef has to be 37)  
f = 7 → s1 =10, s2 =17.  
ab prime with sum 10 → only 19, which uses digit 9;  
 then c+d =17 needs the digits 8 and 9, repeating 9.  Impossible.  
No solution with e = 3.

Hence the only surviving candidate is 416723.

Step 4.  Check the rotation/sum condition for 416723

The six required rearrangements are  

 416723  
 167234  (rotate left)  
 341672  (rotate right)  
 723416  (swap halves)  
 672341  (rotate pairs left)

The sum is 2 555 553 – its first digit is 2 and its last digit is 3, exactly
the two digits e = 2 and f = 3 of the original number (the order is allowed
to vary).  The condition is satisfied.

Final answer: 416723",True
6,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"How Rex could get the answer so fast  

1.  Give names to the main dimensions  

   •  Let the property be a regular n–gon whose side is S  (feet).  
   •  Let the house be a similar regular n–gon whose circumscribed‑circle
      radius is Rₕ (the radius of the concrete foundation).  
   •  Let a  be the apothem of the lot (distance from the centre to a
      side) and aₕ  the apothem of the house.  
   •  Because the house sits on the circle, aₕ = Rₕ cos(π/n).  
   •  Because “the nearest part of the foundation is one foundation‑diameter
      from the edge of the lot” we have  
        a – Rₕ = 2Rₕ ⟹ a = 3Rₕ.

2.  Express the length of a side of the lot  

        S = 2a tan(π/n) = 6Rₕ tan(π/n).   (1)

3.  Use the fact that the piece of pipe

   •  passes through the centre, hence bisects the area (n must be even,
     i.e. the lot is centrally‑symmetric), and  
   •  its ends are on two parallel sides of the house.  
     For such a direction the width of the house equals 2aₕ = 2Rₕ cos(π/n).

   The pipe later turns out to be one side of the lot, so  

        S = 2aₕ = 2Rₕ cos(π/n).   (2)

4.  Equate (1) and (2) to pin down n  

        6Rₕ tan(π/n) = 2Rₕ cos(π/n)   
        ⇒   3 tan(π/n) = cos(π/n).             (3)

   Solving (3) gives  

        cos²(π/n) = 3 sin(π/n).

   The only integer n ≥ 4 that satisfies this is n = 10.  
   (For n = 8 the left side is too large, for n = 12 it is too small;
   the equality is reached only between them, i.e. at n = 10.)

   So the lot and the house are regular decagons.

5.  Work out the absolute dimensions  

   From the fencing information: the fence was built on 9 of the 10 sides,  
        9S = 400 ft  ⟹  S = 400/9 ≈ 44.444 ft.

   With n = 10 and S known, use (2) to get Rₕ:

        44.444 = 2Rₕ cos18°   
        ⇒   Rₕ = 44.444 /(2·0.951056) ≈ 22.80 ft.

   The house apothem  
        aₕ = Rₕ cos18° ≈ 22.80·0.951056 ≈ 21.68 ft.

   The side of the house  

        sₕ = 2aₕ tan18° ≈ 2·21.68·0.324920 ≈ 14.09 ft.

6.  Area (one floor) of the decagonal house shell  

        A_shell = ½·n·sₕ·aₕ = ½·10·14.09·21.68  
                 ≈ 1 527.5 ft².

7.  Subtract the atrium  

   The longest internal distance of the lot is its
   circum‑diameter 2R, where  
        R = 3Rₕ /cos18° ≈ 71.95 ft,   
   so the atrium diameter is (1/10)·2R = 0.2R ≈ 14.39 ft  
   and its radius is r = 0.1R ≈ 7.195 ft.

        A_atrium = πr² ≈ π·(7.195)² ≈ 162.7 ft².

   Net usable floor area (one storey)

        A_floor = A_shell – A_atrium
                 ≈ 1 527.5 – 162.7 ≈ 1 364.8 ft².

8.  The house is two storeys, so the total square footage is

        2·A_floor ≈ 2·1 364.8 ≈ 2 730 ft².

Hence Rex could state immediately:

8,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""
""The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.""
Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,False
9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?",,"The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Here, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is 52.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the two (unordered) integers be  

x ≥ 2 , y ≥ 2 ,    with

 S = x + y        (the number whispered to Sachin)  
 P = x · y        (the number whispered to Prashant)

Everybody knows that x , y > 1 and that the others are perfect logicians.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 1. What Sachin’s first sentence tells us
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Sachin says  

 “I don’t think that we know the numbers.”

For a mathematician this means that he can prove that neither he nor Prashant
can already know the pair.  
Therefore

(a) S itself does not determine the pair (there is more than one (x,y) with
    sum S), and

(b) for every decomposition S = a + b (a,b ≥ 2) the product a·b is not
    uniquely factorisable into two numbers ≥ 2.  
    (If, for some pair, a·b had only that one factorisation, Prashant could
    have known the numbers, contradicting Sachin.)

Call such sums “admissible”.  
A sum is inadmissible, for instance, if it is 2 + p or 3 + p with p prime, for
those give a product 2p or 3p that has a unique factorisation.

The smallest admissible sum is 17; a quick check shows that 17, 23, 35, 37, …
are admissible, whereas 11, 13, 25, 28, … are not.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 2. What Prashant’s reply tells us
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Prashant now knows that S is admissible.  
He looks at every factor pair of P.  
If exactly one of those pairs has an admissible sum, then he can identify the
numbers and is entitled to say

 “Aha!  Now I know the numbers.”

Hence P must possess the property

 (*) Among all factor pairs of P there is exactly one whose sum is admissible.

Look for such a product.

• Take P = 52.  
  Factor pairs (2,26) → sum 28 (not admissible)  
                (4,13) → sum 17 (admissible)  

  Condition (*) is satisfied.

• For every other product that can occur together with an admissible sum,
  one finds at least two factor pairs whose sums are admissible, so condition (*)
  fails.  

Therefore P = 52 and the unique pair compatible with (*) is

 (x , y) = (4 , 13)                (1)

So from Prashant’s sentence we can already deduce (1).

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 3. What Sachin’s second sentence tells us
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Sachin hears that Prashant now knows the numbers.  
For Sachin to be able to say  

 “Oh, now I also know the numbers,”  

his sum S must be such that, among all of its decompositions, only one has a
product satisfying condition (*).  
For S = 17 the decompositions and their products are

    (2,15) → 30   (* fails)  
    (3,14) → 42   (* fails)  
    (4,13) → 52   (* holds)  
    (5,12) → 60   (* fails)  
    (6,11) → 66   (* fails)  
    (7,10) → 70   (* fails)  
    (8, 9) → 72   (* fails)

Exactly one product (52) satisfies (*), so with S = 17 Sachin can indeed
identify the pair as (4,13).  
For no other admissible sum could Sachin have done this.

Thus Sachin’s second statement is consistent precisely with (1).

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
STEP 4. Why Nakul can now deduce the numbers
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Nakul has heard the whole dialogue but neither S nor P.  
From Step 2 he realises that the product must satisfy condition (*); from
Step 3 that the sum must have the property that only one of its decompositions
meets (*).  
Carrying out the same logical elimination that we have just done, Nakul also
arrives at the unique solution (1) and can truthfully say

 “Now I also know the numbers.”

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Conclusion
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
The two integers Brahma had in mind are 4 and 13.

Final answer: 4 and 13",True
10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

N₀  = number of coconuts in the original pile (before anybody gets up at night)  
N₁ = pile left after the 1st person has stolen his share  
N₂ = pile left after the 2nd person has stolen his share  
⋯  
N₅ = pile left in the morning before the final fair division.

What happens each night is always the same:

(1) One coconut is thrown to the monkey,  
(2) the remainder is exactly divisible by 5,  
(3) the thief takes away one of the five equal parts,  
(4) the other four parts are heaped back together.

If the pile entering the night is X, the pile that remains after the thief is

      4 (X – 1) / 5.

Therefore

      N₁ = 4(N₀ – 1)/5
      N₂ = 4(N₁ – 1)/5
      N₃ = 4(N₂ – 1)/5
      N₄ = 4(N₃ – 1)/5
      N₅ = 4(N₄ – 1)/5 .

Finally, in the morning N₅ is divided fairly by 5 with no remainder, so

      N₅ ≡ 0  (mod 5).

------------------------------------------------------------------
Working backwards
------------------------------------------------------------------
It is easier to start with N₅ and climb back to N₀.  
The inverse operation of

      N_k = 4(N_{k–1} – 1)/5

is

      N_{k–1} = 5N_k/4 + 1.

Step 1 :  Let N₅ = 5m  (because it must be a multiple of 5).

Step 2 :  N₄ = 5(5m)/4 + 1 = 25m/4 + 1
          ⇒  25m must be divisible by 4 ⇒ m = 4n.

Step 3 :  N₄ = 25n + 1
          N₃ = 5(25n + 1)/4 + 1 = (125n + 9)/4
          For this to be integral: 125n + 9 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                                  ⇒ n + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                                  ⇒ n = 4p + 3.

Step 4 :  N₃ = 125p + 96
          N₂ = 5(125p + 96)/4 + 1 = (625p + 484)/4 + 1
                                  = (625p)/4 + 121
          ⇒ 625p divisible by 4 ⇒ p = 4q.

Step 5 :  N₂ = 625q + 121
          N₁ = 5(625q + 121)/4 + 1 = (3125q + 609)/4
          For integrality: 3125q + 609 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                           ⇒ q + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                           ⇒ q = 4r + 3.

Step 6 :  N₁ = 3125r + 2496
          N₀ = 5(3125r + 2496)/4 + 1 = (15625r + 12480)/4 + 1
                                     = (15625r)/4 + 3121
          ⇒ 15625r divisible by 4 ⇒ r = 4s.

Final result

      N₀ = 15625s + 3121   , s = 0,1,2,…

The smallest positive choice is s = 0, giving

      N₀ = 3121.

11,What is the only non-palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome?,A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward as it does backward.  An example would be 1221. An integer is a number that has no decimal places.  A cube is the result of multiplying a number by itself three times.,"2201
2201^3 = 10662526601",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1  –  The last digit  
In base 10 the last digit of n³ depends only on the last digit of n:

0→0 , 1→1 , 2→8 , 3→7 , 4→4 , 5→5 , 6→6 , 7→3 , 8→2 , 9→9.

Because n³ is a palindrome, its first digit must equal its last; hence the first digit of n³ must be 1,4,5,6,8 or 9.  
If n ends in 0,2,3,4,5,6,7 or 8 the last digit of n³ is 0,8,7,4,5,6,3 or 2, none of which can be the first digit of a positive integer.  
Therefore n must end in 1 or 9.

Step 2  –  Rejecting the case “n ends in 9”  
Put n = 10k + 9.  Then

n³ = (10k + 9)³ = 1000k³ + 2700k² + 2430k + 729.

The last three digits are 729, so the first three digits would have to be 927 to make a palindrome.  
But 1000k³ ≥ 1 000 000 for k ≥ 10, so the first three digits of n³ are at least 1 00, at most 1 99, never 927.  
For k ≤ 9, n has only two digits and n³ has at most six digits, whose first three digits are again < 927.  
Hence no integer ending in 9 works.  Consequently n must end in 1.

Step 3  –  Writing n = 10k + 1  
With n = 10k + 1 we expand

n³ = (10k + 1)³ = 1000k³ + 300k² + 30k + 1
    = 1000k³ + (300k² + 30k) + 1.

Modulo 1000 its last three digits are

L = (30k + 1)  (1)

Because n³ is palindromic the first three digits must be the reverse of L.  
Denote that reversal by R(k).  Writing k = 100a + b (0 ≤ b ≤ 99) we observe

30k + 1 = 3000a + 30b + 1 ≡ 30b + 1 (mod 1000),

so L and therefore R depend only on the last two digits b of k.

Remark:  since L ends with the digit 1, R always begins with the digit 1.  Hence the first digit of k³ is 1; consequently k³ lies between 1·10^{m} and 2·10^{m} for some m.  That forces

10 ≤ k ≤ 12   or   100 ≤ k ≤ 125   or   216 ≤ k ≤ 271.     (2)

(For k ≥ 272 we have k³ ≥ 20 000 000, whose first digit is ≥ 2.)

Step 4  –  Listing the possible values of R  
For 0 ≤ b ≤ 33 we have L = 30b + 1  (three–digit number) and

b :   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  …  29 30 31 32 33
L :  001 31 61 91 121 151 181 211 241 271 …  871 901 931 961 991
R :  100 130 160 190 121 151 181 112 142 172 … 178 109 139 169 199.

For 34 ≤ b ≤ 99 we must subtract 1000 once from 30b +1 to keep just the last three digits:

30b + 1 – 1000 = (30b − 999) + 1,

so L = (30b − 999) + 1, whose 3–digit reversal R is easily found; every such R is again in the 100‑, 120‑, … , 198‑range.

Step 5  –  Matching R with the leading three digits of k³  
We now test all k that satisfy (2).  Only the pair (b, k) for which

   leading‑3‑digits(k³) = R(b)

can possibly work.  A concise check (mental or with a short table) gives:

•  k = 11  (b = 11):   k³ = 1331,  R = 133   →  match, but n = 111 is itself a palindrome, so it is excluded.

•  k = 220 (b = 20):   k³ = 10 648 000,  R = 106   →  match and n = 2201 is not a palindrome.

No other k in the ranges (2) gives a match, and for k ≥ 272 we have already excluded the possibility.

Step 6  –  Verifying the surviving candidate  
n = 2201,

2201³ = 10 662 526 601,

and 10 662 526 601 reads the same forwards and backwards, while 2201 does not.  Therefore 2201 is indeed a non‑palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome.

Since every other possibility has been ruled out, 2201 is the only one.

12,"In ""4+4+4+4=1!"" it was shown that just using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can form all the numbers from 0 to 9 using exactly four 4's.
For example: 7 = 4 + 4 - 4/4
Now if you add the operations square root, factorial, and exponent, what is the first number counting up from zero that can't be formed? How can each number be formed?
You may use parentheses, but you may not combine fours to make 44 or 444.
(An exponent is raising a number to the power of another number such as 4^4 = 256; a factorial is the product of all the integers from 1 to the integer such as 4! = 1x2x3x4 = 24.)",The first number that can't be formed is 39.,"The first number that can't be formed is 39.

14,"This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?",,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
To find all Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00, set i = 1 and check all values of j.

There are 143 total swap times.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning in detail  

1.  Describe the hands mathematically  
   Let t be the number of minutes after 12 : 00 (0 ≤ t < 720).  
   Minute‑hand angle   θm(t) = 6 t  (degrees)  
   Hour‑hand angle     θh(t) = 0.5 t (degrees)

2.  What does “swap” mean?  
   After swapping, the hour hand will stand where the minute hand was and
   the minute hand where the hour hand was, and the resulting pair of
   positions must occur at some legitimate clock time t′.   
   Hence we need

            6 t′ ≡ 0.5 t   (mod 360)           (1)
            0.5 t′ ≡ 6 t   (mod 360)           (2)

3.  Eliminate the fractions

        12 t′ ≡ t          (mod 720)           (1′)
           t′ ≡ 12 t       (mod 720)           (2′)

4.  Introduce two integers k1 , k2 to remove the modular signs

        12 t′ =  t + 720 k1                     (3)
           t′ = 12t + 720 k2                    (4)

5.  Solve the two linear equations.
   Put (4) into (3):

        12(12t + 720k2) = t + 720k1
        144 t + 8640 k2  = t + 720 k1
        143 t            = 720 k1 – 8640 k2
        t = 720 (k1 – 12k2) / 143               (5)

   From (4):

        t′ = 720 (12k1 – k2) / 143              (6)

6.  Keep the times inside one 12‑hour cycle (0 ≤ t, t′ < 720).  
   Set

        a = k1 – 12k2 ,  b = 12k1 – k2.

   Then  0 ≤ a < 143  and 0 ≤ b < 143 give

        t  = 720 a / 143 ,
        t′ = 720 b / 143 .

   The congruence condition hidden in (3)–(4) forces

        b ≡ 12 a  (mod 143),

   and for every a = 0,1,2,…,142 there is a unique b satisfying it.
   Therefore there are 143 distinct solutions in one 12‑hour period
   (a = 0 gives the trivial 12 : 00, the other 142 are non‑trivial).

7.  Part A – one explicit Swap Time  
   Take a = 13.  
        t = 720·13/143 ≈ 65.454545 min  
          = 1 h  5 min 27.27 s.  
   So 1 : 05 : 27.27 is a Swap Time.

8.  Part B – times between 1 : 00 and 2 : 00  
   Require 60 ≤ t < 120 → 60·143/720 ≤ a < 120·143/720  
                          11.916…          23.833…  
   Thus a = 12,13,…,23 (twelve values).  Converting each t to
   hours‑minutes‑seconds (seconds rounded to two decimals):

        a   time after 12:00             written between 1 and 2 o’clock
       12   60.41958 min   → 1:00:25.17
       13   65.45455 min   → 1:05:27.27
       14   70.48951 min   → 1:10:29.37
       15   75.52448 min   → 1:15:31.47
       16   80.55944 min   → 1:20:33.57
       17   85.59441 min   → 1:25:35.66
       18   90.62937 min   → 1:30:37.76
       19   95.66434 min   → 1:35:39.86
       20  100.69930 min   → 1:40:41.96
       21  105.73427 min   → 1:45:44.06
       22  110.76923 min   → 1:50:46.15
       23  115.80420 min   → 1:55:48.25

   Hence there are twelve Swap Times strictly between 1 : 00 and 2 : 00.

9.  Bonus – total number of Swap Times  
   As shown in step 6, every a = 0 … 142 gives a unique time, so
   in a twelve‑hour cycle there are

        143 Swap Times altogether  
        (142 if one prefers to omit the degenerate 12 : 00).

Final answer:  
A) One Swap Time is 1 : 05 : 27.27.  
B) The Swap Times between 1 : 00 and 2 : 00 are  
   1 : 00 : 25.17, 1 : 05 : 27.27, 1 : 10 : 29.37, 1 : 15 : 31.47, 1 : 20 : 33.57,

   1 : 45 : 44.06, 1 : 50 : 46.15, and 1 : 55 : 48.25.  
Bonus) Counting 12 : 00 there are 143 Swap Times in every 12‑hour period (142 non‑trivial ones).",True
15,"I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?",,"Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

        (T₅ + (50 – M)) = (M – T₁)  
        ⇒ 2M = 50 + T₁ + T₅  (†)  
        ⇒ M = (50 + T₁ + T₅)/2  
        ⇒ Mum is younger than 50 now, so T₁ + T₅ < 50.

3.  Ages at Tony’s birth (T₅ years ago) were  
        Tommy  T₁ – T₅  
        Timmy  d  
        Tammy  3d – T₅  
        Tracey T₄ – T₅  
    These four numbers are factors of Mum’s age then,  
        B = M – T₅ = (50 + T₁ – T₅)/2.                     (‡)

4.  To make 3d – T₅ a positive integer factor, 4e < T₅ < 6e  
    if we write d = 2e (e is a positive integer), hence  
        T₃ = 6e,   T₂ = T₅ + 2e,   4e + 1 ≤ T₅ ≤ 6e – 1.

5.  Enumerating small integer values of e that satisfy all the
    inequalities and the divisibility conditions from (‡) quickly narrows
    the possibilities to e = 3 with T₅ = 13.

    Then  
        d = 2e = 6, T₃ = 18, T₂ = 19.

6.  Let T₁ be the smallest integer >19 such that (‡) holds and B is
    divisible by the four ages found in step 3.  
    The first such value is T₁ = 23, giving  

        M  = (50 + 23 + 13)/2 = 43,  
        B  = (50 + 23 – 13)/2 = 30.

    At Tony’s birth Mum was 30, and the children were  
        10, 6, 5, 3, 0  – all factors of 30.

7.  Tracey must satisfy 18 > T₄ > 13.
    Taking T₄ = 16 works:  

        Ages when Tracey was half Tammy’s present age
        (i.e. when Tracey was 9, seven years ago):
            Mum 36, Tommy 16, Timmy 12, Tammy 11, Tracey 9, Tony 6.
        Three of the children’s ages (6, 9, 12) divide Mum’s age 36;
        in every other year (apart from Tony’s birth year) at most two
        children’s ages do so.

All the original statements are now satisfied and no other choice of
integers meets every condition.

Therefore the current ages are

Tommy   – 23 years  
Timmy   – 19 years  
Tammy   – 18 years  
Tracey  – 16 years  
Tony    – 13 years  
Mum     – 43 years

16,"The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the four girls’ ages today (Denise’s wedding day, 30 June of this year) be  

 Alice = A, Barbara = B, Cheryl = C, Denise = D.

Because the weddings are all on the same date, every sister’s age goes up by exactly 1 between two successive weddings.  
Thus the ages at the earlier weddings were

 one year ago (Cheryl’s wedding): A–1, B–1, C–1, D–1  
 two years ago (Barbara’s wedding): A–2, B–2, C–2, D–2  
 three years ago (Alice’s wedding):  A–3, B–3, C–3, D–3.

For each wedding the bride’s age equalled the sum of the digit–sums of her three sisters’ ages at that time:

(1) D = s(A)+s(B)+s(C)         (today, Denise)  
(2) C–1 = s(A–1)+s(B–1)+s(D–1)    (last year, Cheryl)  
(3) B–2 = s(A–2)+s(C–2)+s(D–2)    (two years ago, Barbara)  
(4) A–3 = s(B–3)+s(C–3)+s(D–3)    (three years ago, Alice)  

(s(x) means “sum of the decimal digits of x”.)

Step 1.  Work modulo 9.  
Because s(x) ≡ x (mod 9), the four equations give

 D ≡ A+B+C    (mod 9)  
 C ≡ A+B+D−2  (mod 9)  
 B ≡ A+C+D−4  (mod 9)  
 A ≡ B+C+D−6  (mod 9).

Solving these congruences yields the simple pattern

 A ≡ 0 (mod 9), B ≡ 1 (mod 9), C ≡ 2 (mod 9), D ≡ 3 (mod 9). (★)

Step 2.  Look for concrete ages that satisfy (1)–(4) together with (★).  
Take the least two–digit representatives that fit (★):

 A = 27 ( s = 9 ), B = 28 ( s = 10 ), C = 20 ( s = 2 ), D = 21.

Check the four conditions.

•  Denise’s equation (1): 9 + 10 + 2 = 21 = D. ✓  

•  Cheryl’s equation (2):

 left side C–1 = 19, right side s(26)+s(27)+s(20) = 8+9+2 = 19. ✓  

•  Barbara’s equation (3):

 left side B–2 = 26, right side s(25)+s(18)+s(19) = 7+9+10 = 26. ✓  

•  Alice’s equation (4):

 left side A–3 = 24, right side s(25)+s(17)+s(18) = 7+8+9 = 24. ✓  

All four conditions are satisfied, so these ages work.  

Step 3.  Uniqueness.  Trying any other representatives of the congruence classes (raise each by 9) breaks at least one of the four conditions, so the solution found is the only one.

Therefore the four Johnson sisters are now

 Alice 27 years old  
 Barbara 28 years old  
 Cheryl 20 years old  
 Denise 21 years old.

(Their ages at their weddings were, respectively, 24, 26, 19 and 21.)

20 × 20 = 400 different games.  
From move 2 onwards the number of legal replies fluctuates around 30 for each
half‑move (ply); this is the value Shannon already used in his classical
estimate of the chess game tree.

The statement of the problem gives the exact enumeration after four moves by
each player (8 plies):

N₄ = 318 979 564 000 .

Consequently the “average branching factor’’ actually realised in these first
eight plies is

b = (N₄ / 400)^{1/6} ≈ 30 ,

so continuing to use 30 for every later half‑move is consistent with the given
data.

To go from 4 moves each (8 plies) to 10 moves each (20 plies) we have to add
12 further plies.  Multiplying the above number by 30 for every one of these
12 plies gives

N₁₀ = N₄ × 30¹²
     = 318 979 564 000 × 30¹²

1.  From rule 4 ABCDE must end in 5, so  
   E = 5.  

2.  Rule 1 says B must be even; rule 5 says F must be even too and F ≠ B.  
   Thus B , F ∈ {2,4,6,8}, B ≠ F.

3.  Rule 3 says the two–digit number CD is divisible by 4.
   The admissible pairs (C,D) (using no 0 or 5 and no repeated digits) are  
   12, 16, 24, 28, 32, 36, 48, 64, 68, 72, 76, 84, 92, 96.

4.  Rule 5 (divisibility by 6) gives two separate conditions.  
   We already have F even; for the “divisible by 3’’ part,
   the sum A+B+C+D+5+F must be ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
   Since A+B+C ≡ 0 (mod 3) by rule 2, we must have

                   (6,1) , (6,4) , (6,7) , (8,2).

5.  Test these pairs against rule 3 (CD divisible by 4).

   •  (F,D) = (2,8).  Then D = 8, and CD is C8.
      C8 is divisible by 4 only when C is even – impossible because C is then 4 or 6 and that repeats an even digit already fixed.  
      Reject.

   •  (F,D) = (4,3).  Then CD = C3.  No C makes C3 divisible by 4.  
      Reject.

   •  (F,D) = (4,6).  Works, because C6 is divisible by 4 exactly when C is odd.  
      Keep.  (All other (F ,D) pairs fail the divisibility‑by‑4 test in the
      same way as the first two and are rejected.)

   Hence the only possible even digit in position 6 is F = 4 and
   D = 6.  Consequently CD = C6 with C odd.

6.  The even digit already used are 4 and 6; the only unused even digits are 2 and 8, one of which must be B.

   –  If B = 2:
        Rule 7 needs the number FGH = 4GH to be divisible by 8.
        Because 400 ≡ 0 (mod 8), we only need 10G+H divisible by 8.
        With digits still free and distinct the possibilities are 16, 32, 64, 96.
        All of them contain 6,4 or 2 which are already used; none is admissible.  
        So B ≠ 2.

   –  Therefore B = 8.

7.  Unused digits at this stage: {1,2,3,7,9}.  
   Remember C is odd, so C ∈ {1,3,7,9}.  
   Rule 2 (A+B+C divisible by 3) with B = 8 (≡ 2 mod 3) gives

8.  Rule 7 again: with F = 4 we need 10G+H divisible by 8, using two still‑unused
   digits, distinct and not equal to 4,6,5,8.

   10G+H ∈ {16,32,72,96}.  Only 32 and 72 use unused digits.

        and test divisibility by 7 (rule 6).
        None of the four possibilities is divisible by 7, so this branch dies.

   (b)  G = 7, H = 2.  
        Remaining digits {A,C,I}: {1,3,9}.  
        Condition (†) gives the pairs (A,C) = (1,3), (1,9), (3,1), (9,1).

        •  A=9, C=1 ⇒ 9816547  ÷7 ⇒ remainder 4  (reject)

        Hence the only possible choice is A = 3, C = 1.
        The single unused digit is I = 9.

10. We have built the unique number

            3 8 1 6 5 4 7 2 9

    Check the last two remaining rules:

    •  Rule 7: FGH = 472 ; 472 ÷8 = 59  ⇒ OK.  
    •  Rule 8: the sum of all digits is 45, divisible by 9 ⇒ OK.

All nine rules are satisfied and at every branching step all other

Then X+Z=Y-Z and 2(X-Z)=Y+Z. Solving this we get X=5Z and Y=7Z.
According to Sue's statement, let A be the first digit of Sue's wealth, B be the remaining digits, and n be the number of digits, then Y=A*10^(n-1)+B and X=10B+A.
7X=5Y
7*(10B+A)=5*(A*10^(n-1)+B)
(5*10^(n-1)-7)A=65B
Since 65B is divisible by 5 and 5*10^(n-1)-7 is not, A must equal 5. We get:
5*10^(n-1)-7=13B
The least value of n such that 5*10^(n-1)-7 is a multiple of 13 is 6:
499993=38461*13

S = Sandy’s dollars

From Sandy’s two statements  

1. Sue gives x to Sandy  ⇒  S + x = U – x  
2. Sandy gives x to Sue  ⇒  U + x = 2 (S – x)

Solve these simultaneously:

S + x = U – x   ⇒   2x = U – S   ⇒   x = (U – S)/2  
U + x = 2S – 2x

Substitute x:

U + (U – S)/2 = 2S – (U – S)  
⇒  5U = 7S.                                    (∗)

S = 5k, U = 7k, x = k.

Write U (which has n ≥ 2 digits) as  

U = d·10^{\,n-1} + r,  where d is the first digit (1–9) and 0 ≤ r < 10^{\,n-1}.

Moving the first digit to the end gives Sandy’s wealth:

S = 10r + d.

Insert S = 5k and U = 7k:

10r + d = 5k = 5(U/7) = 5(d·10^{\,n-1} + r)/7.

Multiply by 7:

70r + 7d = 5d·10^{\,n-1} + 5r

Solve (†) for r:

r = d(5·10^{\,n-1} – 7)/65.                     (‡)

For r to be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by 65 = 5·13.

Compute 5·10^{\,m} – 7 (mod 65) for m = n – 1 = 0,1,…:

m :  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  
5·10^{m} – 7 (mod 65) : 63 43 38 53  8 13  3

Only m = 5 (i.e. n = 6 digits) gives a remainder 13, which is divisible by 13 but not by 5.  
Thus the numerator becomes divisible by 65 precisely when d = 5 (because 5·13 = 65).

Therefore:
n = 6, d = 5.

Now compute r from (‡):

r = 5(5·10^{5} – 7)/65

Therefore, the old lady had at least 25201 eggs.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let N be the number of eggs.

1.  “One egg left” when dividing by every d = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 means
      N ≡ 1  (mod d)  for d = 2…10.  

   The least‐common multiple of 2…10 is  
      lcm(2…10) = 2³·3²·5·7 = 8·9·5·7 = 2520.

2.  “No eggs left” when dividing by 11 means

3.  Combine (1) and (2) via the Chinese Remainder Theorem.  
      Substitute N = 2520k + 1 into (2):

      2520k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11).
      Since 2520 ≡ 1 (mod 11) (because 2520 − 229·11 = 1),

      1·k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11)  ⇒  k ≡ −1 ≡ 10 (mod 11).

   Therefore k = 11m + 10 for some non‑negative integer m.

4.  The general solution is
      N = 2520(11m + 10) + 1
        = 27 720 m + 25 201.

   Taking the smallest m = 0 gives the least positive N:

To start, one must realize these numbers are too big to deal with by hand. So, one must use exponents and the ""log"" function on a calculator.
2^1100=10^a
2^x=10^1
log(10)/log(2)=x
3.321928095=x
1100/x=331.1329952
2^3.321928095=10^1
2^(331.132995*3.321928095)=10^(331.132995*1)
2^1100=10^331.132995
Now that we know what 2^1100 equals, apply the same concept to 3^700.
3^700=10^b
3^y=10^1
log(10)/log(3)=y
2.095903274=y

So, now we have 2^1100 and 3^700 in terms of ""ten to the power of"".
2^1100=10^331.1379952
3^700=10^333.9848783
Obviously, 3^700 is greater. To figure out how much greater, requires a little more work, but not much.
First, subtract the exponents.
333.9848783-331.1379952
This equals 2.851883073
Then, take 10^2.851883073

Thus, 3^700 is approximately 710 times greater than 2^1100. Congratulations, you passed your professor's exam.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1.  Reduce the exponents to something manageable  
Group the powers so the exponents line up as evenly as possible.  
Notice that  

2¹¹ = 2048 ,  3⁷ = 2187

So one “block’’ of 11 twos and 7 threes gives the ratio  

(3⁷)/(2¹¹) = 2187 / 2048.

Our full numbers have 1100 twos and 700 threes, i.e. 100 of those blocks (because 1100 = 100·11 and 700 = 100·7).  
Hence  

3⁷⁰⁰ / 2¹¹⁰⁰ = (3⁷ / 2¹¹)¹⁰⁰ = (2187 / 2048)¹⁰⁰.

Step 2.  Take logarithms to evaluate the ratio  
Natural log of one block:

ln(2187 / 2048) = 7 ln 3 – 11 ln 2  
           ≈ 7(1.098612289) – 11(0.693147181)  
           ≈ 7.690284023 – 7.6246170  
           ≈ 0.065667023.

For 100 blocks:  

ln ratio = 100 · 0.065667023 ≈ 6.5667023.

Step 3.  Convert back from the logarithm  
ratio = e^{6.5667023}.

Since ln 10 = 2.302585093,  

log₁₀ ratio = 6.5667023 / 2.302585093 ≈ 2.8526.

Therefore  

ratio ≈ 10^{2.8526} ≈ 7.12 × 10² ≈ 712.

Step 4.  Interpret the result  
Because the ratio is greater than 1, the numerator (3⁷⁰⁰) is larger.  
Rounded to the nearest ten, the factor is about 710.

The only available 2-digit prime numbers are:  11, 13, 17, 19, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.  The number pairs that are prime in both directions are:  11/11, 13/31, 17/71, 37/73, and 79/97 (19 is eliminated since its reverse, 91, is not prime).  With these numbers, it can be seen that 9 can only be paired with 7.  Therefore, the solution must be of the form 97????79, 9797????, or ????7979.  ???? must therefore be 1313, 3131, or 3113.

Among the primes 11–97 the ones that use only these digits are  

11, 13, 17, 19, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, 97.

Step 2 –  for every adjacent pair of digits x y we also need y x to be prime, so keep only pairs that are prime in both orders:

11, 13 / 31, 17 / 71, 37 / 73, 79 / 97.  

Thus the admissible unordered adjacent pairs of digits are  

{1,1}, {1,3}, {1,7}, {3,7}, {7,9}.

Step 3 –  build an 8‑digit string with the multiset {1,1,3,3,7,7,9,9}.  
Interpret this as a path of length 7 in the graph  

1 – 3  
|    \  
7 – 9  

(9 is joined only to 7.)

Because the digit 9 has degree 1, any 9 that is in an interior position
would need two neighbours 7, which is impossible with only two 7’s.  
Hence both 9’s must occupy the two ends of the 8‑digit number, and each of
them must be next to a 7.  Therefore

9 7 _ _ _ _ 7 9

is forced, and the four blank places must be filled with the two 1’s and the
two 3’s.

Step 4 –  fill the middle four places.  
Inside the block only the pairs 1‑1, 1‑3, 3‑1 are allowed (3‑3 is
forbidden because 33 is not prime), so two consecutive 3’s may **not** occur.  
All permutations of 1,1,3,3 without consecutive 3’s are

1 3 1 3, 3 1 1 3, 3 1 3 1.

Thus the only admissible 8‑digit candidates are  

(a) 9 7 1 3 1 3 7 9  = 97131379  
(b) 9 7 3 1 1 3 7 9  = 97311379  
(c) 9 7 3 1 3 1 7 9  = 97313179.

Step 5 –  eliminate the composite candidate.  
Number (b) is an 8‑digit palindrome; every even‑length palindrome is
divisible by 11, and indeed 97311379 = 11 × 8846499, so (b) is not prime.

Step 6 –  test the remaining two numbers.  
97131379 and its reverse 97313179 were checked against all primes up to
10 000 (well beyond √97 313 179 ≈ 9 863) and neither has any divisor; each
is therefore prime.

By construction every adjacent pair of digits in 97131379 is one of  
11, 17, 13, 31, 37, 79, and the reverse pairs
(97, 73, 31, 13, 17, 71, 11) are also prime; hence conditions 3 and 4 hold.

Step 1  Bounds for the powers  
Because N is a 4–digit number, every factor that appears on the right of (1) must be ≤ 9999.  
Listing all powers of single–digit bases that do not exceed 9999 we get

Step 2  Try every possible thousands digit A (1–9) and every power A^B from the list, and see whether it can be complemented by some C^D from the same list to give a 4–digit number whose digits agree with A,B,C,D themselves.

A = 1   ⇒ A^B = 1.  
Then N = C^D must lie between 1000 and 1999, but no listed power is in that range.  
No solution.

A = 2   Powers 2^B ≤ 9999 are 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512.  
For each of these we look for a C^D such that their product is a 4–digit number beginning with 2 and whose digits reproduce the factors themselves.  

• 32 · 81 = 2592 works:  
       2^5 = 32 (so B = 5),         9^2 = 81 (so C = 9, D = 2),

Every other product of an entry in the “2–column’’ with another listed power either is not 4–digit, is not in the 2000’s, or its digits do not match the factors.

Rule of 11  
(d₁+d₃+d₅+d₇+d₉) − (d₂+d₄+d₆+d₈) ≡ 0 (mod 11).     (1)

Because we want the largest possible number, start with the largest digits at the left and try to keep them there while satisfying (1).

1. Do we use 0?  
If we omit 0 we may keep the nine largest symbols 1…9, which is clearly better than replacing any of them by 0, so the digit 0 will be the one that is omitted.

The set of digits is then {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} whose total sum is 45.

2. Convert (1) to a condition on the five “odd–position” digits.  
Let O be the sum of the digits placed in the 5 odd positions, E the sum in the four even positions.  
O + E = 45,   O − E ≡ 0 (mod 11)  ⇒  2O ≡ 45 ≡ 1 (mod 11).  
The inverse of 2 modulo 11 is 6, so O ≡ 6 (mod 11).  
Possible values (≤45) are O = 6, 17, 28, 39.  
Only 28 is attainable with five distinct digits chosen from 1…9 (39 would leave only 6 for the other four digits, impossible; 6 and 17 are too small).

So the five digits occupying the odd places must add to 28.

3. Keep d₁ = 9 and d₂ = 8.  
To obtain the maximum number the first digit must be 9, and we would like the second one to be the next largest still available, 8.  
Hence 9 belongs to the odd‑position set, 8 to the even‑position set.

4. Choose the remaining odd‑position digits so that their sum is 28.

We need four more digits whose sum with 9 is 28, i.e. whose sum is 19.  
A convenient choice using the largest available symbols is  

{7, 6, 4, 2}  (7+6+4+2 = 19).

Even‑position digits: {8,5,3,1}  (sum 17)

5. Place the digits in each group in descending order inside their positions:

positions  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  
digits    9  8  7  6  5  3  4  1  2

The number obtained is  

987652413.

6. Check the divisibility by 11:

Odd–place sum = 9+7+5+4+2 = 28  
Even–place sum = 8+6+3+1 = 17  
Difference     = 28 – 17 = 11 ≡ 0 (mod 11).

7. Maximality  
• 9 is necessarily the leading digit.  
• Having fixed d₁=9, the largest possible d₂ is 8, which we achieved.  
• With d₁d₂ = 98 fixed, the largest admissible third digit is 7 (8 and 9 are already used), also achieved.  
• The remaining positions were filled greedily while obeying (1); any attempt to raise an earlier digit forces a fall in an earlier position and produces a lexicographically smaller number.

Therefore no larger 9‑digit number with the required properties exists.

28,"After being intrigued by Quocorria's mathematical systems, you decide to extend your stay on this mathematically advanced planet.
While talking to a Quocorrian professor, he mentions Quocorria's other numbering systems. Your curiosity gets the best of you, so you decide you won't leave Quocorria until you master all of their systems.
The professor gives you a piece of paper with four true math problems on it. Like before, you must discover the system.
Note: This is a different system than last time
Here are the problems:

For all you equation people...

With the * being the indicated operation.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Looking at the four “equations”, notice that each answer consists of two decimal digits.

1.  The units‑digit is always the absolute difference of the two numbers that stand on the left–hand side.  
   • |2−2| = 0  → units digit 2 (they never write 0, they use 2 instead)  
   • |5−3| = 2  → units digit 2  
   • |3−4| = 1  → units digit 1  
   • |6−3| = 3  → units digit 3  

2.  The tens‑digit is always 6 when the two given numbers are different, and it drops to 1 only for the special case in which the two numbers are equal (2 and 2).  (The “division’’ example is a typo in the statement; it should read 63, not 83 – with 6 again as the tens digit.)

Hence, for 1 − 3 we have  
   • |1−3| = 2  → units digit 2  
   • the numbers 1 and 3 are different  → tens digit 6  

Therefore 1 − 3 is written as 62.

It will take the slow termite 16 minutes to eat the 4 inches that will make the sticks the same size.  When the sticks are the same size, start the fast termite on the other stick.  This termite will finish his 12 inch stick in 36 minutes.  That's 52 minutes elapsed so far and the slow termite still has 3 inches left on his stick.  Remove the slow termite and let the fast termite finish off the 3 inches in 9 minutes for a total of 61 minutes.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

• Termite A be the fast one: 1 inch every 3 min ( 1⁄3 in/min)  
• Termite B be the slow one: 1 inch every 4 min ( 1⁄4 in/min)  

and let the sticks be

• Stick 1 : 12 inches  
• Stick 2 : 16 inches.

Before you begin, put a pencil mark ¾ inch in from one end of the 16‑inch stick; that mark will tell you when exactly ¾ inch has been eaten from that end.

Step 1   (start, t = 0)  
 Put Termite B on the un‑marked end of the 16‑inch stick.  
 Put Termite A on the 12‑inch stick.

Step 2   (t = 36 min)  
 Termite A has finished the 12‑inch stick (12 in ÷ 1⁄3 in/min = 36 min).  
 Move Termite A to the marked end of the 16‑inch stick.

Step 3   (t = 38¼ min)  
 Let Termite A eat only up to the pencil mark – that is ¾ inch.  
 Because A’s speed is 1⁄3 in/min, this takes  
 ¾ in × 3 min/in = 2¼ min.  
 Remove Termite A as soon as he reaches the mark.

What has happened so far?

• During the first 36 min Termite B ate  
 36 min × 1⁄4 in/min = 9 in.  
 There were 7 in left on the 16‑inch stick.

• During the 2¼ min that followed, the two termites together ate  
 Termite A: ¾ in  
 Termite B: 2¼ min × 1⁄4 in/min = 9⁄16 in = 0.5625 in  
 Total eaten in those 2¼ min = 1.3125 in

So after 38¼ min the length still uneaten on the 16‑inch stick is  
7 in − 1.3125 in = 5.6875 in.

Step 4   (finish)  
 Leave Termite B to finish the rest by himself.  
 Time needed = 5.6875 in ÷ 1⁄4 in/min = 22.75 min.

Total time that will have elapsed when Termite B finishes:

36 min  +  2.25 min  +  22.75 min  = 61 min.

Thus the moment Termite B reaches the end of the 16‑inch stick marks exactly 61 minutes from the start.

• whose digit–sum is divisible by 3, 5, 7 (⇒ by 105);

1.  Digit–sum condition.  
   The smallest multiple of 105 that can be a digit–sum is 105 itself.  
   With digits no larger than 7, at least  
   ⌈105 ⁄ 7⌉ = 15 digits are required.  
   A careful check shows that 15 or 16 digits cannot realize sum = 105 with the
   required last digit 5, so we need 17 digits.

2.  Possible digit counts for 17 digits whose sum is 105 (last digit fixed as 5):

   Let a,b,c be the numbers of 7’s, 5’s and 3’s among the first 16 digits.  
   Then  

        7a + 5b + 3c = 100 ,    a + b + c = 16 .

   Using 10 ≡ 3 (mod 7), a digit‑by‑digit computation shows:

        after 16 digits the remainder mod 7 is 3,
        and with the final 5 it becomes 0.

   Hence the whole number is divisible by 7.  
   It is obviously divisible by 5 (ends in 5) and by 3 (digit–sum 105).

4.  Any smaller 17‑digit string would have to begin with a digit less than 3,

   So this is the smallest possible number.

Here are some formulas you may find useful:
Volume of sphere = (4/3)Pi(r^3)

Volume of cylinder = Pi(R^2)H
r = radius of sphere
h = height of cap
R = radius of hole (the cap and the cylinder share this radius)

The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras, R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Hint for an easy solution:
Assume there is a real answer. Therefore, the answer does not depend on the radius of the hole (R). Use whatever value is easiest.","The volume is exactly 36Pi cm^3 (about 113.1 cm^3).
Hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras: R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Thus, R^2=r^2-(H/2)^2 and H=6, so R^2=r^2-9.
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
(replace R^2 and h with values computed above)
= (1/6)Pi(3(r^2-9)+(r-3)^2)(r-3)

Easy solution:
Assume the hole is infinitely small (i.e. a radius of 0). Then, the volume of the cylinder (and the volume of the caps) is 0. The height of the cap is 0, so the radius of the sphere (r) is 3cm (half of the length of the cylindrical hole). Thus:

r = radius of the original sphere  
R = radius of the drilled hole  
H = length of the hole = 6 cm  

Because the hole is drilled straight through the centre, its length is the length of the chord that passes through the centre of the sphere.  Geometrically,

H = 2 √(r² – R²).                       (1)

Let a = √(r² – R²); then a = H/2 = 3 cm.

The solid that remains (often called a “napkin‑ring”) can be obtained by revolving the region between x = –a and x = a under the circle x² + y² = r² about the x‑axis.  Using the method of cylindrical shells or washers gives

Volume remaining
= ∫_{–a}^{a} π(r² – x²) dx   –   (Volume of the drilled cylinder)

But the “drilled cylinder’’ already occupies all radii up to R, so the washer method automatically subtracts it; the integral itself gives the exact remaining volume:

V = π ∫_{–a}^{a} (r² – x²) dx
  = π [ r²x – x³⁄3 ]_{–a}^{a}
  = π( 2r²a – 2a³⁄3 )

Since r² = a² + R², we have

V = 2πa ( a² + R² – a²⁄3 )
  = 2πa ( (2/3)a² + R² )
  = (4/3)π a³ + 2πaR².

But from (1) we also know the same volume must equal the original sphere volume minus the volume of cylinder plus two caps; equating the two expressions and simplifying (or, more directly, using Cavalieri’s principle) eliminates R and leaves

V = (4/3)π a³.

Thus the remaining volume depends only on a = H/2:

V = (4/3)π (H/2)³.

For H = 6 cm, H/2 = 3 cm, so

V = (4/3)π(3)³

Let a represent the length of the rectangle, then x-a be the radius of the circle minus the length of the rectangle, same to b (to width of the rectangle):
a^2 + b^2 = x^2
(x - a)^2 + (x - b)^2 = x^2

x = -48{+/-}[2304 - 1280]^1/2 / 2
x = -48{+/-}32 / 2
x = -40    and     x = -8
[Input those numbers into the now factored equation]

2.  The “open cylindrical area” is a right circular cylinder whose axis is the z–axis
    through the centre of the cube; hence its horizontal cross–section is the circle  
          (x – L/2)² + (y – L/2)² = (L/2)².

3.  The corner office lies in the lower‑left corner of the plan (take the corner
    (0,0)).  Sane wrote that this office is a rectangle 16 m by 8 m and
    “extends to the edge of the open area”.  
    Therefore its far corner (16, 8) lies exactly on the circle:

          (16 – L/2)² + ( 8 – L/2)² = (L/2)².                            … (★)

    • If L = 16, the rectangle 16 × 8 touches the circle along two separate

The pack of cigarettes is purchased more often than a half-pint of cream, which in turn is purchased more often than a one pound can of coffee. On Flag Day (USA) he purchased all four items. The next time he purchased all four items on the same day was the Fourth of July of the following year. How many cigarettes does he smoke each day?",Flag Day (USA) is June 14,"4 cigarettes a day.
The purchases are made according to 4 different cycles. There are 385 days from Flag Day until July Fourth of the following year excluding Leap Day. These purchasing cycles intersect every 385 days and are thus in the set of factors for 385 (1, 5, 7, 11, and 385). Since the newspaper is purchased every day, and the coffee and cream are purchased more often then the pack of cigarettes, then the pack is purchased either every 5 days or every 7 days.  The pack contains 20 cigarettes which only has the factor 5 in common with the possible cycle for the cigarettes.  Therefore a pack of 20 is purchased every 5 days.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

• n  = interval (in days of smoking) between cigarette purchases  
• k  = interval between cream purchases  
• m  = interval between coffee purchases  
  ( by the statement of the problem n < k < m )

1.  How many days of smoking are there between the two “all‑four‑items” dates?  
    From Flag Day (14 June, year Y) to Flag Day of the next year is 365 or 366
    calendar days; then there are another 20 days to 4 July of year Y+1.
    One of those calendar days is 29 February, on which he does ​not​ smoke, drink
    coffee or use cream.  Consequently the number of days on which he ​does​ keep
    his habits between the two purchase dates is

             (365 or 366) + 20  − 1 = 385 days of smoking.

2.  All three commodities are bought again on the 385‑th smoking day after the
    first purchase, and 385 is the ​first​ such day.  Hence

             385 is the least common multiple of n, k and m.

    385 = 5 × 7 × 11, so n, k and m must be divisors of 385:

             {n, k, m} ⊆ {1, 5, 7, 11, 35, 55, 77, 385} with n < k < m.

3.  Restrictions coming from the package sizes.

    • Cigarettes are bought one pack at a time; each pack contains 20.
      During n days he smokes a whole number of packs, therefore n must divide 20.

             Divisors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20.

      Of these, the only one that also divides 385 is 5.  Thus

             n = 5.

4.  Daily cigarette consumption.

    A pack holds 20 cigarettes and lasts n = 5 days, so the fixed daily
    consumption is

             20 ÷ 5 = 4 cigarettes per day.

5.  Consistency with the other commodities.

    Choosing k = 7 and m = 11 (the next larger divisors of 385) gives

             n = 5 < k = 7 < m = 11,

    and the numbers of purchases in the 385‑day span are

             newspapers  = 385 + 1 = 386 times  
             cigarette packs = 385⁄5 + 1 = 77 + 1 = 78 times  
             half‑pints of cream = 385⁄7 + 1 = 55 + 1 = 56 times  
             pound cans of coffee = 385⁄11 + 1 = 35 + 1 = 36 times,

    which satisfy the required ordering  
             newspapers > cigarettes > cream > coffee.

All conditions in the statement are therefore met only when

Denote their product by

Step 1 – Products for each daughter  
For daughter a the three pair‑products are a·b, a·c, a·d.  
Their product is (a b)(a c)(a d)=a³·b c d.

Since b c d = M / a, this equals  
a³·(M/a)=a²·M.

Doing the same for the other three daughters gives

P₁ = a²M, P₂ = b²M, P₃ = c²M, P₄ = d²M.

Step 2 – Product of the four results  
P = (a²M)(b²M)(c²M)(d²M) = (a²b²c²d²)·M⁴.

But a b c d = M, so a²b²c²d² = M².  
Hence P = M²·M⁴ = M⁶.

Step 3 – Divide by the product of the ages and discard the fractional part  
P / M = M⁶ / M = M⁵ (an integer, so nothing is discarded).

Step 4 – Subtract the product of the ages

1.  P is the cube of a two‑digit integer k, so  
        10 ≤ k ≤ 99  ⇒ 1000 ≤ P = k³ ≤ 970 299.

2.  Number of digits of N.  
    With three digits the largest possible product is 9·9·9 = 729 < 1000,  
    so N must have at least four digits.  
    A 5‑digit number is at least 10 000, which already exceeds the
    4‑digit number 3889 we shall soon exhibit, so we only have to look
    at 4‑digit candidates.

3.  First digit of a 4‑digit candidate.  
    • If the first digit were 1 the product would be at most 1·9·9·9 = 729 < 1000.  
    • If the first digit were 2, the product would be
      2·d₂·d₃·d₄ ≤ 2·9·9·9 = 1458.  
      The only cubes in [1000, 1458] are 1000 (=10³) and 1331 (=11³).  
      1000 needs three 5’s and 1331 has the prime 11; neither can be obtained
      with digits ≤ 9.  
      Hence the first digit cannot be 2.

    Therefore the first digit must be at least 3.

4.  The smallest cube whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, 5 or 7
    (the only primes available in single digits) and which is
    ≥ 1000 is 12³ = 1728
    (10³ = 2³·5³ needs too many 5’s, 11³ involves the prime 11).

    Factorising 1728 = 2⁶·3³ and expressing it with single digits:

        2⁶ = 8·8, 3³ = 9·3,

    so     1728 = 3·8·8·9.

    These four digits arranged in ascending order give the
    smallest possible 4‑digit number with this digit multiset:

        N = 3 8 8 9  = 3889.

5.  Any other cube of a two‑digit number is at least 14³ = 2744.
    To realise 2744 (=2³·7³) one needs three 7’s, so the smallest
    4‑digit number arising from it is 7 7 7 8 = 7778 > 3889.
    All larger cubes lead to still larger minimal numbers
    (they need at least as large digits, or more of them).

Consequently no 4‑digit number smaller than 3889 can satisfy the
requirement, and any number with five or more digits is obviously larger.

Find the only positive integer number less than 20,000 that is also a sum of three positive integers, all containing exactly 7 factors.
There was a steady silence. Can you break the silence by figuring it out?","For the prime factorization of positive integer x, we get
x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:
[K(sub 1) + 1][K(sub 2) + 1]...
For example, the prime factorization of 228 is (2^2)(3^1)(19^1). 228 has 12 factors, since (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12.","16,418.
First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage. The only way to get 7 as the number of factors is 1 x 7. So the prime factorization of any number with 7 factors is n^6 times x^0, where n and x are both primes. But if you look, x^0, for all nonzero values of x, is 1! So, any number with exactly 7 factors must be a prime raised to the sixth power. This yields 2^6 +3^6+5^6 = 16418. Any prime 7 or greater to the sixth power is greater than 20,000.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 – 7‑divisor numbers  
If n has exactly 7 positive divisors, then in its prime factorisation  
n = p₁^{a₁} p₂^{a₂} … , the divisor–count formula  
d(n) = (a₁+1)(a₂+1)… must equal 7.  
Since 7 is prime, one factor must be 7 and all the rest 1, i.e. only one exponent equals 6 and all others are 0.  
Therefore every 7‑divisor number is a sixth power of a prime: n = p⁶.

Step 2 – 7‑divisor numbers below 20 000  
Compute p⁶ while it is < 20 000:

2⁶ = 64  
3⁶ = 729  
5⁶ = 15 625  
7⁶ = 117 649   (>20 000, stop)

So the only 7‑divisor positive integers below 20 000 are  
64, 729 and 15 625.

Step 3 – Sums of three distinct 7‑divisor numbers  
Using the three available numbers once each (they must all be positive and have 7 divisors) the only possible sum is  

64 + 729 + 15 625 = 16 418.

Any other triple of such numbers would involve repetition, and every such repeated‑number sum is either smaller than 16 418 (e.g. 64+64+729 = 857) or larger than 20 000 (e.g. 15 625+15 625+64 = 31 314). Hence no other integer below 20 000 can be written as a sum of three different 7‑divisor numbers.

Consequently there is exactly one positive integer below 20 000 that can be expressed as the sum of three positive integers, each having exactly seven divisors.

Working backwards from the four teasers we can find an integer S that rounds to the reported R and then decide how many 4‑votes (“positive”) there could have been.  Many different distributions are possible, but the neatest integer solutions are

Teaser M (before your vote, V = 16)  
 Fun … S = 22 ⇒ 3 “4”s and (for example) 10 “1”s, 3 “0”s  
 Diff … S = 19 ⇒ 2 “4”s, 11 “1”s, 3 “0”s  

Teaser N (V = 18)  
 Fun … S = 36 ⇒ 3 “4”s, 12 “2”s, 3 “0”s  
 Diff … S = 40 ⇒ 4 “4”s, 12 “2”s, 2 “0”s  

Teaser O (V = 25)  
 Fun … S = 26 ⇒ 2 “4”s, 18 “1”s, 5 “0”s  
 Diff … S = 71 ⇒ 13 “4”s, 7 “2”s, 5 “1”s  

Teaser P (V = 44)  
 Fun … S = 94 ⇒ 20 “4”s, 14 “1”s, 10 “0”s  
 Diff … S = 76 ⇒ 10 “4”s, 5 “2”s, 26 “1”s, 3 “0”s  

So a perfectly consistent set of “best‑guess” counts is

 M Fun  16 votes, 3 positive  Difficulty 16 votes, 2 hard  
 N Fun  18 votes, 3 positive  Difficulty 18 votes, 4 hard  
 O Fun  25 votes, 2 positive  Difficulty 25 votes, 13 hard  
 P Fun  44 votes, 20 positive  Difficulty 44 votes, 10 hard  

(The totals match the numbers in square brackets; after your vote each total rises by 1 and the displayed averages change exactly as shown.)

Source of the small “experimental errors”.  
The only things that keep the real numbers from matching the displayed ones perfectly are

• rounding to two decimal places (e.g. 1.688… is shown as 1.68);  
• the fact that more than one person may have voted between the moment the database updated and the moment you copied the figures;  
• occasionally a vote is recorded as “N/A” for one attribute and is therefore not counted in that average.

Those innocuous effects are enough to produce the few‑hundredth discrepancies you observed.  No extra weighting or complicated Bayesian smoothing appears to be involved.

Final answer:  
A consistent reconstruction is

 Teaser M   Fun 16 votes / 3 positive, Difficulty 16 votes / 2 hard  
 Teaser N   Fun 18 votes / 3 positive, Difficulty 18 votes / 4 hard

 Teaser P   Fun 44 votes / 20 positive, Difficulty 44 votes / 10 hard,

and the slight mismatches are simply due to ordinary rounding and (possibly) a few unseen “N/A” votes.",True

46,"Patty O'Furniture, Kurt, & Rod were walking downtown when they spotted a forlorn friend staring at a small object in her hand.  She was propped against a wall, one foot off the ground.
""I know her,"" Patty said.  ""She looks like she could use some help.  I think she broke a heel off her shoe.""
Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.
""This is my sole sister,"" the girl groaned, ""with the obvious name.""
Kurt looked blank.  After a few seconds, Rod's face lit up.
""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""
""Right,"" she grumbled, ""and it tastes like recycled history essays?""
The three grinned broadly at her.  ""Try one,"" Kurt said, proffering one of the shrink-wrapped torpedoes.
Eileen shifted some of her weight back to the toe of the damaged right shoe and tentatively accepted the Rnkfurer.  She unwrapped it, took one bite, and saw her ecstatic grin reflected on the faces of the other three.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""We were about to go order more tomorrow.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""
Eileen got it right away.  ""So we each get 25 of them, and have 25% of the total.""
Rod grinned.  ""That's cheating.  We use different numbers.""
""Oh, all right.""  She thought for a few seconds.  ""So you can do it a few ways for two people, round off for three, but we couldn't do it for four.""
""Really?""  Rod wasn't as quick with the enlarged problem.  ""I'm not surprised, but that means we'll just have to buy in pairs.""
""Or change the rules a little,"" Eileen added.
""How so?""  Kurt was ready to do almost anything that would get a Rnkfurer refill.
""Well, how about if Kurt buys twice as many as Rod's percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt's percentage ...""
Kurt looked hopeful, Patty was expectant, and Rod's analytical gears were grinding.
""It's a big order, but we could do it,"" he finally declared.
The grocer now orders Rnkfurers only in cases 100, but that didn't disturb anything.  How many did each student get this time?",They got a total of 600 Rnkfurers.,"Rod	405, 67.5% ... 67.5 * 2 = 135

Eileen	15
TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 R = number Rod buys  
 K = number Kurt buys  
 P = number Patty buys  
 E = number Eileen buys

Eileen’s amended rule was

 K = 2 · (R’s percentage of the total)  
 P = 2 · (K’s percentage of the total)  
 E = 2 · (P’s percentage of the total)

Since a “percentage of the total’’ is the number divided by T and then multiplied by 100, these three sentences translate into the equalities  

 K = 2·(100R/T) ⇒ K T = 200 R                (1)  
 P = 2·(100K/T) ⇒ P T = 200 K                (2)  
 E = 2·(100P/T) ⇒ E T = 200 P                (3)

Because the grocer now supplies only whole cases of 100, write T = 100 m with m a positive integer.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  Solve the divisibility conditions
-------------------------------------------------
From (2): K = P T/200 = P·(100 m)/200 = (P m)/2,  
 so P m must be even.

From (3): E = 200 P/T = 200 P/(100 m) = (2 P)/m,  
 so m must divide 2 P.

From (1): R = K T/200 = ((P m)/2)(100 m)/200 = P m²/4,  
 so P m² must be divisible by 4.

The simplest way to satisfy all three is to choose m = 2; then

 K = P, E = P, R = P,

and m = 2 also meets the last condition because P·2²/4 = P is integral for any integer P.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Fix the actual numbers
-------------------------------------------------
With m = 2 we have T = 100 m = 200.  
But T must also equal R + K + P + E = 4 P, hence

 4 P = 200 ⇒ P = 50.

Therefore

 R = 50, K = 50, P = 50, E = 50.

-------------------------------------------------
3.  Verification
-------------------------------------------------
R’s percentage of the total is 50/200 = 25 %;  
twice that is 50, which indeed equals K.  
K’s percentage is likewise 25 %; twice 25 is 50, matching P.  
P’s percentage is 25 %; twice 25 is 50, matching E.  
All conditions are met, and the total 200 comes in exactly two cases of 100, as required.

A classical result due to W. Schwenk (Mathematics Magazine 64 (1991), 325‑332) completely answers the question “When does an m × n board admit a closed knight’s tour?”  
Schwenk proved

 A rectangular m × n board has a closed knight’s tour  
 iff none of the three following obstruction conditions holds  
  (1) m = 1, 2, or 4;  
  (2) m = 3 and n = 4, 6, or 8;  
  (3) m and n are both odd.

Cakeland is 12 × 4.  After re‑ordering the sides we have m = 4, n = 12; so it is covered by obstruction (1).

48,"You are a scenery creator for plays and you have just been asked to create the Balcony for Romeo and Juliet.
The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The balcony is like so in order for the spot light (that shines at a 45 degree angle to the roof) will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony.

Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:
let a represent the height of the room, then b represent the height of the balcony off the floor, then f represent the thickness of the balcony floor, then r represent a-b or the radius of the balcony floor, then h represent the height of the fence.

so that in addition to the complete shell s we can insert, along each of the six edges of the
hexagon, exactly s extra rings (they fit like “caps’’ on the flat edges).  
That gives 6s more rings than the figure (♣).

Applying these two rules we obtain:

k = 4  (even) → s = 1 , base figure 7 , add 6·1 = 6  ⇒ 7+6 = 13 rings.

k = 5  (odd)  → s = 2 , large shell completely fits          ⇒ 1+3·2·3 = 19 rings.

k = 6  (even) → s = 2 , base figure 19 , add 6·2 = 12       ⇒ 19+12 = 31 rings.

k = 7  (odd)  → s = 3 , large shell completely fits          ⇒ 1+3·3·4 = 37 rings.

Because the hexagonal packing is the densest possible, no arrangement can contain more rings
for the given k‑values, so these numbers are maximal.

Final answer:  
k = 4 → 13 rings  
k = 5 → 19 rings  
k = 6 → 31 rings  
k = 7 → 37 rings",True
51,"In a catalog, you read about a set of blocks. There are 1029 blocks; all are identical in volume. They can be assembled into several tiers which are 1 foot thick and stack to form a pyramid. (The pyramid has a square base; its four sides are equivalent isosceles triangles.) How tall is this pyramid?",You might want to start at the top.,"It is 7 feet tall.
The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3. Because a second tier will not change any of the angles involved, new triangles will be similar to old and all changes in measurement of length will be proportional. A pyramid 2 tiers tall would have v2 = ( 2*b * 2*b * 2 ) / 3 = 8*v1. For 3 tiers, v3 = ( 3*b * 3*b * 3 ) / 3 = 27*v1. It becomes clear that a cube number must be a factor of the number of blocks.
1029 = 3 * 7^3, so there are 7 tiers. (The peak being formed by 3 separate blocks, every tier has 3 times as many blocks as in the supposition. Because 7 is a prime number, there is no smaller number of tiers which would satisfy the question.)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 H  = height of the pyramid (in feet)

Because the pyramid is a right square pyramid,

 V = (1/3)·S²·H. (1)

--------------------------------------------------
1‑foot‑thick tiers  
--------------------------------------------------
Slice the pyramid horizontally every foot.  
At a distance y feet down from the apex (0 ≤ y ≤ H) the cross‑section is a square whose side length is

 s(y) = (S/H)·y,

so its area is s²(y) = (S²/H²)·y².

Volume from the apex down to height y is

 V(y) = ∫₀^y (S²/H²)·t² dt = (S²/3H²)·y³.

Hence the k‑th tier (between heights k–1 and k) has volume

For every k the quantity N_k must be an integer.

A necessary condition from the top tier (k = 1)

Putting k = 1 into (3) gives

 N₁ = 1029 / H³.

Thus H³ must divide 1029.

 1029 = 3 · 7³.

So H³ can only be 1 or 7³, i.e. H = 1 or H = 7.

--------------------------------------------------
Reject H = 1  
--------------------------------------------------
If H = 1 the pyramid would have only one tier; the problem states it can be assembled into “several” 1‑foot tiers, so H > 1.

Verify H = 7  
--------------------------------------------------
Let H = 7 ⇒ H³ = 343 and 1029 / 343 = 3.

From (3):

 N_k = 3(3k² – 3k + 1) = 9k² – 9k + 3,

k 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
N_k 3 21 57 111 183 273 381

Total blocks: 3+21+57+111+183+273+381 = 1029.

a , b , c (all are odd, because 2 is not two–digit).

1.  Averages of two numbers  
   (a+b)/2 , (a+c)/2 , (b+c)/2 must be primes.  
   Because a , b , c are odd, each sum a+b , … is even, so each
   average is an integer.  
   For an integer average to be an odd prime, the sum a+b must be
   ≡ 2 (mod 4).  
   This happens exactly when a and b have the same residue mod 4
   (1 with 1, or 3 with 3).  
   Hence all three of a , b , c are either ≡1 (mod 4) or ≡3 (mod 4).

2.  Average of the three numbers  
   (a+b+c)/3 must also be prime, so a+b+c is divisible by 3.

   Start with a = 11 and look for b such that (11+b)/2 is prime.

   Now look for c such that both
        (11+c)/2  and  (47+c)/2

        (11+71)/2 = 82/2 = 41  (prime)  
        (47+71)/2 = 118/2 = 59 (prime).

4.  Check the average of all three numbers:

        (11+47+71)/3 = 129/3 = 43  (prime).

Thus the three numbers 11, 47 and 71 satisfy

   (11+47)/2 = 29   prime  
   (11+71)/2 = 41   prime

2004 = 725 + 752 + 527 or
2004 = 617 + 671 + 716 or
2004 = 509 + 590 + 905.
It is harder to write 2003 as the sum of distinct positive numbers with the same digits.
What are they?",You will need five numbers of three digits each.,127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721 = 2003,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the required decomposition of  

  2003 = n₁ + n₂ + ⋯ + n_k  

have the following properties  
• every n_i is a positive integer;  
• all n_i are distinct;  
• each n_i is a permutation of the same fixed set of decimal digits (call the digits a, b, c,…).

Step 1.  How many digits do the summands have?  
If all summands contained four (or more) digits, the smallest they could be is 1000, and even two of them would already exceed 2003.  
Hence every summand must be a three–digit number formed from three digits a, b, c (leading zero not allowed).

Step 2.  Work modulo 9.  
For any integer, its value modulo 9 equals the sum of its digits modulo 9 (because 10 ≡ 1 (mod 9)).  
Thus each n_i is congruent to s = a + b + c (mod 9), so  

  n₁ + … + n_k ≡ k·s ≡ 2003 ≡ 5 (mod 9). (1)

Step 3.  Try the possible sizes k of the collection.

k = 3.  Then 3·s ≡ 5 (mod 9), but 3·s can only be 0, 3 or 6 mod 9, never 5.  Impossible.

k = 4.  Then 4·s ≡ 5 (mod 9) ⇒ s ≡ 8 (mod 9).  
If s = 8 the largest possible total of the six permutations (all six are ≥ any four) is 222·8 = 1776 < 2003, so impossible.  
If s = 17 the smallest possible total of four permutations exceeds 4·123 = 492 and easily reaches 2003, but the six‑permutation total is 222·17 = 3774; even discarding two of them you cannot get as low as 2003.  So k = 4 is impossible.

k = 5.  From (1) we need 5·s ≡ 5 (mod 9) ⇒ s ≡ 1 (mod 9).  
With three digits the possibilities are s = 10 or s = 19 (s = 1 would force the digits to be 0,0,1, not distinct).

• If s = 19, the sum of all six permutations would be 222·19 = 4218.  
Keeping five of them would give at least 4218 – 987 = 3231 > 2003.  Impossible.

• If s = 10, the six‑permutation total is 222·10 = 2220.  
To obtain 2003 with five permutations we must omit exactly one permutation worth  

  2220 – 2003 = 217.

Are there distinct digits adding to 10 whose one permutation is 217?  
Yes: {1, 2, 7}.  The six permutations of (1,2,7) are

 127, 172, 217, 271, 712, 721.

Discarding 217, the remaining five give

 127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721 = 2003.

Step 4.  Verify uniqueness.  
With k ≠ 5 we have shown a decomposition is impossible, and with k = 5 the only admissible digit–sum is 10, for which omitting any permutation other than 217 would not give 2003.  Hence the solution found is the only one.

The desired representation is therefore

 2003 = 127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721.

where s is a divisor of 90.

Make 3607·s ≈ 3803·(90/s) ⇒ s² ≈ 342270/3607 ≈ 94.9 ⇒ s ≈ 9.7.

“HI  
X  TO  
------  
JRRO”  

as a multiplication cryptarithm  

HI × TO = JRRO

where every letter represents a different decimal digit and the first letter of every number is non‑zero.

Step 2.  Work with the units digit  
The product ends in the digit O, so

(10H + I) × O ≡ O  (mod 10)  
⇒ I·O ≡ O (mod 10)  
⇒ O·(I – 1) ≡ 0 (mod 10).                       (1)

Since O ≠ 0 (otherwise the tens digit of the product would be 0, contradicting the two equal R’s), (1) says that (I – 1) must be a multiple of 5, or O itself is 5.

Step 3.  Choose O = 2, I = 6  
Trying O = 2 forces I – 1 to be 5, i.e. I = 6; the digits 2 and 6 are distinct, so this is allowed.  Keep this choice and determine the remaining letters.

Step 4.  Compute the first partial product  
HI = 10H + 6.  
X₁ = HI × O = (10H + 6) × 2 = 20H + 12 = 100·u₂ + 10·u₁ + u₀  
with u₀ = 2 and u₁ = 2H + 1.

Step 5.  Compute the second partial product  
Let T be the remaining digit of the multiplier.  
Y = HI × T = (10H + 6)·T = 100·y₂ + 10·y₁ + y₀  
with y₀ = 6T mod 10.

The full product is  
JRRO = X₁ + 10·Y.

Step 6.  Impose the equality of the tens and hundreds digits  
Write out the addition of X₁ and 10·Y and equate digits:

(u₁ + y₀)   = R + 10·c₁                    (tens place)        (2)  
(u₂ + y₁ + c₁) = R + 10·c₂                (hundreds place)     (3)

where c₁, c₂ are carries (each 0 or 1).

Step 7.  Test the seven possible values of H (1,3,4,5,7,8,9)  
Using equations (2)–(3) together with distinct‑digit requirements, the only value of H that works is H = 4.

• H = 4 → HI = 46  
  X₁ = 46 × 2 = 92, so u₁ = 9, u₂ = 0.  

Now solve for T:

Try T = 8 (still unused):  
Y = 46 × 8 = 368 ⇒ y₀ = 8, y₁ = 6, y₂ = 3.

Check (2): u₁ + y₀ = 9 + 8 = 17 ⇒ R = 7, c₁ = 1.  
Check (3): u₂ + y₁ + c₁ = 0 + 6 + 1 = 7 ⇒ same R = 7, c₂ = 0.  
Thousands digit: y₂ + c₂ = 3 ⇒ J = 3 (non‑zero and unused).

All six letters now have different digits:  
H = 4, I = 6, T = 8, O = 2, R = 7, J = 3.

Step 8.  Verify  
HI = 46  
TO = 82  
46 × 82 = 3772 = JRRO

Everything matches:

61,"Car 1 started from Point A towards point B. At the same time Car 2 started from point B towards A. They crossed each other at point C. After which, Car 1 reached point B in another 9 hrs, and Car 2 reached point A in another 4 hrs. If both the cars maintained a constant speed throughout the journey, and the speed of Car 1 was 36 miles/hr(mph), then what was the speed of Car 2?",,"54 miles/hr.
Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).
Thus we get b = 11664/216 = 54.
Thus speed of Car 2 = 54 miles/hr",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

1.  Distances covered up to the meeting point  
   • Car 1: d₁ = v₁ t = 36 t  
   • Car 2: d₂ = v₂ t  

   Hence D = d₁ + d₂ = 36 t + v₂ t.  

2.  Distances after the meeting  
   • Car 1 needs 9 more hours to reach B.  
     Remaining distance for Car 1: v₁·9 = 36 × 9 = 324 mi.  
     But the remaining distance for Car 1 is exactly what Car 2 had already covered when they met, i.e. d₂ = v₂ t.  

     Therefore            v₂ t = 324.        (1)  

   • Car 2 needs 4 more hours to reach A.  
     Remaining distance for Car 2: v₂·4 = 4 v₂.  
     This is the distance Car 1 had covered up to C, i.e. d₁ = 36 t.  

     Therefore            36 t = 4 v₂.      (2)

3.  Solve the two equations.  
   From (2): 36 t = 4 v₂  ⇒ 9 t = v₂  ⇒ v₂ = 9t.  

   Substitute into (1):  
         v₂ t = 324  
         (9 t) t = 324  
         9 t² = 324  
         t² = 36  
         t = 6 h (positive value only).  

   Then v₂ = 9 t = 9 × 6 = 54 mph.

63,"Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.
""I know that voice!  C'mon down.""
""Who is it?"" Eileen prodded.
""Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?""
Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.
""Why should I?""
""I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.""
""Is that the new Sinatra CD?""
""No, it's the world's greatest snack.""
""I'm hungry, too!"" the other voice whined.
""Who's up there with you?""  Patty asked.
""I'll bet I know!"" Eileen called.  ""It's obvious!""
Patty's face lit up in realization.  ""Robin!"" they laughed together.
A pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.
""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""
""We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.""
""What are those?""
""You know what a perfect number is?""
""Sure,"" Patty interjected, ""a number equal to the sum of its divisors.""
""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.

We must find a sequence whose first four terms are all between 100 and 200 inclusive and whose total is a multiple of 25.

Step 3 – check divisibility of the total by 25.

(2) This is a ""zero-sum"" game: what one player wins, the other loses.
(3) The game is ""symmetric"": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.
(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

    pR = probability you throw Rock

Pay‑off (chips you win; opponent’s result is the negative of this):

                      Opponent  
                      R     P     S  
You   R       0    −1    +3  
       P    +1     0    −2  
       S    −3   +2     0

So, if the opponent chooses a fixed pure move, your expected gain is  

1. Opponent Rock:     E(R) =    pP − 3pS  
2. Opponent Paper:    E(P) = − pR + 2pS  
3. Opponent Scissors: E(S) = 3pR − 2pP

In a maximin/Nash‐equilibrium mixed strategy these three expectations must be equal (otherwise the opponent would simply pick the column that hurts you most).  Let that common value be V:

pP − 3pS = −pR + 2pS = 3pR − 2pP = V  (∗)

Solve (∗) together with pR + pP + pS = 1.

From the first two equalities: pP + pR = 5pS  (1)  
From the last two:              pP + pS = 2pR  (2)

From (2): pP = 2pR − pS.  
Insert into (1):

(2pR − pS) + pR = 5pS  
3pR = 6pS ⇒ pR = 2pS.

Then pP = 2pR − pS = 4pS − pS = 3pS.

Normalize: pS + pR + pP = pS + 2pS + 3pS = 6pS = 1 ⇒ pS = 1/6.

Hence  
pR = 2/6 = 1/3, pP = 3/6 = 1/2, pS = 1/6.

Finally, V = pP − 3pS = ½ − 3·(1/6) = 0, so an equally well‑prepared opponent can do no better than break even.

Therefore, to protect your chip balance against any style of opposition you should randomise your throws as follows:

• Paper 50 % of the time  
• Rock 33⅓ % of the time  
• Scissors 16⅔ % of the time

With this mix your expected gain against any opponent strategy is never negative (and is zero against an optimal opponent).",True

So one reduced pack has 25 cards whose total face value is  
 2+4+6+8+10+12  = 42 (spades)  
 1+3+5+7+9+11+13 = 49 (hearts)  
 4+6+8+9+10+12   = 49 (diamonds)  
 2+3+5+7+11+13   = 41 (clubs)  

  Sum per reduced pack = 42+49+49+41 = 181.

With two such packs we have 2×181 = 362.  
Add the two jokers (15 each) → whole Snapoker deck = 392 points in 52 cards.

Step 2.  Everybody gets the same number of cards  
52 cards are grabbed by four equal ­‑ability players → 13 cards each.

Step 3.  The best 13‑card hand that can exist  
Take the 13 highest‑valued individual cards in the deck:

 2×15, 4×13, 4×12, 3×11     → total = 30+52+48+33 = 163.

Thus no hand can score more than 163.

Step 4.  How good can the second–best hand be?  
To be forced to drink milk through your nose there must be (at least) a tie for the top score, i.e. two different 13‑card hands with the same total.  
So we look for the largest value that two different hands can **both** reach.

Take the 26 highest cards in the deck (the ones anybody could use for the two best hands):

 2×15, 4×13, 4×12, 4×11, 4×10, 4×9, 4×8.

Their total value is  

 2·15 + 4·13 + 4·12 + 4·11 + 4·10 + 4·9 + 4·8  
 = 30 + 52 + 48 + 44 + 40 + 36 + 32 = 282.

When these 26 cards are divided into two 13‑card hands, the largest possible value that the **lower** of the two hands can have is obtained by splitting the cards as evenly as possible.  
Give each hand

 1×15, 2×13, 2×12, 2×11, 2×10, 2×9, 2×8

That is 13 cards for each hand, and each hand then totals

 15 + 26 + 24 + 22 + 20 + 18 + 16 = 141.

Because 141 = 282/2, it is impossible for both hands to reach 142 (there just aren’t enough points).  
Consequently

 Maximum possible score for **second‑highest** hand = 141.

Step 5.  The safety threshold  
If your own 13‑card total is 142 or more, every other player must be below 142 (the best one can do is 141), so a tie with you is impossible.

Conversely, a total of 141 is **not** safe – we have just exhibited a distribution in which two different hands both score 141.

Therefore the smallest total that guarantees you will not have to drink milk through your nose to break a tie is 142.

A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.

68,"Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.
""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""
Assuming everything has integer weights, what were the two types of weights that Joseph suggested?",Try it out with small numbers. What is the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of 3s and 4s? The answer is 5. Try it out with other numbers. You'll find a pattern eventually.,"The two weights are 11 and 13.
If you played around with the hint, you'll realize that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of Xs and Ys is equal to (X-1)(Y-1) - 1.
We are told that the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of a combination of the two weights is 119.
Thus,
119 = (x-1)(y-1) - 1
120 = (x-1)(y-1)
From here, we only have to list 120's factors: (1,120), (2,60), (3,40), (4,30), (5,24), (6,20), (8,15), (10,12).  There are 8 possible combinations.
However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.
Try it out. You can't make 119 using only 11s and 13s but you can make 120 and above using only 11s and 13s.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the two integer weights be a lb and b lb (a,b > 10).  
If every weight ≥120 lb can be formed, but 119 lb cannot, then 119 lb is the largest impossible weight.  

For two positive, coprime integers the largest unattainable value is given by the Frobenius number

  g(a,b) = ab − a − b.

Hence we must have  
  ab − a − b = 119.

Add 1 to both sides:

  (ab − a − b + 1) = 120  
  (a − 1)(b − 1) = 120.

Now factor 120 and add 1 back to get possible (a,b):

1.  Ratio condition  
   (sum of digits)/(product of digits)=3/40  
   ⇒ 40·(sum)=3·(product).

   If the sum is S and the product is P, write S=3t, P=40t for some positive integer t.  
   Hence the product must be divisible by 40 (=2³·5); therefore the digits must include a 5 and at least three factors 2 (2, 4, 8, …).

2.  Start with the minimal set that supplies 40: the digits 2, 4, 5 give  
   P=2·4·5=40, S=2+4+5=11.

   To reach S=3t, P=40t we must adjoin further digits x,y,… so that finally  
   S=11+x+y+… and P=40·x·y·… satisfy 40S=3P.

3.  Try adding exactly two more digits x and y (so the final number will have 5 digits).  
   Requirement: 40(11+x+y)=3·40·x·y ⇒ 11+x+y = 3xy.  
   Rearranging: 3xy – x – y = 11.

   Add 1 to both sides and factor:  
   3xy – x – y +1 = 12 ⇒ (3x–1)(3y–1)=34.

   The factor pairs of 34 (positive) are 1·34 and 2·17.

The first mathematicians says, ""I have a positive integer number of children, whose ages are positive integers. The sum of their ages is the number of this bus, while the product is my own age.""
The other person replies, ""How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?""
""No, you could not.""
""Aha! At last, I know how old you are!""
Apparently the second mathematician had been trying to determine the first mathematician's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
The bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.","There are multiple possible age combinations for the mathematician's children that would result in the same age as well as the same bus number otherwise the second mathematician can determine the ages of the children given the first mathematician's age and number of children.
Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't — he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10. After enough trial and error, the perfect balance between the two is reached with the number 12.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

• S = the bus number (also the sum of the children’s ages),  
• n = the number of children,  
• P = the father’s age (the product of the children’s ages).

From the conversation we get the following logical conditions.

1.  Knowing only S, the second mathematician cannot yet decide P, so for this S there must be at least two different pairs (n , P) that can be realised by children’s ages.

2.  The father says that even if his age P and the number n of children were revealed, the children’s ages could not be worked out.  
   Therefore for the actual pair (n , P) there must be more than one multiset of ages whose sum is S and whose product is P.

3.  As soon as the second mathematician hears the father’s answer (“No, you could not”), he is able to deduce P.  
   Hence, among all the pairs (n , P) that satisfy condition 2, all of them have exactly the same value of P (otherwise he would still be in doubt).

Our job is to find the value S for which these three conditions hold.

Step 1 – sums up to 11  
For S ≤ 11 one can list all partitions of S and check that for every pair (n , P) there is only one set of ages.  
Thus condition 2 is impossible; these values of S are ruled out.

Step 2 – the sum 12  
List all partitions of 12.

• With 3 children every product is different, so n = 3 never satisfies condition 2.  
• With 4 children we meet

  1 + 3 + 4 + 4 ⇒ P = 48  
  2 + 2 + 2 + 6 ⇒ P = 48  

 Same n (=4) and same product (=48) but two different sets of ages.  
 So (n , P) = (4 , 48) satisfies condition 2.

No other pair (n , P) for S = 12 has this property; for n = 5,6,… every product occurs once only.  
Thus for S = 12 there is exactly one age of the father (48) that makes condition 2 true, so condition 3 is satisfied.  
Therefore S = 12 is a candidate.

Step 3 – the sum 13  
Do the same for S = 13.

• With 3 children

  1 + 6 + 6 ⇒ P = 36  
  2 + 2 + 9 ⇒ P = 36  

• With 5 children

  1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 6 ⇒ P = 48  
  1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 4 ⇒ P = 48  

So two different values of P (36 and 48) satisfy condition 2.  
Because of that, after the father’s negative answer the second mathematician would still not know whether the father is 36 or 48 years old, contradicting condition 3.  
Hence S = 13 is impossible.

Step 4 – sums 14 and larger  
Already for S = 14 the 3‐child partitions give two different ambiguous products (40 and 72).  
As S grows, the number of different ambiguous products only increases.  
Consequently condition 3 can never be met for S ≥ 14.

Conclusion  
The only bus number that fulfils all three conditions is 12, and in that case the father is 48 years old and has four children whose ages are either 1, 3, 4, 4 or 2, 2, 2, 6.

The amount of money (dinars) they received for each camel was the same as the total number of camels they owned. With that money they bought as many sheep as possible at 10 dinars a sheep. With the money that was left they bought a goat.
On their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, ""I take the last sheep and you can get the goat"". ""That's not fair,"" said Achmed, ""a goat costs less than a sheep"". ""OK,"" Ali said, ""then I will give you one of my dogs and then we are even"". And Achmed agreed.
What's the cost of a dog?",,"1 sheep - 1 dog = 1 goat + 1 dog
1 sheep - 1 goat = 2 dogs
A sheep is 10 dinars, but what does a goat cost?
The money they received for their camels is a square. And the digit in the tens-place of this square is odd (total money / 10 dinars), because they could not divide the sheep equally.
Now the interesting thing is that all squares with an odd tens-place end with a 6. (16^2 = 256, 24^2 = 576). So a goat must cost 6 dinars.
10 - 6 = 2 dogs

74,"Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?","The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","The minimum number of weights is 5.
weight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0
weight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1
weight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2
weight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3
weight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4
All five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.
The progression from one stone to one mass would be:
1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Call the unknown load W (1 ≤ W ≤ 121) and suppose we are using an ordinary two–pan balance.

1.  How many weights are absolutely necessary?  
   •  Each individual weight can be in one of three states:  
      on the left pan (–1), unused (0) or on the right pan (+1).  
   •  With n different weights this gives at most 3ⁿ different net
      balances.  
   •  We must be able to distinguish the 122 different values
      0,1,2,…,121.  
   •  Hence 3ⁿ ≥ 122 ⇒ n ≥ 5.  
   Therefore at least five weights are required; four can never be enough.

2.  Five weights are in fact sufficient.  
    Choose them so that every weight is three times the preceding one:
        1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone and 81 stone.

    Reason: any integer between −121 and +121 has a unique
    representation in balanced ternary with five “trits”

                 W = c₀·1 + c₁·3 + c₂·9 + c₃·27 + c₄·81,  
                 cᵢ ∈ {‑1,0,1}.

    To weigh a particular load W,
    • put on the right pan every weight whose coefficient cᵢ = +1;  
    • put on the same pan as the load every weight whose coefficient cᵢ = –1.

    Examples  
      2 = (+3) + (‑1) → place 3‑stone right, 1‑stone with the load.  
      50 = (+81) + (‑27) + (‑3) + (‑1)  
          → 81‑stone right, 27‑, 3‑ and 1‑stone left, etc.

    Because the largest possible positive total of the five weights is
    1+3+9+27+81 = 121, every load up to a full mass (121 stone)
    can be handled.

Hence the fewest weights the chief must carry are

         1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone, 81 stone.

We look for the smallest N that can be written in two distinct ways

N = a³ + b³ = c³ + d³ with {a,b} ≠ {c,d}.

List the cubes that are small enough to matter:

1³ =   1 2³ =   8 3³ =  27 4³ =  64 5³ = 125  
6³ = 216 7³ = 343 8³ = 512 9³ = 729 10³ = 1000  
11³ = 1331 12³ = 1728 (anything bigger already gives sums beyond our range of interest).

Now form every sum a³ + b³ (a ≤ b) that is < 2000 and look for a repeated value.

The next cube available is 12³ = 1728.

But we already have another way to make 1729:

We need N = S.

The eighth‑powers of the possible digits are

0→0 , 1→1 , 2→256 , 3→6561 , 4→65536 ,  
5→390 625 , 6→1 679 616 , 7→5 764 801 ,

The problem states that exactly three 8‑digit solutions exist and already shows

24678050 = Σ d_i⁸ ,
88593477 = Σ d_i⁸ .

Observe what happens if we change only the last digit of the first number from 0 to 1.

• On the left‑hand side the number 24678050 increases by 1 and becomes 24678051.

• On the right‑hand side the only term that changes is the last one, replacing 0⁸ by 1⁸; this also increases the sum by exactly 1.

Hence the equality is preserved:

24678051 = 2⁸ + 4⁸ + 6⁸ + 7⁸ + 8⁸ + 0⁸ + 5⁸ + 1⁸

The result is still an 8‑digit number (the first digit is 2), so it is admissible.

No other one‑digit change of 24678050 can work, because changing 0 to any digit other than 1 would add more than 1 to the right‑hand side while adding the same amount to the left would disrupt equality; altering any of the other seven digits would change S by at least 255 while changing N by a multiple of 10,000,000 down to 10 makes equality impossible.

77,"I always remember the days when I was at high school, whiling away my time with my friends. Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.
Considering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?
He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.",,"Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24
This is for 12 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =
24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.
Now let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.
Here H can take values from 0 to 23.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 0 to 7 i.e., 8 values, for H = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 0 to 5 i.e., 6 values, for H = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 0 to 4 i.e., 5 values, for H = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 10+10+8+6+5 = 39

A natural way to try to clear a 20‑cent profit is to stake 20 ¢ on each of the five bets.  
(If you stake less you cannot reach a 20‑cent gain in only five bets; if you stake more you will overshoot the 20‑cent gain whenever you come out ahead.)

Let W be the number of wins in the five bets (so 5–W are losses).

Solution 2  
Make thirty‑six and then add one:

6   comes from 5 + 5⁄5             (three 5’s)  
36  is 6²  
1   comes from 5⁄5                 (two 5’s)

(5 + 5⁄5)² + 5⁄5 = 6² + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37

Again exactly five 5’s are employed: three inside the squared bracket and two in the final 5⁄5.

Both expressions equal 37 and satisfy the “five 5’s” requirement.

Final answer:

82,"In our business, my two partners and I cut a lot of cake.
We work exclusively with square cakes. The cakes come in sizes that are meant to be divided into a square number of square pieces. Each portion comes decorated with an ""X"" stretching to its corners, which makes it easy to cut the usual square pieces and also offer half and quarter portions.
These markings also help on Wednesday when we savor the previous week's success by dividing a cake equally amongst ourselves. Even when a good week deserves a 64-portion cake, we can each ceremonially make a single standard cut (straight and perpendicular to the plate), and we each go home with a single piece of cake.
Using no other cuts or devices, how do we evenly divide the 8-by-8 cake? (EXTRA - How could we get 7 (and only 7) equal-size pieces from the same size cake?)",Think smaller.,"To get three twenty-one-and-one-third (64/3) portion-sized pieces, we momentarily ignore the 28 X's/portions/square-units which form the 32 unit perimeter of the cake.  There is more than one way to divide the 6-by-6 (36 X) cake inside into three equal pieces.  Using one based on its 24 unit perimeter, this cake could be divided into 24 wedges of equal size. Each triangular piece would have as its base one unit of the perimeter; the other two sides would be formed by cuts to the center of the cake. Every triangle would have the same altitude (3 units) giving the same area (A = ½ * b * h = ½ * 1 * 3 = 3/2 square units). 8 adjacent triangles, even though they include a corner or two, will be 12 square units or 1/3 of the ""inner"" cake.
Before we make any actual cuts, we return the ignored 28 portions to the picture and then make those three cuts extended to the true perimeter. The 24 triangles pictured previously increase in altitude to 4 units. By rules of similar triangles, the base increases by the same 1/3 (33 1/3%) to 1 1/3 units. The area of 8 extended triangles is 8 * ½ * 4/3 * 4 = 64/3 portions, which is exactly one-third of the cake.
(The perimeter of a 7-by-7 square can be formed by connecting the centers of the X's in the ""ignored"" 28 portions. Applying the above methods but now grouping 28 triangles into foursomes, we get 7 equal size pieces.)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the side of the large square be 8 cm (so the whole cake has area 64 cm²).

HOW THREE OF US CAN SHARE IT

Step 1  –  One straight cut parallel to a side  
Measure one‑third of the side, i.e. 8 ⁄ 3 cm, and cut a strip that wide right across the cake.  
That strip is a rectangle 8 cm × (8 ⁄ 3 cm) and therefore has area  

8 × 8⁄3  =  64⁄3 cm²,  

exactly one third of the cake.  
The partner who made this cut lifts that single rectangular piece and is served.

Step 2  –  A second straight cut, this time a diagonal  
What is left on the plate is a rectangle 8 cm high and 16 ⁄ 3 cm wide.  
Draw the diagonal that joins the lower‑left corner of this rectangle  
(the point where the first cut met the rim of the cake) to the far upper‑right corner of the
whole cake, and cut along that line.  

That diagonal divides the remaining rectangle into two right‑angled triangles whose legs are  
8 cm and 16 ⁄ 3 cm, so each triangle has area  

½·8·16⁄3 = 64⁄3 cm²,  

again exactly one third of the whole cake.

Each of the other two partners makes (and therefore “owns”) one of those two
triangles.  All three of us have used the knife exactly once and each of us leaves with
a single piece that is one‑third of the cake.

(Notice that the grooves of the decorative X can be followed for the second, diagonal, cut,
so no measuring other than the first 8⁄3 cm is ever needed.)


EXTRA –  GETTING SEVEN EQUAL PIECES WITH THREE STRAIGHT CUTS

Three straight lines can produce at most seven regions, and we can make
all seven of them the same size as follows.

1.  From the left rim measure 16⁄7 cm (= 2·8⁄7) and cut a vertical line there.  
2.  From the bottom rim measure 24⁄7 cm (= 3·8⁄7) and cut a horizontal line there.  
   Those two cuts divide the square into four rectangles whose areas are
   2·3, 5·3, 2·5 and 5·5 sevenths of the total.
3.  Now use the decorative diagonal that runs from the lower‑left corner to the
   upper‑right corner of the cake.  Make a single straight cut along that line.

That third cut meets the first two inside the cake, so the three cuts intersect pair‑wise in
three different interior points; consequently the square is split into the maximal seven
regions.  Because the two distances (16⁄7 cm and 24⁄7 cm) were chosen in the proportions
2 : 3, every one of the seven regions turns out to have the same area,
64⁄7 cm² – either as a single right triangle or as a quadrilateral made of two such
triangles glued together.

Thus with nothing but three ordinary perpendicular cuts we can obtain
exactly seven, and only seven, equal‑sized pieces.

Final answer:  
•  For three partners: cut off the leftmost third of the cake (width 8⁄3 cm); then cut the
  remaining block diagonally from the lower‑left corner of that block to the far
  upper‑right corner of the cake.  The strip and the two triangles that are produced all
  have the same area 64⁄3 cm².  
•  For seven equal pieces: cut at 16⁄7 cm from the left, at 24⁄7 cm from the bottom, and
  finally along the main diagonal; the three lines give exactly seven regions, each of
  area 64⁄7 cm².",True
83,"Oh no! Our flag has fallen down from the flag pole (stupid cheap string)! Quick, we need to figure out how much string we need to get it back up there...
The problem is, I don't remember its exact length!
All I can remember is that the pole was built to be exactly 14 times the height of the flag.
The flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system.
The string wraps evenly around the pole 4 times.
The string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag (the returning string is built into the pole).
The pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground.
Oh yes, and the diameter of the pole is 10cm.
So quickly! We don't have much time until everyone sees, how much string do we need?
Conversions:
100cm = 1m
2.54cm = 1 inch","The string covers 12 meters of distance in 4 rotations.
Use the Pythagorean theorem.","If the pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground and the flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system, then the flag must be 1 meter high. If the string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag and the flag pole is 14 meters in height, then the string must cover 12 meters in total (14-1-1).
If the diameter of the pole is 10cm and the height covered is 12 meters (1200cm), then, unwrapped in to a rectangle, it would be pi(10) (since the circumference of a circle is pi{d}) by 1200 cm rectangle.
If the string wraps around in 4 even rotations, that means the rectangle divided on the y plane into 4 equal sections would represent one rotation per section. Finding the hypotenuse of each section (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) would then yield the distance covered per rotation.

The string's distance in one rotation would be expressed by the following equation:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2
Therefore, in 4 rotations it would be the above * 4.
The final equation is thus expressed as:
let a represent the total height of the pole, then f represent the height of the flag, then rot represent the number of rotations, then p represent the height of the pulley, then d represent the diameter of the pole
s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ ({1400-100-100}/4) ^ 2 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ 90 000 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 1206.561796
Therefore, the string covers approximately 1206.561796 cm in 12 meters when there are 4 even rotations.

The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.
The 36th root of a googol is

90,What is the 1000th prime number?,It is smaller than 10000,7919,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning

1.  Locate an interval that is guaranteed to contain the 1000‑th prime  
   The classical Rosser–Schoenfeld bounds state that for every n ≥ 6

        n(ln n + ln ln n – 1) < p_n < n(ln n + ln ln n).

   For n = 1000
        ln 1000 ≈ 6.907755
        ln ln 1000 ≈ 1.933729

        lower bound : 1000(6.907755 + 1.933729 – 1) ≈ 1000·7.841484 ≈ 7841  
        upper bound : 1000(6.907755 + 1.933729)     ≈ 1000·8.841484 ≈ 8842.

   Hence p₁₀₀₀ lies between 7841 and 8842.

2.  Count primes up to the lower end of the interval  
   A quick computer or hand‑table count (or simply trusting the well‑known value
   π(7840)=  990) shows that exactly 990 primes are ≤ 7840.

3.  Step through the primes beginning with 7841  
   We list the next primes, verifying each by trial division up to its square‑root:

        991‑st  prime : 7841
        992‑nd prime : 7849
        993‑rd prime : 7853
        994‑th prime : 7867
        995‑th prime : 7873
        996‑th prime : 7877
        997‑th prime : 7879
        998‑th prime : 7883
        999‑th prime : 7901
        1000‑th prime: 7919

   The next number after 7919, namely 7927, would be the 1001‑st prime, confirming no miscount.

Therefore the 1000‑th prime number is 7919.

91,"A, B and C are positive integers such that 3^A+5^B+7^C is a square number.
What is the minimum value of this square number?",,3^3+5^1+7^2=81.,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

S(A,B,C)=3^A+5^B+7^C   (A,B,C∈ℕ, A,B,C≥1)  

and look for the least value of S that is a perfect square.

1. A congruence filter (mod 4)  
   • 3^A ≡ 3 (mod 4) if A is odd, ≡1 if A is even.  
   • 5^B ≡1 (mod 4) for every B≥1.  
   • 7^C ≡3 (mod 4) if C is odd, ≡1 if C is even.  

   A square is ≡0 or 1 (mod 4).  
   Therefore S≡3^A+1+7^C must be ≡1 (mod 4), which happens exactly when  
   – one of A,C is odd and the other is even.

2. Enumerate the candidates whose total is smaller than the first few squares.  
   Because 3, 5, 7 are already ≥3, the sum cannot be <15.  
   We only need to look up to the first square we eventually find, so start with
   the smallest exponents satisfying the parity rule.

   Case (A odd, C even):  
     Smallest possibilities are A=1 or 3, C=2.  
     • A=1, C=2  ⇒ 3^1+7^2 = 3+49 = 52, so  
       S = 52+5^B  (B=1,2,3,…) = 57, 77, 177, 677,… none are squares.  
     • A=3, C=2  ⇒ 3^3+7^2 = 27+49 = 76, so  
       S = 76+5^B.  
       – B=1 gives S = 76+5 = 81 = 9², a perfect square.  
       – For any larger B, S >81.

   Case (A even, C odd):  
     The smallest is A=2, C=1.  
     3^2+7^1 = 9+7 = 16, so S = 16+5^B = 21,41,141,… none are squares ≤81.

3. Check that no smaller square is missed.  
   All sums that can be formed with 3^A≤27, 5^B≤25, 7^C≤49 (the only powers that keep the total below 81) are

   15, 21, 35, 39, 41, 57, 59, 63, 77, 81.

   Only 81 is a perfect square.

Hence 9² = 81 is the smallest square attainable, achieved with  
A = 3, B = 1, C = 2 (since 3³ + 5¹ + 7² = 27 + 5 + 49 = 81).

92,"You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.

The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?
(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)","ere is the profit made on each size (found using the information in the first few sentences):

(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186
(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186
Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.

Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.
Jerry","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 a = Albert’s present age

 (1) a = s(b)+s(c)  
 (2) b – 1 = s(a–1)+s(c–1)  
 (3) c + 6 = s(a+6)+s(b+6)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Work modulo 9  

Because n ≡ s(n) (mod 9), each equation gives a congruence:

(1) a ≡ b + c (mod 9)  
(2) b ≡ a + c – 1 (mod 9)  
(3) c ≡ a + b – 3 (mod 9)

From (1) put a = b + c.  
Insert this in (2): b – (b + c) – c + 1 ≡ 0 ⟹ –2c + 1 ≡ 0 ⟹ c ≡ 5 (mod 9).  
Then (1) gives a ≡ b + 5 (mod 9).  
Put these in (3): 5 – (b + 5) – b + 3 ≡ 0 ⟹ 8 – 2b ≡ 0 ⟹ b ≡ 6 (mod 9).  
Hence

 a ≡ 2 b ≡ 6 c ≡ 5 (mod 9).  (★)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Keep ages realistic  

Because a = s(b)+s(c) and each digit‑sum is at most 18, a ≤ 36, so only the values  
a = 2, 11, 20, 29 satisfy (★).  
For those same residues b can be 6, 15, 24, 33 and c can be 5, 14, 23, 32.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Use the first equation  

s(b) is 6 for every admissible b, and s(c) is 5 for every admissible c, so  
s(b)+s(c) = 11.  
Therefore a must be 11, eliminating a = 2, 20, 29.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Use the second equation  

a–1 = 10, so s(a–1)=1.  
For every admissible c we have c–1 = 4, 13, 22, 31 whose digit‑sums are all 4.  
Thus s(a–1)+s(c–1)=1+4=5, giving b–1 = 5 and therefore b = 6.  
All larger choices b = 15, 24, 33 are impossible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Use the third equation  

a+6 = 17 ⇒ s(a+6)=8, b+6 = 12 ⇒ s(b+6)=3, so  
s(a+6)+s(b+6)=8+3=11.  
Hence c + 6 = 11, giving c = 5.  
The other candidates c = 14, 23, 32 fail here.

6.  The ages  

Only one triple survives every test:

 Albert a = 11  
 Bill   b = 6  
 Charles c = 5

397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.
102?  Is 204 = 201 + 1?  No.
103?  Is 206 = 301 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds even.]
396?  Is 792 = 693 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds again.]
The answer given is the only one that passes.
As for extra points, an infinite number of 9's can be added between the 3 and the 7 without spoiling the major characteristics.

Given condition  
2(100A + 10B + C) = (100C + 10B + A) + 1

Expand and collect like terms  
200A + 20B + 2C = 100C + 10B + A + 1

Because B is a single digit, 10B can be 0,10,20,…,90.  
Rewrite (1):      10B = 1 + 98C – 199A            (2)

We now look for digits A (1–9) and C (0–9) such that the right–hand side of (2)  
• is between 0 and 90 inclusive, and  
• is a multiple of 10.

Systematic check:

A = 1 → 1 + 98C – 199 = 98C – 198  (no multiple of 10 between 0 and 90)  
A = 2 → 1 + 98C – 398 = 98C – 397  (no suitable C)  
A = 3 → 1 + 98C – 597 = 98C – 596  
  C = 7 gives 98·7 – 596 = 686 – 596 = 90 = 10·9  ✓

Thus A = 3, B = 9, C = 7 gives a valid number 397.

Continuing with A ≥ 4 makes the expression ever more negative and no other choice of C brings it into 0…90 as a multiple of 10. Hence 397 is the unique solution.

96,"An iterative equation is one where an initial value is put into the equation to obtain a result, which is in turn put back into the equation as an input and the process is repeated for either a fixed number of times or until a final value is achieved (where you get the same number out as you put in).
For example, if you start with the iterative equation,
A{n+1} = 1/A{n} + 1
And you put in an initial value of 1, you would get 2 as the result.  Put the 2 back in as the input and you would get 1.5, and so on.
There is a simple iterative equation which, when repeated just five times, will give you a very good approximation of the square root of two (accurate to three decimal places, or less than 0.1%).  What's more, you can put in any positive (and almost any negative) initial value into the equation (even zero) and you will end up at the same answer.  This equation does not contain any square root expressions; just single-order algebra.  Can you figure it out?","The only mathematical operators you need are addition and division.

A(A+1) = A + 2
... A^2 + A = A + 2
... A^2 = 2
... A = SQRT(2) !",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We want a function f(x) which  

1. contains only “first–power’’ algebraic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division – no roots, no powers higher than 1);  
2. has √2 as a fixed point (f(√2)=√2);  
3. pulls every starting value (except perhaps one “forbidden’’ value at which we would divide by 0) toward that fixed point fast enough that five repeats already give 3‑digit accuracy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Choosing the general shape

The simplest family of functions that satisfy the “first–power’’ condition and are nevertheless capable of having an attracting fixed point is the family of
Möbius (linear–fractional) transformations

  f(x)= (a x + b)/(c x + d) ,  with a,b,c,d constants and c≠0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Forcing √2 to be the fixed point

Demand f(√2)=√2 :

 (a√2 + b)/(c√2 + d)=√2  
 ⇒ a√2 + b = √2 (c√2 + d)  
 ⇒ a√2 + b = 2c + d√2.

Separate the √2–terms from the rational terms:

 ( a − d ) √2  +  b  =  2c.

To make the left‐hand side a rational number we must have a−d=0, i.e. d=a.
Then b=2c.

So every Möbius map that fixes √2 has the form

 f(x)= (a x + 2c)/(c x + a)  with arbitrary (non–zero) a,c.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Making the fixed point attractive

The derivative of f is

 f′(x)= (ad−bc)/(cx+d)^2 = (a²−2c²)/(cx+a)²  (because d=a, b=2c).

At the fixed point x=√2 the denominator is positive, so the sign
and magnitude of the derivative are governed by (a²−2c²).
To get convergence we need |f′(√2)|<1.

The smallest integer coefficients giving that are obtained by taking a=1, c=1
(then a²−2c² = 1−2 = −1, and |f′(√2)| = 1/(√2+1)² ≈ 0.172 <1).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  The final iteration

With a=1, c=1 the formula becomes

 f(x)= (x + 2)/(x + 1).

Thus the desired iterative equation is

 A_{n+1} = (A_n + 2)/(A_n + 1)   (defined for every A_n ≠ −1).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Demonstrating the convergence

Start, for example, with the extreme values 0, 2 and −2.

• From 0 :

 A₁ = 2/1 = 2  
 A₂ = (2+2)/(2+1)=4/3 = 1.333 …  
 A₃ = (1.333…+2)/(1.333…+1)=1.42857…  
 A₄ = 1.41222…  
 A₅ = 1.41421…  (already correct to four decimals).

• From 2 :

 → 1.333… → 1.42857… → 1.41222… → 1.41421…

• From −2 :

 (−2+2)/(−2+1)=0/−1 = 0  
 and from 0 the list above shows it again reaches 1.414 … in five steps.

The only starting value that fails is A₀ = −1 (division by zero);  
all other real starting points, positive or negative, are pulled rapidly
toward √2, with the error after five iterations already below 0.05 %.

3333377733 is divisible by 7 (the quotient is 476196819.)
Therefore, the number we're looking for is 3333377733.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the unknown number N have  

• a digits equal to 3  
• b digits equal to 7  

so the total number of digits is n = a + b.

1. Digital‑sum requirement  
   The digital sum is  
   S = 3a + 7b.

   We need S to be divisible by 3 and by 7, i.e. by 21.

   • Mod 3: 7 ≡ 1 (mod 3) ⇒ S ≡ a·0 + b·1 ≡ b (mod 3).  
     Hence b must be a multiple of 3.

   • Mod 7: 3 ≡ 3 (mod 7) ⇒ S ≡ 3a (mod 7).  
     Since 3 and 7 are coprime, 3a ≡ 0 (mod 7) ⇔ a ≡ 0 (mod 7);  
     hence a is a multiple of 7.

   Therefore we can write  
   a = 7k , b = 3m  (k, m ≥ 0).  
   Then S = 21(k + m), automatically divisible by 21.

2. Length of the number  
   n = a + b = 7k + 3m.

   We want the smallest N, so we first minimise n.  
   The least positive value attainable by 7k + 3m (k, m ≥ 0) is 3
   (take k = 0, m = 1).

   Thus any candidate with the minimal length must have

   a = 0 and b = 3  → the three digits are all 7’s.

3. The unique 3‑digit candidate  
   N = 777.

4. Divisibility of N itself  
   • Sum of digits = 21 ⇒ N is divisible by 3.  
   • 777 ÷ 7 = 111 ⇒ N is divisible by 7.  
   Hence N is divisible by both 3 and 7, i.e. by 21.

Since no 1‑ or 2‑digit number can satisfy the digital‑sum condition, and 777 is the only 3‑digit number that satisfies all three requirements, it is the smallest possible.

98,"Suppose you're in a hallway lined with 100 closed lockers.
You begin by opening every locker. Then you close every second locker. Then you go to every third locker and open it (if it's closed) or close it (if it's open).  Let's call this action toggling a locker. Continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n.  After 100 passes, where you toggle only locker #100, how many lockers are open?",,"Answer: 10 lockers are left open:
Lockers #1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.
Each of these numbers are perfect squares. This problem is based on the factors of the locker number.
Each locker is toggled by each factor; for example, locker #40 is toggled on pass number 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40.  That's eight toggles: open-closed-open-closed-open-closed-open-closed.
The only way a locker could be left open is if it is toggled an odd number of times. The only numbers with an odd number of factors are the perfect
squares. Thus, the perfect squares are left open.
For example, locker #25 is toggled on pass number 1, 5, and 25 (three toggles): open-closed-open.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We label the lockers 1, 2, 3, …, 100 and assume they all start closed.

Pass‑by‑pass rule  
On pass n you “toggle every n‑th locker,” meaning you flip the state (open ↔ closed) of every locker whose number is divisible by n.

Key observation  
Locker k is toggled exactly once for every positive divisor of k, because each divisor d of k makes k a multiple of d and therefore k gets toggled on pass d.

Number of toggles for locker k  
= number of positive divisors of k  

Starting condition  
Each locker begins closed, so its final state depends only on whether it is toggled an odd or an even number of times:  
• Even # of toggles → ends closed.  
• Odd  # of toggles → ends open.

When does a number have an odd number of divisors?  
A number has an odd divisor count precisely when it is a perfect square.  (Reason: Divisors normally pair up as (d, k/d); only when d = k/d, i.e. when k is a square, does one divisor remain unpaired, giving an odd total.)

Perfect squares ≤ 100  
1² = 1  
2² = 4  
3² = 9  
4² = 16  
5² = 25  
6² = 36  
7² = 49  
8² = 64  
9² = 81  
10² = 100  

There are exactly 10 such squares.

Therefore exactly 10 lockers are toggled an odd number of times and stay open.

The fifteenth time, he flips 1 of the 2 coins that is heads up, and 92 of the coins that are tails up, leaving 93 coins heads up.
The sixteenth and last time he can get all of them tails up.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let “H’’ = heads, “T’’ = tails, work mod 2 (0=H, 1=T) and number the coins 1,…,100.

1.  What a move does  
   In one move Tom chooses 93 coins and flips them.  
   Equivalently he chooses the 7 coins he does NOT flip.  
   So every move is represented by a 0‑1 vector of length 100 that has
   exactly seven 1’s (these 1’s mark the coins that were **not** touched).

2.  Why the number of moves has to be even  
   Let H(k) be the number of heads after k moves.  
   If a of the 93 coins that are flipped in a move are heads, then (93−a) of
   them are tails, and

   ΔH = (tails → heads) − (heads → tails) = (93−a) − a = 93 − 2a ,

   which is an odd number.  
   Thus the parity of H(k) changes every move.  
   We start with 100 heads (even) and want 0 heads (even), hence
   the number m of moves must be even.

3.  A lower bound for the number of moves  
   Each move is a 0‑1 vector with weight 7.  
   To reach the all‑tails position we need the **sum** (mod 2) of our
   m vectors to be the all‑1 vector (every coin has to be touched an odd
   number of times).  
   If m moves are used, the total number of 1’s that appear in those
   vectors is 7m.  Since the final vector we need has 100 ones,

            7m ≥ 100  ⇒  m ≥ 15.

   Combining this with “m is even’’ gives

            m ≥ 16.

4.  Constructing 16 legal moves  
   Show that 16 moves really are enough.

   • Split the first 98 coins into fourteen disjoint 7‑element blocks  
     B₁,…,B₁₄, e.g.  
     B₁={1,…,7}, B₂={8,…,14}, … , B₁₄={92,…,98}.  
     For i=1,…,14 let move i be “do NOT flip the coins of Bᵢ’’
     (and flip the other 93).

     After these 14 moves every coin 1–98 has been left untouched once
     (odd), coins 99 and 100 have never been left untouched (even).

   • Let M={1,2,3,4,5,6}.  
     Move 15 : do NOT flip {99}∪M  
     Move 16 : do NOT flip {100}∪M.  

     The two moves differ exactly on coins 99 and 100; every other coin is
     either in both of them or in neither of them.

     Parity check
     – Coins 99, 100 are now left untouched once ⇒ odd.  
     – Coins 1–6 were left untouched in B₁ and in both new moves
       (total 3 times) ⇒ odd.  
     – Every other coin 7–98 was left untouched exactly once (in its block)
       ⇒ odd.

     Hence after 16 moves every coin has been left untouched an odd number
     of times, i.e. flipped an odd number of times, so every coin is T.

5.  Conclusion  
   It is impossible with 14 moves, but 16 moves work, therefore

b) 125–133 : I = 2.  
Increment by 2 for 5 years → after year 30 we reach P = 135.

c) 135–149 : I = 1.  
Increment by 1 for 15 years → after year 45 we reach P = 150.

d) 150–166 : I = 2.  
Increment by 2 for 9 years → after year 54 we reach P = 168.  
(We skipped 167 because we were moving in steps of 2.)

e) 168–174 : I = 1.  
Increment by 1 for 7 years → after year 61 we reach P = 175.

-------------------------------------------------
3.  What happens after P = 175?
-------------------------------------------------
For P ≥ 175 we have m ≥ 7, and we have already proved that I ≠ 1 for such m.  
Indeed, beginning with P = 175 the possible increments are 2, 3, … but never 1.

Therefore the population increases by exactly one person for the last time in year 61.

102,"If 125207 is ""Hi"", and 031993121212 is ""Dude"", then 125207031993121212 is ""Hi Dude"".
Then what is 799717777010909230151693122001983?",,"It's ""You Are Great"".
Separate the numbers into groups of three, and then add up the three numbers. The total amount will point to a certain letter, and if you continue doing it until all numbers are used, it'll form the sentence ""You Are Great"".",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We look at the training pairs.

125207  → “Hi”
031993121212 → “Dude”

Notice that 125207 is six digits, so we try grouping into 3‑digit blocks:
   125  207
and likewise
   031  993  121  212

Now check what happens if we sum the three digits in each block:

125 → 1+2+5 = 8 → 8th letter = H  
207 → 2+0+7 = 9 → 9th letter = I  

031 → 0+3+1 = 4 → 4th letter = D  
993 → 9+9+3 = 21 → 21st letter = U  
121 → 1+2+1 = 4 → D  
212 → 2+1+2 = 5 → E  

The rule is therefore:
• Split the long number into 3‑digit chunks.  
• Add the digits in each chunk.  
• Convert the sum (1–26) to its alphabet position.

Now decode 799717777010909230151693122001983:

799  717  777  010  909  230  151  693  122  001  983

Add the digits and translate:

799 → 7+9+9 = 25 → Y  
717 → 7+1+7 = 15 → O  
777 → 7+7+7 = 21 → U  
010 → 0+1+0 = 1  → A  
909 → 9+0+9 = 18 → R

103,"Two aging mathematics professors, Al Gebra and Cal Culus were sitting at their favourite Thai restaurant, Phun Kshuns, reminiscing about when they first met, while their waiter, Theo Rumsanrools (who also took Professor Gebra's Advanced Mathematics course at Cart Eshian University) eavesdropped on their conversation as he brought them their meals.
""You know what occurred to me the other day, Cal?"" asked Professor Gebra.
""What's that?"" said Professor Culus.
""Well, when we met, the square of your age contained the same three digits as the square of my age, just in a different order,"" Professor Gebra continued.
""This will really blow your socks off then, Al! If you take the square of the sum of our ages when we met and split it into two 2-digit numbers, you'd have my age then and your age now!"" Professor Culus exclaimed.
Wanting to impress his professor, Theo interjected.
""I thought you were much younger than that, Professor Gebra,"" Theo said.
Said Professor Gebra, ""And just how old am I then, young fellow?""",,"""Well, you're 81, sir,"" Theo replied.
""Right you are! And how did you figure that out so quickly?"" Professor Gebra asked.
""You said the square of your ages when you and Professor Culus met had only three digits, so the oldest you could have been was 31. That means that there were only a few possible ages the two of you could have been. Those being (with the associated squares):
14 & 31 (196 & 961),

And from those figures I concluded that Professor Culus must have been 16 when you met and hence you, Professor Gebra, are now 81!"" Theo explained.
""Aren't you a bright young fellow! You should come and study my Advanced Mathematics course at Cart Eshian University!"" Professor Gebra exclaimed.
""Uh, I already do,"" Theo said sheepishly.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 x = Professor Gebra’s age when they first met,  
 y = Professor Culus’s age when they first met,  
 n = years that have passed since that meeting (so Gebra is now x + n years old).

1.  “The square of your age contained the same three digits as the square of my age.”  
 So x² and y² are 3–digit numbers which are anagrams of each other.

 Among the 3–digit squares (10² = 100 to 31² = 961) the only anagrammatic pairs are  

  12² = 144 and 21² = 441  
  13² = 169, 14² = 196, 31² = 961  
  16² = 256 and 25² = 625

2.  “If you take the square of the sum of our ages when we met and split it into two 2–digit numbers, you’d have my age then and your age now.”  

 Hence (x + y)² is a 4–digit number whose first two digits are y and whose last two digits are x + n.  
 Algebraically: (x + y)² = 100·y + (x + n)  with 10 ≤ y ≤ 99, 10 ≤ x + n ≤ 99.  
 Thus n = (x + y)² − 100y − x must be a non‑negative integer.

3.  Test the three candidate pairs:

 a) (x, y) = (12, 21) → (x + y)² = 33² = 1089; first two digits 10 ≠ 21 ✗  
 b) (x, y) = (13, 14), (14, 13), (13, 31), … All give either a 3–digit square or wrong first two digits ✗  
 c) (x, y) = (16, 25) → 41² = 1681; first two digits 16 = y ✔  

 Now CD = 81, so x + n = 81 ⇒ n = 81 − 25 = 56 (non‑negative and x + n is two‑digit).  
 Everything is consistent:

  • Ages when they met: Gebra 25, Culus 16.  
  • Squares: 25² = 625 and 16² = 256 (same digits).  
  • Sum of ages then: 41, whose square 1681 splits as 16 | 81 = (Culus’s age then) | (Gebra’s age now).

 This is the only pair that works.

Therefore Professor Al Gebra is now 81 years old.

104,"Kurt & Rod were hanging around the window at school munching the last of their Rnkfurers hoard.  They spotted their neighbor lounging in the enclosed courtyard, looking hungry.
""Patty O'Furniture!  Good to see you!  Want a Rnkfurter?""
""A what?""
Kurt handed her the last he had.  She bit in, and her face lit up like a newly-coined metaphor.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""Rod and I were about to go order some more.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""  Patty's blank look bade him explain.  ""In our first batch, we got a total of 25 -- 20 for me, and 5 for Rod.  I had 20, and he had 20% of the total.""
""And you think you can do that for three people?  You get my percentage, and I get Rod's?  I don't think we can do it.""
Rod had been thinking about it, and rattled off three numbers to her.
""Those aren't right.  The last one isn't the right percentage; there's an added fraction.""
""So?  My mom says they're the same on her old phonograph speeds.""
Patty looked at Kurt, each waiting for the other to give an opinion.  Finally, she gestured at the empty wrapper in his hand.
""I'll round off a little for a week's supply of these.  Let's go!""
Since Rnkfurters come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, they had to leave 10 with the storekeeper to make the numbers work, but they got their munchies.
How many did each student get this time?","The old phonograph speeds were typically 16, 33-1/3, 45, and 78 RPM.","27 for Kurt, 30 for Patty, and 33 for Rod.
That's 30% for Kurt and 33-1/3% for Patty.
Method:
Let K, P, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, K+P+R.
Now, since Kurt's percentage equals Patty's quantity, we get
100*K/T = P.
Similarly,
100*P/T = R plus a fraction.  Now, look at the common factor, 100/T.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
K*F = P and P*F = R (plus a fraction),
and K*F^2 = R (plus a fraction).
The clue about the phonograph leaves us looking for a triple with 33 Rnkfurters for Rod, with Patty getting 33-1/3% (one-third) of the total.
P = T/3
P = (K+P+33)/3 -- remember, R=33
Now, combine this with 100*K/T = P, and a bit of algebra gives us the required answer.

105,"A man is standing on a rock in the middle of a circular lake of radius 1. There is a tiger on the shore of the lake that can run four times as fast you can swim, however the tiger cannot swim. The tiger is hungry and always attempts to keep the distance between the two of you at a minimum. How can you safely swim to shore?
Assume that as long as you can get to the shore before the tiger gets to you (even if it is only a split-second before), you will be safe.",,"Until you are more than 1/4 of the radius away from the rock you can swim fast enough so that you can keep the tiger the furthest distance possible from you. Regardless of which direction the tiger moves around the circle, you swim the other way, always keeping the rock between you and the tiger.  While you are doing this you will be able to move outward, since you will have some energy to spare.
Before long you will be 1/4 of the radius away from the center and the tiger will be 180 degrees away. At this point swim straight to the point on the shore furthest from the tiger. You will be able to get there in 3/4 units of time, while it will take the tiger pi/4 =~ 0.7854 units of time.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 v = your swimming speed  
 4v = the tiger’s running speed  

Because the lake’s radius is 1, the tiger’s maximum angular speed while it runs round the bank is  

 ωt = (4v)/1 = 4v  radians per unit time.

If you are at distance r from the centre and you swim purely tangentially, your angular speed is  

 ωs = v / r .

1.  Gaining an angular lead  
   If r < ¼ then  
  ωs = v/r > 4v = ωt .  
   Hence, while you stay inside the circle of radius ¼ you can rotate round the centre faster than the tiger can follow; the angular separation between you and the tiger can be made as large as you like.

2.  The set‑up  
   Start at the rock (the centre).  
   Swim inside the small circle r = ¼, choosing your direction so that you drive the tiger round the shore until it is diametrically opposite some point P on the bank – the point at which you intend to land.  
   Because you are inside r = ¼, the tiger cannot keep the same bearing on you; after at most one full circuit you can make the angular separation exactly π radians (180°).

3.  The dash to shore  
   When you are on the radius that ends at P and exactly ¼ from the centre, turn and swim straight to P.

   • Distance you must cover: 1 − ¼ = ¾.  
     Time you need: Ts = (¾)/v.

   • The tiger must run at least half the circumference (an arc of length π) to reach P.  
     Time the tiger needs: Tt = π/(4v).

   Compare the two times:  

  Ts = 0.75/v   Tt = π/(4v) ≈ 0.7854/v.

   Since 0.75 < 0.7854, you arrive a fraction of a second before the tiger.

4.  Safety  
   You step onto the shore at P just before the tiger reaches the same point, so you are safe.

In summary:  
• Stay within the circle of radius ¼, circling until the tiger is on the opposite side of the lake from your intended landing point.  
• From radius ¼ swim straight to the bank; you beat the tiger because your remaining swim takes less time than the tiger’s half‑circumference sprint.

Final answer: Circle inside the lake at radius less than ¼ until the tiger is opposite your chosen landing point, then swim straight to shore from radius ¼; you reach land before the four‑times‑faster tiger can run halfway round the lake.",True

N₀  = number of marbles Justin starts with,  
N₁  = number left after giving to Mike,  
N₂  = number left after giving to Paul,  
… ,  
N₉  = number left after giving to Will (this is the amount we want).

1.  Track the amount left after each gift.

   Each time Justin gives the stated fraction, he keeps the complementary fraction.

   Mike : keeps 1 – 1/2 = 1/2 of what he had → N₁ = (1/2)N₀  
   Paul : keeps 1 – 1/3 = 2/3 of what he has → N₂ = (2/3)N₁  
   Dave : keeps 1 – 1/4 = 3/4 of what he has → N₃ = (3/4)N₂  
   …  
   Will : keeps 1 – 1/10 = 9/10 of what he has → N₉ = (9/10)N₈  

   Multiply all the “kept” fractions:

   (1/2)(2/3)(3/4)(4/5)(5/6)(6/7)(7/8)(8/9)(9/10)  
   = 1/10   (everything cancels telescopically)

   Therefore   N₉ = (1/10)N₀.

2.  Work out the divisibility requirements.

   For each gift, the number of marbles given away must be an integer.

   • Mike: N₀ must be divisible by 2.  
   • Paul: N₁ = N₀/2 must be divisible by 3  ⇒ N₀ divisible by 2·3 = 6.  
   • Dave: N₂ = N₀/3 must be divisible by 4 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 3·4 = 12.  
   • Bert: N₃ = N₀/4 must be divisible by 5 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 4·5 = 20.  
   • Kyle: N₄ = N₀/5 must be divisible by 6 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 5·6 = 30.  
   • Andy: N₅ = N₀/6 must be divisible by 7 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 6·7 = 42.  
   • Rick: N₆ = N₀/7 must be divisible by 8 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 7·8 = 56.  
   • Fred: N₇ = N₀/8 must be divisible by 9 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 8·9 = 72.  
   • Will: N₈ = N₀/9 must be divisible by 10 ⇒ N₀ divisible by 9·10 = 90.

   Thus N₀ must be divisible by every number  
   2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90.

   The least common multiple of those numbers is the least possible N₀.

   Prime–factorise them:

   2          = 2  
   6          = 2·3  
   12         = 2²·3  
   20         = 2²·5  
   30         = 2·3·5  
   42         = 2·3·7  
   56         = 2³·7  
   72         = 2³·3²  
   90         = 2·3²·5  

   Take the highest power of each prime appearing:

   2³, 3², 5¹, 7¹  ⇒  8·9·5·7 = 2520.

   So the smallest possible starting total is N₀ = 2520.

3.  Find the smallest possible remainder.

   N₉ = (1/10)N₀ = 2520 / 10 = 252.

1.  We look for a product of a 2‑digit number and a 3‑digit number, because  
    2‑digit × 3‑digit is naturally a 4‑digit number, giving us the required total of nine digits (2+3+4 = 9).

2.  All nine symbols 1–9 must appear exactly once, so every candidate pair of factors must already have five different digits.  The remaining four digits must then appear, without repetition, in the product.

3.  A quick divisibility test helps cut the search space:  
        (sum of digits 1–9) = 45 ≡ 0 (mod 9).  
    Therefore the product itself must be divisible by 9.  In other words, the 4‑digit product must have digit‑sum 9, 18, 27 or 36.

4.  Start with a small 2‑digit number that has no repeated digits and does not contain 0 or 5 (because 0 is forbidden and 5 in a factor often forces a 0 or 5 in the product’s last digit, which we want to avoid).  
    Take 39.

5.  Choose a 3‑digit companion whose digits are disjoint from {3,9}.  
    Pick 186 (digits {1,8,6}); so far we have five different digits {1,3,6,8,9}.

6.  Compute the product:

108,"In the equation FORTY+TEN+TEN=SIXTY, each letter represents a different digit. Can you figure out which letter is which digit?",Start from the last digits.,"First, there are ten different letters in this equation: E, F, I, N, O, R, S, T, X, Y. Therefore, every digit from 0 to 9 is used.
Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.
If T=8, then R=X+3, we can have R=6, X=3, or R=7, X=4.
If R=6, X=3, the remaining digits are 2, 4, 7, and again we can't choose S=F+1.

Finally, the remaining digit 6 is for Y.
Therefore, the equation is 29786+850+850=31486.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step–by–step reasoning

1.  Write the addition in columns.

              F  O  R  T  Y
                 T  E  N
                 T  E  N
          ----------------
              S  I  X  T  Y

   Carries from right to left will be called c₁ , c₂ , c₃ , c₄.

2.  Units column  
    Y + N + N = Y  + 10 c₁  → 2N = 10 c₁.  
    Hence N = 0 and c₁ = 0 (the only digit for which 2N = 0 or 10).

3.  Tens column  
    T + E + E + c₁ = T (mod 10)  
    ⇒ 2E ≡ 0 (mod 10) → 2E = 0, 10, 20.  
    E cannot be 0 (already used by N); 2E = 10 gives E = 5.  
    Then T + 2E = T + 10, so c₂ = 1.

4.  Hundreds column  
    R + T + T + c₂ = X + 10 c₃  
    ⇒ R + 2T + 1 = X + 10 c₃.           (1)

5.  Thousands column  
    O + c₃ = I + 10 c₄.                 (2)

6.  Ten‑thousands column  
    F + c₄ = S.                         (3)

7.  Examine c₃.

    • If c₃ = 0, equation (2) forces O = I, impossible (digits must differ).  
    • If c₃ = 1, then (2) gives I = O + 1 (c₄ = 0).  Equation (3) would give S = F, also impossible.  
    • Therefore c₃ = 2.

8.  With c₃ = 2, equation (1) is  
    R + 2T + 1 = X + 20  ⇒  X = R + 2T – 19,  and 19 ≤ R + 2T ≤ 27.      (4)

9.  Still with c₃ = 2, equation (2) is  
    O + 2 = I + 10 c₄.

    • If O + 2 < 10, c₄ = 0, giving S = F again (from (3)); impossible.  
    • Hence O + 2 ≥ 10, so c₄ = 1 and I = O − 8.

    The only digit that works is O = 9, giving I = 1 (both unused so far) and c₄ = 1.

10.  Equation (3) now reads F + 1 = S; thus S = F + 1.

11.  Collect what we have:

    N = 0,  E = 5,  O = 9,  I = 1,
    c₁ = 0, c₂ = 1, c₃ = 2, c₄ = 1.

    Unused digits so far: 2,3,4,6,7,8.

12.  Use (4).  Try the allowed digits for T (not 0 or 5 or 9 or 1):

    Take T = 8  →  2T = 16.  Then R must satisfy 19 ≤ R + 16 ≤ 27, i.e. 3 ≤ R ≤ 11.
    Possible R (distinct and unused): 6 or 7.

    • If R = 6,  X = 6 + 16 – 19 = 3 (unused).  
      Unused digits left: 2,4,7.  
      But F must be one of these and S = F + 1 must also be unused; none work.

    • If R = 7,  X = 7 + 16 – 19 = 4 (unused).  
      Unused digits left: 2,3,6.  
      Choose F = 2 ⇒ S = 3 (both unused).  
      The only digit still free is Y = 6.

    All digits are now distinct and every digit 0–9 is used exactly once:

      F=2, O=9, R=7, T=8, Y=6,
      E=5, N=0, S=3, I=1, X=4.

13.  Check:

          2 9 7 8 6
          +    8 5 0
          +    8 5 0

 k = the common interval between successive births (in years),  
 x = the age of the youngest child (in years),  
 F = the father’s age (in years).

The children’s ages therefore form the arithmetic progression  
x, x+k, x+2k, … ,x+8k .  

The statement says that the sum of the squares of these nine ages equals the square of the father’s age:

 F² = Σ_{i=0}^{8} (x + ik)².

1.  Evaluate the sum of squares.  
 Σ_{i=0}^{8} (x + ik)²  
 = Σ (x² + 2xk i + k² i²)  
 = 9x² + 2xk Σ i + k² Σ i²  
 = 9x² + 2xk·36 + k²·204  
 = 9x² + 72xk + 204k².

 Hence F² = 9x² + 72xk + 204k². (1)

2.  Reduce the equation by introducing t = x/k (a positive rational number):

 F² = k² ( 9t² + 72t + 204 ) = k² f(t) with f(t)=9t²+72t+204. (2)

 For F to be integral, f(t) must itself be a perfect square.  Set

 f(t) = m² with m ∈ ℕ. (3)

3.  Solve 9t² + 72t + 204 = m² for rational t.

 9t² + 72t + (204 − m²) = 0.

        = 5184 − 36(204 − m²)  
        = 36(m² − 60).

 For t to be rational, D must be a perfect square, say D = (6ℓ)².  
 Thus m² − 60 = ℓ² ⇒ m² − ℓ² = 60 ⇒ (m − ℓ)(m + ℓ) = 60. (4)

 The two factors on the right must have the same parity.  
 Possible even factor pairs of 60 are (2, 30) and (6, 10).

 •  (m − ℓ, m + ℓ) = (2, 30)  ⇒  m = 16, ℓ = 14.  
 •  (m − ℓ, m + ℓ) = (6, 10) ⇒  m = 8,  ℓ = 2 (gives negative t).

 Hence the only positive‑t solution is m = 16.

4.  Find t.

 Using D = (6ℓ)² with ℓ = 14:

 t = [−72 ± 6ℓ]/(2·9) = [−72 ± 84]/18.

5.  Recover x and k.

111,"Mad Ade was visiting his friend, computer tycoon and Olympic Kebab hurling champion, Mike Rohsopht.
He was there on Sunday and when the radio gave the time at the hour, Mad Ade noticed that the Madadian antique clock, designed by Madadian clock maker Arthur Minit (teaser #4891) was exactly 3 minutes slow.
""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Mike assured Mad Ade that his treasured Arthur Minit clock had not been adjusted nor fixed since his last visit.
What day of the week was Mad Ade's second visit?",,"The answer is 17 days and 3 hours later, which would have been a Wednesday.
This is the only other time in the same month when the two would agree at all.
In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.
Since the clock was not adjusted since the last visit, it's also possible that the radio time shifted by one hour due to a change to or from summer daylight saving time.  However, it turns out that the only additional possibilities that need to be considered are those of 4 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 12 hours 57 minutes, and 29 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 3 days 10 hours 57 minutes.  Without even considering the rules for when in the month the
clock is changed, these possible solutions are ruled out because we know that both visits were in the evening (""Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht"") and they involve times in a different part of the day.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the first visit be our time origin.  
At that moment (a Sunday, exactly on the radio “pip‑pip‑pip, it’s *n* o’clock”),  

• the real time = 0 minutes  
• the Arthur Minit clock = –3 minutes (it is 3 min slow).  

The clock loses 7 min every real hour, i.e. it runs at  

    rate  =  60 – 7  minutes per real 60 minutes  
           =  53/60 of real time.

Hence after n real hours

    time shown by the clock   =  53n  minutes,
    real elapsed time         =  60n  minutes,
    error                     =  53n – 60n – 3
                              = –7n – 3  minutes.            (1)

For the clock to look “dead right” again the two dials must agree, and on a
12‑hour dial that means the error must be an integral multiple of 12 hours
(720 min):

        –7n – 3  =  –720k        (k = 1,2,3,…).              (2)

Because the second observation is also made exactly on the hour,
n itself must be an integer.

Solve the diophantine equation (2):

        7n + 3 = 720k.                                    (3)

Since gcd(7, 720)=1, 7 has a modular inverse mod 720; 7·103 = 721 ≡ 1 (mod 720).
Multiply (3) by 103:

        n ≡ 103·(720k – 3)  ≡ 103·(–3) ≡ –309 ≡ 411 (mod 720).

The smallest positive solution is n = 411 hours.  
Substituting in (3): 7·411 + 3 = 2880 = 720·4, so k = 4.  
Thus the first moment when the clock is “dead right” again occurs after

        411 hours = 17 days and 3 hours.

Now count the days of the week:

        Sunday + 14 days = Sunday
        Sunday + 17 days = Wednesday

(The extra 3 hours merely changes the time of day, not the weekday,
unless the first observation had been after 21:00, which would contradict
the statement that the second occasion was “rather late in the evening”.)

Hence Mad Ade’s second visit took place on a

Th = 105 °F   (temperature of the hot supply)  
Tc = 45 °F    (temperature of the cold supply)  

Assumptions usually made for this kind of “two‑handle” problem  
1. Each faucet delivers a flow rate proportional to how far it is opened.  
2. Fully opening either faucet (a 360° turn) gives the same maximum flow rate.  

Take the hot faucet to be fully open, giving a (normalized) flow rate  
H = 1 unit / s.  

If the cold handle is turned θ degrees (0 ≤ θ ≤ 360), its flow rate is  

C = (θ / 360°) · 1  = θ/360   (units / s).  

The mixed temperature T is the flow‑weighted average  

T = ( H·Th + C·Tc ) / ( H + C ).  

Set T = 98.6 °F and solve for θ:

(1·105 + (θ/360)·45) / (1 + θ/360) = 98.6

A weird number is an abundant number, n, for which no subset of its proper divisors adds to n. What is the smallest weird number?",They are very rare indeed. The smallest is somewhere between 50 and 100.,"The smallest weird number is 70.

1. n is abundant: the sum σ(n) of its proper divisors exceeds n.  
2. n is not pseudoperfect: no subset of its proper divisors adds up to n.  
Such a number is called weird.  We must find the least one.

Step 1.  List all abundant numbers below 70.  
A quick divisor–sum check gives the complete list

12, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 66.

Step 2.  Verify that each of these is pseudoperfect (i.e. has a subset
adding to itself).

12  = 1+2+3+6  
18  = 9+6+3  
20  = 10+5+4+1  
24  = 12+8+4  
30  = 15+10+5

Hence every abundant number below 70 is NOT weird.

Step 3.  Examine 70.

Its proper divisors are  
1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35;  their sum is

1+2+5+7+10+14+35 = 74 > 70,

so 70 is abundant.

We must show no subset of these divisors totals 70.

• If 35 were in the subset, the remaining divisors would have to supply 35 more.  
  The largest attainable sum with 1,2,5,7,10,14 is  
  14+10+7+5+2+1 = 39;  none of its sub‑sums equals 35, so 35 cannot be used.

• Omitting 35, the sum of all the remaining divisors is only 39, far short of 70.

Therefore no subset of proper divisors of 70 can equal 70, so 70 is weird.

Step 4.  Because every abundant number below 70 is pseudoperfect and 70 itself is weird, 70 is the smallest weird number.

115,"On planet ?*!@, the inhabitants are robots with various numbers of arms. The robots are grouped into tribes according to the numbers of arms they have so that in any tribe, no member has a different number of arms to the other members.

In the ritual, each arm of a male links with an arm of a female, no male-female pair of robots linking more than once. The minimum number of robots required to link all arms once only is the number belonging to that tribe. Now one night, the Creaky tribe cornered half of the Rusty tribe and despite being outnumbered two to one, unscrewed one arm from each, there being an equal number of male and female victims. However, the Creaky tribe were extremely poor at arithmetic and had failed to realise that they needed 24 times their actual haul of spare arms in order that the number of links their members could then make, each with the same number of extra arms, was half the maximum number of links the Rusty tribe could then make.

A robot with n arms requires n females and vice-versa, and the number of members is 2n with n squared links. Let the Creaky tribe have x arms each and the Rusty tribe have y. Then the maximum number of links that the Rusty tribe can make after the mutilation is y(2y-1)/2. The number of extra arms each Creaky needs is 24y/2x allowing x(x + 24y/2x) links. Forming the links equation we have 2(y squared) - 49y - 4(x squared) = 0. We must have y=4x so that y - 4x is a factor. A long division shows that the condition for zero remainder is x=7 so y=28.

116,"Mad Ade's kids, Mad Ade junior and little Miss Mad Ade were going to cut the grass on their square lawn, while their dad was out buying a bumper family sized kebab with extra grease. They agreed that each should cut one-half of the area. Junior went first, and cut a border 2 metres wide all the way around.
After doing a few sums, Little Miss agreed that exactly one-half had been cut and happily cut the rest.
What was the area of the lawn?",,Area of lawn was 186.51 square metres,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the lawn be a square of side L metres.

Border (mown) area = total area – inner area  
         = L² – (L – 4)²

We are told this border area is exactly one‑half of the total area:

L² – (L – 4)² = ½ L²

Expand and simplify:

L² – [L² – 8L + 16] = ½ L²  
8L – 16 = ½ L²  
Multiply by 2: 16L – 32 = L²  
Re‑arrange:   L² – 16L + 32 = 0

Solve the quadratic:

L = [16 ± √(16² – 4·32)] / 2  
  = [16 ± √128] / 2  
  = [16 ± 8√2] / 2

The minus sign gives L < 4 m, impossible because the border alone is 4 m across, so take

The pieces do not need to be of equal size.",,"The answer is n*(n+1)/2 + 1.
With every cut you should cut through every previous cut. As long as you keep doing this you will always be able to do so again with your next cut. The number of additional pieces formed on cut x will always be x. The sum of all integers from 1 to n is n*(n+1)/2. So the sum of additional pieces cut will be n*(n+1)/2.
Finally add 1 because we start with 1 piece: n*(n+1)/2 + 1.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let P(n) denote the greatest possible number of pizza pieces that can be obtained with n straight cuts.  
We want a formula for P(n).

1.  Begin with no cuts.  
    P(0) = 1 (the whole pizza).

2.  What happens when we add the (k + 1)-st cut?  
    • Arrange the new cut so that it is not parallel to any previous cut and no three cuts meet at one point.  
    • Under this “best–possible” arrangement the new cut meets every one of the k existing cuts in a distinct interior point of the pizza.  
    • So it is divided into k + 1 separate line‐segments.  
    • Each such segment lies in a previously existing piece, and every time the segment crosses the boundary of that piece it splits it into two.  
      Hence the new cut creates exactly k + 1 new pieces.

3.  Recurrence.  
    Therefore  
        P(k + 1) = P(k) + (k + 1).

4.  Solve the recurrence.  
        P(0)=1  
        P(1)=1+1=2  
        P(2)=2+2=4  
        P(3)=4+3=7  
    In general, by summing the consecutive integers,  
        P(n) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + … + n

Zingers: 9, 57, 41, 89, 33, 17  
Non‑zingers: 2, 8, 59, 13, 68, 36  

Step 1 – Test divisibility by small integers  
• Squares? 9 is, others aren’t → no.  
• Primes? Some are, some aren’t → no.  

Step 2 – Look at remainders when divided by small integers (modular arithmetic).  
Check “mod 8”, because 8 is a common small modulus that quickly separates numbers:

 9 ÷ 8 = 1 R 1 → remainder 1

 33 ÷ 8 = 4 R 1 → remainder 1  
 17 ÷ 8 = 2 R 1 → remainder 1  

All zingers leave remainder 1 when divided by 8.

Now check the non‑zingers:

 2 ÷ 8 = 0 R 2 → remainder 2  
 8 ÷ 8 = 1 R 0 → remainder 0  
 59 ÷ 8 = 7 R 3 → remainder 3  
 13 ÷ 8 = 1 R 5 → remainder 5  
 68 ÷ 8 = 8 R 4 → remainder 4  
 36 ÷ 8 = 4 R 4 → remainder 4  

None of the non‑zingers give remainder 1.  

Therefore the defining property is:

A “zinger” is an integer that is exactly one more than a multiple of 8; equivalently, a number congruent to 1 modulo 8.

One less complex method is to imagine the axis of the cone form a right triangle. This triangle shares the dimensions of the cone, so it is 12 by 5. We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.
Next we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x. If we add 10x on both sides, we get 22x=60, and dividing 22 from both sides yields x=60/22=30/11.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the cone’s axis be the z–axis, the apex at z = 0, and the base (radius 5) at z = 12.

The required property is  

(10a + b) + (10c + d) = 10b + c.                (1)

10a + d = 9(b – c).                              (2)

Observation from (2)
• 10a + d is positive, so b > c (the right‐hand side is positive).  
• 10a + d must be a positive multiple of 9 not exceeding 9·9 = 81, because b − c ≤ 9.

Since 10a ≡ a (mod 9), equation (2) implies a + d ≡ 0 (mod 9), i.e.  

d = 9 – a  (for a = 1,…,8).                      (3)

(The case a = 9 gives 10a + d ≥ 90, which is too large.)

Substituting (3) in (2):

To obtain the earliest year with a = 2, choose the smallest possible b consistent with b – c = 3 and c ≥ 0:

b = 3, c = 0  → year = 2 3 0 7 = 2307.

   • AB divisible by 2 ⇒ B is even.  
   • CD divisible by 4 ⇒ D is even.  
   • DE divisible by 5 ⇒ E = 5.  
   • EF divisible by 6 ⇒ F is even and (E+F) divisible by 3.  
   • GH divisible by 8 ⇒ H is even and the 2‑digit number GH is a multiple of 8.  
   • The even digits available in 1‑9 are 2,4,6,8, meaning B, D, F, H must be exactly these four digits.

3. EF = 5F must be divisible by 6.
   – F must be even.  
   – 5+F ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
   Among {2,4,6,8} only F = 4 makes 5+4 = 9 divisible by 3.  
   ⇒ F = 4.

4. FG must be divisible by 7 and begins with 4 (because F = 4).
   The two‑digit multiples of 7 that start with 4 are 42 and 49.
   – FG = 42 gives G = 2, but then GH = 26, which is not divisible by 8 ⇒ reject.
   – FG = 49 gives G = 9. Accept.

5. GH must be divisible by 8 with G = 9, so GH can be 96 (since 92 is not a multiple of 8).
   ⇒ H = 6 and GH = 96 is valid.

6. The even digits left for B and D are 2 and 8.

7. HI must be divisible by 9 with H = 6.

           BC ( = 2C ) must be divisible by 3 → C = 1 or 7 work (21 or 27),  
           but CD ( = C8 ) must be divisible by 4 → neither 18 nor 78 is, so no solution.

   Case 2: B = 8, D = 2  
           BC ( = 8C ) divisible by 3 → C = 1 (81) or C = 7 (87) both work.  
           CD ( = C2 ) divisible by 4 → 12 and 72 are both multiples of 4.

Because C can cross in 2 minutes on foot, for any T ≥ 2 we may choose tC = 0.  
Hence only A and B need bicycle time.

For a target finishing time T the minimal bicycle times that allow A and B to make it are  

    tA = (10 – T)/9,   tB = (5 – T)/4.       (1)

They are both non‑negative when T ≤ 5.  
Insert (1) into the resource constraint:

     (10 – T)/9 + (5 – T)/4 ≤ T
     ⇔ 85 – 13T ≤ 36T
     ⇔ 49 ≤ 13T
     ⇔ T ≥ 49/13 ≈ 3.76923 min.

Thus no schedule can get everybody across in less than 49/13 minutes.  
We now show that 49/13 is attainable.

Optimal schedule (time in minutes, distances in bridge lengths)

• 0 – 4/13   B rides the bicycle the first 4/13 of the bridge, leaves it there,
              then walks the rest.

   – At t = 4/13 the bicycle is at position 4/13.

• C simply starts walking at t = 0 and finishes at t = 2.

• A starts walking at t = 0.

   – It takes A 40/13 minutes to reach position 4/13  
      ( distance / speed = (4/13)/(1/10) = 40/13 ).

• 40/13 – 49/13   A now rides the bicycle the remaining 9/13 of the bridge  
                   (time 9/13), reaching the far bank at t = 49/13.

• B after leaving the bicycle walks the remaining 9/13 of the bridge:  
   time = (9/13)/(1/5) = 45/13.  
   Finishing time for B: 4/13 + 45/13 = 49/13.

Finish times  
C : 2 < 49/13  
A : 49/13  
B : 49/13

All are across at t = 49/13 minutes, and the bicycle is used for  
tA + tB = 9/13 + 4/13 = 13/13 = 49/13 minutes, satisfying the resource limit.

Because 49/13 is both a lower bound and is achievable, it is the minimal possible time.

Final answer: 49/13 minutes ≈ 3 minutes 46 seconds",True
126,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
In a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).

• together use the multiset of digits {0,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,9} exactly once, and  
• satisfy  numerator / denominator = 1/2  ⟺  denominator = 2 · numerator.

Denote  
N = numerator (last digit n₀),  
D = denominator = 2N (last digit d₀).

1.  Units digits.  
   For every possible units digit n₀ of N we compute d₀ = 2·n₀ (mod 10) and keep only pairs whose d₀ is an available digit.  
   The available pairs are   
   (1,2), (2,4), (3,6), (5,0), (6,2).  
   We choose the pair (5,0); this uses the unique digits 5 and 0 and immediately makes D even.  
   Thus  
   N = …1 5, D = … 0,  
   and doubling 5 gives 0 with a carry 1 into the tens place.

2.  Tens digits.  
   Let the tens digit of N be d.  We must have

        2d + 1 (carry) = 10·c₁ + j ,

   where j is the tens digit of D and c₁ the carry into the hundreds place.  
   Trying the remaining digits {1,2,2,3,4,4,6,9} gives

        d = 1  →  j = 3,  c₁ = 0   (allowed)  
        d = 4  →  j = 9,  c₁ = 0   (allowed)  
        d = 6  →  j = 3,  c₁ = 1   (allowed)  
        d = 9  →  j = 9,  c₁ = 1   (allowed)

   We adopt the first of these: d = 1, j = 3 (no carry).

3.  Hundreds digits.  
   Let the hundreds digit of N be c.  With no incoming carry we need

        2c = 10·c₂ + k ,

   where k is the hundreds digit of D and c₂ the next carry.  
   From the still unused digits {2,2,4,4,6,9} only

        c = 2  →  k = 4,  c₂ = 0  
        c = 6  →  k = 2,  c₂ = 1

   are possible.  Pick c = 2, k = 4 (no carry).

4.  Thousands digits.  
   Let the thousands digit of N be b.  Again with zero carry:

        2b = 10·c₃ + ℓ ,

   ℓ being the thousands digit of D.  Using digits {2,4,4,6,9} we have

        b = 6  →  ℓ = 2,  c₃ = 1  
        b = 2  →  ℓ = 4,  c₃ = 0

   We choose b = 6, ℓ = 2, creating a carry 1 into the ten‑thousands place.

5.  Ten‑thousands digits.  
   The only digits still unused are {4,9}.  Let a be the ten‑thousands digit of N.  
   With incoming carry 1 we need 2a + 1 < 10 (otherwise D would gain an extra digit), so

        2a + 1 ≤ 9  →  a ≤ 4.

   Therefore a = 4, and the leading digit of D becomes 9.

We have now fixed every digit:

        N = 4 6 2 1 5  =  46215  
        D = 9 2 4 3 0  =  92430.

Double check: 2 · 46215 = 92430, and the digits
0,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,9 appear exactly once across N and D.

Hence the required fraction is 46215 / 92430 = 1/2.

129,"Xavier and Rex were playing a game that involved 5 dice. In each turn, they would roll the 5 dice. Each face of the die is worth a different amount of points. On their first 2 shots, they rolled this:

Rex 1: 2, 4, 4, 5, 6 = 268 points
Xavier 2: 1, 1, 1, 4, 4 = 203 points
Rex 2: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 = 216 points

From Xavier's first shot and Rex's second shot, we can deduce that a 2 is worth more than a 3. From Xavier's second shot, we can deduce that a 1 is worth an odd number. By trial and error we can work out the value of each face.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the six unknown point–values of the faces  

 1,2,3,4,5,6  

be denoted by  

 a , b , c , d , e , f  (respectively).

From the four rolls we are told

(1) a + 2c + d + f = 177        (Xavier 1)  
(2) b + 2d + e + f = 268        (Rex 1)  
(3) 3a + 2d        = 203        (Xavier 2)  
(4) a + b + c + d + f = 216        (Rex 2)

These are four linear equations in the six unknowns a,b,c,d,e,f.

Solving the four independent equations:

 d = (203 – 3a)/2        (from (3))  
 f = (151 + a)/2 – 2c       (from (1))  
 b = 216 – a – c – d – f     (from (4))  
 e = 52  + a + c – d       (from (2))

Thus every choice of the two variables a (which must be odd and ≤ 67 so that d is a positive integer) and c (any positive integer that keeps f and e positive and makes all six values different) produces a perfectly valid set of face‑values.

For example  
 a=5, c=38 gives (a,b,c,d,e,f) = (5, 77, 38, 94, 1, 2);  
 a=41, c=3 gives (41, 42, 3, 40, 56, 90);  
 a=11, c=35 gives (11, 70, 35, 85, 8, 9);  
and so on.  There are infinitely many such choices.

What about the third rolls?

Xavier 3 uses the faces 1,2,2,3,4; its score is  
 X₃ = a + 2b + c + d = (359 – a + 6c)/2.

Rex 3 uses the faces 1,3,4,6,6; its score is  
 R₃ = a + c + d + 2f = (505 + a – 6c)/2.

Because a and c are still free, X₃ and R₃ are not fixed numbers; they vary with the particular admissible choice of a and c (although their sum is always X₃ + R₃ = 432).

Hence

• the point‑value of each face, and  
• the scores obtained by Xavier and Rex on their third turn  

cannot be determined uniquely from the information given.  Many different consistent solutions exist.

Final answer:  It is impossible to work out unique values; the data leave two degrees of freedom, so infinitely many sets of face‑values (and third‑turn scores) satisfy all the stated totals.",True

H₁₀ = 2.928968…  
H₁₁ = 3.019877…

Thus

f₁₀ = H₁₀ /3 ≈ 0.976323   (not yet there)

So the spider finishes during the 11th minute (between 10 and 11 minutes after the start).

Exact finishing time  
After 10 minutes the band length is

L₁₀ = 3(10+1) = 33 inches.

Fraction left to cover:

1 − f₁₀ = 1 − H₁₀/3 = (3 − H₁₀)/3.

Distance left = L₁₀(1 − f₁₀)
              = 33 · (3 − H₁₀)/3
              = 33 − 11H₁₀
              = 33 − 11·(7381/2520)

Walking 1 inch per minute, the remaining time is

t_remaining = 1969/2520 min ≈ 0.7817 min ≈ 46.9 s.

Total time

T = 10 min + 1969/2520 min = 27169/2520 min ≈ 10.78 min

133,"A postman delivered letters every day. On the first day he delivered one letter, on the second day he delivered three letters, on the third day he delivered five letters, and so on. Each day from the second on he delivered two letters more than the preceding day.
The day he retired, he noticed that he had delivered a total of more than 100,000 letters.
Something fun is that the total number of letters he had delivered has its digits arranged in ascending order.
How many days had he worked, and how many letters had he delivered in total?",The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.,"It's easy to see that the number of letters he had delivered is the square of the number of days he had worked.
Square numbers can't end in 7 or 8, and 123456 is not a square because it is divisible by 3 but not by 9. Hence the number of letters must end with 9.
Since odd squares have remainder 1 upon division by 8, the number formed by its fourth and fifth digits must be divisible by 4, which can be 48, 56 or 68.
Numbers that have remainder 2 upon division by 3, and those that are divisible by 3 but not by 9 are not squares. By trial and error, we know that the only square number satisfying these conditions is 134689=367^2.
Hence, he had worked for 367 days, and had delivered 134689 letters.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the number of days the postman worked be n.

Letters delivered on day k : 1, 3, 5, … , so  
day k → 2k – 1 letters.

Total after n days  
S = 1 + 3 + 5 + … + (2n – 1) = n²  
(the sum of the first n odd numbers).

We need n² > 100 000 and the digits of n² must be in strictly ascending order.

1.  Since n² > 100 000, n ≥ 317 (because 316² = 99 856).  
2.  A 5–digit number cannot exceed 99 999, so n² is a 6–digit number.  
    The largest 6–digit number whose digits are strictly ascending is 456 789  
    (digits 4,5,6,7,8,9).  
    Therefore n² ≤ 456 789, hence n ≤ ⌊√456 789⌋ = 675.

So 317 ≤ n ≤ 675.

3.  For a 6‑digit number to have strictly ascending digits the last digit must be at
    least 6 (otherwise there are not enough smaller digits available).
    But a perfect square can end only in 0,1,4,5,6,9, and 6 is impossible
    (the only ascending 6‑digit number ending in 6 is 123 456, not a square).
    Thus n² must end in 9, so n ends in 3 or 7.

4.  Check the 72 values of n in 317 ≤ n ≤ 675 that end in 3 or 7.

   Doing this (or, equivalently, checking each of the 56 six‑digit ascending
   numbers ending in 9 for being a square) reveals exactly one match:

                n = 367  →  n² = 134 689

   134 689 has digits 1 < 3 < 4 < 6 < 8 < 9, satisfying the ascending condition.

No other n in the required range gives an ascending‑digit square, so the
solution is unique.

Hence

Number of working days n = 367  
Total letters delivered n² = 134 689

1.  Since AB and BC must be two‑digit primes, their units digits (B for AB, C for BC) have to be 1, 3, or 7 (9 is forbidden and 5 would give a multiple of 5).  
   So B ∈ {1,3,7} and C ∈ {1,3,7} with C ≠ B (digits are distinct).

2.  List the possible two‑digit primes of the form BC:

   B=1  →  13, 17

   • (B,C) = (1,3)

136,"Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?
Comments to triflers:
The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!",There are hints in the comments to triflers and in the title.,"80
To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion. This takes 9 trips of 2 5/18 miles (5 advancing trips interspersed with 4 return trips) for a total of 20.5 miles traveled (9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5) and 20.5 bottles of soda used. Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases. With one less case to move, Bu will now make 2 fewer trips. The 3.5 bottles set aside are used to move the four cases the next 1/2 mile toward the Wirth Pavilion.   After this, the Wirth Pavilion is just 2 2/9 miles away ( 5 - 2 5/18 - 9/18 = 2 4/18 ). Next, he travels 15 5/9 miles (7 * 2 2/9) using 15 5/9 bottles of soda to complete his trip. The ranger cadet delivers 80 bottles to the pavilion and has 4/9 of a Park Pop to spare. (96 - 15 5/9 = 80 4/9)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

C = 25   (maximum number of bottles – opened or unopened – that can be on the MoJoPed at one time)  
D = 5 mi (distance to be covered)  
N = 120 (un‑opened bottles available at the Weiss Pavilion = 5 cases × 24)

Every time the machine travels one mile it “uses up’’ one bottle.  
If, at some spot on the road, there are more than C bottles waiting to be taken farther,
the driver has to shuttle: go forward with a load, come back empty (or nearly empty) to get
another load, and so on.  

Suppose k = ⌈n/C⌉ loads are necessary to move the n bottles that are at one place
one mile farther along the road.  
For the first k–1 loads Bu must drive that mile forward and the same mile back,
using 2 bottles per load, while the last load is driven forward once,
using 1 bottle.  So the absolute minimum fuel that can be burnt to move
all n bottles one mile is

               2(k – 1) + 1 = 2k – 1 bottles.

That figure gives a lower bound; if we can design a plan that actually attains that bound,
it is optimal.

------------------------------------------------
1.  From 120 bottles down to 100 bottles
------------------------------------------------
With 120 bottles we need k = ⌈120/25⌉ = 5 loads,
so the least possible fuel consumption per mile is 2·5 – 1 = 9 bottles.
To get the stock down to 100 bottles we must burn 20 bottles.
At 9 bottles per mile that takes

        20 / 9 miles.

After travelling 20/9 miles we are 2 2⁄9 miles from Weiss Pavilion and
exactly 100 bottles remain.

------------------------------------------------
2.  From 100 bottles to Wirth Pavilion
------------------------------------------------
With 100 bottles only k = ⌈100/25⌉ = 4 loads are required,
so the least possible fuel consumption drops to 2·4 – 1 = 7 bottles per mile.
The distance still to go is

        5 − 20/9 = 25/9 miles.

Fuel burnt on that stretch is

        7 · 25/9 = 175/9 bottles.

Bottles that arrive (un‑opened) at the Wirth Pavilion:

        100 − 175/9 = 725/9 = 80 5⁄9.

------------------------------------------------
3.  Integer bottling
------------------------------------------------
Because bottles are indivisible, at most 80 of them can arrive unopened.
That bound of 80 is reachable (for example, by doing exactly the two‑stage shuttle
described above and letting the fractional 5⁄9 of a bottle be the fuel left in the
tank), so 80 is the maximum.

Final answer: 80",True
137,"Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.

Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""

Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?",Would Pythagoras have the same plan?,"The rise in the middle of the tracks would have been much greater than Henry surmised.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse). SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Assumptions the boss makes (and Henry ignores)

1.  Each rail is 1 mile = 5 280 ft = 63 360 in long.  
   The coefficient of thermal expansion is such that the rail becomes 1 in longer in the worst‐case temperature change.
2.  Henry pins the rail to the ground at every other joint, so the ends that are actually fixed are 2 miles = 10 560 ft = 126 720 in apart.
3.  Between two pins the two one‑mile pieces behave as one continuous “bar” 2 inches longer than the distance between its fixed ends.  
   It therefore has to take the shape of an arc that is 2 in longer than its 10 560 ft straight‑line distance.

How much “hump” does 2 extra inches create?

Let  

c = straight–line distance between the pins = 10 560 ft = 126 720 in  
Δ = extra length that must be absorbed by a buckle = 2 in  

Assume the rail buckles into a very shallow circular arc.  
For a shallow arc the excess length Δ and the mid‑height (sagitta) h are related by

Δ ≈ 8h² ⁄ (3c)  (standard approximation for a shallow circular arc).

Solve for h:

h ≈ √(3cΔ ⁄ 8).

Insert the numbers:

h ≈ √[ (3)(126 720 in)(2 in) ⁄ 8 ]  
  ≈ √(95 040) in  
  ≈ 308 in ≈ 25.7 ft.

So the track between two pins will rise roughly twenty‑five feet off the ground!

Even if Henry had pinned every single joint (so c = 1 mile and Δ = 1 in), the buckle height would still be

h ≈ √[ (3)(63 360)(1) ⁄ 8 ] ≈ 154 in ≈ 12.8 ft.

Why the boss fired Henry

A train cannot “bump over” a hump that towers a dozen (let alone twenty‑five) feet above the grade.  
Henry’s intuition that “an inch or two of extra length will make only an inch or two of buckle” is dead wrong; with long fixed spans a tiny percentage increase in length produces enormous vertical deflections.  
Seeing this fundamental misunderstanding of elementary structural geometry, the boss quite reasonably concluded that Henry was unfit for the job.

Final answer: The 2 inches of extra rail between fixed points 2 miles apart forces a buckle about 25 feet high (even 1 mile spans would buckle ~13 ft), far too large for trains to ride over, so Henry’s plan is disastrously unsafe and his boss fires him.",True

1.  Place  
   A = (0, 0), B = (16, 0) (AB is 16 ft and horizontal).

2.  Because AF ⟂ AB and AF = 6 ft, put  
   F = (0, –6).

3.  BC ∥ AF and BC = 6 ft →  
   C = (16, –6).

4.  FC ∥ AB.  Hence FC is horizontal and 16 ft long.

5.  On FC take G and H with FG = HC = 4 ft:  
   G = (4, –6), H = (12, –6).

6.  DH ⟂ HC and DH = 4 ft, so D is 4 ft straight below H:  
   D = (12, –10).

   Check angle BCD = 135°:  
   C→B = (0, 6), C→D = (–4, –4).  
   The angle between these vectors is arccos[(0)(–4)+6(–4)] / (6√32) = 135°, as required.

7.  ED ∥ AB and ED = 8 ft; going left from D gives  
   E = (4, –10).

   Check that EG ⟂ FG and EG = 4 ft:  
   G→E = (0, –4) is vertical (perpendicular to horizontal FG) and 4 ft long.

8.  Check angle AFE = 135°:  
   F→A = (0, 6), F→E = (4, –4).  
   The angle between them is 135°.

Mouse(A) bites off one rope in 60 minutes.
Mouse(B) bites off one rope in 90 minutes.

You do not have any time or distance measuring tools and the length of the rope is unknown.  How can you measure 75 minutes?",,"Mark the two ropes as Rope(A) and Rope(B).
1. Let Mouse(A) and Mouse(C) start biting off Rope(A) at the same time, starting each from  one end (moving in opposite directions).  At the same time, let Mouse(B) start biting off Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(A) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X = S(A) * 60, where S(A) is biting speed for Mouse(A) and X is Rope(A) length
X = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X is Rope(A) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(A)/S(C) = 3:1, which means that for each 3 units Mouse(A) will move, Mouse (C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(A) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(A) bites off three times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides Rope(A) length in to 4 units.
Mouse(A) bitten off portion = 3/4 X (where X is Rope(A) length)
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/4 X
Finding the time spent before Rope(A) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(A) needs  60 minutes to bite off X, How many minutes are needed to bite off 3/4 X?
Minutes needed = 3/4 * 60 = 45 minutes are needed to fully bite off Rope(A) by Mouse(A) and Mouse(C).  At that point in time, Mouse(B) would have bitten off exactly half the length of Rope(B) (needing 90 minutes to bite off the full rope), and needs an additional 45 minutes to bite off the remaining rope half.
2. Let Mouse(B) continue biting off Rope(B) and make Mouse(C) start biting off the other end of Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(B) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X/2 = S(B) * 90, where S(B) is biting speed for Mouse(B) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
X/2 = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(B)/S(C) = 2:1, which means that for each 2 units Mouse(B) will move, Mouse(C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(B) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(B) bites off two times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides the remaining half of Rope(B) length to 3 units.

So the whole rope is being removed at

When the two fronts meet and nothing is left, you have a clear, observable event: 30 minutes have passed.

N = 225 × k  (k is a positive integer)

and, when written in ordinary decimal notation, N must consist exclusively of the digits 0 and 1.

Break the divisibility requirement.

1. 225 = 9 × 25  
   • Divisibility by 25 means the last two decimal digits must be 00 (because 25, 50, 75 all use forbidden digits).  
   • Divisibility by 9 means the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9.

So N must look like “(some digits)…00”, and among all its digits the count of 1’s must be a multiple of 9.

Strip off the mandatory ending “00”.  
Write N = 100 × m, where m itself is a decimal number made only of 0’s and 1’s.

Because gcd(100, 9)=1, 9 divides N ⇔ 9 divides m.  
Hence the problem reduces to:

Find the smallest positive multiple of 9 whose decimal expansion uses only 0’s and 1’s.

Digit–sum viewpoint.

• A decimal number made of 0’s and 1’s has digit–sum equal to the number of 1’s it contains.  
• To be divisible by 9, that digit–sum must be 9, 18, 27, …  
• With at most 8 digits you cannot reach a digit–sum of 9 (the maximum would be 8).  
  Therefore such a number must have at least 9 digits.

Try 9 digits.  
The lexicographically (and numerically) smallest 9‑digit string of 0/1’s containing exactly nine 1’s is

   111 111 111.

Its digit‑sum is 9, so it is divisible by 9.  
Hence

   m = 111 111 111  is the smallest possible.

Re‑attach the two obligatory zeros.

   N = 100 × m = 11 111 111 100.

Verification.

• Last two digits are 00  ⇒ divisible by 25.  
• Digit‑sum = 9  ⇒ divisible by 9.  
⇒ N is divisible by 225.

No smaller N can work:

– A 10‑digit number ending in 00 would have only 8 remaining digits; the greatest possible digit‑sum would be 8, so it can’t be divisible by 9.  
– For 11‑digit numbers ending in 00, all first 9 digits must be 1 to reach digit‑sum 9, giving exactly the number above.  
Thus 11 111 111 100 is indeed the minimum.

There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5.

Since 7*14=98, there was only one cyclist that he never beat and that was the champion.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Think of the 14 stages being run according to the usual road‑cycling rule:

•  Riders who cross the finish line together are all given exactly the same time;  
   their order of crossing counts only for the day’s stage placings.

Design the race as follows.

Stage pattern (the same on every one of the 14 stages)

1.  The future overall winner (call him the Champion) attacks early and finishes
    the stage all alone, 10 minutes ahead of everybody else.

2.  Ninety‑two riders – one of whom is “Crazy” Charles – reach the finish in a big
    bunch.  Because they arrive together they all get the same time, 10 minutes
    slower than the Champion’s.  When the bunch sprints for the line Charles
    is the last man in it, so he is recorded as 93rd for the stage
    (the Champion is 1st, the other 91 in the bunch are 2nd‑92nd).

3.  The remaining seven riders come in far behind, one hour after the bunch.
    They therefore receive a time that is 1 h 00 min slower than Charles’s.

Varying the seven “stragglers”
There are 14 stages × 7 straggler places = 98 “late‑arrival slots”.
Let every one of the 98 riders other than the Champion and Charles occupy
one of those slots exactly once.
Thus, during the whole race

•  Charles is never a straggler; he is always in the bunch.  
•  Each of the other 98 riders is a straggler on one stage and loses
   an extra hour to Charles on that day, but finishes in the bunch (same time as
   Charles) on the other 13 stages.  
•  The Champion gains 10 minutes on Charles on every stage.

Compute the accumulated times

Champion:   gains 10 min × 14 = 2 h 20 min on Charles.

Charles:    loses nothing extra at any time.

Any other rider:  
  loses the same 10 min per stage to the Champion that Charles loses,  
  and on one stage also loses 1 h 00 min to Charles.  
  Therefore he finishes the race 1 h 00 min behind Charles.

So, after 14 stages

1st Champion   (best total time)  
2nd “Crazy” Charles  (1 h ahead of everyone else except the Champion)  
3rd‑100th  All the remaining riders

Hence it is perfectly possible for Charles to have finished 93rd in every single
stage and still be runner‑up in the general classification.

Final answer: Because stage times are awarded to whole groups that finish together, Charles could always finish last in the main bunch (93rd place) while every other rider (except the eventual winner) lost a large amount of time on at least one stage; thus Charles’s consistent bunch finishes left him with the second‑best aggregate time even though he never placed better than 93rd on any single day.",True
147,"The Boldavian navy has a rigorous training program.  In order to graduate from the naval academy, cadets must enter a pool and fight sharks.  Today, a group of cadets was tested.  Each cadet put on his mask, snorkel, and two flippers; and armed himself with a knife.  Then the cadets jumped into the pool.  The sharks were then released from their pens.  After 10 minutes of gruelling hand-to-fin combat, all of the sharks were killed.  Miraculously, none of the cadets were killed.  Exiting the pool, the cadets began to haul the shark bodies out of the water.  The dead sharks were soon lying in a row.  One of the cadets noted that during the fight, there were 4 times as many cadets in the water as there were sharks.  A second cadet then stated that the number of legs they now had was equal to the square of the number of sharks.  A third said that the number of cadet legs was 14 more than the total number of cadet and shark heads.  How many sharks were killed?",,"7 sharks were killed.
Since there were 4 times as many cadets, there were 28 cadets.  The number of cadet legs is equal to the square of the number of sharks, which would be 49 legs.  49 legs is 14 more than the number of cadet and shark heads: 7 sharks plus 28 cadets equals 35 heads.
Note that although all of the cadets survived, nothing was said about possible injuries.  In fact, each shark had bitten off one leg from each of 7 cadets.  This explains the shortage of legs, since 28 cadets should have had 56 legs, not 49.  Also note the statement of the second cadet, who said 'the number of legs they NOW had ...'.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

But L also equals s² from (2).  Equate (2) and (4):

s² = 5s + 14  
s² – 5s – 14 = 0  
(s – 7)(s + 2) = 0  

Since s > 0, we get s = 7.

148,"There is a five digit square number that is palindromic, and each digit is also a nonzero square number.

Because it must read the same backwards, its first and last digits are the same (A), and its second and fourth digits are the same (B).

1. Each digit must itself be a non‑zero perfect square digit; hence each digit is in {1, 4, 9}.  
2. A perfect square is congruent to 0 or 1 (mod 4).  
   Compute ABCBA (mod 4):

   ABCBA = 10001A + 1010B + 100C

   Since A, B ∈ {1,4,9} ⇒ A ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 4) and B ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 4).

   • If B ≡ 1, then A + 2 ≡ 0,1  ⇒ A ≡ 2 or 3 (impossible).

Let the original price of the Red Rose bouquet  be 'B' Roka.
It is given that during a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%.
Hence after a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 162 Roka, the price of the bouquet

Substituting the above value of Y^2 in equation 1, we get

151,"In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.
On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.
About this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, ""Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.""
Knowing Junior, we asked, ""How big a headache is your math gonna give us?""
She answered, ""I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.""
Name the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.",Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.,"Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.
After labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, ""Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof. First, I mark a line from A to D.  This creates a trapezoid (trapezium in Britain) ABCD.  Next, I mark the lines EH, BG, and CF.  These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.""
The partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's. (The second and third cuts can be made in reverse order.)

  This isolates the quadrilateral A‑B‑C‑D.

After the third cut we have obtained

 Q₁ = ABCD  Q₂ = DEFG  T₁ = DGH  T₂ = HDA ,

altogether four pieces.

Why the four pieces are equal‑area  

Put the octagon with its centre O at the origin and inscribe it in the unit
circle.  
For any polygon with vertices (x₀ , y₀ ), … , (x_{m−1} , y_{m−1}) its area is

  S = ½ │ Σ (x_i y_{i+1}  −  x_{i+1} y_i) │   (the “shoelace’’ rule)

(take the index i+1 cyclically).

Working only with that rule one finds

 area(ABCD)  =  ½ (3 sin 45° − sin 135°)  
       =  (sin 45°) ,

 area(DGH)  =  ½ (2 sin 45°)  
       =  (sin 45°) ,

and the same value is obtained for DEFG and HDA.  
(The numerical value sin 45° = √2 ⁄ 2 need never be written; it
cancels out everywhere, so no roots, powers or trigonometry are really
required.)

Because every piece has the same area, each of them is one quarter of the
whole cake.  
The first two cuts each produced exactly one of those quarters; the last cut
split what was left into the final two quarters, so all the conditions stated
in the problem are satisfied.

pieces ABCD, DEFG, DGH and HDA are all of equal area.",True

(q , r) = (4 , 15), (5 , 9), (6 , 7).

Case p = 3.

Putting p = 3 in (5) gives

(q – 2)(r – 2) = 6,

which yields

(q , r) = (3 , 8), (4 , 5).

Case p ≥ 4.

If p ≥ 4 then p q r ≥ 4·4·4 = 64, and by (4) this forces N ≥ 16·64 = 1024, already larger than one solution we have found below, so no smaller total can arise here. (A direct check for p = 4, 5 shows there is in fact no solution at all.)

Thus all solutions are

(p , q , r) = (2,4,15), (2,5,9), (2,6,7), (3,3,8), (3,4,5).

────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Compute N for each solution (use N = 16 p q r)

(2,4,15) → N = 16·2·4·15 = 1920  
(2,5,9)  → N = 16·2·5·9  = 1440  
(2,6,7)  → N = 16·2·6·7  = 1344  
(3,3,8)  → N = 16·3·3·8  = 1152  
(3,4,5)  → N = 16·3·4·5  = 960 ← smallest

────────────────────────────────────────
4.  Recover the cuboid’s actual dimensions for the minimal case

For (p , q , r) = (3 , 4 , 5):

a = 2(p+1) = 2·4 = 8 cm  
b = 2(q+1) = 2·5 = 10 cm  
c = 2(r+1) = 2·6 = 12 cm.

Indeed,

interior cubes = (8–2)(10–2)(12–2) = 6·8·10 = 480  
surface  cubes = 8·10·12 – 480 = 960 – 480 = 480.

So the numbers match, and 960 is the least total possible.

153,"Find three numbers, all under 500, where the sum of all three is a perfect square and the sums of any two of them are also perfect squares.",,"41, 80, 320",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the three required numbers be  
a , b , c   (< 500)  

and denote the three pair–sums and the total sum by squares

a + b = p²  
a + c = q²  
b + c = r²  
a + b + c = s².                (1)

1.  Express a , b , c in terms of the three squares  
 From the first three equations of (1)

 2a = p² + q² – r² ⇒ a = (p² + q² – r²)/2  
 2b = p² + r² – q² ⇒ b = (p² + r² – q²)/2            (2)  
 2c = q² + r² – p² ⇒ c = (q² + r² – p²)/2

   For a , b , c to be positive all three right‑hand sides must be positive, i.e.  
 p² , q² , r² satisfy the triangle inequality.

2.  A useful relation among p , q , r , s  
   Adding the three pair‑sums gives  
 p² + q² + r² = 2(a + b + c) = 2s².                 (3)

   Hence we need three squares whose sum equals twice another square and which pass the
   triangle test.

3.  Looking for such a triple of squares  
   Take two odd squares of the same residue mod 16 (so that their sum is 2 (mod 16))
   and look for an even square which completes (3).

   A convenient choice is  

 19² = 361, 21² = 441 (both 9 mod 16)  

   Their sum is 361 + 441 = 802.

   We want an even square t² such that  

 361 + 441 + t² = 2s².                               (4)

   Trying successive odd s gives s = 23 :

 2·23² = 2·529 = 1058, so take t² = 1058 – 802 = 256 = 16².   (5)

   Thus we have the three pair‑squares  

 p² = 361 (= 19²), q² = 441 (= 21²), r² = 256 (= 16²).        (6)

   Since 441 < 361 + 256 and 361 < 441 + 256 and 256 < 361 + 441,
   the triangle inequality holds, so (2) gives positive a , b , c.

4.  Determining a , b , c  

 a = (361 + 441 – 256)/2 = 546/2 = 273  
 b = (361 + 256 – 441)/2 = 176/2 = 88  
 c = (441 + 256 – 361)/2 = 336/2 = 168                 (7)

   All three are < 500.

5.  Verification  

 a + b = 273 + 88 = 361 = 19²  
 a + c = 273 + 168 = 441 = 21²  
 b + c = 88 + 168 = 256 = 16²  
 a + b + c = 273 + 88 + 168 = 529 = 23².              (8)

   Every requirement of the problem is satisfied.

Therefore the three desired numbers are 88, 168 and 273.

154,"Mad Ade noticed that he could arrange the five odd digits (1,3,5,7,9) into a five-digit number, such that the first two digits (as a 2-digit number) times the last two digits (as a 2-digit number) minus the center digit results in a number composed of repetitions of one digit.
Mad Ade noted there were two possible answers.
What are they?",,"Answers are 39157 and 57139
39*57= 2223-1= 2222
57*39= 2223-1= 2222",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the five–digit number be  

 D₁D₂D₃D₄D₅  (with the digits 1,3,5,7,9, all different).  

Set  
 A = 10·D₁ + D₂ (the first two‑digit number)  
 B = 10·D₄ + D₅ (the last two‑digit number)  
 C = D₃      (the centre digit)

Mad Ade’s condition is  

 A·B – C  =  a repdigit (all its digits equal).

Step 1 – Parity of the repdigit  
A and B are odd, so A·B is odd.  
Subtracting the odd digit C gives an even result, therefore the repeated digit must be even: 2, 4, 6 or 8.

Step 2 – Last–digit condition  
The last digit of A·B is the product of the units digits of A and B; call that u.  
We need u – C ≡ d (mod 10), where d is the repeated digit (2,4,6 or 8).  
Trying all odd digits for u and C shows only one possibility:

 u ≡ 3 (mod 10) and C = 1 gives u – C ≡ 2.

Hence the repdigit must be 222…2, and the centre digit is 1.

Step 3 – Size of the repdigit  
The smallest possible value of A·B (13×57) is 741; the largest (97×59) is 5 723.  
Therefore A·B – 1 must be at least 732, so the repdigit has at least four digits.  
The only four–digit repdigit whose final digit is 2 is 2222.

So we must have  

 A·B − 1 = 2222 ⇒ A·B = 2223.

Step 4 – Factoring 2223  
2223 = 3²·13·19 = 39·57 = 57·39.

Both factors are two–digit numbers that use only the digits 1,3,5,7,9 once each (39 uses 3,9; 57 uses 5,7) and leave 1 for the centre digit.  Thus

 A, B = 39 and 57  (in either order), C = 1.

Step 5 – Forming the five‑digit numbers
1. A = 39, C = 1, B = 57 ⇒ 39157  
2. A = 57, C = 1, B = 39 ⇒ 57139

Verification  
39157: 39×57 = 2223; 2223 – 1 = 2222 ✔  
57139: 57×39 = 2223; 2223 – 1 = 2222 ✔

155,"Old Farmer McDoughnut owns a piece of grassland in the heart of Madadia and has three animals: a Madadian Burger Cow, a Spare Kebab Goat, and a Scotch Egg laying Goose. McDoughnut discovered the following:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 45 days.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 90 days also.
For how long can the three animals graze on the field together?",,"The cow, the goat, and the goose eat grass with a constant speed (amount per day): v1 for the cow, v2 for the goat, v3 for the goose.
The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:
v1 = 3 x h/180,
v2 = 2 x h/180,
v3 = 1 x h/180,
k = 1 x h/180.
Then holds for the time t that the three animals can graze together: h-tx(v1+v2+v3-k) = 0, so t = h/(v1+v2+v3-k) = h/(3xh/180+2xh/180+1xh/180-1xh/180) = 36. The three animals can graze together for 36 days.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

F = amount of grass that is on the field at the start (measured in “grass‑units”),  
r = grass that grows back each day,  
C , G , S = grass eaten per day by the Cow, the Goat, and the (Scotch‑egg‑laying) Goose, respectively.

While the animals are grazing, the grass on the field changes at the net rate  

  (net change) = r  – (consumption of the animals present).

If the net change is negative the stock of grass falls at constant rate  
  F / (consumption – r)  
and the field is bare when the initial stock is exhausted.

Hence, for every group we have  

  time until bare = F / (consumption of that group – r).

The data give four such equations.

1. Cow + Goat: 45 = F / (C + G – r)  ⇒ F = 45(C + G – r) … (i)
2. Cow + Goose: 60 = F / (C + S – r)  ⇒ F = 60(C + S – r) … (ii)
3. Cow alone:  90 = F / (C – r)     ⇒ F = 90(C – r) … (iii)
4. Goat + Goose: 90 = F / (G + S – r)  ⇒ F = 90(G + S – r) … (iv)

Use equation (iii) to express C – r:

 C – r = F / 90.                                        (1)

(i) minus (iii) eliminates C – r and r:

 (C + G – r) – (C – r) = F/45 – F/90  
 G = F/90.                                              (2)

(ii) minus (iii):

 (C + S – r) – (C – r) = F/60 – F/90  
 S = F/180.                                            (3)

Add (2) and (3): G + S = F/90 + F/180 = F/60.

Insert in (iv):

 G + S – r = F/90  
 F/60 – r = F/90 ⇒ r = F/180.                        (4)

Now find C from (1) and (4):

 C = (C – r) + r = F/90 + F/180 = F/60.                (5)

Summary of the rates (all in grass‑units per day):

 C = F/60, G = F/90, S = F/180, r = F/180.

Finally, when all three animals graze together the net depletion rate is

 (C + G + S) – r
 = (F/60 + F/90 + F/180) – F/180
 = (3F + 2F + 1F – 1F) / 180

Therefore the time until the grass is gone is

 t = F / (F/36) = 36 days.

156,n people each know a different piece of gossip.

This can be achieved as follows: choose four people (A, B, C, and D) as the ""core group"". Each person outside the core group phones a member of the core group (it doesn't matter which); this takes n-4 calls. Now the core group makes 4 calls: A-B, C-D, A-C, and B-D. At this point, each member of the core group knows everything. Now, each person outside the core group calls anybody who knows everything; this again requires n-4 calls, for a total of 2n-4.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"For 1, 2 and 3 people the minimum numbers of calls can be written down directly

• 1 person: nobody has to ring – 0 calls.  
• 2 people: one call lets the two of them swap what they know – 1 call.  
• 3 people: A telephones B, B telephones C, and C telephones A – 3 calls.  
  (With two calls at least one of the three would still be ignorant of something.)

From 4 people on the general answer is

  minimum number of calls = 2 n − 4       (n ≥ 4).

Why 2 n − 4 calls are enough

Label the people 1,2,…,n (n ≥ 4).

Step 1 1 telephones 2.          (1 call)

Step 2 n telephones 1.         (1 call, total 2)

After these two calls person 1 knows the gossips 1,2,n and persons 1 and n each know three different items.

Step 3 The remaining n − 3 people call 1 one after another
         (in the order n − 1, n − 2, … , 3).             (n − 3 calls, total n − 1)

 • while these calls are being made person 1 keeps
   gathering information;  
 • at the moment the k‑th of them (counting from the end)
   rings, 1 already knows everything except that caller’s
   own gossip, so the caller receives the whole collection.

Consequently after Step 3

  – person 1 knows every gossip;  
  – every caller of Step 3 (i.e. everybody except 2) also
         knows every gossip;  
  – only person 2 does not yet know everything.

Step 4 Somebody who already knows everything (for instance n)
         rings 2 once more and tells it to him.            (1 call)

Total number of calls

  1  (first call)  
 + 1  (second call)  
 + (n − 3)  (calls in Step 3)  
 + 1  (last call)  
 = 2n − 4.

So 2n − 4 calls always suffice.

Why 2 n − 4 calls are necessary

Take any sequence of calls that ends with everybody knowing everything.

• Look at the final call.  Just before it, at least two people
  still lacked some information – namely the two who
  took part in that last call.  
• The other n − 2 people were already fully informed
  before the last call took place, and each of those n − 2
  people had to learn his last new item in some *earlier*
  call.  A person can learn new items from only one side
  of a conversation, so each of those n − 2 fully informed
  people must have taken part in at least two earlier calls:
  one in which he got his last missing item and another
  in which he *gave* it to somebody else.  That accounts
  for at least 2(n − 2) person‑participations.  

• The last call contributes 2 more person‑participations,
  so altogether there have been at least 2(n − 2)+2 =
  2n − 2 person‑participations.  Each telephone call involves
  exactly two participants, hence the total number of calls
  is at least (2n − 2)/2 = n − 1.  

• But we already used n − 1 calls to make *everyone*
  know everything except the two people in the last call,
  so in addition we need those two final calls that made
  that last pair acquainted with the rest.  Hence at least  
  (n − 1)+ (n − 3)+1 = 2n − 4 calls are unavoidable.

Because 2n − 4 calls are both sufficient and necessary we have proved that

  For n ≥ 4 the smallest number of calls is 2n − 4.

161,"There was a body pump class that lasted a long time, but it always changed. The instructor was a very smart person and liked to throw puzzles at the students. About 15 minutes into the class, one kid asked how much time there was left in the class. He said: ""Right now? Oh, I'd say seven."" The kid was confused and knew the instructor was never going to tell anybody.
Another 5 minutes in, another kid asked how much time was left. The instructor said, ""About five now."" Confused, the kid went back and the class continued.

The condition “m is 50 % larger than n” gives

The two boats leave from opposite shores at the same time.  They pass at a point of 720 yards from Lard Sculptures.  Upon arriving at the opposite shore, each boat stays in its slip for 5 minutes, and then starts back. They pass again 400 yards from Kebab Fountains. Assume both boats travel along a straight line.

The ratio of the total distance traveled by the two boats when they pass each other for the second time is:  (2x - 400) / (X + 400).

The boats leave opposite ends simultaneously and meet 720 yd from Lard

x = D at Kebab Fountains).

Choose the faster launch order so that

 • Iceberg Magnet starts at Lard Sculptures (x = 0) and heads east.

At the first meeting:

 distance travelled by Iceberg = 720

Each boat waits 5 min after reaching the far shore, then returns.

Lead (now at the west side) leaves again at time   tL = D/vL + 5

Iceberg (now at the east side) leaves again at time tI = D/vI + 5

They meet the second time 400 yd from Kebab Fountains, i.e. at x = D – 400.

For that time t2 we therefore have

Replace D from (2) in (4):

2·720(1+r) – 400 = r[720(1+r) + 400]

You have no way to call for help. Luckily, in addition to medical supplies, the truck is carrying a Desert Patrol Vehicle (DPV) and two barrels of fuel.
The DPV has a full 10 gallon tank, but to make room for the medical supplies, it can only carry one of the 45 gallon barrels at a time. While you can't transfer fuel between barrels, you can refill the tank from the barrels. Assume the DPV can get 12 miles per gallon, regardless of the load it carries.

Use half of a tank (5 gallons) to carry L 5*12=60 miles, and then return for F (uses another 5 gallons). Refill the tank from F and carry it to where you left L (also uses 5 gallons). Refill the tank again from F and switch barrels. Now you are 60 miles from the broken truck, the tank and L are full, but F is down to 30 gallons (45-5-5-5=30). Repeat this procedure two times.
Now you are 60*3=180 miles from the broken truck. The tank and L are still full, but F is empty. Leave F behind and make a run for it, carrying L. Refill the tank from L as needed. There are 55 gallons of fuel left so you can travel an additional 55*12=660 miles, for a maximum of (180+660) 840 miles.

Hence, when you start the final dash the remaining distance must not exceed 660 miles; i.e.

Those 55 gallons carry you

Hence the DPV reaches

You can drive the DPV at most 840 miles; since the base camp is only 800 miles away, the medical supplies (and the DPV itself) can indeed be delivered with a little fuel to spare.

Because k ≥ 2, k must divide 2N.  
Notice the parity of the two factors in (2):

• If k is even, then 2a+k−1 is odd, so the right side of (2) is even×odd = even.  
  But for a to be an integer we need 2a+k−1 to be even (so that (2a+k−1)/2 is integral).  
  Hence k cannot be even.

• Therefore k must be odd.  Write k = d, an odd divisor of 2N.

576/9 = 64, 810/10 = 81, 1100/11 = 100, 1452/12 = 121, 1872/13 = 144.  

Those quotients are 8², 9², 10², 11², 12², i.e. (n – 1)².  
Hence  
First output A = n × (n – 1)².

For n = 25:  
n – 1 = 24.

B = 25 × 24 = 600  
A = 25 × 24² = 25 × 576 = 14 400

169,"Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.
We were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?",,"It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.
Hence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.
Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90. These 90 id's will not have a corresponding number when written in reverse order.
Secondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order. For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.
Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.
Therefore total number of valid employee id's possible = 90 + 90 + 360 = 540.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let an ID be written as the three–digit string  
a b c  with a ≠ 0 (otherwise the machine rejects it).

1.  Count all admissible IDs.  
   a can be 1–9 and b,c can be 0–9, so there are  
   9 × 10 × 10 = 900 possible IDs (100–999).

2.  Separate the IDs according to the behaviour of their reverse.

   •  IDs that end with 0 (c = 0)  
      Reversing c b a gives 0 b a, which starts with 0 and is therefore
      not a valid ID at all.  
      There are 9 × 10 = 90 such IDs (a = 1–9, b = 0–9).  
      Each of them is “alone”, so we can keep all 90.

   •  Palindromic IDs (a b a)  
      Reversing gives the same number, so no conflict arises if we keep it.
      There are 9 × 10 = 90 palindromes (a = 1–9, b = 0–9).  
      We keep all 90.

   •  All remaining IDs  
      These have c ≠ 0 and are not palindromes, so
      a b c ≠ c b a, but both numbers are valid.
      They therefore form two–element “reverse pairs” in which we may keep
      at most one member.  
      Count them: total admissible IDs (900) minus the 90 ending with 0
      minus the 90 palindromes leaves 720 IDs.  
      Hence there are 720 / 2 = 360 reverse pairs, and we may keep exactly
      one ID from each pair → 360 IDs.

3.  Add up all IDs we can retain:

      90  (ending with 0)  
    + 90  (palindromes)  
    + 360 (one from each non‑palindromic pair)  
    = 540.

Thus the largest possible set of three–digit IDs satisfying the requirement has 540 members.

a , b , c  (all positive and given to the nearest penny).

The shop‑keeper’s slip shows that  
a + b + c = 5.70  and  a b c = 5.70.

Write the prices in pence so that we work with whole numbers:
x = 100 a , y = 100 b , z = 100 c
(so x , y , z are positive integers and one penny = 1 unit).

Then  

x + y + z = 570                       (1)  
x y z = 5.70 × 10⁶ = 5 700 000   (2)

Factor 5 700 000:
5 700 000 = 2⁵ · 3 · 5⁵ · 19 .

We need x,y,z ≤ 570 whose product is 5 700 000 and whose sum is 570.
Take one factor x and compute the required y and z from (1) and (2):

If x is chosen, then  
y + z = 570 − x ,  y z = 5 700 000 / x .

For integral y and z we need the quadratic
t² − (570−x)t + 5 700 000/x = 0
to possess integral roots; that happens exactly when its discriminant
Δ = (570−x)² − 4·(5 700 000/x)

Testing the divisors of 5 700 000 that do not exceed 570 gives only one value of x producing a perfect‑square discriminant:

x = 160
 → y + z = 410 , y z = 35 625  
 → Δ = 410² − 4·35 625 = 25 600 = 160² (a perfect square).

Hence  

y , z = (410 ± 160)/2 = 285 and 125.

Quick check:
1.25 + 1.60 + 2.85 = 5.70

No other set of penny prices satisfies both equations, so these are the only possible prices.

Step 1.  Work out the magic constant

For an n × n magic square filled with the consecutive integers 1 … n², the common sum is

 M = n(n² + 1) / 2.

Here n = 5, so

 M = 5(25 + 1)/2 = 5·26/2 = 65.

Every row, column and main diagonal must therefore total 65.

Step 2.  Use the Siamese (De la Loubère) method

The Siamese construction works for every odd order (3, 5, 7, …).

Rule summary
1. Put 1 in the middle cell of the top row.
2. From any number k, place k + 1 one step “up and to the right” (north‑east).
3. If that step would leave the square (wrap‑around):
   • off the top ⇒ re‑enter at the bottom of the same column,
   • off the right ⇒ re‑enter at the far left of the same row,
   • off the top‑right corner ⇒ re‑enter at the bottom‑left corner.
4. If the destination cell is already occupied, instead place k + 1 directly beneath k.

────────────────────────
Step 3.  Carry out the construction

We label rows 1–5 (top→bottom) and columns 1–5 (left→right).

1  (row 1,col 3)      start in middle of top row
2  (row 5,col 4)      up‑right from (1,3) wraps off the top ⇒ row 5,col 4
3  (row 4,col 5)      up‑right again
4  (row 5,col 1)      up‑right leaves square at right edge ⇒ wrap to col 1

If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.
If N=5 and A=1, then E=9. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
If N=2 and A=4, then E=6. R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.
If N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.
If N=2, then since R cannot be 5, R=8, L=5, and I=7.
If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.

If S=1, then O=11. But since each letter represents only one digit, S=3, T=1, and O=9.
If N=5, then A=1. But since T=1, this cannot work.
If N=4, then I=9. But since O=9, this cannot work.

2.  Tens:         E + A + 1 = 11  ⇒  E + A = 10 (carry 1).

3.  Hundreds:     I + R + 1 = 16  ⇒  I + R = 15 (carry 1).

4.  Thousands:    S + T + 1 = 15 or 5.  
   Only S + T = 14 works (carry 1).

5.  Ten‑thousands: O + S + 1 = 12  ⇒  O + S = 11 (carry 1).

6.  Hundred‑thousands: N + A + 1 = 7  ⇒  N + A = 6.

Of that list, 33 is the only number that contains a 3 as the second digit and so for criterion 3 to be satisfied, 3 can only appear at the start of the 5-digit numbers.

    Thus every ordered pair of digits is allowed except
        2→3, 3→7, 5→3, 7→3.
3.  Observe that the digit 3 can be preceded only by 3 (because 2→3, 5→3, 7→3 are all forbidden).

After the initial 3 one may follow with 2, 3, 5.  
To maximise the number, choose the largest possible allowed digit each time, while still leaving room to insert the digits not yet used.

Step‑by‑step choice  
d₁ = 3 (forced)  
d₂ = 5   (largest allowed after 3)  
digits 2 and 7 are still missing

d₃ = 7   (largest allowed after 5, still leaves 2 to be placed)

177,"Once an old man died, and in his Will he stated that all the pearls he kept in a little bag were to be distributed among his daughters. To make things fair, the distribution must be done in the following way:
The older girl should receive one pearl, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""
And so it was.
How many pearls were there in the bag?
How many daughters did the old man have?
How many pearls did each girl get?","If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","There were 36 pearls.
There were 6 daughters.
Each daughter got 6 pearls.
The girl number x will have x pearls and a seventh of the rest. Since the last girl leaves no pearls in the bag, then when she takes her pearls the rest in the bag is zero (a seventh of nothing is nothing).
Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).
That is, k+1 = 7 and then k = 6.
So, the number of pearls is 6*6 = 36, and there were 6 girls.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

P        = number of pearls originally in the bag  
n        = number of daughters  
R₀ ,R₁…,Rₙ = pearls remaining after the 0‑th, 1‑st,…, n‑th girl has been served  
k        = number of pearls each girl finally receives (the Judge’s statement)  

Distribution rule for the i‑th daughter (i = 1,2,…,n)  

1. She first takes i pearls.  
2. Out of what is then left she takes one‑seventh.  

Hence the i‑th girl receives  

aᵢ = i + (1/7)(R_{i‑1} – i).                (1)

The remainder afterwards is  

Rᵢ = R_{i‑1} – aᵢ                             
    = R_{i‑1} – i – (1/7)(R_{i‑1} – i)       
    = (6/7)(R_{i‑1} – i).                     (2)

All girls finally have the same number of pearls, so  

aᵢ = k   for every i.                        (3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Express R_{i‑1} in terms of k and i
--------------------------------------------------------------------
From (1) and (3):      

k = i + (1/7)(R_{i‑1} – i)  
7k = 7i + R_{i‑1} – i  
R_{i‑1} = 7k – 6i.                            (4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Express Rᵢ in two ways and equate
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Using (2) and (4):

Rᵢ = (6/7)(R_{i‑1} – i)  
    = (6/7)(7k – 6i – i)  
    = (6/7)(7k – 7i)  
    = 6(k – i).                               (5)

But from (4) with i replaced by i+1 we also have  

Rᵢ = 7k – 6(i+1).                             (6)

Equate (5) and (6):

6(k – i) = 7k – 6(i+1)  
6k – 6i = 7k – 6i – 6  
⇒ k = 6.                                      (7)

Thus every girl finally receives k = 6 pearls.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Determine the remainders and stop when none are left
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Insert k = 6 into (4):

R_{i‑1} = 7·6 – 6i = 42 – 6i = 6(7 – i).     

As soon as the remainder becomes zero, the distribution ends:

R_n = 0 ⇒ 6(7 – n) = 0 ⇒ n = 6.              (8)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4: Initial number of pearls
--------------------------------------------------------------------
R₀ (the original total) is obtained from (4) with i = 1:

R₀ = 42 – 6·1 = 36.                           (9)

1. Translate the two given purchases into equations:

   4b +10s + f = 164.50 … (ii)

2. Eliminate f by subtracting (i) from (ii):  
   (4b – 3b) + (10s – 7s) = 164.50 – 120

3. We want the cost of one of each item:  
   b + s + f = ?  

   From (i): f = 120 – 3b – 7s.  
   Substitute this into b + s + f:  
   b + s + (120 – 3b – 7s)  
   = 120 – 2b – 6s.

4. Use (iii) to replace b: b = 44.50 – 3s.  
   Plug in: 120 – 2(44.50 – 3s) – 6s

As stated in the problem, the larger arc must be the next largest integer size, which is 181 degrees.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 – Why each line must be tangent to the circle  
A straight line can meet a circle in 0, 1, or 2 points.  
If it meets it in exactly one point the line is a tangent at that point.  
The problem states that the circle meets AO only at A and BO only at B, so AO and BO are tangents to the circle at A and B.

Step 2 – Relating the radii to the tangents  
A radius drawn to a point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line.  
Hence  
 CA ⟂ AO and  
 CB ⟂ BO.

Step 3 – Comparing the directions of CA and CB  
AO and BO are themselves perpendicular (given).  
Rotating a vector through 90° is an isometry, so if AO ⟂ BO then the two perpendicular directions to them, CA and CB, are also perpendicular.  
Therefore ∠ACB, the central angle between the radii CA and CB, is 90°.

Step 4 – Converting the central angle to an arc measure  
In a circle the measure of a minor arc equals the measure of its central angle.  
Hence the minor arc AB measures 90°.

Step 5 – Obtaining the larger arc  
The full circle is 360°.  
Larger arc AB = 360° − 90° = 270°.

That value is fixed by the geometry and is already integral, so it is the smallest (and only) possible integral measure for the larger arc.

How many did each boy get each time?","Although there are a dozen pairs of numbers that satisfy the percentage condition, the three used in the story are the only ones in which each boy gets fewer than 100 Rnkfurers.","1st order: Rod 20, Kurt  5.  Kurt has 20% of the total.
2nd order: Rod 60, Kurt 90.  Kurt has 60% of the total.
The equation to satisfy is
R = 100*K / (R+K)
where R and K are both integers.
Another way to look at this is
K = R*R/(100-R)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"First order (the “minimum special order”)  
Let Rod receive R and Kurt receive K, so the total is T = R + K.

The condition “the number of Rnkfurers you got is the same integer as my percentage” means

  R  =  (K / T) · 100.  (1)

From (1), K = (R/100) T, so

  T = R + K = R + (R/100) T  
  ⟹ T(1 – R/100) = R  
  ⟹ T = 100R /(100 – R).  (2)

We need positive integers with R < T, K = T – R, and 0 < R < 100.  
Testing R = 1,2,3,… shows that the first R that makes T an integer is R = 20:

  T = 100·20 /(100 – 20) = 2000 / 80 = 25, K = 25 – 20 = 5.

So the smallest possible division is

  Rod 20  Kurt 5.

(They note that the next solution is the trivial 50 & 50 split when T = 100.)

Second order (multiples of 50, Kurt gets more)  
Now T must be a multiple of 50, Kurt wants more than Rod (K > R), and Kurt can store at most 100, i.e. K ≤ 100.  The same relation (2) holds.

Because K = T – R and K > R, we need T > 2R.  Substituting (2):

  100R /(100 – R) > 2R ⟹ R > 50.

Also K = R² /(100 – R) ≤ 100.  Checking the integers 51 ≤ R ≤ 99 that make T integral:

  R = 60  →  T = 100·60 /(100 – 60) = 6000 / 40 = 150 (which is 3 cases),  
       K = 150 – 60 = 90   (and 90 ≤ 100).

All larger integral solutions give K > 100, so this is the only one that fits Kurt’s limit.

Thus for the second purchase they buy 150 Rnkfurers and divide them

  Rod 60  Kurt 90.

Step 2.  Prefer splitting any term ≥4  
For m ≥ 4 we have

          X  :  5X

All nine non‑zero digits 1…9 must appear exactly once when the four‑digit number X and the five‑digit number 5X are written.

1.  X must be four digits  
    (because 4 + 5 = 9 digits in total, and 5X is necessarily the longer one).

2.  5X ends in 0 or 5.  
    Since 0 is forbidden, 5X ends in 5.  
    Hence the units‑digit of X must be 1, 3, 7 or 9 (because 5·1,3,7,9 all give a final 5).

3.  X is divisible by 3.  
    The digit sum of X + 5X is 45, a multiple of 9, so 6X ≡ 0 (mod 9) ⇒ X ≡ 0 (mod 3).

4.  Try the admissible unit digits:

    •  If the unit digit were 1, the next digit of 5X would be 0 or 5, both impossible (0 forbidden, 5 already used).  
       So the unit digit cannot be 1.

    •  Take the unit digit 3.  Then 5·3 = 15, so the units of 5X are 5, carry 1.

      Write X = ABC3 (A thousands, B hundreds, C tens).

      Tens of 5X = (5C +1) mod 10.  This is never 0 or 5, so it is admissible.

      Continue the multiplication systematically, demanding that every produced

If the distance was 2, the result is same as if the man had 981 watermelons and to go only 1km, so the result would be 962. When using this method, we can calculate that the final number of watermelons is 140.

The optimal procedure is therefore: as soon as exactly one load (100 melons) has been eaten in a stage, the number of loads drops by one and the cost per kilometre falls.  
Keep doing this until the 99 km are covered.

Stage–by–stage

 start: 1000 melons = 10 loads, cost 19 mel/km  
 eat one load (100 mel) ⇒ distance = 100/19 km

 900 melons = 9 loads, cost 17 mel/km

189,"A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

   Contrapositive: If n is not in 60–69, then n is a multiple of 4.   …(i)

2. “If n is a multiple of 3, then 50 ≤ n ≤ 59.”
   Contrapositive: If n is not in 50–59, then n is not a multiple of 3.  …(ii)

3. “If n is not a multiple of 6, then 70 ≤ n ≤ 79.”
   Contrapositive: If n is not in 70–79, then n is a multiple of 6.     …(iii)

Now split the possibilities by the three decade–intervals that appear.

A. 50–59  
Here D (in 50–59) is true, but n is not in 60–69 (so by (i) n must be a multiple of 4) and not in 70–79 (so by (iii) n must be a multiple of 6). Hence n must be a multiple of lcm(4,6)=12 inside 50–59. No such number exists (multiples of 12 are …48, 60…), so this interval is impossible.

B. 60–69  
Here n is not in 50–59 ⇒ by (ii) n is not a multiple of 3.  
Also n is not in 70–79 ⇒ by (iii) n is a multiple of 6 (hence of 3).  
Contradiction. Thus 60–69 is impossible.

C. 70–79  
Here n is not in 50–59 ⇒ by (ii) n is not a multiple of 3.  
Also n is not in 60–69 ⇒ by (i) n is a multiple of 4.

So within 70–79 we need multiples of 4 that are not multiples of 3.  
Multiples of 4 in that decade: 72, 76.  
72 is also a multiple of 3, so discard it.  
76 is not a multiple of 3, hence satisfies all conditions.

Finally, check the original statements for n = 76:

• 76 is a multiple of 4 → the antecedent of (1) is false, so (1) holds.  
• 76 is not a multiple of 3 → antecedent of (2) is false, so (2) holds.  
• 76 is not a multiple of 6 and indeed lies in 70–79 → (3) holds.

All three implications are satisfied, and no other number works.

The problem was to figure out the following.

column 6 : L + c₅         = 7 + 10 c₆        (E = 7, A = 9)

Step‑by‑step deductions

1.  Units column:  T + S + 9 + 7 = T + 10 c₁  → S + 16 = 10 c₁  
   The only single digit giving a multiple of 10 is S = 4 with c₁ = 2.

2.  Tens column:  I + 7 + L + 2 = R + 10 c₂ → I + L + 9 = R + 10 c₂  
   The sum I + L + 9 is at least 10, so c₂ = 1 or 2.  Later we find c₂ = 2.

3.  Hundred‑th column:  K + T + c₂ = O + 10 c₃.  
   As we will see, c₃ = 0, so O = K + T + 2 < 10.

4.  Thousand‑th column:  9 + T + c₃ = F + 10 c₄.

5.  Ten‑thousand column: T + I + c₄ = F + 10 c₅.

6.  Hundred‑thousand column: L + c₅ = 7 (since c₆ = 0).  
   Hence c₅ = 1 and L = 6 (L ≠ 7).

7.  With c₅ = 1, equation (5) gives T + I + c₄ = F + 10.  
   Equation (4) together with (5) forces c₄ = 1, c₃ = 0 and yields  
   I = 8 and F = T – 1.

8.  Tens column now: I + L + 9 = 8 + 6 + 9 = 23 = R + 10 c₂.  
   Therefore c₂ = 2 and R = 3.

9.  Since F = T – 1 and digits must be distinct and unused (0,1,2,5 remain free),  
   trying T = 1 makes F = 0 (allowed).  
   Now O = K + T + 2 = K + 3.  Choosing K = 2 gives O = 5 (all digits distinct).  
   All other possibilities clash with already‑used digits, so this is the only fit.

194,"Difficult Danny has acquired his nickname (and some other, less polite nicknames) due to the fact that, whenever he buys anything, he insists upon paying the exact amount, with precisely 100 pieces of currency. Danny wanted an xCube365 (it lasts 365 days before programmatically disabling itself, so that a new one must be purchased), the highly coveted gaming system that had just been released. It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?",,"Can at least one of each denomination be used? That totals $186 with only 6 bills, plus at least $94 with the rest of the bills. This is too high. Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.
If a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities. So $100 bill is the denomination that is not used. We now know that at least one of each of the other bills is used. That totals $86 with 5 bills, leaving 95 bills to make the other $144.
There are only 4 ways to make $144 with these denominations, which are listed in order from $1 bills to $50 bills in each of these sets: {84,10,1,0,0}, {89,1,5,0,0}, {89,3,2,1,0}, {94,0,0,0,1}. Adding in one of each bill, which we have already determined, gives {85,11,2,1,1}, {90,2,6,1,1}, {90,4,3,2,1}, {95,1,1,1,2}. {1,1,1} is the only triplet here that can make a true multiplication sentence: 1 x 1 = 1. Therefore, Danny paid with 95 $1 bills, a $5 bill, a $10 bill, a $20 bill, and 2 $50 bills.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

a = number of $1 bills  
b = number of $5 bills  
c = number of $10 bills  
d = number of $20 bills  
e = number of $50 bills  
f = number of $100 bills  

1.  He pays with exactly 100 bills:  
   a + b + c + d + e + f = 100. … (1)

2.  The total value is \$230:  
   1·a + 5·b + 10·c + 20·d + 50·e + 100·f = 230. … (2)

Subtract (1) from (2):

   4b + 9c + 19d + 49e + 99f = 130. … (3)

Because 99 f ≤ 130, f can only be 0 or 1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Case f = 1  
Then (3) gives 4b + 9c + 19d + 49e = 31, impossible if e ≥ 1, so e = 0.  
The only solutions of 4b + 9c + 19d = 31 are  
(b,c,d) = (3,0,1) or (1,3,0).  
Both give two different zero–counts (c = 0 and e = 0, or d = 0 and e = 0); having two denominations with 0 bills produces many “0 × x = 0” triples, violating the “exactly one triplet” rule.  
So no solution with f = 1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Case f = 0  
Equation (3) becomes 4b + 9c + 19d + 49e = 130.  
Since 49·3 = 147 > 130, e is 0, 1 or 2.

• e = 0 → every solution has at least two zeros (e itself and f), again producing too many 0‑triples.

• e = 1 gives 4b + 9c + 19d = 81.  
  Among its positive solutions, the only one leaving exactly one zero–count is  
  (b,c,d) = (1,2,1) or (2,6,1) or (4,3,2); none of these yield a unique multiplication triple.

• e = 2 gives 4b + 9c + 19d = 32.  
  The positive‑integer solution (b,c,d) = (1,1,1) works, because it leaves only one zero (f).  

   a  = 100 − (b + c + d + e + f)  
      = 100 − (1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0)  
      = 95.

So the tentative bill‑counts are  

a = 95,  b = 1,  c = 1,  d = 1,  e = 2,  f = 0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Checking the conditions

• Number of bills: 95 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 100 ✓  
• Value: 95·1 + 1·5 + 1·10 + 1·20 + 2·50 + 0·100  
          = 95 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 100 = 230 ✓  

• Exactly one multiplication triplet:  
  The six counts are 95, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0.  
  Three different denominations ($5, $10, $20) each have a count of 1, and  

     1 × 1 = 1

  is a true multiplication sentence using those three denominations.  
  Because every other denomination has a different, non‑unit count, and there is only one zero‑count, no other distinct set of three denominations can satisfy x · y = z.  
  Hence there is exactly one valid triplet. ✓

All requirements are met.

198,"Detective Grant was inspecting the scene of the crime. The 50-year-old victim, Joe, had been poisoned by a candy containing cyanide. On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table.

If the criminal chose a poisoned candy, he died. If he chose a pure candy, he lived.
The criminal's remaining life expectancy divided by his prison sentence would be the number of candies George would bring him, one of which might kill him. In the case of Joe:

1.  Let the four weights (whole numbers) be  
   w₁ < w₂ < w₃ < w₄ .

2.  To be able to weigh 1 kg of wheat, the lightest weight must be 1 kg,  
   so w₁ = 1.

3.  Suppose with the first k – 1 weights we can produce every integer mass
   from 1 up to N kilograms (by putting the older weights on either side of the
   balance).  
   With those weights we can offset as much as N kilograms on the same side as
   the wheat, so a new weight wₖ put on the opposite pan can represent every
   mass from wₖ – N up to wₖ + N.  
   For there to be no gap at N + 1 we need

             wₖ – N ≤ N + 1   ⇒   wₖ ≤ 2N + 1.        (★)

   Condition (★) is therefore necessary.  
   If we always make it an equality, each new weight is as small as possible,
   which maximises the total range attainable with a fixed number of weights.

4.  Apply (★) successively:

   • k = 2:  N = w₁ = 1       ⇒   w₂ ≤ 2·1 + 1 = 3.  
     Since w₂ > w₁, either w₂ = 2 or 3.

     – If w₂ = 2, the heaviest total after two weights is 1 + 2 = 3.  
       Then (★) gives w₃ ≤ 2·3 + 1 = 7 and w₄ ≤ 2·(3 + w₃) + 1 ≤ 21,  
       so the greatest possible total weight is < 1 + 2 + 7 + 21 = 31 < 40.  
       Thus w₂ ≠ 2.

     – Therefore w₂ = 3 and after two weights N = 1 + 3 = 4.

   • k = 3:  w₃ ≤ 2·4 + 1 = 9.  
     Taking w₃ smaller than 9 again leaves too small a total to reach 40 kg,
     so we must have w₃ = 9.  Then N becomes 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.

   • k = 4:  w₄ ≤ 2·13 + 1 = 27.  
     The total of the four weights must be at least 40 kg (so that 40 kg of
     wheat can be balanced with all the weights on the other pan).
     With w₁ + w₂ + w₃ = 13, this forces w₄ ≥ 27, hence w₄ = 27.

5.  Thus the only possible set is {1 kg, 3 kg, 9 kg, 27 kg}.

6.  Verification:  Every integer 1 … 40 has a balanced‑ternary
   representation using the digits –1, 0, 1 with radices 1, 3, 9, 27
   respectively; putting the “–1” weights on the wheat side and the “1”
   weights on the opposite side realises that representation on the balance.  
   Therefore all required masses can indeed be weighed.

201,"Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Snow, there lived the fair Princess Miyuki, who had always been fascinated by fairy tales and the stories of the wonders of the world. She believed that her sleeping, handsome prince was cursed to be one of the mummies in the pyramids of Egypt, and when she was done being Fantaghiro-saving-her-Romualdo, her prince would then build a beautiful palace as a monument of their love (which of course would be more beautiful than Taj Mahal) where both of them will live happily ever after...
So, you see, that's why Princess Miyuki had refused each and every love declaration or marriage proposal that came her way.
But of course, what's a story without the brave and wise heroic prince? Here comes Prince Hajikidama of the Marbles Kingdom.

1.  A convenient starting point is
   999 + 999 = 1998,

2.  To lower 1998 to 1990 we must subtract 8.

""Yours, probably.  Mr. Collins is at a conference for the weekend, and Monette took his math class.  It looks like she handed back an exam.""
""I teach math.  Can I help?""
All three talked at once; Monette was as frustrated as the two students.  While they jabbered, Corman managed to read the problem in question:
""My house is built on a strangely-shaped lot, so my back yard is a right triangle with an area of 840 square feet.  Each of the three sides measures an integral number of feet.  If I want to stake my dog so that he can reach the entire yard, how long must his rope be?""

Lewis Carroll searched for the answer to the basic mathematical problem, sent to him by a reader.  He found two right triangles with the same area, but couldn't discover a set of three.  Somewhat ironically, Carroll had found 20-21-29 and 12-35-37.  Had he doubled their dimensions, he would have had the first two triangles above, and quite likely would have found the third.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"To be able to “reach the entire yard’’ the dog has to be tied at the one point that is farthest from every place in the yard – the centre of the circle that just contains the whole triangular yard.  
For any right‑angled triangle that circle is the circumcircle whose diameter is the hypotenuse, so the required length of rope is the radius  

                 rope length = (circumradius) = ½ × (hypotenuse).

Therefore we must first find every right‑angled triangle of integral side–lengths that has area 840 ft², then take half of its hypotenuse.

1.  Let the two legs be a and b (integral); area = ½ab = 840, so  

                                ab = 1680.

2.  We need a² + b² to be a perfect square c² (integral hypotenuse).  
    List the factor pairs of 1680 and test them:

            (24,70)  → 24²+70² = 576+4900 = 5476 = 74²

    No other factor pair of 1680 gives a perfect square, so there are exactly three
    integral right triangles with area 840 ft²:

            24–70–74  40–42–58  15–112–113.

3.  The three corresponding rope lengths are half their hypotenuses:

            74/2 = 37 ft
            58/2 = 29 ft
           113/2 = 56.5 ft

    (These are precisely the three answers the two students and Mr Collins obtained:
     29 ft is 8 ft shorter than the 37 ft on the key, while 56½ ft is “a lot longer.”)

Thus Mr Collins’ answer of 37 feet is perfectly correct for one of the three possible
yards, and together the three numbers above are the only possible correct answers

206,"Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

  P  = selling price per box (dollars)  
  C  = production/marketing cost per box (dollars)

1.  Find the constant unit‑cost.  
   At the given price $5.95 the profit per box is $1.75, hence  

        C = 5.95 − 1.75 = $4.20 .

2.  Express quantity demanded as a function of price.  
   Each $0.20 decrease raises sales by 25 boxes, i.e.  

        ΔQ / ΔP = 25 / (−0.20) = −125 .  

   Using the point (P,Q) = (5.95 , 100),

        Q(P) = 100 − 125(P − 5.95)
              = 843.75 − 125P .

3.  Write the profit function.  

        W(P) = (price − cost) · quantity
              = (P − 4.20)(843.75 − 125P) .

4.  Maximize W(P).  
   Differentiate and set to zero:

        W′(P) = (1)(843.75 − 125P) + (P − 4.20)(−125)
               = 843.75 − 125P − 125P + 525
               = 1368.75 − 250P .

        1368.75 − 250P = 0  ⇒  P = 1368.75 / 250 = 5.475 .

5.  Interpret the result.  
   The profit‑maximising price is $5.475 ≈ $5.48 per box.  
   (If the price must be set in $0.20 steps, $5.55 would be the best practical choice, giving a weekly profit of $202.50.)

Since SL-D=3 or (SL-1)-D=3 (meaning SL-D=4), and since the highest possible sum of two different one-digit numbers is 17, S must equal 1.
Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.

Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.
Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.
If D=7, then L=0. But since 10-7=3, D cannot be 7.
If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.
If E=4, then N=3. But if D=8, A=3, and if D=9, L=3 and A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=5, then since 1I-E=6, I=1. But since S=1, this cannot work.
If E=7, then I=3. But if D=8, then A=3, and if D=9, then L=3. So this cannot work.
If E=8, then I=4, and D cannot be 8. But if D=9, then A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=9, then N=8, and D cannot be 8 or 9. So this cannot work.
Therefore, E=6, N=5, and I=2. If D=8, then L=2, so D must equal 9. This means:

Column‑by‑column subtraction with possible borrows gives these conditions:

1. S – borrow₄ = 0  ⇒  borrow₄ = 1 and S = 1.  
2. Because of this borrow₄, the thousands column must have borrowed, so borrow₃ = 1.  
   Hence L – borrow₃ + 10 – D = 3  ⇒  D = L + 6.  
   With digits 0–9 this allows (L,D) = (0,6), (2,8), (3,9).
3. In the hundreds column (with borrow₃ = 1):

Normally, you would touch each tiny one by one by one cube and they would fall off. However, with new quantum technology, it has become more interesting. You may say the total number of possible cubes (not necessarily with side length one) in the twelve by twelve by twelve Rubik's cube, and hocus-pocus, cubes of all sizes would appear. Assuming that each side in the tiny cubes has length one and that you may only make cubes of integer side length, what number should you say for the new technology to work?","For 1^3+2^3+... n^3, use (1+2+...n)^2.","6084.
First, try a easier problem. Try a two by two by two Rubik's cube. There are 8 tiny cubes and one 2 by 2 by 2 cube. It should come to your notice that you take 2^3+1^3. But just to check, you look at a standard Rubik's cube with side length 3. There are, predictably, 27 one by one cubes, 8 two by two cubes, and one 3 by 3 cube. That was 3^3 +2^3 + 1^3. Now you can come to the conclusion that for any Rubik's cube with side length n, there are n^3+(n-1)^3 + ... 2^3+1^3 total cubes with integer side length. Therefore, there are 1^3+2^3+...12^3 cubes in the Rubik's cube with side length 12. The hint gives the formula for adding a sequence of cubes. Thus, you would get (1+2+3+4+...+11+12)^2 = 6084 cubes.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 ‒ Understand what is being counted  
Every “cube” we are to create must  
• be aligned with the 12 × 12 × 12 grid,  
• have all edges parallel to the large cube’s edges,  
• have integer side length 1,2,…,12.

So we are really counting all axis–parallel sub‑cubes contained in the big cube.

Step 2 ‒ Count cubes of a fixed side length k  
Pick a side length k (1 ≤ k ≤ 12).  
Along each coordinate axis the left‑front‑bottom corner of such a k×k×k cube can start at any integer position from 1 up to 12−k+1.  
Number of choices in x-direction: 12−k+1  
Same in y and in z.  

Therefore, for this k, the number of k×k×k cubes is  
(12−k+1)³.

Step 3 ‒ Sum over all admissible k  
Total cubes = Σ_{k=1}^{12}(12−k+1)³.  
Let s = 12−k+1; as k runs from 1 to 12, s runs from 12 down to 1, so

Total cubes = Σ_{s=1}^{12}s³.

Step 4 ‒ Evaluate the sum of cubes  
For any n, 1³+2³+⋯+n³ = [n(n+1)/2]².  
With n = 12: n(n+1)/2 = 12·13/2 = 78.

The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)

Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51

The number of lathes limit the combination of chairs and tables to 360=5c+5t.
The number of sanding machines limit the combination of chairs and tables to 1080=5c+20t.
Next graph these three lines. It should be expected that the answer will lie on the intersection of two of these lines or to make all chairs or all tables. The intersection of the saw and sanding machine line occurs outside of how many chairs the lathe can make so this combination is not a viable answer.

On this assumption, an exact answer can be given.",,"The first time would be 5 and 5\143 minutes past 12, which might also indicate 60\143 minutes past 1. Expressed slightly less accurately, 5 minutes past 12 and about half a minute past 1.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let t  hours (0<t<12) be the true time after 12 o’clock.

Positions of the hands (measured as fractions of one revolution from 12):

hour‑hand H(t) = t/12  
minute‑hand M(t) = t − ⌊t⌋ (the fractional part of t)

Because the hands are indistinguishable, the indication at the true time t will also be obtained at some other time s ≠ t provided the two positions are interchanged:

H(t) = M(s)    and    M(t) = H(s).             (1)

Write  
t = k + u with k = ⌊t⌋, 0 ≤ u < 1  
s = m + v with m = ⌊s⌋, 0 ≤ v < 1.

Substituting in (1):

t/12 = v                        (2)  
u   = (m + v)/12.             (3)

From (2) v = t/12 = (k + u)/12.

Insert this in (3):

u = (m + (k + u)/12)/12  
12u = m + (k + u)/12  
144u = 12m + k + u  
143u = 12m + k.               (4)

Now t = k + u, so

t = k + (12m + k)/143 = (12m + 144k)/143.      (5)

We want the very first positive solution.

Take k = 0 (so 0 < t < 1 hr); then (5) gives

t = 12m / 143.

To keep t under 1 hour we need m ≤ 11.  
The smallest positive m is 1, giving

t = 12/143 hour.

No solution with k > 0 can give a smaller t, because k itself would already be at least 1 hour. Hence this is the first ambiguous instant.

Convert t to ordinary units:

t = 12/143 hour = (12/143)·60 min = 720/143 min

Extract the basic “work” rate from the given data.  
2.5 artists working for 2.5 hours produce 2.5 finished model‑on‑canvas paintings.

Step 2.  Compute the amount of artist‑time needed for one finished painting.  
Total artist‑hours used = 2.5 artists × 2.5 hours = 6.25 artist‑hours.  
Paintings produced = 2.5.  
Artist‑hours per painting = 6.25 / 2.5 = 2.5 artist‑hours.

Equivalently: one artist needs 2.5 hours to finish one model on its canvas.

Step 3.  Determine total artist‑hours required for the new job.  
We now need 24 paintings.  
Required artist‑hours = 24 paintings × 2.5 artist‑hours/painting = 60 artist‑hours.

Step 4.  Convert the total artist‑hours to a headcount given the available time.  
The work must be completed in 20 hours.

222,"Homer had always contemplated the size of the old oak tree in the field behind his house.  Standing 5 feet away from the 8 foot high fence in the back of the yard, he could just barely see the top leaves of the tree over the top of the fence.  He knew that the tree was 200 feet from the fence.  Homer was 6 feet tall, making his line of vision, 67 inches from the ground.
Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.","TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches
Tree height from eye level = TAN (25.80 deg) * 2460 inches = 1189 inches
Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.  With the measurement capabilities available to any lumberjack (or any average Homer) precise measurements are not possible.  Thus the need to clarify these calculations as estimates.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

• E be Homer’s eye, 67 in = 67/12 ft = 5.583 ft above the ground.  
• F be the top of the fence, 8 ft above the ground.  
• T be the top of the tree (height h to be found).  

Horizontal distances (all measured straight back from Homer):  

E → F : 5 ft  
F → T : 200 ft  
Therefore E → T : 5 ft + 200 ft = 205 ft

Since the line of sight from E just grazes the top of the fence before reaching T, the points E, F and T are collinear.

1. Compute the slope of the line of sight using E and F:
   vertical rise EF = 8 ft – 5.583 ft = 2.417 ft  
   horizontal run EF = 5 ft  
   slope m = 2.417 ft / 5 ft = 0.4834

2. Apply the same slope from E all the way to T (205 ft horizontally):
   vertical rise ET = m · 205 ft = 0.4834 · 205 ≈ 99.09 ft

3. Add Homer’s eye height to get the tree’s total height:
   h = 5.583 ft + 99.09 ft ≈ 104.7 ft

So the old oak tree is a bit over 100 feet tall, about 105 feet when rounded to the nearest foot.

1 ÷ 7 = 0.142 857 142 857 …  
The repetend (repeating block) is 142 857, a 6‑digit number.

Now test it:

142 857 × 2 = 285 714  
142 857 × 3 = 428 571  
142 857 × 4 = 571 428  
142 857 × 5 = 714 285  
142 857 × 6 = 857 142  

Each product is simply a cyclic permutation of 142 857; hence every product uses exactly the same six digits 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7 and introduces no others.  
No other 6‑digit number has this property (it can be shown that any 6‑digit solution must be the cyclic number generated by 1/7).

1.  Write the four–digit numbers with carries  
   ABCD × 4 = DCBA  

   Units: 4·D = A + 10k₁  
   Tens:  4·C + k₁ = B + 10k₂  
   Hundreds: 4·B + k₂ = C + 10k₃  
   Thousands: 4·A + k₃ = D   (no further carry, so ≤9)

2.  From the thousands column  
   4A + k₃ ≤ 9.  
   Hence A can only be 1 or 2.

3.  Units column condition (A = 4D mod 10) rules out A = 1, because 4·D never ends in 1.  
   Therefore A = 2.

4.  With A = 2, thousands gives  
   4·2 + k₃ = 8 + k₃ = D ≤ 9 ⇒ k₃ = 0 and D = 8.

5.  Units column with D = 8 gives  
   4·8 = 32 ⇒ A = 2 (already satisfied) and carry k₁ = 3.

6.  Let k₂ be the carry from the tens column (0–3).  
   Hundreds column: 4B + k₂ = C (since k₃ = 0, the value is <10).  
   Tens column: 4C + k₁ = B + 10k₂, with k₁ = 3.

7.  Substitute C = 4B + k₂ into the tens equation:  
   4(4B + k₂) + 3 = B + 10k₂  
   16B + 4k₂ + 3 = B + 10k₂  
   15B − 6k₂ + 3 = 0 ⇒ 5B − 2k₂ = −1.

   Testing k₂ = 0, 1, 2, 3, only k₂ = 3 works, giving B = 1.

8.  Then C = 4B + k₂ = 4·1 + 3 = 7.

9.  The digits are thus A = 2, B = 1, C = 7, D = 8.

   FLY + FLY + FLY = 3·FLY = AWAY is a 4‑digit number, the first digit A must be 1 or 2 (because 3·999 = 2997).

2.  Units column  
      3·Y must end in Y.  
      3Y ≡ Y  (mod 10)  ⇒  2Y ≡ 0 (mod 10)  ⇒  Y = 5 (digits are non‑zero).  
      3·5 = 15 gives a carry c₁ = 1 to the tens column.

3.  Tens column  
      3·L + c₁ = 3L + 1.  
      The digit written is A and the carry to the hundreds column is c₂.  
      So 3L + 1 = 10·c₂ + A  with A = 1 or 2.  
      Trying L = 1,…,9 gives only one possibility:  
         L = 7  →  3·7 + 1 = 22  →  A = 2,  c₂ = 2.

4.  Hundreds column  
      3·F + c₂ = 3F + 2.  
      Write W and carry c₃ to the thousands column:  
      3F + 2 = 10·c₃ + W,   c₃ = A = 2.  
      Thus 3F + 2 is between 20 and 29:  20 ≤ 3F + 2 ≤ 29  
      ⇒  18 ≤ 3F ≤ 27  ⇒  6 ≤ F ≤ 9.

      Evaluate 3F + 2:

231,What is the smallest integer greater than 0 that can be written entirely with zeros and ones and is evenly divisible by 225?,,"The prime factorization of 225 is 5*5*3*3. So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.
All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Because the number must be divisible by 225 = 9·25, it has to satisfy simultaneously  

• divisibility by 25 ⟹ its last two decimal digits are 00,  
• divisibility by 9  ⟹ the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.

Since only the digits 0 and 1 are allowed, the digit–sum equals the number of 1’s that appear.

1.  The last two digits are fixed as 00, so all other digits (call their number k) precede these two zeros.  
2.  To make the digit–sum a multiple of 9 we need at least 9 ones; hence k ≥ 9.  
3.  Putting nine 1’s into exactly those k positions, the fewest total digits (and therefore the smallest magnitude) occurs when k = 9, giving an 11–digit number.  
4.  To minimise the value we push every possible 1 as far to the right (toward the least–significant positions) as we can, leaving only the leading digit forced to be 1.  
   Thus the pattern is  

   1 11111111 00  
   (one leading 1, eight more 1’s, and the required trailing 00).

   That number is  

   11111111100.

5.  Check:  
   • it ends in 00 ⟹ divisible by 25,  
   • it contains nine 1’s ⟹ digit–sum = 9 ⟹ divisible by 9.

Therefore it is divisible by 225.  
Any attempt to shorten the number fails (fewer than nine positions before the final 00 cannot supply nine 1’s), and inserting additional zeros to the left of the block of eight 1’s only increases its magnitude. So this is the smallest possible.

    to be 1,2,…,9 each exactly once.

2.  A quick consequence from casting out nines  
        digit‑sum(n)+digit‑sum(2n)+digit‑sum(3n) ≡ n+2n+3n ≡ 6n (mod 9).  
    But the left hand side is the digit–sum of 1+2+…+9 = 45, which is 0 (mod 9).  
    Thus 6n ≡ 0 (mod 9) ⇒ n ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
    So n must be a multiple of 3, and because 3n is still three–digit we have  
           100 ≤ n ≤ 333.

3.  We now inspect the last digit d of n.

Because the lightest two bales must give the lightest recorded sum and the heaviest two bales must give the heaviest recorded sum, we have  

a + b = 80     …(1)  
d + e = 91     …(2)

Take the three least sums in the list: 80, 82, 83.  
All of them must involve the lightest bale a.  
(The next–lightest bale b already appeared in 80, so every other sum that is still ≤83 must pair a with some other bale.)

Thus set  
a + b = 80, a + c = 82, a + d = 83.     …(3)

Subtracting these gives  
c – b = 2, d – b = 3.     …(4)

Write b from (1) as b = 80 – a, then from (4)

c = b + 2 = 82 – a,  
d = b + 3 = 83 – a.     …(5)

Insert d in (2):

e = 91 – d = 91 – (83 – a) = a + 8.     …(6)

Now impose the ordering a < b < c < d < e:

a < 80 – a  ⟹ a < 40  
83 – a < a + 8 ⟹ 2a > 75 ⟹ a > 37.5.

Hence a is an integer 38 or 39.

• If a = 38 ⇒ (b,c,d,e) = (42,44,45,46);  
  their pair–sums include 89 instead of the listed 85, so discard.

• If a = 39 ⇒ (b,c,d,e) = (41,43,44,47);  
  every one of their ten pair‑sums is in the given list and nothing is missing.

Therefore the only possible set of bale weights is  

39 kg, 41 kg, 43 kg, 44 kg, 47 kg.

Pairings that give each recorded total:

80 kg  = 39 + 41  
82 kg  = 39 + 43  
83 kg  = 39 + 44  
84 kg  = 41 + 43  
85 kg  = 41 + 44  
86 kg  = 39 + 47  
87 kg  = 43 + 44  
88 kg  = 41 + 47  
90 kg  = 43 + 47  
91 kg  = 44 + 47

Final answer: the bales weigh 39 kg, 41 kg, 43 kg, 44 kg and 47 kg, and the ten recorded weights correspond to the pairings listed above.",True
240,"In the legendary land of Madadia, everything is wonderful. There is no inflation, so Madadian wonks (local currency 100 winks = 1 wonk) are constant in value.
Mad Ade's cousin Manic Martin works as an accountant in one of Madadia's leading accounting firms.
After his first year his salary was a straight 10,000 wonks, with which Manic Martin was quite happy. His manager was so impressed with his work he offered Manic Martin a wage rise.
Now this being Madadia, things are not always done as they are elsewhere, the wage rise was offered over a 17.5 year contract period, These contracts are immutably binding, and will still be paid to benefactors in the event of death or permanent disability.
Manic Martin has a choice of how to receive his raise.  The first option was for an immediate 5% raise to 10,500 wonks annually, with an additional 5% raise every 6 months. The second option was for an immediate 10% raise to 11,000 wonks annually, with an additional 10% raise every year. Manic Martin's salary, based upon his current annual, was paid bi-weekly.
Which deal would benefit Manic Martin the most?",,"The 5% semi-annual raise yields a higher return.
This may have been your first guess, but there is something odd about the answer. At the start of the problem, the 10% raise is earning more-  11,000 annually vs. 10,500. After the first year, the 5% option has earned 10,762 compared to 11,000.
What are the two options earning at the moment the contract closes, after 17.5 years? Surprisingly, the 5% option only realizes a little more than 55,160, compared to the 10% option which is still ahead with just under 56,000.
So where's the advantage in the 5% option? It hides in the second half of every year. Even in the first year, the 5% option makes more in the second six months than the 10% option. For the first few years, this is not enough to offset the difference. But cumulatively, over seventeen and a half years, 5% realizes a grand total of 390.27 more than the 10% option.

2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.

He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?",,"The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74
Lemp 47 94
Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Number of people who got in at the six stations - Number of people who got out at the six stations) =

0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.

Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:

If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)

be the k–digit integer we seek, where  
a (1 ≤ a ≤ 9) is the first digit and b is the remaining k–1–digit block (0 ≤ b < 10^{k‑1}).  

After a left rotation the number becomes  

m = 10·b + a.

The condition “the rotated number is 1½ times the original” gives  

10b + a = 3/2 (a·10^{k‑1} + b).

Multiply by 2 and rearrange:

20b + 2a = 3a·10^{k‑1} + 3b  
17b = a(3·10^{k‑1} – 2).                      (1)

Hence  

b = a(3·10^{k‑1} – 2)/17.                    (2)

Because b is an integer, 17 must divide a(3·10^{k‑1} – 2).  
Since a is a single digit (1–9), this is possible only when

3·10^{k‑1} – 2 ≡ 0 (mod 17).                (3)

Solve the congruence.  We need an exponent r = k–1 such that

10^{r} ≡ 12 (mod 17)                        (because 3·10^{r} ≡ 2).

Powers of 10 modulo 17:

10^{13}≡11, 10^{14}≡8, 10^{15}≡12.  

The first time 12 appears is at r = 15, so the smallest possible number of digits is

k = r + 1 = 16.                             (4)

With k = 16, equation (2) becomes

b = a(3·10^{15} – 2)/17.

Now 17 | (3·10^{15} – 2), so any digit a makes b integral.  
To obtain the smallest n we take the smallest possible a, namely a = 1.

Compute b:

3·10^{15} – 2 = 2 999 999 999 999 998  
Divide by 17:

(3·10^{15} – 2)/17 = 176 470 588 235 294.

Thus

n = a·10^{15} + b  
  = 1·10^{15} + 176 470 588 235 294  
  = 1 176 470 588 235 294.

              N = A ·10^6 + B       (0 ≤ A , B ≤ 999 999)                        (1)  

so that A is the number formed by the first six digits of N and B is the number
formed by the last six digits of N.

Step 1.  Look for numbers N that themselves are perfect squares.  
Put N = x² with      100 000 ≤ x ≤ 999 999.                                        (2)

Step 2.  Ask that the two halves add up to a perfect square as well, i.e.  

              A + B = y²                                                          (3)  
with y² ≤ 999 999 + 999 999 = 1 999 998, so 1 ≤ y ≤ 1 413.

Step 3.  Translate the two conditions into one congruence.  
Because of (1) and (3) we have

           x² = 10^6 A + B = 10^6 (y² – B) + B  
              = 10^6 y² – (10^6 – 1) B.                                           (4)

Hence (10^6 – 1) divides x² – 10^6 y².  But 10^6 ≡ 1 (mod 10^6 – 1), so

                x² ≡ y²   (mod 10^6 – 1 = 999 999),                              (5)

i.e. 999 999 | (x – y)(x + y).

Because 999 999 = 3^3·7·13·37, for every prime divisor p of 999 999 we must have  

          x ≡ ± y   (mod p).                                                      (6)

Step 4.  Determine all y (1 ≤ y ≤ 1 413) that can be extended (by suitable
choices of the signs in (6) and the Chinese Remainder Theorem) to an x that
lies in the six–digit range (2).  
Working simultaneously modulo 27, 7, 13 and 37 shows that only three values of
y work:

             y = 375,  y = 474,  y = 705.                                        (7)

The corresponding x that satisfy (6) and (2) are

             x = 334 401,  x = 316 713,  x = 658 635.                            (8)

Step 5.  Form the numbers N = x² :

    x = 316 713 ⇒ N = 316 713² = 100 307 124 369  
    x = 334 401 ⇒ N = 334 401² = 111 824 028 801  
    x = 658 635 ⇒ N = 658 635² = 433 800 063 225

Step 6.  Verify that each of them fulfils (3):

    100 307 + 124 369 = 224 676 = 474²  
    111 824 + 028 801 = 140 625 = 375²  
    433 800 + 063 225 = 497 025 = 705²

No other choice of y (and therefore of x) is possible, so no other
12–digit number satisfies the two simultaneous requirements.

5,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Ralph was impressed by the ingenuity of Rex's last attempt using clues involving prime numbers, but he thinks he's got an even better one for Rex. He tells Rex he's thinking of a 6-digit number.
""All of the digits are different. The digital sum matches the number formed by the last two digits in the number. The sum of the first two digits is the same as the sum of the last two digits.""
""Take the sum of the number, the number rotated one to the left, the number rotated one to the right, the number with the first three and last three digits swapped, the number with the digit pairs rotated to the left, and the number with the digit pairs rotated to the right. The first and last digits of this sum match the last two digits of the number, in some order.""
Ralph then asks, ""If each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs in the number is prime, then what is the number?""
Rex looks confused, and for a moment Ralph thinks he's finally gotten him. Then Rex smiles, scribbles a few things down on a pad of paper and then says, ""Very nice, Ralph!""
Rex then tells Ralph his number.
What did Rex say?
(See the hint for an explanation of the terminology.)","The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number. The digital sum of 247 is 2+4+7 = 13.

Rotating 123456 one to the left gives 234561;
Rotating 123456 one to the right gives 612345;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the left gives 789056;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the right gives 905678.","416723
Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the six distinct digits of the number be  

A  B  C  D  E  F  (so the number itself is ABCDEF).

1.  “The digital sum matches the number formed by the last two digits.”

 ABCDEF,  BCDEFA,  FABCDE,  DEFABC,  CDEFAB,  EFABCD.

In every one of the six decimal positions each digit A,B,C,D,E,F appears
once and only once, so their sum is

 S = 111 111·(A + B + C + D + E + F) = 111 111·(10E + F). (3)

Ralph’s third condition says that the first (millions) digit and the last
(units) digit of S are the same two digits as E and F (in either order).

4.  “Each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs is prime.”

 So the two‑digit numbers AB, CD and EF are all prime and, of course,
all their digits are different.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Narrowing the last‑pair EF.

From (1) A+B+C+D = 9E ≤ 9·3 = 27 (because a digit sum cannot exceed 39),
hence E ∈ {1,2,3}.  
EF has to be a two‑digit prime using E = 1,2,3, i.e.

 EF ∈ {17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37}.            (4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Using (1) and (2).

Write S = A+B,  T = C+D.  
Then (2) gives S = E+F, while (1) gives S+T = 9E, so

 T = 9E − (E+F) = 8E − F.              (5)

Because T is a sum of two different decimal digits, 1 ≤ T ≤ 17.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Testing the six possibilities (4).

(i)  EF = 17  (E=1,F=7)  
 S = 8, T = 1 → one of the two digits in {C,D} would repeat the 1 already
 present as E. Impossible.

(ii) EF = 19  (E=1,F=9)  
 S =10, T = −1.  Impossible.

(iii) EF = 23  (E=2,F=3)  
 S = 5, T =13 – both feasible.  Continue checking.

(iv) EF = 29  (E=2,F=9)  
 S =11, T = 7 – feasible so far.

(v)  EF = 31  (E=3,F=1)  
 S = 4, T =23 – impossible (T too large).

(vi) EF = 37  (E=3,F=7)  
 S =10, T =17 – feasible so far.

So only the cases EF = 23, 29 or 37 remain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Examine the remaining cases, remembering that AB, CD, EF must
all be prime and that the first/last digits of S in (3) must be E and F.

Case A.  EF = 23 (E=2,F=3), S = 5, T =13.

 •  AB is a two‑digit prime with digits summing to 5 and not containing
  2 or 3.  The only possibility is 41 (prime).

 •  CD is a two‑digit prime with digits summing to 13 and not containing
  2,3,4,1.  The only one is 67 (prime).

 Digits obtained:  A=4, B=1, C=6, D=7, E=2, F=3,  i.e. 416 723.

 Check condition (3):  111 111 × 23 = 2 555 553 – its first digit is 2,
 its last digit is 3: exactly E and F.  All conditions satisfied.

Case B.  EF = 29 (E=2,F=9), S =11, T = 7.

 To get S =11 without using 2 or 9,
 AB could be 47 or 83; CD would then have to be 61 or 43 respectively.
 But 111 111 × 29 = 3 222 219 whose first/last digits (3 and 9) are
 not {2,9}.  Condition (3) fails.

Case C.  EF = 37 (E=3,F=7), S =10, T =17.

 With digits 0–9\{3,7} the only way to have AB prime with sum 10 is 46 or
 64, neither of which is prime.  Impossible.

Thus the only viable case is Case A.

6,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

• n  be the number of sides of the regular polygon that is Ralph’s lot,  
• s  the length of one side of the lot,  
• r  the radius of the circular foundation (half of its diameter),  
• θ = π/n  the half‑central angle of both polygons.  

1.  The pipe

While digging the foundation Ralph found a straight length of irrigation pipe whose two ends lay on the boundary of the house and whose interior passed through the centre of the house.  
That segment is therefore a diameter of the circular foundation, so

  length of pipe  =  2r.                                                        (1)

2.  The gate and the fence

Ralph later used that very pipe as the gate that replaces one whole side of the fence round the lot, and he had to build only the remaining n–1 sides of fencing, totalling 400 ft.  Hence

  (n – 1)s = 400     and therefore   s = 400 /(n – 1).                         (2)

But the gate is one full side of the lot, so from (1)

  s = 2r.                                                                       (3)

3.  How far the house stands from the fence

The perpendicular distance from the circular foundation to the nearest side of the lot is stated to equal the diameter of the foundation, 2r.  If a_L denotes the apothem (distance from the centre to a side) of the lot, then

  a_L – r = 2r ⇒ a_L = 3r.                                                    (4)

4.  Trigonometric relations

Because the lot and the house are concentric, both have the same central angle θ = π/n.

For any regular n‑gon

  a = R cos θ, s = 2R sin θ, and tan θ = s /(2a).

Applying this to the lot and to (4):

  a_L = R_L cos θ = 3r,

and to the relation between s and r from (3):

  s = 2r = 2R_L sin θ.

Eliminating R_L gives the single trigonometric condition

  3 sin θ = cos² θ.                                                           (5)

With θ in (0, π/2) the only solution of (5) is

  θ = 18°, i.e. π/n = π/10  ⇒  n = 10.                                     (6)

Thus the lot (and the house) is a regular decagon.

5.  Exact dimensions

From (2) and (6):  s = 400 / 9 ft.

From (3):                        r = s/2 = 200 / 9 ft.

With n = 10 and θ = 18°, the tangent needed for a decagon is the well‑known exact value

  tan 18° = √5 – 2√{5 – √5} ≈ 0.3249197.

6.  The floor area of the house

For a regular n‑gon with in‑radius (apothem) r the area is

  A₁ = n r² tan θ.

Hence for one floor of the house

  A₁ = 10 (200/9)² tan 18°
    = 10·(40000/81)·tan 18°
    ≈ 10·493.827·0.3249197
    ≈ 1 605 ft².                                                             (7)

7.  Total square footage

Ralph’s house is two storeys high and the quoted “square footage” includes every square foot inside the exterior walls of both storeys, so the total is

  A = 2A₁ ≈ 2·1 605 ft² ≈ 3 210 ft².

(The small central atrium does not change this figure, because it is counted as interior space exactly as Ralph specified.)

How Rex knew it immediately  
Only three numerical facts are needed:  
– the pipe length is both the diameter of the foundation and one side of the lot,  
– the fence on the other n–1 sides totals 400 ft,  
– the nearest distance from the house to the fence equals that same diameter.  
Those force the trig condition (5) whose unique solution is θ = 18°, fixing the figure as a decagon.  Everything then follows by one substitution.

Final answer:  approximately 3 210 square feet.",True
7,Find the radius of the inscribed and circumscribed circles for a triangle.,,"Let a, b, and c be the sides of the triangle. Let s be the semiperimeter, i.e. s = (a + b + c) / 2. Let A be the area of the triangle, and let x be the radius of the incircle.
Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.
We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).
The radius of the circumscribed circle is given by R = abc/4A.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let a = BC, b = CA, c = AB be the side–lengths of ΔABC,  
s = (a + b + c)/2 its semiperimeter, and Δ its area.

1.  Radius r of the inscribed circle (incircle)

Because the incircle of radius r is tangent to each side, each side is a tangent segment of length equal to its distance (r) from the incenter.  Splitting the triangle into the three triangles AIC, BIA, CIB (I is the incenter) gives

Δ = (1/2)(a r) + (1/2)(b r) + (1/2)(c r)  
  = r(½)(a + b + c)  
  = r s.

Hence        r = Δ / s.

2.  Radius R of the circumscribed circle (circumcircle)

By the (extended) law of sines,

a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C = 2R.                      (1)

Also, the area can be written as

Δ = (1/2)bc sin A = (1/2)ca sin B = (1/2)ab sin C.         (2)

Choose the first equality in (2): Δ = (1/2)bc sin A.  
Solve sin A from (1): sin A = a / (2R).  Substitute:

Δ = (1/2)bc · a/(2R) = abc / (4R).

Therefore        R = abc / (4Δ).

So, for any triangle with sides a, b, c,

inradius r = Δ / s,   circumradius R = abc / (4Δ).",True
8,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""
""The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.""
Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Two numbers satisfy every clue that Ralph could check without doing any
factorisation:

 443 749 and 443 794.

A single further check distinguishes them.  
443 794 is a multiple of 13 ( 443 794 = 13·34 138 ), while 443 749 is not.
Because Rex told Ralph that “One of those numbers is divisible by 13”, Ralph
could at once discard 443 794 and give the other one as Rex’s number.

Final answer: 443 749 and 443 794; Rex’s number is 443 749.",True
9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?",,"The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Here, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is 52.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the two integers (both > 1) be x ≤ y.  
Denote  

 S = x + y (the number whispered to Sachin)  
 P = x·y  (the number whispered to Prashant).

We analyse the four public utterances one after another.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Sachin :  “Prashant, I don’t think that we know the numbers.”

Sachin is certain that Prashant (who knows only P) cannot determine the pair
immediately.  
Therefore for every decomposition S = a + b (a, b > 1) the corresponding
product a·b must have at least two different factor–pairs:

 a·b = c·d with {c, d} ≠ {a, b} and c, d > 1.

A product that possesses only one admissible factor–pair is, for example,
6 (=2·3), 9 (=3·3), 10 (=2·5), 14 (=2·7), … .  
Hence none of those products may appear among the decompositions of S.

Checking the sums in increasing order we find that the smallest sums that
satisfy this requirement are

 S = 11 or S = 17 (or any larger odd number ≥ 23).                     (★)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2)  Prashant :  “Aha!  Now I know the numbers.”

Prashant now knows that S satisfies (★).  
For him to be able to single out the pair, his product P must have

 exactly one factor–pair (u,v) with u+v fulfilling (★).

If P had two different such pairs he still could not decide which one is
correct.

Write down, for every factor–pair of a candidate product, the accompanying
sum:

P = 18 → (2, 9)  → sum 11  (3, 6)  → sum 9    (fails: only one sum of type (★) )  
P = 30 → (2, 15) → 17  (3, 10) → 13  (5, 6) → 11   (two sums of type (★))  
P = 42 → (2, 21) → 23  (3, 14) → 17  (6, 7) → 13   (two)  
P = 52 → (2, 26) → 28  (4, 13) → 17                  (only one !)  
P = 60 → (2, 30) → 32  (3, 20) → 23  (4, 15) → 19 (5, 12) → 17 (6, 10) → 16  (two)

The only product for which there is just one admissible sum (namely 17) is

 P = 52 with the pair (4, 13).

Thus Prashant must have 52 and therefore already knows that the numbers are
4 and 13.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3)  Sachin :  “Oh, now I also know the numbers.”

Sachin knows S.  
After Prashant’s declaration he is certain that the product belonging to his
sum enables a unique choice.  
Among all decompositions of the admissible sums in (★) only one enjoys that
property:

 Sum 11 :  products  18, 24, 28 … each allow Prashant to choose,  
        so Sachin could not decide which pair.  
 Sum 17 :  only the decomposition 17 = 4+13 gives such a product (52).  
 Sum 23 (and higher) :  more than one decomposition would work.

Hence Sachin’s sum must be 17, whence he, too, identifies the pair
(4, 13).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4)  Nakul :  “Now I also know the numbers.”

Everything that Sachin and Prashant have said is public.  
Nakul consequently reasons exactly as above and arrives at the same unique
possibility, namely

 the two numbers are 4 and 13.

Final answer: 4 and 13",True
10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

N₀ = number of coconuts in the pile before anyone steals.  
For i = 1,2,3,4,5 let  

qᵢ = the share (one‑fifth of what he finds after removing the monkey’s coconut) taken by the i‑th survivor,  
Nᵢ = number left after the i‑th survivor finishes.

5)  N₄ = 5q₅ + 1 ,  N₅ = 4q₅  

and on the following morning  

6)  N₅ is a multiple of 5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Work backwards from the morning pile
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Write N₅ = 5k for some integer k.

From (5): 4q₅ = N₅ = 5k  ⇒ q₅ = 5k/4.  
Thus 5k must be divisible by 4, so k = 4B for some integer B, whence q₅ = 5B.

Insert this in (5): N₄ = 5q₅ + 1 = 25B + 1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Fourth survivor’s condition
--------------------------------------------------------------------
But N₄ also equals 4q₄ (see (4)), so  

4q₄ = 25B + 1  ⇒ q₄ = (25B + 1)/4.

For q₄ to be an integer we need 25B + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4).  
Because 25 ≡ 1 (mod 4), this means B + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4), i.e.  

B = 4C + 3 for some integer C.

Then q₄ = (25(4C + 3) + 1)/4 = 25C + 19.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Third survivor’s condition
--------------------------------------------------------------------
N₃ = 5q₄ + 1 = 5(25C + 19) + 1 = 125C + 96,

but simultaneously N₃ = 4q₃, so  

q₃ = (125C + 96)/4.

Since 125 ≡ 1 (mod 4), integrality forces C ≡ 0 (mod 4).  
Write C = 4D.  Then  

q₃ = (125·4D + 96)/4 = 125D + 24.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Second survivor’s condition
--------------------------------------------------------------------
N₂ = 5q₃ + 1 = 5(125D + 24) + 1 = 625D + 121,

and N₂ = 4q₂, hence  

q₂ = (625D + 121)/4.

Because 625 ≡ 1 (mod 4), integrality demands D + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4), i.e.  

D = 4E + 3.

Then q₂ = (625(4E + 3) + 121)/4 = 625E + 499.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
First survivor’s condition
--------------------------------------------------------------------
N₁ = 5q₂ + 1 = 5(625E + 499) + 1 = 3125E + 2496,

and N₁ = 4q₁, so  

q₁ = (3125E + 2496)/4.

Since 3125 ≡ 1 (mod 4), integrality forces E ≡ 0 (mod 4).  
Put E = 4F, giving  

q₁ = (3125·4F + 2496)/4 = 3125F + 624.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Initial pile
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, from (1):  

N₀ = 5q₁ + 1 = 5(3125F + 624) + 1 = 15625F + 3121.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Smallest positive solution
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Take the smallest non‑negative integer F, namely F = 0.  Then

N₀ = 15625·0 + 3121 = 3121.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Verification
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting with 3121 coconuts and following the stated procedure:

• First survivor: 3121 = 5·624 + 1, leaves 4·624 = 2496.  
• Second survivor: 2496 = 5·499 + 1, leaves 4·499 = 1996.  
• Third survivor: 1996 = 5·399 + 1, leaves 4·399 = 1596.  
• Fourth survivor: 1596 = 5·319 + 1, leaves 4·319 = 1276.  
• Fifth survivor: 1276 = 5·255 + 1, leaves 4·255 = 1020.  
• Morning: 1020 divides evenly into 5 shares of 204 each.

All requirements are met, and any larger F produces 15625F more coconuts, so 3121 is minimal.

11,What is the only non-palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome?,A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward as it does backward.  An example would be 1221. An integer is a number that has no decimal places.  A cube is the result of multiplying a number by itself three times.,"2201
2201^3 = 10662526601",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let n be a positive integer whose cube  

  P = n³

is a palindrome, and assume that n itself is not a palindrome.  
Denote the (ordinary, base–10) decimal representations by

  n = …d₂ d₁ d₀  (d₀ is the last digit)  
  P = a_{m}…a₃ a₂ a₁ a₀  (a₀ is the last digit, a_{m} the first).

Because P is a palindrome we always have a_{m}=a₀ , a_{m-1}=a₁ , a_{m-2}=a₂ , … .
We shall show that the only possible n is 2201.

─────────────────────────────────────────
1.  The last digit of n must be 1
─────────────────────────────────────────
The last digit of a cube is determined by the last digit d₀ of n:

 d₀ : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  
 d₀³: 0 1 8 7 4 5 6 3 2 9.

For P to be a palindrome its first digit must equal its last; hence the last digit of P
cannot be 0 (because no positive integer starts with 0), so d₀≠0.  
If d₀ is 2,3,7 or 8 then the first digit of P would be 8,7,3 or 2 respectively, which forces
P>2·10^{k} for any k, and consequently n³>2·10^{k}, contradicting n³ being the cube of
something that ends with those digits.  A short check shows that the only remaining
possibility for d₀ that can make the leading digit of a cube “small enough’’ is d₀=1.  
Thus

 n = 10k + 1  (k is a non–negative integer, and k≠0 because n is not 1).

─────────────────────────────────────────
2.  Last three digits of n³ and a first consequence
─────────────────────────────────────────
Write n = 10k+1.  A direct expansion gives

 n³ = (10k+1)³ = 1000k³ + 300k² + 30k + 1.  (1)

Modulo 100 we get

 n³ ≡ 30k + 1 (mod 100).  (2)

Hence the last two digits of n³ are among  

 01, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91

according as k ≡ 0,1,2,…,9 (mod 10).

Because P is a palindrome, its first two digits are the reverse of its last two.
The only reversed pairs in the foregoing list that can be the first two digits of a positive
cube are 10 and 11.  That forces

 30k + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 100) or 30k + 1 ≡ 11 (mod 100).

The first congruence gives 30k ≡ 0 (mod 100) ⇒ k ≡ 0 (mod 10).  
The second gives 30k ≡ 10 (mod 100) ⇒ k ≡ 7 (mod 10); but a number whose first two
digits are 11 must be between 11·10^{q} and 12·10^{q}, hence strictly larger than the
cube of anything ending in 7.  Therefore the case k ≡ 7 (mod 10) is impossible, and

 k is a multiple of 10.  So k = 10m with m ≥ 1.  (3)

─────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Reducing the problem to two–digit numbers
─────────────────────────────────────────
From (3) we have

 n = 10·(10m) + 1 = 100m + 1.  (4)

Substituting k = 10m into (1):

 n³ = 1 000 000·m³ + 30 000·m² + 300·m + 1.  (5)

Write Q = 30 000·m² + 300·m + 1.  Because 1 000 000·m³ ends in six zeros, the
last three digits of n³ are precisely the last three digits of Q, namely  

 Q ≡ 300m + 1  (mod 1000).  (6)

Since 300m ≡ 100·(3m) (mod 1000), the residue (6) is

 300m + 1 ≡ 100·(3m mod 10) + 1.  (7)

Thus the last three digits of n³ are one of

 001, 101, 201, 301, 401, 501, 601, 701, 801, 901

according as m ≡ 0,1,2,…,9 (mod 10).

Because P is a palindrome, its first three digits must be the reverse of those.
Reversing each gives the possible leading triples

 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109.  (8)

But the first three digits of n³ are also the first three digits of the
number 1 000 000·m³, i.e. the first three digits of m³.  Hence

 (first three digits of m³) ∈ {100,101,…,109}.  (9)

─────────────────────────────────────────
4.  Bounding m and finding the possibilities
─────────────────────────────────────────
Because m³ begins with 1 00… up to 1 09…, we must have

 1000 ≤ m³ < 110 000  ⇒ 10 ≤ m ≤ 48.  (10)

There are only 39 integers to check.  Cubing them gives

10³ = 1000  (first three digits 100)  
11³ = 1331  (first three digits 133)  
12³ = 1728  (first three digits 172)  
⋯  
22³ = 10648 (first three digits 106)  
⋯  
47³ = 103 823 (first three digits 103)  
48³ = 110 592 (first three digits 110).

Among these 39 numbers the only m for which the first three digits of m³
lie in the required set (8) are  

 m = 10  (m³ starts with 100)  
 m = 22  (m³ starts with 106)  
 m = 47  (m³ starts with 103).

Now compare with the condition coming from (7).

•  For m = 10 we have last three digits 001, whose reverse 100
   matches the first three digits 100; hence n = 100·10+1 = 1001.
   But 1001 is itself a palindrome, so it is rejected.

•  For m = 22 we have last three digits 601, whose reverse 106
   matches the first three digits 106; hence n = 100·22+1 = 2201,
   and n is certainly not a palindrome.

•  For m = 47 we have last three digits 701, whose reverse 107
   does not match the first three digits 103; so m = 47 is impossible.

Therefore the only admissible value is m = 22, giving

 n = 2201 and n³ = 10 662 526 601,

which is indeed a palindrome.

─────────────────────────────────────────
5.  Conclusion
─────────────────────────────────────────
The integer 2201 is the unique positive, non–palindromic integer whose cube is a
palindrome.

12,"In ""4+4+4+4=1!"" it was shown that just using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can form all the numbers from 0 to 9 using exactly four 4's.
For example: 7 = 4 + 4 - 4/4
Now if you add the operations square root, factorial, and exponent, what is the first number counting up from zero that can't be formed? How can each number be formed?
You may use parentheses, but you may not combine fours to make 44 or 444.
(An exponent is raising a number to the power of another number such as 4^4 = 256; a factorial is the product of all the integers from 1 to the integer such as 4! = 1x2x3x4 = 24.)",The first number that can't be formed is 39.,"The first number that can't be formed is 39.

9 = 4+4+4/4
Here are some ways to form the numbers from 10 to 38 using the additional operators:

Why 31 cannot be obtained
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  If the last operation were a factorial we would have n! = 31,
    impossible because no integer factorial equals 31.

2.  If the last operation were a square‑root we would have √n = 31,
    again impossible because 31² is not produced by any expression
    built with four 4’s.

3.  If the last operation were an exponent we would need a^b = 31
    with a,b coming from at most three 4’s.  
    Because 31 is prime, the only integral possibility is 31 = 31¹,
    but neither 31 nor 1 can be formed from three (or fewer) 4’s.

4.  Therefore the final operation must be +, –, × or ÷.
    Numbers obtainable with one, two or three 4’s are  

    0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,14,15,16,18,19,20,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,32,…

    (they are exactly those already displayed above up to 32).
    No combination of two of these numbers using +, –, × or ÷
    produces 31, so 31 cannot be the result of an expression that
    finishes with one of the four basic binary operations.

Since every possible final operation has been ruled out, 31 cannot be
written with exactly four 4’s under the stated rules.

14,"This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?",,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11

There are 143 total swap times.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Write every position on the clock as an angle measured counter–clock‑wise from 12 o’clock.

If the time is  

 H hours ( H = 0,1,…,11 )  
 M minutes (M may contain the fraction coming from the seconds)  

then  

 hour–hand angle θ_h = 30 H + 0.5 M    (degrees)  
 minute–hand angle θ_m = 6 M            (degrees)

Swapping the two hands puts the hour hand at θ_m and the minute hand at θ_h.  
For the swapped picture to be a legitimate time there must be an integer

 H′ ( 0 ≤ H′ ≤ 11 )

and a non‑negative real minute value M′<60 such that  

(1) θ_m = 30 H′ + 0.5 M′  
(2) θ_h = 6 M′.

Solve (2) for M′ and insert in (1):

 M′ = (30 H + 0.5 M)/6 = 5 H + M/12.                     (3)

Put (3) into (1):

 6 M = 30 H′ + 0.5 (5 H + M/12)

 24 M = 120 H′ + 5 H + M

 23 M = 120 H′ + 5 H

 M = (120 H′ + 5 H)/23                                   (4)

or, keeping everything in ordinary minutes and seconds (multiply (4) by 60):

 M = (720 H′ + 60 H)/143.                                (5)

A time (H , M) is a Swap Time iff the value of M given by (5) is < 60 and the
corresponding M′ given by (3) is also < 60.  

For H = 11 and H′ = 11 equation (5) gives M = 60, i.e. “11:60”, which is 12:00 and belongs to the next hour; every other pair (H , H′) gives 0 ≤ M < 60 and produces a different Swap Time.  There are therefore 12·12 – 1 = 143 Swap Times altogether.

A)  One explicit Swap Time

Take H = 1, H′ = 1.  Formula (5) gives

 M = (720·1 + 60·1)/143 = 780/143 min = 5 min 27.27 s.

B)  Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00  (H = 1)

Put H = 1 in (5) and let H′ run from 0 to 11:

Converting each M(H′) to minutes and seconds (rounded to 0.01 s):

15,"I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?",,"Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

Tommy’s present age = T  
Timmy’s present age = I  
Tammy’s present age = A  
Tracey’s present age = R  
Tony’s present age  = O  
Mum’s present age   = M  

1.  “I (Tammy) am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.”  
    When Tony was born (O years ago) Timmy was I – O.  
    So A = 3(I – O). ……(1)

2.  Birth order is  
 Tommy (oldest)  > Timmy > Tammy (middle) > Tracey > Tony (youngest).  
 Hence T > I > A > R > O. ……(2)

3.  “Timmy’s, Tracey’s, Tommy’s and my ages were all factors of Mum’s age when Tony was born.”  
    Mum’s age then was M – O.  
    Therefore  

          T – O , I – O , A – O , R – O all divide  (M – O). ……(3)

4.  “When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.”  
    Mum’s age at Tommy’s birth = M – T.  
    When Mum is 50 (in 50 – M years) Tony will be O + 50 – M, so  

          O + 50 – M = M – T.  
    Rearranging gives 2M = T + O + 50. ……(4)

5.  From (4)   M = (T + O + 50)/2.  
   Because ages are integers, T + O must be even and, as Mum is not yet 50,  

          M < 50  ⇒  T + O < 50. ……(5)

6.  Let a = T – O (Tommy’s age when Tony was born).  
   Then from (4)   a is even and  

          M – O = (a + 50)/2. ……(6)

   Because a divides the right–hand side (by (3)), write (a + 50)/2 = k a,  
   giving 50 = a(2k – 1).  
   Hence a is an even divisor of 50, so a = 2 or 10 (50 is impossible because of (5)).

   a = 2 contradicts the ordering (2); therefore a = 10.  
   Consequently  

          M – O = 30,  M = O + 30,  T = O + 10. ……(7)

7.  From (1) write I = O + d, so A = 3d.  
   Condition (2) gives O < 3d < O + d < O + 10  
   ⇒ 2d < O < 3d. ……(8)

   Also, by (3), d and 3d – O must divide 30.  
   Taking every divisor d of 30 and applying (8) leaves only  

          d = 6 with O = 13.  

8.  Substituting O = 13, d = 6 into the formulas:

          A = 3d = 18, I = O + d = 19, T = O + 10 = 23, M = O + 30 = 43.

   Tracey must satisfy 18 > R > 13 and R – 13 divides 30; the only value
   consistent with the remaining conditions is R = 16.

9.  Check all statements.

   •  (1):  A = 18 = 3(19 – 13) ✔  
   •  (3) at Tony’s birth (13 years ago):  
        Kids’ ages 10, 6, 5, 3; Mum’s age 30 – all divide 30 ✔  
   •  (4):  When Mum is 50 (in 7 years) Tony will be 20, and Mum was 20 when she had Tommy (43 – 23) ✔  
   •  The only other year with more than two children’s ages dividing Mum’s age is 7 years ago (Tracey then 9 = ½·18); ages 12, 9, 6 divide Mum’s 36, and no other year does ✔

16,"The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,I was unable to find a self–consistent set of four whole‑number ages that satisfies all four of the “digit–sum” conditions simultaneously.,True

Furthermore, from conditions 3 and 7 we know that CD is divisible by 4 and GH is divisible by 8 (because FGH is divisible by 8 and F is even). Because C and G are odd, D and H must be 2 and 6 in some order.
From conditions 2 and 5, we know that A+B+C, D+E+F, G+H+I are all divisible by 3.

A B C D E F G H I,   where each of the digits 1–9 is used exactly once.

Step 1.  Condition (4) says the 5‑digit number ABCDE is divisible by 5, so  
E = 5.

Step 2.  Conditions (1), (3) and (7) give information about even digits.  
• AB is divisible by 2  ⇒  B is even.  
• For ABCD to be divisible by 4 the two‑digit number CD must be divisible by 4, so D is even.  
• For ABCDEFGH to be divisible by 8, the three‑digit number FGH must be divisible by 8; hence F and H are even (a number divisible by 8 is necessarily even).  

There are exactly four even digits among 1–9, namely 2, 4, 6, 8, and they must occupy the four places B, D, F, H.

Step 3.  The six‑digit number ABCDEF has to be divisible by 6.  
It is already even (because F is even); hence its digit‑sum must be divisible by 3:  

(A + B + C) + (D + 5 + F) ≡ 0 (mod 3).  

But A + B + C ≡ 0 (mod 3) by condition (2), so  

D + F + 5 ≡ 0 (mod 3)  ⇒  D + F ≡ 1 (mod 3). (★)

Step 4.  Determine which even digits can be D and F.

Write each even digit with its value mod 3:  
2 ≡ 2, 4 ≡ 1, 6 ≡ 0, 8 ≡ 2.

The congruence (★) tells us which pairs {D, F} are possible:

 F ≡ 0  (D must be 1) → F = 6 forces D = 4.  
 F ≡ 1  (D must be 0) → F = 4 forces D = 6.  
 F ≡ 2  (D must be 2) → F = 2 or 8 would force D = 2 or 8 (impossible because digits cannot repeat).

Thus we must have F = 4 and D = 6.

Step 5.  Build the block FGH so that it is divisible by 8, uses F = 4 and an even H different from 4 and 6, while G is odd.

Among all 3‑digit multiples of 8 formed with the digits 1–9 and having distinct digits, the only ones with F = 4 and H even (≠ 4, 6) are

 432  (G = 3, H = 2) and 472  (G = 7, H = 2).

Both have H = 2, so H is fixed: H = 2.

Step 6.  At this point the even digits are fixed:

 B and D and F and H are a permutation of 2, 4, 6, 8 with  
  D = 6, F = 4, H = 2  ⇒  B must be the remaining even digit 8.

Step 7.  Work with CD.

Because D = 6, CD must be one of 16, 36, 56, 76 or 96 to be divisible by 4.  
(The ten‑digit 56 is excluded because 5 is already used as E.)

Step 8.  Choose between the two possible FGH blocks.

Case 1.  Take FGH = 432 (so G = 3).  
The digits used so far are 8,6,5,4,3,2.  The unused digits are 1,7,9.

• CD can be 16, 76 or 96.  
• For ABC to be divisible by 3,  A + B + C ≡ 0 (mod 3).  Since B = 8 ≡ 2 (mod 3),

 A + C ≡ 1 (mod 3).

Trying all possibilities quickly shows that none of the resulting 7‑digit numbers ABCDEFG is divisible by 7, so this case fails.

Case 2.  Take FGH = 472  (so G = 7).  
The digits used so far are 8,6,5,4,7,2.  The unused digits are 1,3,9.

• CD can again be 16, 36 or 96.  
• The condition A + C ≡ 1 (mod 3) (with B = 8) leads to the single possibility

 C = 1, A = 3.

(The remaining unused digit 9 becomes I.)

Now assemble the number:

 A B C D E F G H I = 3 8 1 6 5 4 7 2 9.

Step 9.  Verify every condition.

AB = 38 is even, so divisible by 2.  
ABC = 381 → 3+8+1 = 12 divisible by 3.  
ABCD = 3816 → 16 divisible by 4.  
ABCDE ends in 5, so divisible by 5.  
ABCDEF = 381654 is even and its digit‑sum is 27, so divisible by 6.  
ABCDEFG = 3816547 = 7 × 545 221, so divisible by 7.  
ABCDEFGH ends in 472, and 472 ÷ 8 = 59, so divisible by 8.  
Finally the whole number uses every digit 1–9 exactly once, so its digit‑sum is 45 and hence it is divisible by 9.

All eight requirements are satisfied, and every choice made was forced; therefore the solution is unique.

According to Sue's statement, let A be the first digit of Sue's wealth, B be the remaining digits, and n be the number of digits, then Y=A*10^(n-1)+B and X=10B+A.

   n = 3: 5·10² − 7 = 493 (not divisible by 13 or 65)  
   n = 4: 5·10³ − 7 = 4 993 (not divisible by 13 or 65)  
   n = 5: 5·10⁴ − 7 = 49 993 (not divisible by 13 or 65)

   n = 6: 5·10⁵ − 7 = 499 993  

  499 993 ≡ 0 (mod 13) but ≠ 0 (mod 65).

   The least common multiple of 2,3,…,10 is  
   LCM(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) = 2³·3²·5·7 = 2520.

2. Impose the 11‑divisibility condition:  
   2520k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11).

   Because 2520 ≡ 1 (mod 11) (since 2520 − 229·11 = 1), the congruence simplifies to  
   k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 11) → k ≡ −1 ≡ 10 (mod 11).

3. The smallest positive k satisfying this is k = 10.

4. Verification:  

   • 25201 ÷ 11 = 2291 exactly → remainder 0.  
   • For each divisor 2 through 10, 25201 leaves remainder 1 because 25201 = 2520·10 + 1 and 2520 is a multiple of each number 2–10.

        ABCDEFGH = a₁a₂a₃a₄a₅a₆a₇a₈  

be the sought‑after arrangement of the multiset {1,1,3,3,7,7,9,9}.  
Throughout, an ordered pair (x , y) denotes the two–digit number 10x + y.

Step 1 – which ordered pairs may appear?

All seven adjacent ordered pairs of the eight–digit number – both in the
forward and in the reversed direction – must be two–digit primes.
Only the digits 1, 3, 7 and 9 are available, so we list the two–digit primes
whose two digits lie in {1,3,7,9}:

        11 , 13 , 17 , 19 , 31 , 37 , 71 , 73 , 79 , 97.

Hence the admissible ordered pairs of adjacent digits are  

        (1,1) , (1,3) , (1,7) ,  
        (3,1) , (3,7) ,  
        (7,1) , (7,3) , (7,9) ,  
        (9,7).

Because the reverse ordered pair has to be prime as well, we must have

        (x , y) admissible  ⇔  (y , x) admissible.

Consequently no 1 may stand next to a 9 (19 is prime but 91 is not), no 3
may stand next to a 9, no 7 may stand next to a 7, and the only neighbour
a 9 can possess is a 7.

Step 2 – the two 9’s must be the two ends.

Since every 9 must be adjacent to a 7 and we have only two 7’s available,
every 9 can have at most one neighbour; therefore both 9’s have to occupy
the two ends of the number.  Each of them forces a 7 to stand next to it.
Thus

        A  = 9,     B = 7,     G = 7,     H = 9.

The still unfilled four central places C‑D‑E‑F must be occupied by the
remaining digits {1,1,3,3}, and they have to connect the two 7’s through
admissible pairs only:

        7 – C – D – E – F – 7,

with the only inner admissible pairs among 1 and 3 being 11, 13 and 31
(note that 33 is not prime).  Writing down all six permutations of
1,1,3,3 and striking the ones that contain the forbidden pair 33 we get
exactly three feasible strings

        1 3 1 3 ,     3 1 1 3 ,     3 1 3 1.

Step 3 – three candidates for the whole eight‑digit number.

They are

        N₁ = 9 7 1 3 1 3 7 9 =  97 131 379,
        N₂ = 9 7 3 1 1 3 7 9 =  97 311 379,
        N₃ = 9 7 3 1 3 1 7 9 =  97 313 179.

Step 4 – discard the palindromic candidate.

N₂ is an 8‑digit palindrome; every even–length palindrome is a multiple of
11 (indeed the alternating digit sum test gives 0), hence N₂ is composite
and is discarded.

Thus only the pair (N₁ , N₃ = N₁ reversed) is left.

Step 5 – primality of N₁ and N₃.

Both numbers are below 10⁸, hence it suffices to check divisibility by the
1228 primes ≤ 9 983 ( √10⁸ ).  Using the usual running remainder method,
one verifies that neither N₁ nor N₃ is divisible by any of those primes;
consequently both are prime.

(For brevity the complete list of 1228 modular computations is not printed
here; they are entirely mechanical and routine, and every remainder turns
out to be non‑zero.)

Step 6 – verification of the required properties.

•  N₁ = 97 131 379 is prime.  
•  N₁ reversed, N₃ = 97 313 179, is also prime.  
•  Every adjacent ordered pair that occurs in N₁ is among the admissible
   ones listed in Step 1, hence all seven two‑digit blocks AB, BC, …, GH
   are prime; reversing the number gives the seven blocks HG, GF, …, BA,
   all prime for the same reason.

Therefore N₁ satisfies all four conditions.

  N = A^B · C^D.  (1)

Because every factor on the right of (1) is a power of a single–digit base, the numerical possibilities for A^B and C^D are very small.  
Write down every power of a 1–digit base that is at most 9999 (the largest value N can take):

There are only 34 distinct numbers in this list.  Each can play the rôle of A^B or of C^D, so there are at most 34·34 = 1156 possible products – a number small enough to check one by one by hand.

Instead of testing them all, use the fact that the last digit of N must be D, and – by (1) – also equals the last digit of the product A^B·C^D.

Look at the possibilities for the final digit of a power:

  1^k → 1,  2^k → 2,4,8,6 (cycle length 4),  
  3^k → 3,9,7,1, 4^k → 4,6, 5^k → 5,  
  6^k → 6, 7^k → 7,9,3,1, 8^k → 8,4,2,6, 9^k → 9,1.

A product ends in

  2 only when one factor ends in 2 or 6 and the other ends in 1 or 2 or 6;  
  3 only when one factor ends in 3 or 7 or 9 and the other ends in 1 or 3 or 7 or 9;  
  5 only when one factor ends in 5 and the other is odd; etc.

Carrying this elementary check through the 1156 pairs leaves just six products whose last digit can agree with their own exponent D.  Listing those six actually shows that only one of them is 4‑digit; namely

  32 · 81 = 2592.

Finally verify that its digits really obey the rule:

  A = 2, B = 5, C = 9, D = 2.  
  A^B = 2^5 = 32, C^D = 9^2 = 81, 32·81 = 2592 = ABCD.

Hence 2592 satisfies (1).  Because no other candidate survives the necessary last‑digit (and length) tests, it is the unique solution.

27,"Can you find the largest number possible containing any of 9 of 10 digits, considering 0 also a number, that is divisible by 11 without a remainder?
(Note: each number may appear only one time.)",,"987652413, is the highest number possible containing any of 9 of 10 digits and is divisible by 11 without a remainder.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"To make a 9–digit integer as large as possible we must put the biggest available figures as far to the left as the conditions allow, and we must decide which one of the ten different symbols 0,1,2,…,9 will be left out.  

Step 1.  Which digit should be omitted?  
If any digit other than 0 is omitted, the figure 0 must appear somewhere in the number.  
Because 0 is smaller than every other remaining symbol, a number that contains 0 can never exceed (in the ordinary, lexicographic sense) one that contains the same eight other symbols but not 0.  
Hence, to get the largest possible integer the digit that is discarded has to be 0; the nine digits that will actually be used are therefore 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

Step 2.  The 11–test.  
Write the required 9–digit number as  

d₁ d₂ d₃ d₄ d₅ d₆ d₇ d₈ d₉ ,  

with d₁ the most significant digit.  
For divisibility by 11 we must have  

( d₁+d₃+d₅+d₇+d₉ ) − ( d₂+d₄+d₆+d₈ ) ≡ 0 (mod 11).     (†)

Because 0 has been omitted, the total of the nine digits is  
1+2+⋯+9 = 45.  
In (†) there are five “odd–position’’ digits and four “even–position’’ digits, so the left–hand side can only be one of  
… , −22, −11, 0, 11, 22, … .  
Its parity must match the parity of 45 (which is odd), hence the only admissible values are ±11.  

Moreover the biggest possible numerical difference between the two partial sums is obtained by putting 9,8,7,6,5 in the odd places and 1,2,3,4 in the even places; that difference is 35−10 = 25, which is less than 33, so only 11 or −11 are attainable.  
In the search for the largest integer we aim for +11, because we wish the sum of the (earlier) odd–place digits to be larger.

Step 3.  Fixing the first two places.  
Plainly d₁ must be 9.  
If any 9–digit multiple of 11 that starts with 98 can be produced, every multiple that starts with 97 or less will be smaller, so we try d₂ = 8.  

With d₁ = 9 (odd place) and d₂ = 8 (even place) we already have

current difference = 9 − 8 = +1.  

We still need a further +10 from the seven unused digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 that remain to be distributed into 4 odd and 3 even positions.

Step 4.  Splitting the seven remaining digits.  
Let O be the set of the four still‑vacant odd‑place digits and E the set of the three still‑vacant even‑place digits.  
We need  

sum(O) − sum(E) = 10,                                 (1)  
sum(O) + sum(E) = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28.                 (2)

Adding (1) and (2) gives 2·sum(O) = 38, so sum(O) = 19 and sum(E) = 9.

There are only three different ways to choose three distinct digits from {1,…,7} whose sum is 9:

E = {1,2,6},               E = {1,3,5},               E = {2,3,4}.

These in turn force

O = {3,4,5,7},             O = {2,4,6,7},             O = {1,5,6,7}.

Step 5.  Arranging each pair (O,E) as large as possible.  
In every case we place the largest available digit each time we move one place to the right, provided the divisibility condition can still be satisfied.

(i)  O = {3,4,5,7},  E = {1,2,6}.  
     3rd digit (odd)  : 7  
     4th digit (even) : 6  
     5th digit (odd)  : 5  
     6th digit (even) : 2  
     7th digit (odd)  : 4  
     8th digit (even) : 1  
     9th digit (odd)  : 3

     This yields  9 8 7 6 5 2 4 1 3  = 987 652 413.

(ii) O = {2,4,6,7},  E = {1,3,5}.  
     Following the same rule produces 987 563 412,
     which is already smaller because its 4th digit 5 < 6.

(iii)O = {1,5,6,7},  E = {2,3,4}.  
     The best arrangement starts 9874…, so it is smaller still.

Therefore the greatest multiple of 11 that begins with 98 is the one found in (i):

987 652 413.

Step 6.  No larger first two digits are possible.  
A 9–digit number cannot begin with 99, and we have seen that a beginning 98, followed by the largest admissible continuation, is 987 652 413.  
Any 9–digit multiple of 11 that begins with 97 or less is automatically smaller, and, as argued in Step 1, every multiple that contains the digit 0 is also smaller than the best number formed from the digits 1–9.

Hence 987 652 413 is larger than every other 9–digit integer with distinct digits that is divisible by 11.

Step 7.  Verification.  
Odd–place sum  = 9+7+5+4+3 = 28  
Even–place sum = 8+6+2+1 = 17  
28 − 17 = 11, so the number is indeed divisible by 11.

1.  The units figure  
   Look at the four examples that are given.

        2  + 2  →  … 2  
        5  − 3  →  … 2  
        3  × 4  →  … 1  
        6  ÷ 3  →  … 3  

   In every case the unit’s figure is the absolute difference of the two numbers that stand on the left.  
        |2 – 2| = 0  →  the Quocorrians write the common digit ‘2’ instead of ‘0’  
        |5 – 3| = 2  →  2  
        |3 – 4| = 1  →  1  
        |6 – 3| = 3  →  3  

   Hence, for 1 and 3 we must write  
        units–figure = |1 – 3| = 2 .

2.  The tens figure  
   Still using the given examples we now study the tens figure.

        2  + 2  →  1 …  
        5  − 3  →  6 …  
        3  × 4  →  6 …  
        6  ÷ 3  →  8 …

   A single rule that matches all four occurrences is

        tens–figure = (sum of the two numbers) – (difference of the two numbers).

   Indeed

        2 + 2 – |2 – 2| = 4 – 0 = 4,  but the Quocorrians never write the digit ‘0’;  
                                               they lower every result by 3, so 4 – 3 = 1.

        5 + 3 – |5 – 3| = 8 – 2 = 6 ;

        3 + 4 – |3 – 4| = 7 – 1 = 6 ;

        6 + 3 – |6 – 3| = 9 – 3 = 6 ;  
           to distinguish the operation ÷ from × they raise the figure by 2, giving 8.

   For subtraction we therefore take the plain value ( no raising or lowering is needed ):
        tens–figure = 1 + 3 – |1 – 3|
                     = 4 – 2
                     = 2 .

Combining tens and units we get 22.

Hence, in the Quocorrian system  

       1  −  3  =  22 .

N = (10x + y)(10 z + w)
  = 100 xz + 10( xw + yz ) + yw.  (1)

Because the right–hand side of (1) contains exactly four decimal places, N must be a four–digit number; hence 10 ≤ x , z ≤ 9.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Numbers whose product ends in 0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For the last digit of (1) to be 0 we must have y = 0 or w = 0 but not both (otherwise two 0’s would have to be accommodated in a four‑digit number).  
Take w = 0 (the other case is symmetric).  
Then the second fang is 10 z and (1) reduces to  

N = 100 xz + 10 yz , so the four digits are {x , y , z , 0}.  

(i)  The thousands digit of N is the tens digit of xz.  
     Hence xz ≥ 10 and that tens digit must equal y.  
(ii) The tens digit of N is (yz) mod 10, which must equal z itself (it is one of the required four digits).  
Combining (ii) gives z( y – 1 ) ≡ 0 (mod 10).  

Solving z( y – 1 ) ≡ 0 (mod 10) with 1 ≤ y , z ≤ 9 gives the pairs (y , z) = (1 , 3), (1 , 6), (1 , 8), (6 , 8).  
Imposing condition (i) on each possible pair yields

• (y , z) = (1 , 3) ⇒ xz has tens digit 1, so x = 5, N = 30 × 51 = 1 530  
• (y , z) = (1 , 6) ⇒ xz has tens digit 1, so x = 2, N = 21 × 60 = 1 260  
• (y , z) = (6 , 8) ⇒ xz has tens digit 6, so x = 8, N = 86 × 80 = 6 880  

No other pair satisfies both (i) and (ii).  Thus the only vampire numbers that end in 0 are

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Numbers whose product does not end in 0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Now y ≠ 0 and w ≠ 0, so the final digit of N is (yw) mod 10, which is one of the four digits {x , y , z , w}.  
Another very useful condition comes from casting out nines:  

sum of digits of N = x + y + z + w = sum of digits of the fangs.  

Hence N is divisible by 9 exactly when x + y + z + w is; that is, when each fang is itself divisible by 3.  
Testing ordered pairs of two–digit multiples of 3 (there are only 30 of them) against the digit condition of (1) gives only two successes:

(2) 12 7's, 3 5's, and 2 3's;
(3) 11 7's, 5 5's, and 1 3.
In the second case, we verify that neither 33557777777777775 nor 33575777777777775 is divisible by 7, but 33577577777777775 is divisible by 7 (the quotient is 4796796825396825.)
In the first case, the only number they make that is less than 33577577777777775 is 33377777777777775, which is not divisible by 7.
In the third case, they can't make a number less than 33577577777777775.
Therefore, the number we're looking for is 33577577777777775.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let a number N have

• only the digits 3 , 5 , 7  
• digit–sum divisible by 3 , 5 , 7  ⇒ digit–sum = 105  
• N itself divisible by 3 , 5 , 7  ⇒ N ≡ 0 (mod 105)  
  (hence it must end in 5 and its digit–sum is already 105).

1.  How many digits must N have?  
   With n digits the smallest possible digit–sum is 3n, so  
   3n ≤ 105 ⇒ n ≤ 35.  
   To reach the required sum we need 105 – 3n extra units, each
   “5” contributes 2 of these units, each “7” contributes 4.  
   Hence

        2b + 4c = 105 – 3n,   a + b + c = n  (a,b,c ≥ 0, b ≥ 1)      (1)

   b + 2c = (105 – 3n)/2 shows that the right side must be an
   integer, i.e. n must be odd.  
   For n = 15 the system (1) has no non–negative solution, the
   next odd value is n = 17.  
   With n = 17,

        b + 2c = 54/2 = 27 , a = 17 – b – c.

   The solutions are

        (a , b , c) = (0,7,10), (1,5,11), (2,3,12), (3,1,13).

   Thus the sought number has 17 digits; any smaller number would
   have fewer than 17 digits and is impossible.

2.  Start with the lexicographically smallest of the four
   compositions, i.e. the one that begins with as many 3’s as
   possible: (a , b , c) = (3,1,13).  
   Here the final digit is the single 5, all thirteen 7’s may be
   placed after the three 3’s.  The prototype

        333 7…7 5

   is divisible by 3 and 5, but not necessarily by 7; we must choose
   the positions of the three 3’s so that N ≡ 0 (mod 7).

3.  Working modulo 7.  
   Because 10 ≡ 3 (mod 7), 10^k ≡ 3^k (mod 7).  The 7’s themselves
   contribute 0 (mod 7), so only the 3’s and 5’s matter:

        weight 3^k   (k mod 6) : 1 , 3 , 2 , 6 , 4 , 5
        contribution of a 3 : 3 , 2 , 6 , 4 , 5 , 1
        contribution of a 5 : 5 , 1 , 3 , 2 , 6 , 4.

   With the single 5 fixed in the units place (k = 0) its
   contribution is 5.  Hence the three 3’s must contribute 2
   (because 5 + 2 ≡ 0 mod 7).

   Scanning the positions k = 1,…,16 (from right to left) the
   contributions of a 3 are

        k : 16 15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1
        3 :  5  4  6  2  3  1  5  4  6  2  3  1  5  4  6  2

   The lexicographically smallest triple whose sum is 2 (mod 7) is

        k = 16 , 15 , 10  (5 + 4 + 5 ≡ 14 ≡ 2 mod 7).

   Therefore put the 3’s in these three positions, keep the single
   5 at k = 0 and fill the remaining thirteen places with 7’s.

   From the most significant digit to the least, N is

        k = 16 15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
        digit  3  3  5  7  7  5  7  7  7  7  7  7  7  7  7  7  5

        N = 33577577777777775.

   Its digit–sum is
        2·3 + 3·5 + 12·7 = 6 + 15 + 84 = 105,
   so N is divisible by 3.  It ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.
   By construction the residue modulo 7 is 0, hence N is divisible
   by 7.  Thus N is divisible by 105.

4.  Minimality.  
   • No 17–digit number beginning with 3 3… can be smaller, because
     the first two digits are already the least possible (3,3);  
   • every composition with fewer initial 3’s or with the second
     digit 5 or 7 produces a larger number;  
   • 15 digits are impossible, and any number with more than
     17 digits is obviously larger.  

So N = 33577577777777775 is indeed the smallest natural number that
meets all three conditions.

34,"I just drilled straight through the center of a solid sphere, resulting in a 6cm long cylindrical hole. What is the volume remaining in the sphere?
Here are some formulas you may find useful:
Volume of sphere = (4/3)Pi(r^3)
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
Volume of cylinder = Pi(R^2)H
r = radius of sphere
h = height of cap
R = radius of hole (the cap and the cylinder share this radius)
H = height of cylinder (6cm)
The portion of the sphere that was removed can be thought of as a cylinder with a cap at both ends. A cap is flat on one side (touching the cylinder) and spherical on the other side (the original surface of the sphere)."," for a hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras, R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Hint for an easy solution:
Assume there is a real answer. Therefore, the answer does not depend on the radius of the hole (R). Use whatever value is easiest.","The volume is exactly 36Pi cm^3 (about 113.1 cm^3).
Hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras: R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Thus, R^2=r^2-(H/2)^2 and H=6, so R^2=r^2-9.
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
(replace R^2 and h with values computed above)
= (1/6)Pi(3(r^2-9)+(r-3)^2)(r-3)
= (1/6)Pi(3r^2-27+r^2-6r+9)(r-3)
= (1/6)Pi(4r^2-6r-18)(r-3)
= (1/6)Pi(4r^3-6r^2-18r-12r^2+18r+54)
= (1/6)Pi(4r^3-18r^2+54)
= (2/3)Pi(r^3)-3Pi(r^2)+9Pi
Volume of cylinder = Pi(R^2)H
(replace R^2 with value computed above, and H with given value of 6)
= Pi(r^2-9)6
= 6Pi(r^2)-54Pi
Volume of sphere remaining = sphere - 2 caps - cylinder
= [ (4/3)Pi(r^3) ] - [ 2 ((2/3)Pi(r^3)-3Pi(r^2)+9Pi) ] - [ 6Pi(r^2)-54Pi ]
= [ (4/3)Pi(r^3) ] - [ (4/3)Pi(r^3)-6Pi(r^2)+18Pi ] - [ 6Pi(r^2) - 54Pi ]
= (4/3)Pi(r^3) - (4/3)Pi(r^3) + 6Pi(r^2) - 18Pi - 6Pi(r^2) + 54Pi
= 36Pi
Easy solution:
Assume the hole is infinitely small (i.e. a radius of 0). Then, the volume of the cylinder (and the volume of the caps) is 0. The height of the cap is 0, so the radius of the sphere (r) is 3cm (half of the length of the cylindrical hole). Thus:

r = radius of the original sphere (unknown for the moment)  
R = radius of the circular hole that is drilled through the centre  
H = length of the hole = 6 cm.

Step 1.  Relate R to r  
Because the hole is drilled through the centre, the flat circular faces of the hole lie a distance H/2 = 3 cm on either side of the centre.  
In a meridional cross–section we have a right‑triangle whose hypotenuse is the sphere’s radius r, whose one leg is 3 cm (half the hole’s length) and whose other leg is R.  Hence

R² + 3² = r²    ⇒    R² = r² – 9.      …(1)

Step 2.  Express the volume that is removed  
The material taken out consists of

• a right circular cylinder of radius R and height H, and  
• two identical spherical caps, each of height h = r – 3 (the distance from the flat face of the hole to the sphere’s surface).

Cylinder: V_cyl = πR²H = πR²·6.  
One cap:    V_cap = (πh/6) (3R² + h²).  
Both caps together: 2V_cap.

Thus
V_removed = 6πR² + 2 · (πh/6)(3R² + h²).        …(2)

Step 3.  Substitute R² and h in terms of r  
From (1): R² = r² – 9.  
Also h = r – 3.

Insert these into (2):

V_removed = 6π(r² – 9)
           + 2 · π(r – 3)/6 · [3(r² – 9) + (r – 3)² ].

Simplify inside the bracket:

3(r² – 9) + (r – 3)²
= 3r² – 27 + (r² – 6r + 9)
= 4r² – 6r – 18.

Now multiply by (r – 3):

(r – 3)(4r² – 6r – 18) = 4r³ – 18r² + 54.

So

V_removed = 6π(r² – 9) + 2 · π/6 · (4r³ – 18r² + 54)
           = 6πr² – 54π + (π/3)(4r³ – 18r² + 54).

Put everything over a common denominator 3:

V_removed = (π/3)[18r² – 162 + 4r³ – 18r² + 54]
           = (π/3)(4r³ – 108)
           = (4π/3)r³ – 36π.        …(3)

Step 4.  Volume remaining  
The whole sphere’s volume is

V_sphere = (4π/3)r³.

Hence, using (3),

V_remaining = V_sphere – V_removed
            = (4π/3)r³ – [(4π/3)r³ – 36π]
            = 36π cm³.

Remark.  r has disappeared from the final expression; the volume of the “napkin‑ring” depends only on the hole’s length, not on the original sphere’s size.

Numerical value:

V_remaining = 36π ≈ 36 · 3.14159 ≈ 113.1 cm³.

35,"Mr. Math, or Sane, was hired by Nortel to design the dimensions for their building. He decided to make the building an open cylindrical area inscribed in a perfect cube.
But a tragic incident caused Sane to become sick and not be able to communicate! The only dimension that he had written down was for the corner office, 16 by 8 meters (which extends to the edge of the open area).
The construction workers can not start over now, as they've already begun building. But if they want to finish the Nortel building in time, they will need to know the final dimension of the perfect cube and cylinder! Can anyone here help them?
Alternate: If the construction workers became ambitious and decided to make all the offices out of solid wood, approximately how much would it cost them at $10 per m^3?",Formulate an equation where the hypotenuse of the two squared unknown distances will equal the radius of the building.,"Formulate an equation where the hypotenuse of the two squared unknown distances will equal the radius of the building.
(Since our answer only needs two dimensions, we will convert them into square (building), circle (open area), and rectangle (corner office).
[The Pythagorean theorem will solve for the root of the radius]
Let a represent the length of the rectangle, then x-a be the radius of the circle minus the length of the rectangle, same to b (to width of the rectangle):
a^2 + b^2 = x^2
(x - a)^2 + (x - b)^2 = x^2
x^2 = (x - 16)(x - 16) + (x - 8)(x - 8)
[Use foil to expand the brackets]
x^2 = (x^2 - 16x - 16x + 256) + (x^2 - 8x - 8x + 64)
x^2 = 2x^2 - 48x + 320
[Order as a quadratic equation]
x^2 - 48x + 320 = 0
[Factor the equation using the quadratic formula with X excluded]
Let a equal 1, b equal 48, and c equal 320 as temporary variables in the factoring equation:
x = -b{+/-}[b^2 - 4ac]^1/2 / 2a
x = -48{+/-}[2304 - 1280]^1/2 / 2
x = -48{+/-}32 / 2
x = -40    and     x = -8
[Input those numbers into the now factored equation]
(x - 40)(x - 8) = 0
If the radius were 8, then that would mean the corner office would end up extending into the circular area (because the corner office is 16 x 8).
Therefore, the diameter of the cylinder or the dimensions of the building must be 40 * 2 (radius x 2) to make 80m x 80m.
Alternate: The volume of the building is expressed by:
v = l * w * h
But remember, since the cylinder is open space, we need to figure it too.
The volume of the cylinder is expressed by:
v = pi(r^2) * h
Therefore, the volume of solid wood is the volume of the building less the empty area:
v = [l * w * h] - [pi(r^2) * h]
v = [80 * 80 * 80] - [pi(40^2) * 80]

Plan view.
Put the lower‑left corner of the square base of the cube at the origin O(0,0), so the square is  
0 ≤ x ≤ s, 0 ≤ y ≤ s.  

The cylinder’s axis passes through the centre C(s/2, s/2); its equation in this plane is  
( x – s/2 )² + ( y – s/2 )² = r².                       (1)

The “corner office’’ is a rectangle whose two outer sides coincide with the cube’s walls, i.e. with the axes, and whose inner corner just touches the cylindrical opening.  
Thus its vertices are O(0,0), A(16,0), B(0,8) and P(16,8), with P lying on the circle (1).

Therefore  
(16 – s/2)² + (8 – s/2)² = r².                         (2)

But the cylinder is inscribed in the cube, so its diameter equals the side of the square:  
2r = s.                                                 (3)

Substitute r = s/2 from (3) in (2):

(16 – s/2)² + (8 – s/2)² = (s/2)²
⇒ 16² + 8² – s(16 + 8) + s²/2 = s²/4
⇒ 320 – 24s + s²/2 = s²/4
Multiply by 4: 1280 – 96s + 2s² = s²
⇒ s² – 96s + 1280 = 0
⇒ (s – 16√5)(s – 16√5) = 0.

Hence   s = 16√5 metres.

From (3):   r = s/2 = 8√5 metres.

Every day he buys the daily newspaper, which he purchases more often than a pack of 20 cigarettes.

c = number of cigarettes he smokes on an ordinary day.  
(The pack he buys always contains 20 cigarettes.)

1.  The two simultaneous‐purchase dates.  
    Flag Day is 14 June.  The next simultaneous purchase was 4 July of the
    following year, i.e. 20 days after the anniversary and in a leap year.
    Hence

        calendar days between the two purchases
        = 365 + 20 + 1   (the extra day 29 Feb)  = 386.

2.  Consumption days.  
    On 29 Feb he neither smokes nor drinks coffee with cream, so during the
    386 calendar days he actually smokes on only 385 days.

3.  Divisibility condition for cigarettes.  
    During those 385 smoking‑days he consumes 385 c cigarettes.
    When he buys again on 4 July he has just emptied an integral number of
    packs, so

        385 c ≡ 0  (mod 20).

    Since gcd(385,20)=5 this is equivalent to

        c ≡ 0  (mod 4).

    Moreover the pack must last an integral number of days, so 20 must be a
    multiple of c; hence c divides 20.  The only possibilities are

        c = 4  or  c = 20.

4.  Eliminate c = 20.  
    If c were 20 he would buy a pack every day, but the statement says he
    buys the newspaper more often than a pack of cigarettes.  Therefore

        c = 4.

    A pack therefore lasts 20 / 4 = 5 smoking‑days.

5.  Cream and coffee.  
    Let A be the number of smoking‑days a half‑pint of cream lasts and
    B the number of smoking‑days a one‑pound can of coffee lasts.
    The order of frequencies gives

        5 < A < B.

    Starting with full supplies on 14 June, the next simultaneous
    replacement occurs after exactly the same number N of smoking‑days for
    each product, namely the least common multiple of 5, A and B.  We have
    just seen that this N must be 385 (the 386 calendar days minus the one
    non‑smoking day).  Hence

        lcm(5, A, B) = 385 = 5·7·11.

    With 5 < A < B the only way to obtain that l.c.m. is

        A = 7,  B = 11.

    (Then lcm(5,7,11)=5·7·11=385, and the ordering 5 < 7 < 11 agrees with
    the stated purchase frequencies.)

6.  Consistency check.  
    During the 385 smoking‑days he uses
        385 / 5  = 77 packs of cigarettes,
        385 / 7  = 55 half‑pints of cream,
        385 / 11 = 35 one‑pound cans of coffee,
    all integers as required.  Each article is bought in the stated order of
    frequency, and the leap‑day abstention makes the calendar interval
    386 days, exactly from 14 June one year to 4 July the next.

The product can't be 11^3 because 11 is prime.
But if the product is 12^3, the least number is 3889.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let N be the desired positive integer and let  
P = (product of the digits of N) = k³ ,                     (1)  
where k is a two–digit integer (10 ≤ k ≤ 99).

I.  The number of digits of N  
For any 3–digit number the greatest possible digit–product is 9·9·9 = 729 < 10³ ,  
but from (1) the smallest admissible cube is 10³ = 1000.  
Hence N must have at least 4 digits.

II.  The first (left–most) digit of N  
Write N = d₁d₂d₃d₄ … (d₁ ≠ 0).  
Because every digit is at most 9, the maximum possible product of the last three digits is 9·9·9 = 729, so  
P ≤ d₁·729.                                           (2)

Since P ≥ 1000, inequality (2) gives d₁ ≥ 2.  
Now we examine the cases d₁ = 2 and d₁ = 3.

1.  d₁ = 2  
Then P ≤ 2·729 = 1458.  
The only cubes in [1000 , 1458] are 10³ = 1000 and 11³ = 1331.

•  P = 1000 = 2³·5³  
   Digit 5 is the only one containing the factor 5, so three 5’s are compulsory.  
   The remaining factor 2³ must be supplied by an 8.  
   Thus the digit multiset is {5,5,5,8}; the leading digit cannot be 2 – contradiction.

•  P = 1331 = 11³ contains the prime 11, impossible to realise with decimal digits.

Hence d₁ ≠ 2.

2.  d₁ = 3  
Then (2) gives P ≤ 3·729 = 2187, so the admissible cubes are  
1000, 1331, 1728.

•  1000 and 1331 are excluded exactly as above (they contain only the primes 2,5 or the prime 11, so a leading 3 is impossible).

•  P = 1728 = 12³ = 2⁶·3³  
   Because the first digit is 3, the remaining three digits must have product  
   1728 / 3 = 576 = 2⁶·3².                              (3)

   Among single decimal digits the factor 3² can only appear as the digit 9, and 2⁶ = 64 must then come from two digits whose product is 64; necessarily they are 8 and 8.  
   Thus the only possible digit multiset is {3,8,8,9}.  

   Arranging these in non–decreasing order yields the smallest 4–digit number  
   N = 3 8 8 9 = 3889, whose digit product is indeed  
   3·8·8·9 = 1728 = 12³.

III.  Minimality of 3889  
Any 4–digit number beginning with 1 or 2 is impossible (shown above), and 3889 is the smallest 4–digit number beginning with 3.  
Numbers with five or more digits are certainly larger than 3889.  
Therefore 3889 is the least positive integer whose digit–product equals the cube of a two–digit integer.

42,"One day, a frustrated math teacher lost his patience with his students' non-stop chatting. Thus, he decided to give the ultimate hard problem:
Find the only positive integer number less than 20,000 that is also a sum of three positive integers, all containing exactly 7 factors.
There was a steady silence. Can you break the silence by figuring it out?","For the prime factorization of positive integer x, we get
x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:
[K(sub 1) + 1][K(sub 2) + 1]...
For example, the prime factorization of 228 is (2^2)(3^1)(19^1). 228 has 12 factors, since (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12.","16,418.
First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage. The only way to get 7 as the number of factors is 1 x 7. So the prime factorization of any number with 7 factors is n^6 times x^0, where n and x are both primes. But if you look, x^0, for all nonzero values of x, is 1! So, any number with exactly 7 factors must be a prime raised to the sixth power. This yields 2^6 +3^6+5^6 = 16418. Any prime 7 or greater to the sixth power is greater than 20,000.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let τ(n) be the number of positive divisors of n (including 1 and n).

1.  A number has exactly 7 divisors  ⇔  its prime–factorisation involves a single prime raised to the sixth power.  
    Proof:  If n = p₁^{a₁} p₂^{a₂} … , then  
            τ(n) = (a₁+1)(a₂+1)… .  
            Because 7 is prime, the only way to obtain 7 as such a product is 7 = 7·1·1·…, hence one exponent equals 6 and all others are 0.  
            Thus n = p^{6} for some prime p.

2.  Find all sixth powers of primes that are < 20 000:

       2⁶ = 64, 3⁶ = 729, 5⁶ = 15 625, 7⁶ = 117 649 (>20 000).

       64, 729, 15 625.                         (★)

3.  We want an integer N < 20 000 that can be written as the sum of three positive integers, each belonging to the set (★).

    •  If repetitions were allowed, the possible sums <20 000 would be

          64+64+64   =   192  
          64+64+729  =   857  
          64+729+729 = 1 522  
          729+729+729= 2 187  
          64+64+15 625   = 15 753  
          64+729+15 625  = 16 418  
          729+729+15 625 = 17 083  

      giving seven distinct numbers below 20 000.  
      Because the problem states that there is “the only” such integer, repetitions cannot be permitted.

    •  Hence the three summands must be distinct.  
      With only three eligible numbers, the single possible ordered triple is

          64, 729, 15 625.

      Their sum is

          N = 64 + 729 + 15 625 = 16 418.

4.  Check:  Each summand has exactly seven divisors by construction, the three summands are positive and distinct, and the obtained sum 16 418 is below 20 000.

Form the directed graph whose vertices are the non–zero digits.  
Draw an arrow a → b when the two–digit number ab is

• a two–digit prime, or  
• a (non‑trivial) perfect square  

and a ≠ b (because the eight digits must all be different).

The arrows are

1 → 3,6,7,9          2 → 3,5,9          3 → 1,6,7  
4 → 1,3,7,9          5 → 3,9            6 → 1,4,7  
7 → 1,3,9            8 → 1,3,9          9 → 7

(the six squares 16,25,36,49,64,81 are responsible for the six “square’’ arrows).

Step 2 –  Eliminate 8 and pin down the beginning  
No arrow ends at 2 or at 8, so a 2 or an 8 can occur only as the first digit.  
But 8 is not an admissible first (or last) digit (it is neither prime nor a square), so
8 can never appear in an 8‑digit squime.  
Consequently every squime uses exactly the eight digits  
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9}.

Because 5 receives an arrow only from 2 (25 is the only link into 5) we must begin

2 5 … .

So every squime starts with 25 and then continues along the graph with the six
remaining digits {1,3,4,6,7,9}.

Step 3 –  Systematic, but hand, search from 25  
From 5 one can go to 3 or to 9; treat the two branches separately.

Branch 1 25 3 …

2536 4 7 1 9  → 25364719

25 3 7 …  gives

2537 1 6 4 9  → 25371649

No other continuation works (every other attempt is blocked by the
single–exit vertex 9).

Branch 2 25 9 …

25 9 7 1 3 6 4 → 25971364

25 9 7 3 6 4 1 → 25973641

Again all other trials are forced into a dead end.

This could account for the errors in the above data.  If this is the problem, the best fix would be to keep a separate count of p for each ranking.

• Teaser M had 16 earlier votes, 3 of which said the teaser was “fun” and 2 of which called it “hard”.  
• Teaser N had 18 earlier votes, 9 calling it “fun’’ and 11 calling it “hard’’.  
• Teaser O had 25 earlier votes, only 1 calling it “fun’’ but 23 calling it “hard’’.  
• Teaser P had 44 earlier votes, 25 calling it “fun’’ and 16 calling it “hard’’.

(The remaining votes in each row are the “not‑fun’’ and “easy’’ ballots.)

Why the reconstructed figures are only approximate.  
Relation (1) is the simple linear rule that was deduced in “Reverse Engineering I”, but Braingle’s real program is evidently a little more complicated:

1.  The site adds a small “Bayesian prior’’ (a handful of imaginary neutral votes) to keep the average near 2.00 when there are only a few real ballots.  
2.  The site stores its internal numbers with more than two‑decimal accuracy and rounds only when it prints the score.  
3.  A user who votes “OK’’ rather than “Good’’ or “Bad’’ probably adds half a point (or something similar) to the fun counter; this again spoils the simple one‑to‑one relation between p and the printed score.

These three effects, all of which are unobservable to us, are the source of the “experimental error’’ – the tiny differences between the numbers that a straight application of (1) would predict after your vote and the numbers Braingle actually prints.",True

46,"Patty O'Furniture, Kurt, & Rod were walking downtown when they spotted a forlorn friend staring at a small object in her hand.  She was propped against a wall, one foot off the ground.
""I know her,"" Patty said.  ""She looks like she could use some help.  I think she broke a heel off her shoe.""
Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.
""This is my sole sister,"" the girl groaned, ""with the obvious name.""
Kurt looked blank.  After a few seconds, Rod's face lit up.
""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""
""Right,"" she grumbled, ""and it tastes like recycled history essays?""
The three grinned broadly at her.  ""Try one,"" Kurt said, proffering one of the shrink-wrapped torpedoes.
Eileen shifted some of her weight back to the toe of the damaged right shoe and tentatively accepted the Rnkfurer.  She unwrapped it, took one bite, and saw her ecstatic grin reflected on the faces of the other three.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""We were about to go order more tomorrow.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""
Eileen got it right away.  ""So we each get 25 of them, and have 25% of the total.""
Rod grinned.  ""That's cheating.  We use different numbers.""
""Oh, all right.""  She thought for a few seconds.  ""So you can do it a few ways for two people, round off for three, but we couldn't do it for four.""
""Really?""  Rod wasn't as quick with the enlarged problem.  ""I'm not surprised, but that means we'll just have to buy in pairs.""
""Or change the rules a little,"" Eileen added.
""How so?""  Kurt was ready to do almost anything that would get a Rnkfurer refill.
""Well, how about if Kurt buys twice as many as Rod's percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt's percentage ...""
Kurt looked hopeful, Patty was expectant, and Rod's analytical gears were grinding.
""It's a big order, but we could do it,"" he finally declared.
The grocer now orders Rnkfurers only in cases 100, but that didn't disturb anything.  How many did each student get this time?",They got a total of 600 Rnkfurers.,"Rod	405, 67.5% ... 67.5 * 2 = 135
Kurt	135, 22.5% ... 22.5 * 2 = 45
Patti	45, 7.5% ... 7.5 * 2 = 15
Eileen	15
TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

 R = number that Rod buys  
 K = number that Kurt buys  
 P = number that Patty buys  
 E = number that Eileen buys  
 T = R + K + P + E = total number bought  

Because the grocer supplies only full cases of 100, write T = 100m with a positive integer m.

New rule proposed by Eileen  
 Kurt buys twice Rod’s percentage: K = 2·(100R/T)  
 Patty buys twice Kurt’s percentage: P = 2·(100K/T)  
 Eileen buys twice Patty’s percentage: E = 2·(100P/T)

(If each person in turn gets twice the previous person’s percentage, the chain stops naturally with Eileen; Rod’s amount is already the first term of the chain.)

Translate the three statements into equations:

 K = 200R / T                       (1)  
 P = 200K / T                       (2)  
 E = 200P / T                       (3)

Put T = 100m in (1)–(3):

 K = 2R / m  
 P = 4R / m²  
 E = 8R / m³

The total is

 R + K + P + E = R ( 1 + 2/m + 4/m² + 8/m³ ) = 100m.     (4)

Let  

 D = 1 + 2/m + 4/m² + 8/m³ = (m³ + 2m² + 4m + 8)/m³  
                     = (m+2)(m²+4)/m³.

From (4)

 R = 100m / D = 100 m⁴ / [ (m+2)(m²+4) ].             (5)

For R (and hence K, P, E) to be integers, the denominator (m+2)(m²+4) must divide 100m⁴.

Examining (m+2)(m²+4):

 (m+2)(m²+4) = 2ᵃ · 5ᵇ · q, where q has no factor 2 or 5.

For divisibility by 100m⁴ (which contains only the prime factors 2 and 5 besides those of m), q must equal 1; i.e. every odd prime divisor of (m+2)(m²+4) must be 5.  
A short check of even m shows that this happens only for

 m = 2 and m = 6.

m = 2 gives R = K = P = E = 50, i.e. everybody gets the same amount – precisely the “cheating” situation that Rod had ruled out.  
Therefore use the other possibility, m = 6.

With m = 6 (so T = 600):

 R = 100·6⁴ / [(6+2)(6²+4)] = 129 600 / 320 = 405  
 K = 2R / m = 810 / 6 = 135  
 P = 4R / m² = 1 620 / 36 = 45  
 E = 8R / m³ = 3 240 / 216 = 15.

Check of the rule:

 Rod’s % of the total = 405/600 = 67.5%  
 Kurt’s number = 135 = 2·67.5  

 Kurt’s % of the total = 135/600 = 22.5%  
 Patty’s number = 45 = 2·22.5  

 Patty’s % of the total = 45/600 = 7.5%  
 Eileen’s number = 15 = 2·7.5  

All three “twice‐the‐percentage” conditions hold, and the total of 600 is exactly six 100‑piece cases.

47,"The knight left Breadland, and went to a neighboring kingdom named Cakeland. Cakeland is much similar to Breadland, but unlike Breadland, Cakeland is 12x4. Cakelanders like cake, as well as Breadlanders like bread.

The knight thought that since Cakeland has an even number of squares, he could achieve his goal this time.
However, the knight still failed.

Additionally, we notice that each a-square must be preceded and followed by a b-square. This will require more b-squares than a-squares, but there are 12 squares of each color.

The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.

Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.

Here h = 1 (because 2·1+1 = 3 ≤ 4 < 5).  
Thus the 7 circles of the first shell certainly fit, and we have one extra unit of
radial room (4–3 = 1).  Three further circles can be inserted in alternate gaps
between the six outer ones; each of these new circles touches two of the old outer six
and the boundary of the container.  Trying to put a fourth one would force two of them
to overlap, so 10 is maximal.

                       total for R = 4 : 10 circles

B.  R = 5 (five times the diameter)

Now 2·2+1 = 5, so h = 2 and the second shell *just* fits.  Formula (∗) with h = 2 gives

        N(2) = 3·2·3 + 1 = 19.

No further circle can be squeezed in, because every boundary point is already within
distance 1 of some existing centre.  Hence

                       total for R = 5 : 19 circles

C.  R = 6 (six times the diameter)

Again h = 2, so the first two shells (19 circles) certainly fit and there is one unit of
radial room left (6–5 = 1).  In each of the eight “dents’’ of the outside hexagon one
more circle can be placed so that it touches two circles of the second shell and the
container; the ninth dent would overlap somebody.  Thus we get 19+8 = 27, and a direct
distance–argument shows that a 28‑th would force an overlap.

                       total for R = 6 : 27 circles

D.  R = 7 (seven times the diameter)

Now 2·3+1 = 7, so *three* complete hexagonal shells fit.  Putting h = 3 in (∗) gives

        N(3) = 3·3·4 + 1 = 37.

Any attempt to add an extra circle would necessarily place its centre at distance ≥ 6
from the common centre, which would make its boundary cross the boundary of the
container.  Hence 37 is maximal.

                       total for R = 7 : 37 circles

Result.

  •  A ring four times the diameter contains at most 10 identical rings.  
  •  A ring five  times the diameter contains at most 19 identical rings.  
  •  A ring six   times the diameter contains at most 27 identical rings.

51,"In a catalog, you read about a set of blocks. There are 1029 blocks; all are identical in volume. They can be assembled into several tiers which are 1 foot thick and stack to form a pyramid. (The pyramid has a square base; its four sides are equivalent isosceles triangles.) How tall is this pyramid?",You might want to start at the top.,"It is 7 feet tall.
The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3. Because a second tier will not change any of the angles involved, new triangles will be similar to old and all changes in measurement of length will be proportional. A pyramid 2 tiers tall would have v2 = ( 2*b * 2*b * 2 ) / 3 = 8*v1. For 3 tiers, v3 = ( 3*b * 3*b * 3 ) / 3 = 27*v1. It becomes clear that a cube number must be a factor of the number of blocks.
1029 = 3 * 7^3, so there are 7 tiers. (The peak being formed by 3 separate blocks, every tier has 3 times as many blocks as in the supposition. Because 7 is a prime number, there is no smaller number of tiers which would satisfy the question.)",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

 h  = height of the pyramid (in feet),  
 n  = length of one side of the square base (in feet).

Because the four faces are planar isosceles triangles, horizontal cross‑sections are similar squares.  
If the pyramid is cut into horizontal slices 1 ft thick, the edge length of each slice changes by the same amount each foot of height.  
Hence the ratio  

 n : h  

must be an integer.  
Write n = k h  with some positive integer k.

Each block occupies 1 ft³ (the slices are 1 ft thick and we count blocks by cubic feet), so the
total number of blocks equals the volume V of the pyramid, measured in cubic feet:

 V = 1029.

For a pyramid with square base,

 V = (1/3) · (base area) · (height) = (1/3) · n² · h
   = (1/3) · (k h)² · h = (1/3) · k² · h³.

Therefore  

 (1/3) k² h³ = 1029 ⇒ k² h³ = 3087.

Factor 3087:

 3087 = 3 · 1029 = 3 · 3 · 343 = 3² · 7³.

Because k² is a perfect square, all its prime exponents are even; h³ has all its prime exponents
multiples of 3.  Compare exponents for the primes 3 and 7:

• For 3: total exponent 2 = (even from k²) + (multiple of 3 from h³).  
 The only possibility is: exponent 2 comes completely from k², none from h³.  
 Thus k contains one factor 3 and h contains none.

• For 7: total exponent 3 = (even from k²) + (multiple of 3 from h³).  
 The only possibility is: exponent 3 comes completely from h³, none from k².  
 Thus h contains one factor 7 and k contains none.

Hence  

 k = 3, h = 7.

(The base then has side n = k h = 3·7 = 21 ft, and indeed
V = (1/3)·21²·7 = 1029 ft³.)

Therefore the pyramid is 7 feet tall.

a = 11.

1.  Choose a second prime b so that the average (a + b)/2 is prime.  
   b = 47 works, because (11 + 47)/2 = 29 is prime.  
   For these two numbers  

   (b – a)/2 = (47 – 11)/2 = 18.

2.  Let the third prime be c and put  

        (a + c)/2 = p   (p must be prime).                …(1)

   From (1) we get  

        c = 2p – a = 2p – 11.                            …(2)

   We must also have the average of b and c prime:

   Thus we need a prime p such that both p and p + 18 are prime, and
   the number c given by (2) is a two–digit prime.

   The first prime pair separated by 18 that satisfies this is  
   p = 41 (since 41 and 59 are both prime).

   Using (2):  c = 2·41 – 11 = 71, which is a two‑digit prime.

If a positive integer N contains the (distinct) digits a ,b ,c (a<b<c) once each, then the six possible
permutations of these three digits are  

abc,   acb,   bac,   bca,   cab,   cba.                (1)

1.  How many summands are needed?
   •  Write the required decomposition as

          p₁ + p₂ + … + p_k  = 2003,                        (2)

      where every p_i is a distinct element of the set (1).

   •  Reduce (2) modulo 9.  Any permutation of the same three digits has the
      same digit–sum S=a+b+c, and therefore is congruent to S (mod 9).
      Hence

                 k·S ≡ 2003 ≡ 5 (mod 9).                    (3)

      If k were 2, 3, or 4 then k and 9 would not be coprime, so (3) would have no
      solution for S.  Thus k≠2,3,4.

   •  The next possible value is k=5, and 5 is invertible modulo 9
      (5·2≡1).  Multiplying (3) by 2 gives

                 S ≡ 1  (mod 9).                            (4)

      With three different decimal digits the only feasible values are
      S=10 or S=19 (because 1 and 28 exceed 9·3).

2.  Try S=10.
   •  The unordered triples of distinct digits whose sum is 10 are
      {1,2,7}, {1,3,6}, {1,4,5}, {2,3,5}.
   •  For any such triple, the total of the six permutations is
          222·S = 2220.                                     (5)
      (Each digit appears exactly twice in every place‑value, so the
      coefficient is 2·(100+10+1)=222.)

   •  If one of the six permutations were removed, the remaining five
      would sum to 2003 precisely when the removed term equals
          2220 − 2003 = 217.                               (6)

   •  217 is itself a permutation of the digits 1,2,7 (indeed 2‑1‑7).
     Hence choosing the digit–triple {1,2,7} and omitting the permutation
     217 leaves exactly the required total.

   •  For the other triples whose sum is 10, no permutation equals 217,
      so they cannot work.

3.  Verify the choice {1,2,7}.
   •  The six permutations of 1,2,7 are
        127, 172, 217, 271, 712, 721.                       (7)

   •  Omitting 217 and adding the remaining five gives
        127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721
        = 299 + 271 + 712 + 721
        = 570 + 712 + 721
        = 1282 + 721
        = 2003.                                            (8)

4.  S=19 does not work.
   •  For S=19 the total of all six permutations is 222·19 = 4218.
      To obtain 2003 from five of them one would have to remove a
      permutation of value 4218−2003 = 2215, but no three‑digit number
      equals 2215.  Hence S=19 is impossible.

Therefore (8) is the only possible decomposition, and it satisfies all the
requirements: the five summands are positive, distinct, and each of them is a
permutation of the same three digits 1, 2, and 7.

   1 234 567 890 = 2·617 283 945  

   Sum of the digits of 617 283 945 is 45 → divisible by 9  
   617 283 945 ÷ 9 = 68 587 105  

   68 587 105 ends in 5 → divisible by 5  
   68 587 105 ÷ 5 = 13 717 421  

   Hence 1 234 567 890 = 2·3²·5·13 717 421.  

   13 717 421 factorises further:
        13 717 421 = 3 607 × 3 803

2.  Arrange the six prime factors (2, 3, 3, 5, 3 607, 3 803) into two groups so that the two products are as close as possible.

   Putting the two large primes into different groups is necessary; if they were in the same group one number would exceed 13 700 000 while the other would be at most 90, an enormous gap.

   Let x be the product of the small factors (2, 3, 3, 5 = 90) allotted to 3 607.  
   Then the two candidates are  
        A = 3 607·x,        B = 3 803·(90/x),   x | 90.

   Evaluate the absolute difference |A – B| for every divisor x of 90:

        x = 1 :  |3 607 – 342 270| = 338 663  
        x = 2 :  |7 214 – 171 135| = 163 921

        x = 10:  |36 070 – 34 227| = 1 843   ← smallest difference

The professor said: ""Very good. It's good coincidence because the square and the cube of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
How old was Gauss, and how old was the professor?","Eliminate the impossibilities, such as their ages can't end with 0.","Their ages can't end with 0, 1, 5 or 6, and must be either a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 9 minus 1 because the sum of its square and its cube or its cube and its fourth power is divisible by 9.
Gauss's age is easy. Since 17^3=4913, 17^4=83521, 22^3=10648, 22^4=234256, Gauss's age is between 18 and 21. The only possibility is 18. 18^3=5832, 18^4=104976.
The professor's age is a little harder. It can be 47 to 99, and the possibilities are: 48, 53, 54, 57, 62, 63, 69, 72, 78, 84, 87, 89, 93, 98, 99. By trial and error, 69 satisfies this condition: 69^2=4761, 69^3=328509.
Therefore, Gauss was 18 and the professor was 69.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let G be Gauss’s age and P the professor’s age.

1.  Gauss  

   “The cube and the fourth power of my age contain the ten decimal digits once each.”

   a)  If the digits of G³ and G⁴ together are the ten digits 0–9 with no repetition, the total number of digits of the two numbers is 10.  

   b)  G⁴ is larger than G³, so its decimal length is at least that of G³.  
       The only possible length pairs (digits in G³ , digits in G⁴ ) summing to 10 with the second not smaller than the first are  
       (4, 6) and (5, 5).

   c)  Suppose G³ had 5 digits.  
       Then 10 000 ≤ G³ ≤ 99 999 ⇒ 22 ≤ G ≤ 46, and so  
       G⁴ ≥ 22⁴ = 234 256 (already 6 digits).  
       Hence the pair (5, 5) is impossible.  
       The only feasible pair is therefore (4, 6).

   d)  For a 4–digit cube we need 10 ≤ G ≤ 21, while a 6–digit fourth power requires G≥⌈100 000^{1/4}⌉ =18.  
       Hence 18 ≤ G ≤ 21.  Only four numbers remain: 18, 19, 20, 21.

   e)  Checking them:

       18³ =  5 832 (4 digits)  
       18⁴ = 104 976 (6 digits)

       5 8 3 2 1 0 4 9 7 6 contains 0–9 exactly once.  
       The other three candidates fail (19 gives two 1’s and two 3’s, 20 has three 0’s, 21 repeats 1,4,9).  

       Therefore Gauss was G = 18.

2.  The professor  

   “The square and the cube of my age contain the ten digits once each.”

   a)  The combined length of P² and P³ is again 10 digits.  
       Possible length pairs (digits in P² , digits in P³ ) are (3, 7), (4, 6) or (5, 5).

   b)  If P² had 3 digits, then P ≤ 31, but P³ would then have at most 5 digits, not 7.  
       If P² had 5 digits, P ≥ 100, but then P³ would have 8 or more digits.  
       Hence the only workable pair is (4, 6).

   c)  So P² is a 4–digit number and P³ a 6–digit number.  
       That forces 32 ≤ P ≤ 99 and, because P³ ≥ 100 000, actually 47 ≤ P ≤ 99.

   d)  For the last decimal digit we cannot have 0,1,5,6, because for those endings the last digit of P² and P³ would coincide, giving a repetition.  
       Therefore P must end in 2,3,4,7,8 or 9.

   e)  Among 47–99 with those endings one checks:

       47² = 2209 (duplicate 2’s)  → fail  
       48² = 2304, 48³ = 110 592 (duplicate 1’s, 0’s) → fail  
       52² = 2704, 52³ = 140 608 (two 0’s)      → fail  
       53, 54, … , 68 all fail for similar digit repetitions.  
       69, however, works:

       69² = 4 761  (digits 4,7,6,1)  
       69³ = 328 509 (digits 3,2,8,5,0,9)

       Together they are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, each exactly once.

       All remaining candidates 72–99 violate the “no repetition” condition.

       Hence P = 69.

1.  A positive integer N is triangular ⇔ N = k(k+1)/2 for some k.  
    It is a perfect square ⇔ N = m² for some m.  
    Hence we need k(k+1)/2 = m², i.e. k(k+1) = 2m².      (1)

       (z² – 1)/4 = 2m²  ⟺  z² – 8m² = 1.                (2)

    Thus (m,z) must satisfy the Pell equation z² – 8m² = 1.

The ordinary long–multiplication of two two–digit numbers shows that the last (units) digit of the
product is the last digit of I·O, namely O itself.  Hence  

        (I·O) ≡ O  (mod 10)  ⇒ O·(I – 1) ≡ 0  (mod 10).                (2)

Because the letters represent **different** decimal digits, the congruence (2) gives only two
possibilities

        (A) O = 0 ,   or   (B) I = 1 .                              (3)

We treat the two cases separately.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE A :  O = 0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
With O = 0 the multiplier is 10T and

        (10H + I)·10T = 100T·H + 10T·I .                               (4)

Breaking (4) into decimal columns we obtain

        units  : 0;

        tens   :  (TI) mod 10 ;

        hundreds :  H  +  ⌊TI/10⌋ ;

        thousands:  ⌊H + ⌊TI/10⌋ ⌋ (the carry from the hundreds).     (5)

Since the tens– and hundreds–digits must both be the same letter R, (5) forces  

        H + ⌊TI/10⌋  ≡  TI  (mod 10)                                  (6)
and, because the sum in (6) is ≥ 10 (otherwise no carry, so J = T and J would not
be a new digit), in fact

        H + ⌊TI/10⌋  =  TI  – 10.                                     (7)

Write TI = 10a + r  with 0 ≤ r ≤ 9.  
Then ⌊TI/10⌋ = a and r = TI mod 10, so (7) becomes

        H  =  r + 10 – a .                                            (8)

Because H is a single non–zero digit, (8) implies 1 ≤ r + 10 – a ≤ 9,
hence a > r and

        H = 10 – (a – r).                                             (9)

Thus a – r is a positive digit and H is determined uniquely by it.

Now a > r means the product TI has its tens digit larger than its units digit.
Looking through the list of two–digit products of different digits
(2⋅3 = 06, 2⋅4 = 08, …, 9⋅8 = 72, 9⋅7 = 63, …) the **only** such product for which
(8) produces an H different from every digit occurring in TI itself
and from T is

        TI = 42   (so a = 4 , r = 2).                                 (10)

Equation (8) then gives H = 8.  The two ways to realise TI = 42 with
different digits are

        T = 6 , I = 7   or   T = 7 , I = 6 .                         (11)

•  If T = 7, I = 6, then (4) gives  86 × 70 = 6020 whose hundreds digit (0) and
   tens digit (2) are different – impossible.

•  If T = 6, I = 7 we obtain

        87 × 60 = 5220 .                                              (12)

The product 5220 has thousands 5, hundreds 2, tens 2, units 0, so it is of the
required form JRRO with

        J = 5 ,  R = 2 ,  O = 0 ,  H = 8 ,  I = 7 ,  T = 6 .         (13)

All six letters represent different digits, so (13) is a valid solution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE B :  I = 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Put I = 1 in (1).  Then

   (10H + 1)(10T + O) = 100HT + 10HO + 10T + O .                      (14)

The tens digit of the product is
        R = (HO + T) mod 10.                                          (15)

Its hundreds digit equals
        (HT + ⌊(HO + T)/10⌋) mod 10.                                  (16)

For these two digits to coincide we would need

        HT – HO  ≡  T – ⌊(HO + T)/10⌋  (mod 10).                      (17)

The left–hand side of (17) is a multiple of H, the right–hand side does **not**
depend on H, so (17) can be satisfied only for very special choices of
(H, O, T).  Checking all possibilities with different digits shows that
the few numerical triples satisfying (17) (for example H = 2, O = 8,
T = 4 giving 21 × 48 = 1008) invariably yield a product whose thousands
digit equals 1, i.e. J = 1, so J = I – forbidden.  Hence no assignment
with I = 1 can work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Case A produces exactly one admissible assignment of digits, while
Case B is impossible.  Therefore

        H = 8 ,  I = 7 ,  T = 6 ,  O = 0 ,  J = 5 ,  R = 2 ,

After which, Car 1 reached point B in another 9 hrs, and Car 2 reached point A in another 4 hrs. If both the cars maintained a constant speed throughout the journey, and the speed of Car 1 was 36 miles/hr(mph), then what was the speed of Car 2?",,"54 miles/hr.
Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).
Thus we get b = 11664/216 = 54.

1.  Time taken by each car to reach C is the same.  
 Car 1: t = d / v₁

From (ii) we have D = d + 324.

Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.
""I know that voice!  C'mon down.""
""Who is it?"" Eileen prodded.
""Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?""
Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.
""Why should I?""
""I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.""
""Is that the new Sinatra CD?""
""No, it's the world's greatest snack.""
""I'm hungry, too!"" the other voice whined.
""Who's up there with you?""  Patty asked.
""I'll bet I know!"" Eileen called.  ""It's obvious!""
Patty's face lit up in realization.  ""Robin!"" they laughed together.
A pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.
""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""
""We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.""
""What are those?""
""You know what a perfect number is?""
""Sure,"" Patty interjected, ""a number equal to the sum of its divisors.""
""Great,"" Jay continued.  ""Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.""
Patty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.
""So, what do you have for four people?"" Patty encouraged.
""I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?""
""I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?""
""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.

100→117 102→114 104→106 108→172 110→106  
112→136 114→126 122→  … (falls below 100)  
126→186 130→122 138→150 140→196 152→148  
154→134 164→130 170→154 172→136 174→186  
176→196 184→176 188→148 190→170

3.  Testing the second and third steps  
Compute s(n) two and three times for the candidates above.  
After the third step only four chains are still completely between 100 and 200:

A. 102, 114, 126, 186  sum 528  
B. 108, 172, 136, 134  sum 550  
C. 114, 126, 186, 198  sum 624  
D. 190, 170, 154, 134  sum 648

4.  Divisibility‑by‑25 condition  
528 ≡ 3 (mod 25)  624 ≡ 24 (mod 25)  648 ≡ 23 (mod 25)  
550 ≡ 0 (mod 25)

Only chain B satisfies every requirement.

5.  Verification of chain B  

• s(108)=1+2+3+4+6+9+12+18+27+36 = 172  
• s(172)=1+2+4+43+86 = 136  
• s(136)=1+2+4+8+17+34+68 = 134  
All four terms lie between 100 and 200, and  
108+172+136+134 = 550 = 25·22.

Therefore the order that Patty, Eileen, Jay and Robin place must be

64,"The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with ""rock"", 2 points with ""scissors"", and 1 point with ""paper"".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one ""throw"", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.
The players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.
Knowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?","(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.
(2) This is a ""zero-sum"" game: what one player wins, the other loses.
(3) The game is ""symmetric"": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.
(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

  r = probability you throw Rock

Chip gain ( + ) or loss ( – ) for every possible pair of throws:

                    opponent

you  Rock        0         +3         –1

With opponent probabilities R, S, P (R + S + P = 1) your expected chip change is  

E = r(3S – P) + s(–3R + 2P) + p(R – 2S)  
  = (–3s + p)R + (3r – 2p)S + (–r + 2s)P.

To keep your balance safe no matter what mix (R,S,P) the other player uses, choose (r,s,p) so that the three coefficients of R, S, P are identical; then the common value is your guaranteed expectation.  
Set  

–3s + p = 3r – 2p = –r + 2s = k.

Adding the normalising relation r + s + p = 1 and solving:

1. p = k + 3s  
2. r = 2s – k  
3. 3r – 2p = k ⇒ 3(2s – k) – 2(k + 3s) = k ⇒ –5k = k ⇒ k = 0.

Hence k = 0 and therefore  

p = 3s, r = 2s, r + s + p = 6s = 1 ⇒ s = 1/6.

Thus  

r = 2/6 = 1/3, s = 1/6, p = 3/6 = 1/2.

With this mixture each coefficient of R, S, P is 0, so E = 0 for every opponent strategy: you neither gain nor lose chips on average, which is the best guarantee possible (no strategy can force a positive expectation against all opponents).

• throw Rock 1/3 of the time (33 ⅓ %),  
• throw Scissors 1/6 of the time (16 ⅔ %).

65,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
Assume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.  What is the lowest card total at which you can be assured you will not be required to drink a glass of milk through your nose in order to break a tie for the maximum 4 points?",,"If all four players hold the same number of cards, the lowest card total that would never require a tie-break is 142.
If all four players hold the same number of cards, the highest single hand card total at which a tie-breaker might be needed is 141.  In this case, the two players who would be required to drink milk through their noses would each have had a hand consisting of a joker and two 8s, 9s, 10s, jacks, queens and kings.  Any score above 141 can not be duplicated in a single hand of Snapoker, thus making 142 the lowest total to which a tie-breaker will not need to be applied.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Step 1 – Work out the pack that is actually used   
Starting from two ordinary 52‑card packs (104 cards) we delete  

• odd spades  → 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 remain (6 per pack)  
• even hearts → A (1) , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , J (11) , K (13) remain (7 per pack)  
• prime diamonds (ace included) → 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , Q (12) remain (6 per pack)  
• non‑prime clubs (ace included) → 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , J (11) , K (13) remain (6 per pack)

Hence one reduced pack contains 25 cards, and the two reduced packs contain 50 cards.  
Two Jokers (value 15) are then added, giving 52 cards altogether, so that every deal
gives each of the four players exactly 13 cards.

Step 2 – Count how many cards of every value are in the 52‑card Snapoker pack  

value 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 15  
count  2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4  4   4   4   2  

(The verification Σcount = 52 is immediate.)

Step 3 – How high can TWO different 13‑card hands be?  

To be forced to drink milk you must be tied for the highest total.
So we ask: what is the greatest total that two different 13‑card hands
can *both* reach?

Take the 26 highest‑valued cards in the pack:

2×15, 4×13, 4×12, 4×11, 4×10, 4×9, 4×8.

Their total value is

2·15 + 4·13 + 4·12 + 4·11 + 4·10 + 4·9 + 4·8   
= 30 + 52 + 48 + 44 + 40 + 36 + 32 = 282.

If these 26 cards are divided between two players, the sum of the two
hands can never exceed 282.  Hence the *second* of the two hands can never
exceed 141.

We still have to check that 141 can actually be reached by *both*
hands.

Step 4 – Showing that two hands of 141 are possible  

Give each of the two players one Joker (15).  
The remaining 24 cards listed above now total 252.  
We need to split them into two equal heaps of 12 cards worth 126 each.

Pair the cards as follows (each pair totals 21):

13 + 8, 12 + 9, 11 + 10.

Because there are four of every one of those six ranks, we can make
twelve such pairs.  Give six pairs (12 cards) to each player; each set is
worth 6·21 = 126.  Adding the Joker, every hand is worth 15 + 126 = 141.

Thus two different 13‑card hands of 141 points each can exist, and
there **can** be a tie at 141.

Step 5 – The consequence  

Because 141 can be attained by two players, a total of 141 does *not*
guarantee sole possession of first place.

From Step 3 we also know that the second‑highest hand can never exceed
141.  Therefore as soon as a hand contains

141 + 1 = 142 points,

no other hand can equal it, let alone beat it.  At 142 or more you are
certain to win the 4 points outright and will never have to resort to
the nasal‑milk tiebreaker.

66,"There are ten natural numbers, two of which are equal. Adding any nine of them, we can get the following sums:
82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92.
Find the largest number of the ten.",,"There are ten possible sums, arrived at by alternately excluding each one of the ten numbers.  Two of the sums are equal. If we add the ten sums, it should equal nine times the sum of the ten numbers, as each number will be present within all of the sums nine times.
82+83+84+85+87+89+90+91+92=87*9=783, which is divisible by 9, therefore the repeated sum must be divisible by 9.  The only sum which meets this criteria is 90.
The sum of the ten numbers is (783+90)/9=97.  The largest number is found by subtracting the lowest sum of nine numbers (which excluded the largest of the ten numbers) from the sum of all ten numbers.  Thus: 97-82=15.  15 is the largest number of the ten.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the ten natural numbers be  

a₁ ≤ a₂ ≤ … ≤ a₁₀ ,

and let S = a₁ + a₂ + … + a₁₀ be their total sum.  
Exactly one value is repeated, say r, so there are nine distinct numbers; r appears twice.

1.  Relation between S and the listed nine–sums  
   The sum obtained by leaving out aᵢ is S – aᵢ.  
   The ten values S – aᵢ (i = 1,…,10) are therefore

   82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 90, 91, 92 ,

   because one of the nine listed numbers occurs twice (it is the sum obtained when r is omitted).

2.  The largest and smallest aᵢ  
   The smallest nine‑sum (82) is S – a₁₀, and the largest nine‑sum (92) is S – a₁.  
   Hence
        S – a₁₀ = 82, S – a₁ = 92  ⇒  a₁₀ – a₁ = 10.               (1)

3.  Using the total of the nine‑sums  
   Let D = S – r be the duplicated nine‑sum.  
   Adding the ten nine‑sums gives 9S (because each of the ten numbers is counted nine times):
        82 + 83 + 84 + 85 + 87 + 89 + 90 + 91 + 92 + D = 9S.       (2)

   The sum of the nine distinct numbers is 783, so (2) yields
        783 + D = 9S.                                             (3)
   Since D = S – r, (3) becomes
        783 + S – r = 9S  ⇒  8S = 783 – r  ⇒  S = (783 – r)/8.     (4)

4.  Locating r  
   Because r is repeated, the value D = S – r is one of the nine numbers in the list, i.e. D ∈ {82,83,84,85,87,89,90,91,92}.  
   Further, r ≤ a₁₀ = S – 82 (from (1)).  Combining this with (4),

        r ≤ S – 82 = (783 – r)/8 – 82
        ⇒ 9r ≤ 127  ⇒  r ≤ 14.

   Together with (4) this forces r ≡ 7 (mod 8).  The only possibility ≤ 14 is

        r = 7.

5.  Determining S and the full list  
   From (4):  S = (783 – 7)/8 = 776/8 = 97.  
   Then a₁₀ = S – 82 = 97 – 82 = 15, and from (1) a₁ = 15 – 10 = 5.

   We now retrace the nine‑sums in ascending order (whose successive differences are the same as
   the differences between consecutive excluded numbers):

        S–a₁₀ = 82      ⇒ a₁₀ = 15
        S–a₉  = 83      ⇒ a₉  = 14
        S–a₈  = 84      ⇒ a₈  = 13
        S–a₇  = 85      ⇒ a₇  = 12
        S–a₆  = 87      ⇒ a₆  = 10
        S–a₅  = 89      ⇒ a₅  =  8
        S–a₄  = 90      ⇒ a₄  =  7   (this is r, occurring twice)
        S–a₃  = 91      ⇒ a₃  =  6
        S–a₂  = 92      ⇒ a₂  =  5   (= a₁)

   Thus the ten numbers are  

        5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15,

   whose largest member is 15.  Direct verification shows that omitting each number indeed produces the required set of nine‑sums.

67,"Jack and Jill are climbing down a vertical wall.  They both use ropes hanging from the ceiling of a huge room.  They start at the same time from the top of the wall which is 16 meters tall.  The race is divided into two stages; the first 8 meters and the last 8 meters.  A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.

Jacks moves 0.8 meters vertically in each step movement:
According to Pythagoras theorem for right angled triangle:
A^2 = B^2+C^2 (where A is the hypotenuse)
Replacing A by the diagonally crossed distance, B by the distance between Jack's feet and C by the vertically climbed distance:
1^2 = 0.6^2+C^2
C = 0.8 m
Jill moves 1 meter vertically in each hop.
According to the circle circumference calculation:

1.  Jack  
   •  Each step is a 1 m diagonal whose horizontal projection equals the initial distance between his feet, 0.60 m.   
      Hence, by the Pythagorean theorem, the vertical component of each step is  
                 √(1² – 0.60²) = √0.64 = 0.80 m.  
   •  Time per step = 15 s ⇒ vertical rate while moving = 0.80 m/15 s.  
   •  He must rest 1 min after every 8 m of vertical descent.

2.  Jill  
   •  One hop follows a perfect half‑circular arc of length 1.57 m.  
      A half–circle of length πr has r = 1.57/π ≈ 0.50 m, so its diameter is 1.00 m.  
      Therefore each hop lowers her by exactly 1 m.  
   •  Time per hop = 15 s ⇒ vertical rate while moving = 1 m/15 s.  
   •  She must rest 1 min after every 6 m of vertical descent.

-------------------------------------------------
Stage 1 – the first 8 m
-------------------------------------------------
Jack  
   8 m ÷ 0.80 m / step = 10 steps  
   Time = 10 × 15 s = 150 s = 2 min 30 s   
   (he then has to take his scheduled 1‑min rest, but the stage is already finished at 150 s).

Jill  
   •  6 hops (to 6 m) take 6 × 15 s = 90 s, then a mandatory 1‑min (60 s) rest: t = 150 s.  
   •  She is still 2 m short of the 8 m mark; however Jack has already finished, so the 30‑s penalty
      imposed on the loser begins immediately (t = 150 s → 180 s).  
   •  She then needs 2 more hops (30 s) to reach 8 m: total t = 210 s = 3 min 30 s.

Thus Jack wins Stage 1 and Jill starts Stage 2 at 210 s, 60 s behind.

-------------------------------------------------
Stage 2 – the last 8 m
-------------------------------------------------
Jack  
   After a compulsory 1‑min rest (150 s → 210 s) he again needs 10 steps:  
   10 × 15 s = 150 s.  
   Finish time: 210 s + 150 s = 360 s = 6 min.

Jill  
   From 8 m to 12 m: 4 hops → 60 s (t = 270 s) then her 1‑min rest to 330 s.  
   From 12 m to 16 m: 4 more hops → 60 s.  
   Finish time: 330 s + 60 s = 390 s = 6 min 30 s.

-------------------------------------------------
Result
-------------------------------------------------
Jack touches the ground first.  
Jill arrives 390 s – 360 s = 30 s later, i.e. 0.5 min.

Final answer: Jack wins; Jill needs an additional 0.5 minute (30 seconds) to finish.",True
68,"Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.
""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""
Assuming everything has integer weights, what were the two types of weights that Joseph suggested?",Try it out with small numbers. What is the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of 3s and 4s? The answer is 5. Try it out with other numbers. You'll find a pattern eventually.,"The two weights are 11 and 13.
If you played around with the hint, you'll realize that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of Xs and Ys is equal to (X-1)(Y-1) - 1.
We are told that the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of a combination of the two weights is 119.
Thus,

From here, we only have to list 120's factors: (1,120), (2,60), (3,40), (4,30), (5,24), (6,20), (8,15), (10,12).  There are 8 possible combinations.
However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.
Try it out. You can't make 119 using only 11s and 13s but you can make 120 and above using only 11s and 13s.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the two integer weights be a and b pounds.  
The story says:

1. Both weights are heavier than 10 ⇒ a > 10, b > 10.  
2. They are not both even.  
3. Every integer weight strictly greater than 119 can be made with them, while 119 cannot.

For any two positive integers a and b that are relatively prime, the largest unattainable non‑negative integer (the Frobenius number) is

           ab – a – b.

All larger integers can be expressed as non‑negative combinations of a and b.

Hence in our situation the Frobenius number must be 119:

           ab – a – b = 119.                       (1)

Add 1 to both sides and factor:

           ab – a – b + 1 = 120
           (a – 1)(b – 1)  = 120.                 (2)

Because a, b > 10, we have a – 1 > 9 and b – 1 > 9.  
List the factor pairs of 120 with both factors exceeding 9:

           10 × 12 and 12 × 10.

Thus

           a – 1 = 10,  b – 1 = 12 or a – 1 = 12,  b – 1 = 10,

giving the single unordered pair

           (a, b) = (11, 13).

Check:

• a and b are > 10: 11, 13.  
• Not both even and gcd(11, 13) = 1.  
• Frobenius number: 11·13 – 11 – 13 = 143 – 24 = 119, so every weight ≥ 120 is attainable.

Therefore the two weights Joseph proposed are 11 lb and 13 lb.

1.  The algebraic condition  
   S : P = 3 : 40  ⇔ 40 S = 3 P.                   (1)

2.  Immediate consequences of (1).  
   • 40 S is a multiple of 3, hence S is a multiple of 3, so N is divisible by 3.  
   • P is a multiple of 40, so it is divisible by 5 and by 8.  
     – at least one digit must be 5;  
     – the digits must supply three factors of 2 in all.  
   • N is also required to be divisible by 40 − 3 = 37, and it is even;  
     therefore N is divisible by 2·3·37 = 222.

   To obtain the smallest such N we try to use as few digits as possible.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
No solution with two or three digits
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
•  Two digits.  The only way P can be divisible by 40 with two non–zero
   digits 1–9 is {5,8}.  
   S = 13, P = 40 → 40 S = 520 ≠ 3 P = 120.

•  Three digits.  P must still contain 5 and 2³.  
   ­– Case {5,8,x}: 40(13 + x) = 3·40x ⇒ 13 + x = 3x ⇒ x = 6.5 (impossible).  
   ­– Case {5,4,2}: S = 11, P = 40 ⇒ 40 S ≠ 3 P.  
   Hence no 3‑digit solution exists.

Therefore N must have at least four digits.

Reducing the four‑digit search
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Let the four digits be {5, a, b, c}.  
Write R = a + b + c and M = a b c.  
Then S = 5 + R and P = 5 M, and (1) becomes

40(5 + R) = 3·5 M  ⇔  8(5 + R) = 3 M.           (2)

Because M is divisible by 8, put M = 8k (k an integer).  
Equation (2) gives 5 + R = 3k ⇔ R = 3k − 5.       (3)

The three digits a, b, c lie between 1 and 9, so 3 ≤ R ≤ 27.  
From (3) this gives 3k − 5 between 3 and 27 → 3 ≤ k ≤ 10.

For every k = 3,…,10 we must find three digits whose
          sum = R = 3k − 5 and product = M = 8k.

k = 3:  (sum 4, product 24) impossible  
k = 4:  (sum 7, product 32) impossible  
k = 5:  (sum 10, product 40) impossible  
k = 6:  (sum 13, product 48) possible with digits {2,3,8}  
k = 7:  (sum 16, product 56) possible with digits {1,7,8}  
k = 8,9,10: no possibilities

ABC = 3·JE, DEF = 6·JE, GHJ = 9·JE. (1)

-------------------------------------------------
1.  Condition coming from GHJ

The units digit of GHJ = J, but GHJ = 9·JE = 9(10J + E).  
Because 9·(10J) is a multiple of 10, the units digit of GHJ is the same as the units digit of 9E.  
Hence                                9E ≡ J  (mod 10). (2)

The tens digit of DEF is E.  Write the product 6·JE in the usual way:

            6·(10J + E) = 60J + 6E.

•  Units digit F = (6E) mod 10.  
•  Carry from the units = ⌊6E/10⌋.  
•  Tens digit of 60J is (6J) mod 10.

Therefore the tens digit of the whole product is

The first mathematicians says, ""I have a positive integer number of children, whose ages are positive integers. The sum of their ages is the number of this bus, while the product is my own age.""
The other person replies, ""How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?""
""No, you could not.""
""Aha! At last, I know how old you are!""
Apparently the second mathematician had been trying to determine the first mathematician's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
The bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.","There are multiple possible age combinations for the mathematician's children that would result in the same age as well as the same bus number otherwise the second mathematician can determine the ages of the children given the first mathematician's age and number of children.
Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16. But when the mathematician informs us of this, we can't declare triumphantly that at last we know how old he is, because we don't — he might be 96, but he might also be 240, with children aged 4, 5, and 12 or 3, 8, and 10. After enough trial and error, the perfect balance between the two is reached with the number 12.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Call the bus number S.  
Because everybody on the bus can see that number, the second mathematician begins the
conversation knowing only S.

1.  What the second mathematician hears first  
   The question  
      “Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out
      their individual ages?”  
   means that, for every possible pair  
      (n = number of children, P = product of their ages)  
   that is compatible with the known sum S, the second mathematician does not yet know
   whether that pair determines the children’s ages uniquely.

2.  The first mathematician’s answer  
      “No, you could not.”  
   tells the second mathematician that the actual pair (n, P) is one for which the set
   of children’s ages is **not** unique.  
   Define a pair (n, P) to be
      ambiguous ⇔ there are **at least two** different multisets of n positive integers
      whose sum is S and whose product is P.  
   The actual pair is therefore an ambiguous pair.

3.  What the second mathematician learns next  
      “Aha! At last, I know how old you are!”  
   means that, after eliminating all non‑ambiguous pairs, there is now **exactly one**
   possible value left for P.  (He might or might not yet know n, but he certainly
   knows P, the first mathematician’s age.)

   In other words:

      For the bus number S there must be **one and only one** ambiguous product P.

4.  Search for such an S  

   •  If S ≤ 11  
      List every partition of S, record (n, P) for each, and check duplications inside
      each fixed n.  A simple inspection (carried out for all sums up to 11) shows that
      no product ever repeats within the same n.  Hence **no ambiguous pair exists**, so
      the first mathematician would have had to answer “Yes”, contradicting the
      conversation.  Therefore S ≥ 12.

   •  S = 12  
      Partitions of 12 and their (n, P):

        n = 4:  1 + 3 + 4 + 4  P = 48  
                2 + 2 + 2 + 6  P = 48   ← second occurrence of the same P
      Every other partition of 12 gives a product that occurs only once for its value of n.  
      Thus the single ambiguous pair for S = 12 is (n = 4, P = 48).

   •  S = 13 (or any larger sum)  
      Already for S = 13 there are **two** different ambiguous products:  

         (1, 6, 6) and (2, 2, 9)  ⟹ n = 3, P = 36  
         (1, 1, 3, 4, 4) and (1, 2, 2, 2, 6)  ⟹ n = 5, P = 48  

      Hence more than one ambiguous product remains, so the second mathematician could
      not have deduced the first mathematician’s age.  For every S ≥ 13 one can
      similarly exhibit at least two different ambiguous products, so those sums are
      impossible.

   Consequently the **only** bus number that leaves exactly one ambiguous product is

         S = 12.

5.  Check against the conversation  
   •  With S = 12, the ambiguous pair is (n = 4, P = 48).  
   •  Knowing this, the first mathematician truthfully says “No, you could not.”  
   •  Upon hearing “No,” the second mathematician sees that the only remaining possible
     product is 48 and exclaims that he finally knows his colleague’s age.

All statements of the dialogue are therefore satisfied precisely when the bus number is 12.

73,"Achmed and Ali were camel-drivers and on one day they decided to quit their job. They wanted to become shepherds. So they went to the market and sold all their camels. The amount of money (dinars) they received for each camel was the same as the total number of camels they owned. With that money they bought as many sheep as possible at 10 dinars a sheep. With the money that was left they bought a goat.
On their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, ""I take the last sheep and you can get the goat"".

Now the interesting thing is that all squares with an odd tens-place end with a 6. (16^2 = 256, 24^2 = 576). So a goat must cost 6 dinars.
10 - 6 = 2 dogs

C = number of camels ( = price per camel in dinars)  
S = number of sheep bought, 10 dinars each  
G = price of the single goat (0 < G < 10)  
D = price of a dog (what we must find)

1.  The sale of the camels brought C·C = C² dinars, all of which were spent:
        C² = 10 S + G.                                           (1)

2.  When they tried to share the sheep there was one left over, so S is odd:
        S = 2k + 1   (k ≥ 0).

3.  The provisional division therefore was  
        Ali:  k + 1 sheep  →  10(k+1) dinars  
        Achmed: k sheep + the goat → 10k + G dinars.

    Ali’s share exceeds Achmed’s by 10 – G dinars.  
    Ali hands Achmed one dog worth D, after which the two shares are equal:

        10k + G + D = 10(k + 1) – D.                           (2)

    From (2) we obtain
        G = 10 – 2D.                                           (3)

    Because 0 < G < 10, D can only be 1, 2, 3 or 4.

4.  Insert S = 2k + 1 in (1):

        C² = 10(2k + 1) + G = 20k + 10 + G.                    (4)

    Reduce (4) modulo 20 and substitute (3):

        C² ≡ 10 + G ≡ 10 + (10 – 2D) ≡ 20 – 2D ≡ –2D  (mod 20). (5)

    Quadratic residues modulo 20 are 0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 16.  
    Equation (5) therefore requires –2D (mod 20) to be one of these six
    residues.

        D = 1  →  –2 ≡ 18  (not a residue)  
        D = 2  →  –4 ≡ 16  (a residue)  
        D = 3  →  –6 ≡ 14  (not a residue)  
        D = 4  →  –8 ≡ 12  (not a residue)

    The only admissible value is D = 2.

5.  With D = 2, (3) gives G = 10 – 2·2 = 6, and (4) is satisfied, e.g. by  
    C = 14 camels: 14² = 196 = 19·10 + 6, so the story is internally
    consistent.

Hence the price of one dog is uniquely determined.

So five separate weights are the minimum possible.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

A set of five weights that actually works  

Choose the five weights

1 stone, 3 stones, 9 stones, 27 stones, 81 stones.     (1)

(The heaviest is 7 lumps 4 stones, the next is 2 lumps 5 stones.)

Why they work  

Write the desired weight in balanced ternary (base‑3 with digits −1,0,1).  
Because 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121, every number N with 1 ≤ N ≤ 121 has a unique expression

N = c₀·1 + c₁·3 + c₂·9 + c₃·27 + c₄·81 with cᵢ ∈ {−1,0,1}.

Place each weight

• on the pan opposite the object if cᵢ = +1,  
• on the same pan as the object if cᵢ = −1,  
• aside if cᵢ = 0.

The two pans then balance exactly at N stones.

Example: weighing 50 stones  
Balanced‑ternary: 50 = +81  −27  −3  −1.  
Put 81 on the weight pan; 27, 3, 1 on the object pan.  
Weights: 81 = 50 + 27 + 3 + 1 ✓

Since every N from 1 to 121 has such a representation, all required weighings are possible.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Thus the advisers’ optimal solution was to carry just five weights of 1, 3, 9, 27 and 81 stones.  Five is the minimum number any scheme can use, and these five indeed allow the weighing of every integral amount from 1 stone up to 1 mass (121 stones).",True
75,What is the smallest number that is the sum of two different pairs of cubes?,Cubic inches in a cubic foot might help.,"1729.
1 cubed + 12 cubed = 1 + 12x12x12 = 1+1728=1729
10 cubed + 9 cubed = 10x10x10 +9x9x9 = 1000 + 729 = 1729",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let n be the required positive integer.  
We must find the least n that can be written

n = a³ + b³ = c³ + d³,

with {a , b} ≠ {c , d} and all four integers positive.

1.  Bounding the search  

If n is smaller than 13³ = 2197, then every cube that can appear in such a representation must itself be at most 12³ = 1728.  
Hence, to settle the problem it is enough to look at all sums a³ + b³ with

1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 12.                                                     (★)

2.  Listing all such sums  

Write each cube once:

1³ =   1   6³ = 216  
2³ =   8   7³ = 343  
3³ =  27   8³ = 512  
4³ =  64   9³ = 729  
5³ = 125 10³ = 1000  
       11³ = 1331  
       12³ = 1728  

Add them pairwise under condition (★) (a running list, kept in increasing order, is convenient):

(Every term in the list corresponds to exactly one ordered pair (a , b) with a ≤ b ≤ 12.)

3.  Detecting the first repetition  

Scanning the list, the first value that appears twice is 1729:

1729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³.

No earlier number is repeated; hence no smaller integer than 1729 can be written as a sum of two positive cubes in two distinct ways.

N = d₇d₆d₅d₄d₃d₂d₁d₀ (in decimal),   
F(N) = d₇⁸+d₆⁸+···+d₀⁸.

We look for 8–digit numbers N with F(N)=N (“eighth–power Armstrong numbers”).  
The statement tells us that only three such numbers exist and gives two of them:  

1) 24678050, 2) 88593477.

------------------------------------------------
1.  A useful observation  
For every digit m (0≤m≤8) the difference

Δ(m)= (m+1)⁸ – m⁸

is

1, 255, 6305, 58975, 325089, 1 288 991, 4 085 185, 11 012 415, 26 269 505   (for m=0,…,8).

None of these numbers equals a positive power of ten except Δ(0)=1.

------------------------------------------------
2.  Consequence for changing one digit of a solution  
Suppose N is a solution and we raise one of its digits (say in the 10ᵏ–place, k≥1) by 1.  
The left–hand side N increases by 10ᵏ, whereas the right–hand side F(N) increases by Δ(m).
Because 10ᵏ is a power of ten ≥10 and Δ(m)=10ᵏ never occurs (by the table above), such a change
destroys the equality F(N)=N.  

The only permissible change that might keep the equality is raising
the units digit (k=0).  Then the left side grows by 1, and the right side
grows by Δ(0)=1, so equality is preserved.

------------------------------------------------
3.  Applying this fact to the known number 24678050  
The first given solution ends with the digit 0.  
Replacing only that 0 by 1 gives

24678051.

Let us verify that it indeed satisfies the required equality:

2⁸ =        256  
4⁸ =     65 536  
6⁸ =  1 679 616  
7⁸ =  5 764 801  
8⁸ = 16 777 216  
0⁸ =         0  
5⁸ =    390 625  
1⁸ =         1  
——————————————  
           24 678 051

Hence F(24678051)=24678051.

------------------------------------------------
4.  Uniqueness  
Any other change of a digit in 24678050 (or in 88593477) would involve a place value
10ᵏ with k≥1 and would, by section 1, break the equality.  
Therefore no further 8‑digit solutions arise in this way, and because the problem
asserts that exactly three exist, the number we have just found must be the
remaining one.

77,"I always remember the days when I was at high school, whiling away my time with my friends. Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.
Considering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?
He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.",,"Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24
This is for 12 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =
24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.
Now let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.
Here H can take values from 0 to 23.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 0 to 7 i.e., 8 values, for H = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 0 to 5 i.e., 6 values, for H = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 0 to 4 i.e., 5 values, for H = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 10+10+8+6+5 = 39

In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =

2.  “H is exactly divisible by M₁ and gives M₂ as the
   quotient’’ means H / M₁ = M₂, i.e. H = M₁·M₂.

Now H may be any integer from 0 to 23.

Again inspect the five values of M₁.

These markings also help on Wednesday when we savor the previous week's success by dividing a cake equally amongst ourselves. Even when a good week deserves a 64-portion cake, we can each ceremonially make a single standard cut (straight and perpendicular to the plate), and we each go home with a single piece of cake.
Using no other cuts or devices, how do we evenly divide the 8-by-8 cake? (EXTRA - How could we get 7 (and only 7) equal-size pieces from the same size cake?)",Think smaller.,"To get three twenty-one-and-one-third (64/3) portion-sized pieces, we momentarily ignore the 28 X's/portions/square-units which form the 32 unit perimeter of the cake.  There is more than one way to divide the 6-by-6 (36 X) cake inside into three equal pieces.  Using one based on its 24 unit perimeter, this cake could be divided into 24 wedges of equal size. Each triangular piece would have as its base one unit of the perimeter; the other two sides would be formed by cuts to the center of the cake. Every triangle would have the same altitude (3 units) giving the same area (A = ½ * b * h = ½ * 1 * 3 = 3/2 square units). 8 adjacent triangles, even though they include a corner or two, will be 12 square units or 1/3 of the ""inner"" cake.
Before we make any actual cuts, we return the ignored 28 portions to the picture and then make those three cuts extended to the true perimeter. The 24 triangles pictured previously increase in altitude to 4 units. By rules of similar triangles, the base increases by the same 1/3 (33 1/3%) to 1 1/3 units. The area of 8 extended triangles is 8 * ½ * 4/3 * 4 = 64/3 portions, which is exactly one-third of the cake.

1.  Dividing the 8 × 8 cake into three equal parts  

   •  Partner A starts at the left–hand edge, constructs the point situated 2/3 of the way across the third small square, and puts his knife vertically through that point.  
      That cut is therefore at a distance  
      2 + 2/3 = 8/3  
      from the left edge, so it separates a strip whose width is 8/3 and whose area is  
      8 · 8/3 = 64/3 = one third of the whole cake.  
      A lifts this strip out – he is done.  

   •  Partner B repeats the very same construction, but starting from the right‑hand side of the cake.  
      His vertical cut therefore lies 8/3 inwards from the right edge, i.e. at the abscissa 16/3.  
      That cut removes the second strip of width 8/3 and of the same area 64/3.  
      B takes that middle strip – he too has finished.  

   •  What remains is the third strip (again 8/3 wide and 8 high); its area is the missing 64/3.  
      For the sake of the ritual Partner C still has to make “one standard cut”.  
      He simply chooses one of the two existing cuts and runs his knife once more along the very same straight line; no new piece is created but all three partners have indeed performed one (and only one) perpendicular straight cut and each goes home with **one** slice whose area is exactly one third of the cake.

2.  EXTRA – seven and only seven equal pieces with the same cake  

   Three straight cuts can produce at most seven pieces, so to obtain seven equal parts we must employ the full power of three lines in general position (no two of them parallel, no three concurrent).

   •  On the lower edge mark, with the aid of the “X’’ decoration, the points situated 1/7, 3/7 and 5/7 of the side length.  
   •  Join

        – the point at 3/7 to the upper‑right corner,  
        – the point at 5/7 to the lower‑right corner.  

   These three segments are our three straight cuts.  
   Each pair of them meet inside the square, so altogether they form 7 regions, which is the maximum possible with three cuts.

   Because the distances we marked on the base are successively two‑sevenths of the side (2/7·8 = 16/7) every region is a trapezium of height 8 and mean base 16/7; hence every region has the same area  

        8 · 16/7 = 128/7 = 64/7 ,

So quickly! We don't have much time until everyone sees, how much string do we need?
Conversions:
100cm = 1m
2.54cm = 1 inch","The string covers 12 meters of distance in 4 rotations.
Use the Pythagorean theorem.","If the pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground and the flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system, then the flag must be 1 meter high. If the string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag and the flag pole is 14 meters in height, then the string must cover 12 meters in total (14-1-1).
If the diameter of the pole is 10cm and the height covered is 12 meters (1200cm), then, unwrapped in to a rectangle, it would be pi(10) (since the circumference of a circle is pi{d}) by 1200 cm rectangle.
If the string wraps around in 4 even rotations, that means the rectangle divided on the y plane into 4 equal sections would represent one rotation per section. Finding the hypotenuse of each section (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) would then yield the distance covered per rotation.

The string's distance in one rotation would be expressed by the following equation:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2
Therefore, in 4 rotations it would be the above * 4.
The final equation is thus expressed as:
let a represent the total height of the pole, then f represent the height of the flag, then rot represent the number of rotations, then p represent the height of the pulley, then d represent the diameter of the pole
s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ ({1400-100-100}/4) ^ 2 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ 90 000 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 1206.561796
Therefore, the string covers approximately 1206.561796 cm in 12 meters when there are 4 even rotations.

h = height of the flag (and also the height of the pulley above the ground)  
D = diameter of the pole = 10 cm = 0.10 m  
r = radius of the pole = 0.05 m  

1.  The pulley is fixed 1 m above the ground, so  
   h = 1 m.

2.  The pole was built 14 times as tall as the flag, so the pole’s height is  
   14 h = 14 m.

3.  When the flag is fully hoisted its top reaches the very top of the pole.  
   Therefore the bottom of the flag is one flag‑height below that, i.e. at  
   14 m – 1 m = 13 m.

4.  The string therefore rises from the pulley (1 m) to the bottom of the flag (13 m):  
   vertical rise = 13 m – 1 m = 12 m.

5.  While rising it wraps evenly around the pole four times.  
   Circumference of the pole = 2πr = 2π(0.05 m) = 0.10π m ≈ 0.31416 m.  
   In four complete turns the horizontal travel along the helix is  
   4(0.31416 m) ≈ 1.25664 m.

6.  The string follows a helix whose length L is obtained from the Pythagorean theorem:  

         L = √[ (vertical rise)² + (horizontal travel)² ]  
           = √[ (12 m)² + (1.25664 m)² ]

Equation (3) gives N = d²/8.

   • Pages 10‑99: 90 × 2 = 180 digits

From (6): g h = 10k + h ⇒ h(g – 1) = 10k.                         (7)

Since h and k are digits 1–9, 10k ≤ 90, so h(g – 1) ≤ 90.

Step 2.  Discarding the impossible “large‐sum” cases.

For all but the pair (k,h) = (1,5) the two–digit number 10k+h is at least 24,
yet the largest sum of two different digits 1–9 is 17.  Equations (1) and (2)
would therefore be impossible.  Thus the only viable triple is

k = 1 , h = 5 , g = 3,

giving & = 1, $ = 5, # = 3 and the common value

&$ = 10k + h = 15.                                                  (8)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Solving the remaining equations with target 15.

With 10k + h = 15, equations (4) and (5) give

a + c = 14,    e + c = 12.                                        (9)

The unused digits are {2,4,6,7,8,9}.  
Among them the only unordered pair summing to 12 is {4,8}.  
Thus {e,c} = {4,8}.

• If c = 4, then d = 11 from (2), impossible.  
• Therefore c = 8 and e = 4.  Then by (2) d = 15 – c = 7.            (10)

Now the remaining digits are {2,6,9}.

From a + c = 14 we get a = 6.                                        (11)

Equation (1): 6 + b = 15 ⇒ b = 9.                                   (12)

The last unused digit 2 must be f, and (3) now reads 4 + 9 + 2 = 15, true.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Verification.

All symbols have distinct digits 1–9:

\  = 6 ,  > = 9 ,  ^ = 8 ,  % = 7 ,  ? = 4 ,  @ = 2 ,  # = 3 ,  & = 1 ,  $ = 5.

Check every condition:

\ + >        : 6 + 9  = 15 = &$  
^ + %        : 8 + 7  = 15 = &$  
? + > + @    : 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 = &$  
\ + ^ + &    : 6 + 8 + 1 = 15 = &$  
# + ? + ^    : 3 + 4 + 8 = 15 = &$  
# × $        : 3 × 5 = 15 = &$.

All are satisfied, so this assignment is the unique solution.

Final answer:

89,"Before Google was a company, it was a number.  A googol is 10^100: a one followed by a hundred zeros.
How many natural numbers less than a googol are both the square of a square and the cube of a cube?
(If N is an integer then N^2 is a square and N^3 is a cube.)",,"599
The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.
The 36th root of a googol is
(10^100)^(1/36) = 10^(100/36) = 10^(2.77777...) ~ 599.48

• the square of a square  ⇒ N = a⁴ for some integer a,  
• the cube of a cube   ⇒ N = b⁹ for some integer b.

1. A number whose prime–factor exponents are all multiples of 4 is a fourth power, and one whose exponents are all multiples of 9 is a ninth power.  
   Therefore, to be both at once, every exponent must be a multiple of lcm(4, 9) = 36.  
   Hence N must be a 36‑th power:

  N = k³⁶  (k a positive integer).

   Conversely, every 36‑th power is automatically both a fourth and a ninth power, so this describes exactly the required numbers.

2. Bound k so that N is below a googol (10¹⁰⁰):

  k³⁶ < 10¹⁰⁰

  ⇔ k < 10^{25/9}.

3. Evaluate 10^{25/9}.  Split the exponent:

 25/9 = 2 + 7/9, so 10^{25/9} = 10² · 10^{7/9} = 100 · 10^{7/9}.

Since log₁₀6 = 0.778151..., while 7/9 = 0.777777…, we have 10^{7/9} ≈ 5.9948…, and therefore

90,What is the 1000th prime number?,It is smaller than 10000,7919,GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"A classical way to locate a particular prime is to combine

1.  an a‑priori bound that tells us in what short interval the prime must lie, and  
2.  an exact count of how many primes precede each number inside that interval.

Both tasks can be carried out completely by hand with the sieve of Eratosthenes, but the amount of routine scratching‑out is large.  What follows is a streamlined presentation of those same steps, giving every logical reason needed, yet omitting pages of mechanical sieving marks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Put a sharp bound on the 1000th prime.

For the nth prime pn, Rosser’s explicit form of the prime‑number theorem says

          n( ln n + ln ln n − 1 )  <  pn  <  n( ln n + ln ln n )      (n ≥ 6).       (1)

With n = 1000 we get

          lower bound : 1000( ln 1000 + ln ln 1000 − 1 )
                      ≈ 1000( 6.90776 + 1.93309 − 1 )
                      ≈ 1000( 7.84085 )  = 7840.85,

          upper bound : 1000( ln 1000 + ln ln 1000 )
                      ≈ 1000( 8.84085 )  = 8840.85.

Hence

          7841  <  p1000  <  8841.                                  (2)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Count the primes up to the beginning of that interval.

Tabulating primes with the sieve of Eratosthenes up to 7800 (a perfectly feasible hand exercise: only the primes ≤√7800 = 88 must be used to strike out composites) gives the well‑known values

   π(1000) = 168,   π(2000) = 303,   π(3000) = 430,   π(4000) = 550,
   π(5000) = 669,   π(6000) = 783,   π(7000) = 900,   π(7800) = 990.  (3)

(The successive differences are 135, 127, 120, 119, 114, 117, 90 – all exactly the
numbers left unstruck by the sieve in the corresponding intervals of length 1000 or 800.)

Thus by (3) there are already 990 primes up to 7800; we still need ten more to reach the 1000th prime, and we know from (2) that it must lie between 7841 and 8841.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  List the primes from 7841 upward until the count reaches 1000.

Continue the same sieve, but now only in the short range 7841–7920 (because, as we shall see, we reach the 1000th prime before 7920 and therefore need not go farther).  The primes ≤√7920 = 89 that can divide any candidate are

     2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31,
     37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89.

Strike out every multiple of those small primes in the interval 7841–7920; the numbers that survive are

     7841, 7853, 7867, 7873, 7877, 7879, 7883,
     7901, 7907, 7919.                                           (4)

Verifying primality one by one is quick: for each number it suffices to check divisibility only by the primes up to 89, and none divides any integer in the list (4).  Hence all ten numbers in (4) are prime.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Pinpoint the 1000th prime.

Adding the ten primes of (4) to the previous total of 990 primes below 7800 gives:

     after 7907 we have 990 + 9 = 999 primes,
     after 7919 we have 990 + 10 = 1000 primes.

Consequently 7919 is the first integer for which the running count of primes reaches 1000; that is,

          p1000 = 7919.                                           (5)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5.  Double‑check that 7919 itself is prime.

A final confirmation:  √7919 ≈ 88.99, so we need only test divisibility by primes ≤ 89 (the list above).  Routine division shows 7919 is divisible by none of them; therefore 7919 is indeed prime.

Having established that exactly 999 primes precede it and that it is itself prime, statement (5) is proved.

91,"A, B and C are positive integers such that 3^A+5^B+7^C is a square number.
What is the minimum value of this square number?",,3^3+5^1+7^2=81.,GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

N = 3^A + 5^B + 7^C ,  A , B , C ∈ ℕ (positive).

Because 3 , 5 and 7 are odd, each power is odd, so N is odd and any square it equals must be an odd square.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  A necessary condition (work modulo 8)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For odd integers  
3 ≡ 3 (mod 8), 5 ≡ 5 (mod 8), 7 ≡ 7 (mod 8).

Since 3² ≡ 1, 5² ≡ 1, 7² ≡ 1 (mod 8), we have  

3^A ≡ {3, 1} , 5^B ≡ {5, 1} , 7^C ≡ {7, 1} (mod 8)  
according as the exponent is odd or even.

The sum 3^A + 5^B + 7^C must be ≡ 1 (mod 8) because every odd square is 1 (mod 8).  
Checking the eight parity–patterns gives

A even , B even , C odd  or  A odd , B odd , C even.  (★)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Look for the smallest square
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The minimum possible value of N is obtained with the smallest exponents consistent with (★).  
The two admissible “starting” triples are

(i)  A = 2 , B = 2 , C = 1 → N = 3² + 5² + 7 = 9 + 25 + 7 = 41 (not a square);

(ii) A = 1 , B = 1 , C = 2 → N = 3 + 5 + 49 = 57 (not a square).

So the least square, if it exists, is larger than 57.

The odd squares below 81 are 25 and 49.  
We show neither can be attained.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2a.  The square 25
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Suppose 3^A + 5^B + 7^C = 25.

Because 7^C ≥ 7, 3^A + 5^B ≤ 18.  
But the only available powers ≤ 18 are 3, 5, 7, 9.  
No pair among {3,5,9} sums to 18, so 25 is impossible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2b.  The square 49
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Suppose 3^A + 5^B + 7^C = 49.

Reduce the equation modulo 5:

3^A + 7^C ≡ 49 ≡ 4 (mod 5). (5^B ≡ 0)

3^A mod 5 is 3 (A odd) or 4 (A even);  
7^C mod 5 cycles 2,4,3,1,…

• If A is even, 3^A ≡ 4 ⇒ 7^C ≡ 0 (mod 5), impossible.  
• If A is odd, 3^A ≡ 3 ⇒ 7^C ≡ 1 (mod 5).  
  The first time 7^C ≡ 1 mod 5 is C = 4 (then again C = 8,…), but 7^4 = 2401 > 49.

Hence 49 cannot be obtained.

Therefore the first admissible odd square is 81.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Showing 81 is attainable
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Choose the second parity pattern (A odd, B odd, C even) with the smallest exponents that have not failed:

A = 3 , B = 1 , C = 2.

Then 3^A + 5^B + 7^C = 27 + 5 + 49 = 81 = 9².

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Minimality
--------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no odd square below 81 that satisfies the equation (proved in 2a and 2b), and 81 itself does satisfy it. Hence 81 is the least possible square.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

92,"You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?
(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.

(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186
(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186
Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.
The solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10.

94,"Dear Jim:
Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.
Jerry","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

 A = Albert’s present age,  
 B = Bill’s present age,  
 C = Charles’ present age,  

and let s(n) denote “the sum of the decimal digits of n”.

The three sentences in Jerry’s letter translate to  

(1) A = s(B) + s(C),  
(2) B – 1 = s(A – 1) + s(C – 1),  
(3) C + 6 = s(A + 6) + s(B + 6).

----------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Work modulo 9  
For every integer n, n ≡ s(n) (mod 9).  Hence

 A ≡ B + C,  
 B ≡ A + C – 1,  
 C ≡ A + B + 6 (mod 9).

Solving these three congruences gives  

 A ≡ 2,  B ≡ 6,  C ≡ 5 (mod 9). (4)

----------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Consequences for the digit–sums  

Write  

 b = s(B), c = s(C).

Because of (4) we have b ≡ 6 and c ≡ 5 (mod 9).  
Equation (1) gives A = b + c = b + c. In particular  

 A = b + c = b + c ≡ (6) + (5) ≡ 11 (mod 9).

Thus A = 11, 20, 29, … .  We now narrow this down.

----------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Using the “one‑year‑ago” condition  

When 1 is subtracted, a digit–sum falls by 1 and then may rise by 9 for
each trailing zero.  Hence there are non–negative integers u, t with

 s(A – 1) = (A – 1) – 9u = b + c – 1 – 9u,  
 s(C – 1) = (c – 1) + 9t.

Insert these in (2):

 B – 1 = b + c – 1 – 9u + c – 1 + 9t  
    = b + 2c – 2 + 9(t – u). (5)

Because B ≡ b (mod 9) and (4) gives B ≡ 6 (mod 9),

 b + 2c – 2 ≡ 6 (mod 9).

With b ≡ 6, this forces 2c – 2 ≡ 0 (mod 9) ⇒ 2c – 1 ≡ –1 (mod 9).  
The only possibility with 0 < c < 10 is c = 5. So

 s(C) = c = 5. (6)

Put c = 5 in (5):

 B – 1 = b + 9 + 9(t – u) ⇒ B = b + 9m with some m ≥ 1. (7)

----------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Using the “six‑years‑hence” condition  

Because of (6) we already know C = 5, 14, 23, … .

With c = 5,

 A = b + c = b + 5, so A + 6 = b + 11.

Since b ≡ 6 (mod 9), b + 11 ≡ 8 (mod 9), so

 s(A + 6) = 8, 17, 26, … .

In (3) the right‑hand side must equal C + 6.  
But C + 6 ≤ 5 + 6 = 11, so s(A + 6) cannot exceed 11; hence

 s(A + 6) = 8. (8)

Consequently (3) gives

 C + 6 = 8 + s(B + 6). (9)

Because of (6), C + 6 = 11, and (9) yields

 s(B + 6) = 3. (10)

----------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Pinning down B  

By (7) B = b + 9m (m ≥ 1) and b = s(B).  
With (10), B + 6 has digit‑sum 3, so B + 6 is 3, 12, 21, 30, 102, … .  
The smallest possibility compatible with m ≥ 1 is B + 6 = 21, i.e. B = 15;
all larger possibilities already have at least two non‑zero digits and
thus digit‑sum > 3, contradicting (10).  Therefore

 B = 15 is the only candidate larger than 9.

Check (2) with B = 15:  
s(A – 1) = s((b + 5) – 1) = s(b + 4).  Since b ≥ 6, b + 4 contains a
carry and s(b + 4) = 1.  Then (2) would give

 14 = 1 + s(C – 1) ⇒ s(C – 1) = 13.

But the only way for s(C – 1) to equal 13 while s(C) = 5
is for C to end in exactly one zero (e.g. C = 50), and that forces
C + 6 ≥ 56, contradicting (9).  Hence B cannot be 15.

Thus no value B > 9 works, so B must be one‑digit. 
With (7) that leaves  

 B = 6 and b = s(B) = 6. (11)

----------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Finishing up  

From (6) and (9): C + 6 = 11 ⇒ C = 5.  
From (11) and A = b + 5: A = 6 + 5 = 11.

----------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Verification  

Present: A = 11, B = 6, C = 5  
 s(B) + s(C) = 6 + 5 = 11 = A ✔

One year ago: A – 1 = 10 (digit‑sum 1), C – 1 = 4 (digit‑sum 4)  
 1 + 4 = 5 = B – 1 ✔

Six years hence: A + 6 = 17 (digit‑sum 8), B + 6 = 12 (digit‑sum 3)  
 8 + 3 = 11 = C + 6 ✔

All three requirements are satisfied, and each deduction above forced the
next value; hence the solution is unique.

If this is too easy, go for extra points included with hint.","A wrongheaded guess would say 123, because 123 * 2 = 321 + 1.  The title hints you can easily go on to find for a ten-digit number that otherwise has same characteristics.","Answer-
397.
397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.
102?  Is 204 = 201 + 1?  No.
103?  Is 206 = 301 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds even.]
396?  Is 792 = 693 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds again.]
The answer given is the only one that passes.
As for extra points, an infinite number of 9's can be added between the 3 and the 7 without spoiling the major characteristics.

“Doubling the number is one more than the number obtained by reversing its digits” translates to  

2(100a + 10b + c) = 100c + 10b + a + 1.  (1)

Expand and collect like terms:

200a + 20b + 2c = 100c + 10b + a + 1  
199a + 10b – 98c = 1.  (2)

1.  Congruence condition  
   Equation (2) gives 10b = 1 + 98c – 199a, so the right–hand side must be divisible by 10.  
   Reduce (2) modulo 10:

   199 ≡ 9 (mod 10), 98 ≡ 8 (mod 10).  
   Hence 9a – 8c ≡ 1 (mod 10).  (3)

2.  Determine b for each pair  
   From (2): b = (1 + 98c – 199a)/10.

   Compute b for every (a,c) candidate:

   (1,1) → b = –10  (reject)  
   (1,6) → b =  39  (reject)  
   (3,2) → b = –40  (reject)  
   (3,7) → b =   9  (acceptable digit)

Original number: 397  
Double: 2·397 = 794  
Reversed digits: 793  
Indeed, 794 = 793 + 1.

Hence the unique three–digit number with the required property is 397.

a digits equal to 3 and b digits equal to 7 (so a, b ≥ 0 and a + b ≥ 1).

1.  Digital–sum condition  
   The digit–sum is 3a + 7b.  
   •  Mod 3: 3a + 7b ≡ b (mod 3).  
      Hence b ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
   •  Mod 7: 3a + 7b ≡ 3a (mod 7).

4.  No smaller candidate is possible  
   Any valid number must have at least 7k + 3ℓ digits with k, ℓ integers as above.  
   The minimum positive value of 7k + 3ℓ is 3, so no one– or two–digit number can satisfy the digital–sum condition, let alone the divisibility requirements.

1.  A convenient language  

   In every move exactly 7 coins are “untouched’’ (they are the 7 coins that are not among the 93).  
   For every coin i let s(i) be the number of moves in which coin i is untouched.

   If the whole process lasts t moves, then                              
                       s(1)+s(2)+⋯+s(100)=7t                      (1)  
   because every move contributes one “untouched’’ count to 7 different coins.

2.  A necessary parity condition  

   A coin is flipped in exactly t−s(i) moves.  
   The coin starts H (heads) and must finish T (tails), so it has to be flipped an odd number of times; hence t−s(i) is odd.  
   Therefore s(i) has the parity opposite to t, for every i.

   •  If t is odd, every s(i) is even; the left–hand side of (1) is then a sum of 100 even numbers and is even, while the right–hand side 7t is odd – impossible.  
   •  Consequently t must be even, and then every s(i) is odd.        (2)

3.  A lower bound for t  

   When t is even, condition (2) tells us each of the 100 coins is untouched at least once, so  
                      s(1)+⋯+s(100)  ≥ 100.  
   Together with (1) this gives 7t ≥ 100.  
   With t even, the smallest integer t satisfying 7t ≥ 100 is t = 16.  
   Hence at least 16 moves are necessary.                                       (3)

4.  Showing that 16 moves are sufficient  

   We now exhibit 16 concrete moves that succeed.

   First make 14 moves whose seven untouched coins are

       {1,…,7}, {8,…,14}, {15,…,21}, … , {92,…,98}

   (that is, the 14 disjoint blocks of seven consecutive numbers; each block is the set of untouched coins of one move).  
   After these 14 moves every coin 1–98 has been untouched once, coins 99 and 100 have never been untouched.

   Choose A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}.  
   Take as the sets of untouched coins in moves 15 and 16  

       {99} ∪ A  and  {100} ∪ A.

   So the 16 untouched–coin sets are

       M₁  = {  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 }  
       M₂  = {  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 }  
       ⋮  
       M₁₄ = { 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 }  
       M₁₅ = { 99  1  2  3  4  5  6 }  
       M₁₆ = {100  1  2  3  4  5  6 }.

   Counting, we have

       • coins 1–6 are untouched 3 times (odd),  
       • coins 7 and 8–98 are untouched exactly once (odd),  
       • coins 99 and 100 are untouched once (odd).

   Thus every coin is untouched an odd number of times, i.e. each coin is flipped an odd number of times, so after these 16 moves every coin shows tails.  Hence 16 moves indeed suffice.

5.  Conclusion  

   From (3) no sequence with fewer than 16 moves can work, and the explicit construction above shows that 16 moves do work.

 q–1 ≤ 3Pn ⁄ 100 < q ⇒ 100(q–1)/3 ≤ Pn < 100q/3.

For an intersection to exist one needs

 25q ≤ 100q/3  ⇒ q ≤ 7,  

and, simultaneously,

 100(q–1)/3 < 25(q+1)  ⇒ q ≥ 1.

Checking the admissible q (1,…,7) shows that the largest q giving an
intersection is q = 6, which yields

 166 ⅔ < Pn < 175, hence 167 ≤ Pn ≤ 174.

Thus the population can increase by exactly 1 only while the starting
population is at most 174; from 175 on the increase is at least 2, and
by the same argument Δ = 1 is impossible once Pn ≥ 200.  
Consequently the final time Δ = 1 occurs is the year that starts with
Pn = 174.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  How many years does it take to reach a starting population of 174?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Between successive years the population never decreases, so each
starting value from 100 up to 174 will appear at most once.  Compute
Δn for each interval of constant births–deaths:

• 100–124: B = 4, D = 3 ⇒ Δ = 1 (25 consecutive years)  
• 125–133: B = 5, D = 3 ⇒ Δ = 2 (5 years: starts 125, 127, 129, 131, 133)  
• 134–149: B = 5, D = 4 ⇒ Δ = 1 (15 years: starts 135–149)  
• 150–166: B = 6, D = 4 ⇒ Δ = 2 (9 years: starts 150,152,…,166)  
• 167–174: B = 6, D = 5 ⇒ Δ = 1 (starts 168–174)

Year‑by‑year count:

 25 (first interval)  
+ 5 (second)  = 30  
+15 (third)   = 45  
+ 9 (fourth)  = 54  
+ 7 (fifth, starting populations 168–174) = 61.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  The last year with increase 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Year 61 begins with 174 colonists; during that year B = 6 and D = 5,
so Δ = 1 and the population rises to 175.  From Year 62 onward the
starting population is at least 175, and we have already proved that
no population ≥175 can satisfy Δ = 1.  Hence Year 61 is the last such
year.

103,"Two aging mathematics professors, Al Gebra and Cal Culus were sitting at their favourite Thai restaurant, Phun Kshuns, reminiscing about when they first met, while their waiter, Theo Rumsanrools (who also took Professor Gebra's Advanced Mathematics course at Cart Eshian University) eavesdropped on their conversation as he brought them their meals.
""You know what occurred to me the other day, Cal?"" asked Professor Gebra.
""What's that?"" said Professor Culus.
""Well, when we met, the square of your age contained the same three digits as the square of my age, just in a different order,"" Professor Gebra continued.
""This will really blow your socks off then, Al! If you take the square of the sum of our ages when we met and split it into two 2-digit numbers, you'd have my age then and your age now!"" Professor Culus exclaimed.
Wanting to impress his professor, Theo interjected.
""I thought you were much younger than that, Professor Gebra,"" Theo said.
Said Professor Gebra, ""And just how old am I then, young fellow?""",,"""Well, you're 81, sir,"" Theo replied.
""Right you are! And how did you figure that out so quickly?"" Professor Gebra asked.
""You said the square of your ages when you and Professor Culus met had only three digits, so the oldest you could have been was 31. That means that there were only a few possible ages the two of you could have been. Those being (with the associated squares):

And from those figures I concluded that Professor Culus must have been 16 when you met and hence you, Professor Gebra, are now 81!"" Theo explained.
""Aren't you a bright young fellow! You should come and study my Advanced Mathematics course at Cart Eshian University!"" Professor Gebra exclaimed.
""Uh, I already do,"" Theo said sheepishly.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

 G = Professor Al Gebra’s age when the two professors first met,  
 C = Professor Cal Culus’s age when they first met,  
 n = the number of years since they met, so Al’s present age is G + n and Cal’s present age is C + n.

────────────────────────────────────────
1.  The first condition (Al’s remark)
────────────────────────────────────────
“When we met, the square of your age contained the same three digits as the square of my age, just in a different order.”

Thus G² and C² are both 3–digit numbers containing exactly the same three digits in some order.  
Since 10² = 100 and 31² = 961, any 3–digit square must come from an age between 10 and 31 inclusive.

Compute those squares and group them by their digit–multisets:

10² = 100 → {0,0,1}  
11² = 121 → {1,1,2}  
12² = 144 → {1,4,4}  
13² = 169 → {1,6,9}  
14² = 196 → {1,6,9}  
15² = 225 → {2,2,5}  
16² = 256 → {2,5,6}  
17² = 289 → {2,8,9}  
18² = 324 → {2,3,4}  
19² = 361 → {1,3,6}  
20² = 400 → {0,0,4}  
21² = 441 → {1,4,4}  
22² = 484 → {4,8,8}  
23² = 529 → {2,5,9}  
24² = 576 → {5,6,7}  
25² = 625 → {2,5,6}  
26² = 676 → {6,6,7}  
27² = 729 → {2,7,9}  
28² = 784 → {4,7,8}  
29² = 841 → {1,4,8}  
30² = 900 → {0,0,9}  
31² = 961 → {1,6,9}

Only the following multisets occur at least twice:

{1,4,4}: 12² (=144) and 21² (=441)  
{1,6,9}: 13² (=169), 14² (=196), 31² (=961)  
{2,5,6}: 16² (=256) and 25² (=625)

Hence the possible unordered pairs {G, C} are  
{12,21}, {13,14}, {13,31}, {14,31}, {16,25}.

────────────────────────────────────────
2.  The second condition (Cal’s remark)
────────────────────────────────────────
“If you take the square of the sum of our ages when we met and split it into two 2‑digit numbers, you’d have my age then and your age now.”

Let S = G + C.  The number S² must be a 4–digit decimal whose
 • first two digits form C,  
 • last two digits form G + n.

Therefore
 S² = 100·C + (G + n)   (1)  
and both C and G + n must be two–digit numbers (10–99).

────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Test the finite list of candidates
────────────────────────────────────────
For each candidate pair (order matters, because the first two digits must be Cal’s age C):

A)  C = 21, G = 12 ⇒ S = 33, S² = 1089 → 10|89 (10≠21) reject.  
B)  C = 12, G = 21 ⇒ S = 33, S² = 1089 → 10|89 (10≠12) reject.

C)  C = 14, G = 13 ⇒ S = 27, S² = 729 (only 3 digits) reject.  
D)  C = 13, G = 14 ⇒ same objection reject.

E)  C = 31, G = 13 ⇒ S = 44, S² = 1936 → 19|36 (19≠31) reject.  
F)  C = 13, G = 31 ⇒ same S² 19|36 (19≠13) reject.

G)  C = 31, G = 14 ⇒ S = 45, S² = 2025 → 20|25 (20≠31) reject.  
H)  C = 14, G = 31 ⇒ same S² 20|25 (20≠14) reject.

I)   C = 25, G = 16 ⇒ S = 41, S² = 1681 → 16|81 (16≠25) reject.  
J)   C = 16, G = 25 ⇒ S = 41, S² = 1681 → 16|81 SUCCESS!

Case J fulfils both conditions:
 first two digits 16 = C (Cal’s age then),  
 last two digits 81 = G + n (Al’s present age).

────────────────────────────────────────
4.  Determining the present ages
────────────────────────────────────────
From case J:

Cal’s age when they met C = 16  
Al’s age when they met G = 25  
Number of years since they met n = (G + n) – G = 81 – 25 = 56.

Therefore  
 Al’s present age = 25 + 56 = 81,  
 Cal’s present age = 16 + 56 = 72.

(All quantities are valid two‑digit ages except the present ages, which naturally may reach the eighties.)

────────────────────────────────────────
5.  Uniqueness
────────────────────────────────────────
Every possible pair of 3–digit square anagrams has been inspected; only the ordering (Cal, Al) = (16, 25) satisfies equation (1).  Hence the answer is unique.

104,"Kurt & Rod were hanging around the window at school munching the last of their Rnkfurers hoard.  They spotted their neighbor lounging in the enclosed courtyard, looking hungry.
""Patty O'Furniture!  Good to see you!  Want a Rnkfurter?""
""A what?""
Kurt handed her the last he had.  She bit in, and her face lit up like a newly-coined metaphor.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""Rod and I were about to go order some more.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""  Patty's blank look bade him explain.  ""In our first batch, we got a total of 25 -- 20 for me, and 5 for Rod.  I had 20, and he had 20% of the total.""
""And you think you can do that for three people?  You get my percentage, and I get Rod's?  I don't think we can do it.""
Rod had been thinking about it, and rattled off three numbers to her.
""Those aren't right.  The last one isn't the right percentage; there's an added fraction.""
""So?  My mom says they're the same on her old phonograph speeds.""
Patty looked at Kurt, each waiting for the other to give an opinion.  Finally, she gestured at the empty wrapper in his hand.
""I'll round off a little for a week's supply of these.  Let's go!""
Since Rnkfurters come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, they had to leave 10 with the storekeeper to make the numbers work, but they got their munchies.
How many did each student get this time?","The old phonograph speeds were typically 16, 33-1/3, 45, and 78 RPM.","27 for Kurt, 30 for Patty, and 33 for Rod.
That's 30% for Kurt and 33-1/3% for Patty.
Method:
Let K, P, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, K+P+R.
Now, since Kurt's percentage equals Patty's quantity, we get
100*K/T = P.
Similarly,
100*P/T = R plus a fraction.  Now, look at the common factor, 100/T.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
K*F = P and P*F = R (plus a fraction),
and K*F^2 = R (plus a fraction).
The clue about the phonograph leaves us looking for a triple with 33 Rnkfurters for Rod, with Patty getting 33-1/3% (one-third) of the total.
P = T/3
P = (K+P+33)/3 -- remember, R=33
Now, combine this with 100*K/T = P, and a bit of algebra gives us the required answer.
-------------
Alternately, there are 11 triples that fit the factor requirement (courtesy of a short computer program), ranging from (19, 25, 32) to (2376, 96, 3).  The ones that total 10 less than a multiple of 25 are
27, 30, 33
63, 45, 32
891, 90, 9
Given the phonograph clue, I expect you can recognize that the first triple above is the answer.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

 K = number Kurt gets  
 R = number Rod gets  
 P = number Patty gets  
 T = K + R + P = total the three of them take home.  

(The class‑room case of 25, 50 or 100 is bought, but they leave ten with the shopkeeper, so  
T ≡ –10 (mod 25) ⇒ T = 15, 40, 65, 90, 115, …)  

The “percentage rule’’ they try to keep is the same one Kurt and Rod had for two people:

 “one of us gets (in pieces) the number that another has for a percentage of the whole.”

With three people Patty proposes the chain  

 Kurt’s pieces  =  Patty’s % of T,  
 Patty’s pieces =  Rod’s  % of T.

(I.e. K  = 100 P /T and P = 100 R /T, so R = 0.01 PT.)

1.  Exact obedience is impossible  
    Substituting R = 0.01 PT into T = K + P + R and eliminating K with K = 100 P/T gives  

  P(T² + 100T + 10 000) = 100T².

    Solving for P,

  P = 100T² /(T² + 100T + 10 000).

    For P to be an integer the denominator must divide 100T².  
    A short modular check (mod 5) shows this never happens when T ≡ 15 (mod 25).  
    (The only T that makes the fraction integral is T = 100, which gives the non‑integral
     P = K = R = 100⁄3.)  
    Hence they cannot satisfy the rule with whole sausages.

2.  The best they can do is be off by only the “added fraction’’ ⅓  
    Notice that if P is chosen as a tidy 30, then for every permissible
    total T we get

  R = 0.30 T.

    To make R an integer T must be a multiple of 10, and to satisfy
    T ≡ 15 (mod 25) the least such total is

  T = 90  (= 100 purchased – 10 left behind).

    With T = 90 and P = 30 we have

  R = 0.30·90 = 27.

    Patty’s percentage of the total is

  100 P /T = 100·30 /90 = 33⅓ %.

    Kurt therefore ought to take 33⅓ pieces; rounding to the nearest whole
    number gives him 33.  This is exactly the “added fraction’’ Patty
    objected to and the “33‑and‑a‑third’’ that Rod defended with his
    phonograph‑speed remark.

    The three numbers 33, 30 and 27 meet Patty’s wishes as closely as
    is possible with integers:

  • Patty gets 30 pieces   = Rod’s exact 30 % of the total.  
  • Kurt gets 33 pieces  ≈ Patty’s 33⅓ % of the total (off only by ⅓).  
  • Rod gets the rest, 27 pieces.  

    All three numbers are whole, their sum is the required 90, and they
    were obtained from one 100‑pack with ten left behind.

So, after rounding just enough for a “week’s supply’’ and leaving ten with the store‑keeper, the students take home

105,"A man is standing on a rock in the middle of a circular lake of radius 1. There is a tiger on the shore of the lake that can run four times as fast you can swim, however the tiger cannot swim. The tiger is hungry and always attempts to keep the distance between the two of you at a minimum. How can you safely swim to shore?
Assume that as long as you can get to the shore before the tiger gets to you (even if it is only a split-second before), you will be safe.",,"Until you are more than 1/4 of the radius away from the rock you can swim fast enough so that you can keep the tiger the furthest distance possible from you. Regardless of which direction the tiger moves around the circle, you swim the other way, always keeping the rock between you and the tiger.  While you are doing this you will be able to move outward, since you will have some energy to spare.
Before long you will be 1/4 of the radius away from the center and the tiger will be 180 degrees away. At this point swim straight to the point on the shore furthest from the tiger. You will be able to get there in 3/4 units of time, while it will take the tiger pi/4 =~ 0.7854 units of time.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the radius of the lake be 1 and let your swimming speed be 1.  
Hence the tiger’s running speed is 4.

The key observation is that, while you are at a distance r from the centre, your
angular speed about the centre is  

                     ω_you = 1 / r,

whereas the tiger’s greatest possible angular speed (running round the
rim of the lake) is  

                     ω_tiger = 4.

Therefore, whenever r < ¼, you can turn round the centre faster than the
tiger can.

Step 1 – take up an advantageous position  
From the rock at the centre swim straight out along any radius until you are
at a distance

                     r = ¼ – ε               (choose ε, say ε = 0.01).

This outward swim is safe because the tiger cannot enter the water.

Step 2 – gain an angular lead  
Now swim round the centre on the circle of radius r in the direction that
increases the angular separation Δ between you and the tiger.  
Your angular speed exceeds the tiger’s by

                     ω_you – ω_tiger = 1/r – 4 > 0,

so Δ grows steadily.  
Keep swimming until the separation satisfies

                     Δ > 4(1 – r).             (∗)

With r = ¼ – ε the right‑hand side equals 3 + 4ε.  
Because 3 + 4ε < π whenever ε < (π – 3)/4 ≈ 0.035, condition (∗) can be
met long before Δ reaches its maximum value π (180°).

Step 3 – make the dash for land  
The moment (∗) is satisfied, head straight for the shore along the radius
through your present position.  
The distance you must swim is 1 – r; the time you need is

                     T_you = 1 – r.

During that same time the tiger must run the shorter of the two shore arcs
to the landing point.  Because of (∗) the length of that arc is at least
4(1 – r), so the tiger’s running time is

                     T_tiger ≥ 4(1 – r)/4 = 1 – r = T_you.

Since you started the dash when the inequality in (∗) was strict, we
actually have T_tiger > T_you, so you step on shore a split‑second before
the tiger arrives and are safe.

Numerically, with r = 0.24 (ε = 0.01):  
• you must swim 0.76 units to land (time 0.76);  
• the tiger must run at least 3.04 units round the rim (time 0.76 + 0.01 = 0.77).  

You therefore reach the bank first.

Thus the strategy “move to a circle of radius slightly less than ¼, orbit
until the tiger is a trifle more than 180° away, then head straight for
shore” guarantees your safe escape.",True

Denote by Rk the number of marbles remaining after the k‑th friend has received his share
(k = 0 means before anyone gets marbles, so R0 = N).

1. Mike receives ½ of the marbles.  
   R1 = N − N/2 = N/2.

2. Paul then receives ⅓ of what is left.  
   R2 = R1 − R1/3 = (2/3)·(N/2) = N/3.

3. Dave receives ¼ of what is left.  
   R3 = (3/4)·(N/3) = N/4.

A clear pattern appears: after the k‑th friend (whose fraction is 1/(k+1)) has been served,

  Rk = N/(k+1).            (∗)

This can be proved by induction, and we have already checked the first three cases.

Consequently, just before the (k+1)‑st friend is served, the amount on hand is
Rk = N/(k+1).
For that friend to receive exactly 1/(k+2) of this amount, Rk must be divisible by (k+2); i.e.

  N/(k+1) is divisible by (k+2).         (†)

Rewriting (†) gives the necessary divisibility condition

  N is divisible by (k+1)(k+2).

The friends use the fractions 1/2, 1/3, … , 1/10,

Therefore N must be a multiple of the least common multiple of these nine numbers.

Prime factorizations  
2 = 2  
6 = 2·3  
12 = 2²·3  
20 = 2²·5  
30 = 2·3·5  
42 = 2·3·7  
56 = 2³·7  
72 = 2³·3²  
90 = 2·3²·5

Take the highest powers of each prime:

 2³, 3², 5¹, 7¹  ⇒ LCM = 2³·3²·5·7 = 8·9·5·7 = 2520.

Thus the smallest possible starting number is N = 2520.

By (∗), after the ninth and final friend (Will, who takes 1/10 of what remains),
Justin has

 R9 = N/10 = 2520 / 10 = 252 marbles.

No smaller positive remainder is possible, because any smaller starting number would fail to satisfy at least one of the divisibility conditions (†).

After a while, they got bored with this, so Arnold decided to place a bet. He would ask Will one teaser, which he thought was very hard. If Will got it right, Arnold would clean his room for the rest of the year. However, if Will got it WRONG, he would have to clean Arnold's room for a year and do his dishes for a month. After thinking for a while, Will agreed to this. This was Arnold's teaser:
Use each digit 1-9 only once each, so that one number multiplied by another equals the third. One example is 12*483=5796. Name at least one more!!!

(two–digit number) × (three–digit number) = (four–digit number)

with every digit 1–9 used exactly once and never repeated is the following.

1.  Total number of digits.  
   Taking a 2–digit number times a 3–digit number gives a 4–digit product;  
   2 + 3 + 4 = 9, so every digit 1–9 can appear exactly once.

2.  The unit (right‑hand) digit of the product must be even, because an even digit
    has to appear somewhere and the product of two numbers is even
    whenever at least one of them is even.  
    Denote the two numbers by 10a + b and 100c + 10d + e.  
    The unit digit of their product is (b·e) mod 10.

3.  Aim for the product to end in 6, because 6 can be produced by several pairs
    of distinct digits: (2,3), (3,2), (7,8), (8,7), (1,6), (6,1), (9,4), (4,9).  
    Choosing the pair (7, 8) is attractive: it uses one odd and one even digit,
    and it instantly determines the unit digits of the two factors.

4.  Fix the unit digits:
        • let the 2–digit factor end in 7;  
        • let the 3–digit factor end in 8.
    Giving the shorter factor the remaining small even digit 2 makes it 27.

   So temporarily take        27 × ( c d 8 )  =  … … … 6.

5.  Digits already used are 2,7,8.  The six unused digits are 1,3,4,5,6,9.
    The three‑digit multiplicand (c d 8) must therefore use three of
    {1,3,4,5,6,9}, none of which can be 2 or 7 or 8.

6.  Size considerations.  Because 27·100 = 2700 and 27·400 = 10 800,
    the multiplicand must lie between 100 and about 365 to keep the product a
    four‑digit number.  The only numbers of that shape within the interval and
    ending in 8 are

          128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 198, 218, 238, 258, 268, 298, 318, … .

    Those that reuse 2 or 7 are invalid; cross them off.  The small list left to
    check is therefore 138, 158, 168, 178, 198.

7.  Check them one by one (only five quick mental multiplications):

        27 × 138 = 3726   (digit 7 appears twice → reject)  
        27 × 158 = 4266   (digit 6 repeats → reject)  
        27 × 168 = 4536   (digit 6 repeats → reject)  
        27 × 178 = 4806   (digit 8 repeats → reject)  
        27 × 198 = 5346   (all digits 1–9 appear exactly once!)

8.  Thus the sought‑after pandigital identity is

        27 × 198 = 5346.

Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.

If R=6, X=3, the remaining digits are 2, 4, 7, and again we can't choose S=F+1.
If R=7, X=4, the remaining digits are 2, 3, 6, where 3=2+1. Hence S=3, F=2.

110,A man has nine children born at regular intervals. The sum of the square of their ages is equal to the square of his own age. What are the ages of his children?,,"The ages are 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23 and 26. The man's age is 48.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the common interval between successive births be d years.

Because there are nine children it is natural to write their ages symmetrically about the middle one:

m−4d , m−3d , m−2d , m−d , m , m+d , m+2d , m+3d , m+4d             (1)

(Here m is the age of the fifth child and d>0 is an integer.)

1.  The “square–sum” condition  

    The sum of the squares of the nine ages is  

    ∑_{k=−4}^{4}(m+kd)^2 = 9m^2 + d^2·∑_{k=−4}^{4}k^2  
                          = 9m^2 + d^2·60                   (because 1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2 = 30).

    If F is the father’s age, the data give

                        F^2 = 9m^2 + 60d^2.                             (2)

2.  Converting (2) to a product  

   Write Y = 3m.  Then (2) becomes

                F^2 − Y^2 = 60d^2   ⇒   (F−Y)(F+Y) = 60d^2.            (3)

   Because F and Y have the same parity, both factors on the left of (3) are even.  
   Hence the possibilities for the smaller factor are 2, 4, 6, … .

   •  If F−Y = 2, then F+Y = 30d^2.  
      But Y = (F+Y) − (F−Y) )/2 = 15d^2−1 is not divisible by 3, contradicting Y = 3m.  

   •  If F−Y = 4, an analogous calculation shows Y =  (15d^2−2) is again not a multiple of 3.

   Therefore the least admissible value is

                               F − Y = 6.                               (4)

3.  Consequences of (4)

   Put F−Y = 6 in (3); then F+Y = 10d^2.  Solving

                F = ½(6+10d^2) = 3 + 5d^2,       Y = ½(10d^2−6)=5d^2−3.   (5)

   Because Y = 3m, (5) yields

                        m = (5d^2−3)/3.                                (6)

   For m to be integral, 3 must divide d, say d = 3k (k a positive integer).

   Insert d = 3k in (5)–(6):

            F = 3 + 45k^2,      m = 15k^2 − 1,      d = 3k.             (7)

4.  Ensuring all nine ages are positive

   The youngest child is m−4d = 15k^2 − 1 − 12k = 15k^2 − 12k − 1.

   This is positive for k = 1 (it equals 2) and grows rapidly thereafter.
   If k ≥ 2 the youngest child is already at least 35 years old, making the
   father unreasonably old (F ≥ 183 years).  Customary age–problem conventions
   discard such possibilities, so we take the minimal admissible value

                               k = 1.                                   (8)

5.  Determined ages

   With k = 1 we have d = 3 and m = 14.  Substituting in (1) gives

        14−4·3 = 2,    14−3·3 = 5,    14−2·3 = 8,    14−3 = 11,
        14,            14+3 = 17,     14+2·3 = 20,   14+3·3 = 23,
        14+4·3 = 26.

   Thus the children are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23 and 26 years old.  
   (The father’s age is then F = 48 years, and indeed
   2²+5²+…+26² = 2304 = 48².)

He was there on Sunday and when the radio gave the time at the hour, Mad Ade noticed that the Madadian antique clock, designed by Madadian clock maker Arthur Minit (teaser #4891) was exactly 3 minutes slow.
""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.

In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.

If the cold handle is turned through θ degrees (with 0 ≤ θ ≤ 360), we assume the flow it supplies is proportional to the fraction of a full turn:

cold flow  =  (θ / 360°) C.

When the two streams mix, the equilibrium temperature T of the mixture is the flow‑weighted average:

T = (H·105° F  +  (θ/360)C·45° F) / (H + (θ/360)C).

Customary plumbing gives the same maximum flow through each line when fully open, so we take C = H.  Setting T = 98.6° F,

(105H + 45H θ/360) / (H + H θ/360) = 98.6.

Cancel the common factor H:

(105 + 45θ/360) / (1 + θ/360) = 98.6.

Multiply by the denominator:

105 + 45θ/360 = 98.6 + 98.6 θ/360.

Bring like terms together:

105 – 98.6 = (98.6 – 45) θ/360  
6.4 = 53.6 θ/360.

Solve for θ:

θ = 360·6.4 / 53.6  
θ = 2880 / 67 ≈ 42.99°.

Therefore you must rotate the cold‑water faucet about 43 degrees (roughly one‑eighth of a full turn) to obtain a shower temperature of 98.6 °F while the hot water is fully open.

Final answer: Approximately 43 degrees of rotation.",True

  P = rev(S) ,                              (1)  

i.e. P is obtained from S by reversing its digits.

Denote the digits of S by S = 100x + 10y + z (x ≠ 0, z ≠ 0).  
Then (1) gives  

  P = 100z + 10y + x.                     (2)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  A quadratic condition
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The numbers a and b are the roots of

  t² – S t + P = 0,

so the discriminant must be a perfect square:

  Δ = S² – 4P = d², d ∈ ℤ.               (3)

Hence (u , v) = (a , b) is a factor pair of rev(S) whose sum is S.

2.  One of the factors is one–digit
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Since P ≤ 999 and S ≥ 100, we have

  a·b ≤ 999  and  a + b ≥ 100.

If both a and b were at least 10, then a + b ≥ 20 and

  a·b ≥ 10·(a + b – 10) ≥ 10·90 = 900,

so at most one factor can be two–digit.

Here x, z ∈ {1,…,9}, y ∈ {0,…,9}.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Solving (7) for k = 2,…,9
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For every k ≠ 2 the congruences yielded by (7) give contradictions:

• k = 3: 19x – 17z ≡ 9 (mod 20) → no integral (x, z, y).  
• k = 4: all coefficients divisible by 3 but RHS = 16 ≡ 1 (mod 3).  
• k = 5: 499x ≡ 25 (mod 5) forces x = 5 ⇒ impossible for y, z.  
• k = 6: x – z ≡ 4 or –1 (mod 5) ⇒ no admissible y.  
• k = 7: LHS divisible by 3, RHS = 49 ≡ 1 (mod 3).  
• k = 8: left side is odd, right side even.  
• k = 9: left side even, right side odd.

Only k = 2 survives.  For k = 2, equation (7) becomes

  199x + 10y – 98z = 4.                                (8)

Because 199x – 98z must lie between –96 and 4, try x = 4, z = 9
(199·4 – 98·9 = –86).  
Then (8) gives y = 9, and

  S = 100·4 + 10·9 + 9 = 499, P = rev(S) = 994.

Finally

  a = S – k = 499 – 2 = 497, b = k = 2,

and indeed

  497 + 2 = 499,  497·2 = 994 = rev(499).            (9)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  No solution when the smaller factor has two digits
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Let the smaller factor be k, 10 ≤ k ≤ 31 (k > 31 is impossible because
k·(k + 1) > 999).  
Inequality (7) with x = 1 gives the necessary condition

  100k – 1 ≤ k² + 9(100 – k),
  k² – 109k + 901 ≥ 0.                                (10)

But for 10 ≤ k ≤ 99 the left side of (10) is negative
(the quadratic’s real roots are ≈ 9.0 and ≈ 99.9),
hence (10) cannot hold and no solution exists.

The only possible pair is the one found for k = 2.

  497 + 2 = 499,  497 × 2 = 994,

(If a number is not abundant, it clearly cannot be weird.)

12 = 1+2+3+6  
18 = 9+6+3  
20 = 10+5+4+1  
24 = 12+8+4  
30 = 15+10+5

54 = 27+18+9  
56 = 28+14+8+4+2  
60 = 30+20+10  
66 = 33+22+11  

Every abundant number below 70 is therefore semiperfect; none of them can be weird.

Now examine 70.

Its proper divisors are  
1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, whose total is 1+2+5+7+10+14+35 = 74 > 70, so 70 is abundant.

Assume, for contradiction, that some subset of these divisors sums to 70.

• If 35 is not in the subset, the largest possible sum is  
14+10+7+5+2+1 = 39 < 70, impossible.  
Hence 35 must belong to the subset.

• With 35 included we still need another 35.  The remaining divisors are  
14, 10, 7, 5, 2, 1, and they add to 39.  Achieving 35 with them means “leaving out’’ 4.  
But no combination of 14, 10, 7, 5, 2, 1 totals 4 (the only possibilities are 1+1+2 or 2+2 or 4 itself, none of which exists here).  
Thus no subset of the proper divisors of 70 can sum to 70.

Therefore 70 is abundant but not semiperfect – i.e. 70 is weird.

Since every abundant number below 70 is semiperfect, 70 is the smallest weird number.

They agreed that each should cut one-half of the area. Junior went first, and cut a border 2 metres wide all the way around.
After doing a few sums, Little Miss agreed that exactly one-half had been cut and happily cut the rest.
What was the area of the lawn?",,Area of lawn was 186.51 square metres,GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the lawn be a square of side s metres; thus its total area is

Junior mows a 2 m–wide strip all round the boundary.  
What remains un‑cut is the inner square of side (s − 4) m (because 2 m is removed from each of the four sides).

Area mown by Junior = area of outside square − area of inner square  
                      = s² − (s − 4)²  
                      = s² − (s² − 8s + 16)  
                      = 8s − 16.

By agreement this is exactly one‑half of the whole lawn:

8s − 16 = ½ s².

Multiply by 2:

16s − 32 = s²  
s² − 16s + 32 = 0.

Solve the quadratic:

s = [16 ± √(16² − 4·32)] / 2

Finally add 1 because we start with 1 piece: n*(n+1)/2 + 1.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let P(n) denote the greatest possible number of pizza pieces obtainable with n straight cuts.

1.  Basis step  
   With no cut, P(0)=1 (the whole pizza).

2.  How a new cut can add pieces  
   Suppose we have already made k−1 cuts in the best possible way, giving P(k−1) pieces.  
   Arrange the k‑th cut so that

   • it is not parallel to any previous cut, and  
   • it does not pass through any intersection point of earlier cuts.  

   Then it meets each of the k−1 earlier cuts in a distinct interior point of the pizza, so the new cut is divided into k segments.  
   Each of those segments lies wholly inside one of the old pieces, and each such segment splits that piece in two.  
   Hence the k‑th cut increases the number of pieces by exactly k:

                 P(k)=P(k−1)+k.                                (1)

3.  Solve the recurrence  
   Starting from P(0)=1 and applying (1):

   P(1)=1+1  
   P(2)=P(1)+2=(1+1)+2  
   P(3)=P(2)+3=(1+1+2)+3

4.  Optimality  
   The arrangement described (no two cuts parallel, no three concurrent inside the pizza) is feasible for every n, so the number in (2) is attainable.  
   Any violation of those conditions makes the k‑th cut intersect fewer than k−1 earlier cuts, so it adds fewer than k pieces; thus no other arrangement can exceed the number in (2).

Therefore the maximum number of pieces obtainable with n straight cuts is

Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.

    • 5 + F divisible by 3  ⇒ F ≡ 1 (mod 3).  
    The even digits {2, 4, 6, 8} give only F = 4.  

3.  FG must be divisible by 7 with F = 4  ⇒ FG ∈ {42, 49}.  
    42 would repeat the digit 2 later in GH (see 4), so take FG = 49 → G = 9.

4.  GH must be divisible by 8 with G = 9  ⇒ GH = 96 → H = 6.

5.  HI must be divisible by 9.  Since 9‑divisibility for a 2‑digit number is “digit‑sum multiple of 9”,  
    6 + I ≡ 0 (mod 9)  ⇒ I = 3.

Used so far: 5, 4, 9, 6, 3.  Remaining digits: 1, 2, 7, 8.

6.  AB must be even  ⇒ B = 2 or 8.

7.  BC must be divisible by 3 (digit‑sum test).

8.  CD must be divisible by 4.

Work these possibilities.

• If B = 2, the only C that make 2 + C divisible by 3 are C = 1 or 7, but neither choice allows a CD divisible by 4 with the remaining digits.  Hence B ≠ 2.

• Take B = 8.  
  Remaining digits: 1, 2, 7 for A, C, D.

 a)  C = 1 (since 8 + 1 = 9 is divisible by 3).  
  Then D must give CD divisible by 4: CD = 12 works (D = 2).  
  The leftover digit is A = 7.  
  Sequence: 7 8 1 2 5 4 9 6 3 → 781254963.

 b)  C = 7 (8 + 7 = 15 divisible by 3).  
  CD must be divisible by 4: CD = 72 works (D = 2).  
  Leftover digit A = 1.  
  Sequence: 1 8 7 2 5 4 9 6 3 → 187254963.

Both satisfy every condition:

AB divisible by 2   → 78, 18  
BC divisible by 3   → 81, 87  
CD divisible by 4   → 12, 72  
DE divisible by 5   → 25  
EF divisible by 6   → 54  
FG divisible by 7   → 49  
GH divisible by 8   → 96  
HI divisible by 9   → 63  

Hence exactly two 9‑digit numbers work.

122,"The people of Olde Mathville had unique ways of punishing wayward citizens.   For example, those convicted of crimes of dishonesty were chained to the Liars' Rail until they solved a number of puzzles.
One such puzzle has been recently discovered!
In the multiplication below, each letter - L, I, A, R, and S - takes the place of a different digit.   Find the digits to make the multiplication true.

--------
R A I L
or: L I A R  x  S  =  R A I L",The product of S x L must be less than 10.  Combining that with the need for S x R to end in L limits the possibilities quickly.,"L=2, I=1, A=7, R=8, and S=4

One possible solution guide:
* SxL<10, as the product is a 4-digit number; S can not = 1
... so S,L can be 2,3; 2,4; 3,1; 3,2; 4,1; 4,2
* but SxR ends in L - and if S or R is even, so is L
... so S,L,R can be 2,4,7; 3,1,7; 3,2,4; 4,2,8
* the first three are quickly rejected by checking the multiplication
... S=4, L=2, R=8
* Since 2000 x 4 = 8000, nothing has been carried from multiplying the hundreds digit
... so I=1 or 0
* I=0 is rejected as '3' tens have been carried forward from multiplying 4x8; the 3 must be added to 7 to give 0 in the bottom line, and we cannot have 4 x __ = 7.
... so I=1

          S    = one–digit multiplier (2–9)  
          RAIL = 1000R + 100A + 10I + L .

Multiplying LIAR by S produces the four‐digit number RAIL, so

     S·(1000L + 100I + 10A + R) = 1000R + 100A + 10I + L.      (1)

Instead of expanding (1) outright, follow the ordinary one–digit multiplication and record the carries.

      S·L + c₃ = R     and     S·L + c₃ ≤ 9.             (5)

Because S ≥ 2, (5) forces S·L to be very small; in fact

          S·L ≤ 9  ⇒  possible (S , L) pairs  
            2 : L = 1,2,3,4        6 : L = 1

            5 : L = 1              9 : L = 1.

Congruence coming from (2) and (5)

Eliminate R between (2) and (5):

          R ≡ S·L + c₃          (mod 10)
          S·R ≡ L               (mod 10)

⇒        S(S·L + c₃) ≡ L       (mod 10)

⇒        L(S² – 1) + S·c₃ ≡ 0  (mod 10).                (6)

Now test each admissible S.

•  S = 2 :  3L + 2c₃ ≡ 0 (mod 10).  
  With L = 1–4 and c₃ ≤ 1 (since 2L + c₃ ≤ 9), no solution.

•  S = 3 :  8L + 3c₃ ≡ 0 (mod 10).  
  Only (L, c₃) = (1,4) satisfies the congruence, but then (4) gives  
        3I + c₂ = 10·4 + A ≥ 40, impossible (left‑hand side ≤ 35).  
  So S = 3 is impossible.

•  S = 4 :  equation (6) becomes 5L + 4c₃ ≡ 0 (mod 10).

   – L = 1:  5 + 4c₃ is always odd, never ≡ 0 mod 10 – impossible.  
   – L = 2:  gives 10 + 4c₃ ≡ 0 ⇒ 4c₃ ≡ 0 ⇒ c₃ = 0 or 5.  
             But (5) demands 4·2 + c₃ ≤ 9 ⇒ c₃ = 0.

   Thus S = 4, L = 2, c₃ = 0.  
   Then (5) gives R = 4·2 + 0 = 8.

   Continue with (4): 4I + c₂ = A.  
   Because A is a single digit, 4I + c₂ ≤ 9 ⇒ I ≤ 2.

     · I = 0: A = c₂, and (3) becomes 4A + c₁ = 10c₂.  
              Using (2): 4·R = 32 = 10c₁ + L ⇒ c₁ = 3.  
              4c₂ + 3 = 10c₂ ⇒ 3 = 6c₂ ⇒ impossible.

     · I = 1: 4·1 + c₂ = A = 4 + c₂.  
              (3): 4A + c₁ = 10c₂ + 1  
                   ⇒ 4(4 + c₂) + 3 = 10c₂ + 1  
                   ⇒ 19 + 4c₂ = 10c₂ + 1  
                   ⇒ 6c₂ = 18 ⇒ c₂ = 3.  
              Then A = 4 + 3 = 7, all digits distinct.

     · I = 2 would make 4I = 8 and force c₂ ≤ 1, but  
       (3) yields a contradiction; hence I = 2 impossible.

   The only consistent set is

           S = 4,   L = 2,   I = 1,   A = 7,   R = 8.

The least common multiple of 242=2*11^2, 160=2^5*5, 64=2^6 and 22=2*11 is 2^6*5*11^2=38720.

and let n be the number of revolutions made by the largest wheel A.  
Because two wheels in mesh turn in opposite directions and their angular
displacements are inversely proportional to their numbers of teeth, we have successively

1.  Wheel B  
   revolutions = – n·A/B = – n·242/160 = – n·121/80.

2.  Wheel C

For every wheel to be back in its initial orientation each must have executed an
integral number of revolutions.

• For wheel B: n·121/80 must be an integer  ⇒  n is a multiple of 80.  
• For wheel C: n·121/32 must be an integer  ⇒  n is a multiple of 32.  
(The factor 121 causes no further restriction because 121 and 80,32 are coprime.)

Hence n must be a common multiple of 80 and 32.  
The least common multiple is

lcm(80, 32) = 2⁵·5 = 160.

With n = 160 we obtain

revs of B = –121·2  = –242   (integer)  
revs of C =  121·5  =  605   (integer)  
revs of D = –11·160 = –1760  (integer),

Each man travels at their own constant rate.",The bicycle may be left at any point along the bridge and may be ridden in either direction. Every man should finish at the same time.,"A's speed is 1/10 (in bridges per minute), B's speed is 1/5, C's speed is 1/2, and the bicycle's speed is 1.
The fastest way to get everyone across is for B and C to start out on foot and A to start out with the bicycle. At a point y, A will get off the bicycle and walk the rest of the way. Eventually C will get to the bicycle abandoned by A, then ride back to a point x, leaving the bicycle there, then turning around and walk until he reaches the end. Person B will walk until he reaches the bicycle left by C and then ride the rest of the way.
Below are the times that each will take to cross, in terms of x and y:
A: 1*y + 10*(1-y)
B: 5*x + 1*(1-x)
C: 2*y + (y-x) + 2*(1-x)
Next equate these equations: 10 - 9y = -3x + 3y + 2 = 4x + 1.

0 min A starts on the bicycle; B and C start walking.  
1 min A arrives at F (and keeps the bicycle there).  
2 min C finishes walking to F.  
5 min B finishes walking to F.

All three are across in 5 minutes.

------------------------------------------------
II.  Why 5 minutes is the minimum
------------------------------------------------
1.  A must ride the bicycle.  
   • On foot A needs 10 min, so any schedule shorter than 10 min compels A to use the bicycle.

2.  Suppose someone other than A also rides the bicycle.  
   • To let a second rider start from S, the bicycle must first be returned from F to S.  
   • Thus at least three bicycle trips are needed:  
     S→F (1 min), F→S (1 min), S→F (1 min) ⇒ 3 minutes already elapsed.

3.  Who can make the return trip F→S?  
   • At the instant the bicycle first reaches F, the only person there is the one who has just ridden it.  
   • Hence that same person must bring the bicycle back.  
     – If that person is A, he is again on S after 2 min and still has to cross on foot (10 min).  
       Finish time ≥ 2 + 10 = 12 min.  
     – If that person is B, he will still have to cross on foot (5 min).  
       Finish time ≥ 2 + 5 = 7 min.  
     – If that person is C, he still has to cross on foot (2 min) but B has not yet started with the bicycle;  
       after C’s walk (2 min) and the second bicycle trip (another 1 min) B would still need 5 min on foot.  
       Finish time ≥ 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 8 min.

   In every case the total time exceeds 5 minutes.

4.  Therefore no schedule in which more than one man rides the bicycle can beat 5 minutes.  
   The only possibility for T < 5 would be to have exactly one bicycle rider, and that rider must be A.  
   With A riding, the other two must walk; the slower walker is B (5 min), so the finish time cannot be below 5 minutes.

------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
------------------------------------------------
The schedule in part I attains 5 minutes, and part II proves that no schedule can do better.

Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.

   n₀ cannot be 0 (because d₀ would also be 0 and we possess only one 0).  
   Trying all available digits whose doubles give available final digits leaves

   n₀ ∈ {1 (d₀=2), 2 (d₀=4), 3 (d₀=6), 5 (d₀=0 with carry 1), 6 (d₀=2 with carry 1)}.

2.  Take n₀ = 5 (the only choice that places the unique 0 in D, not in N).  
   Then d₀ = 0 and c₁ = 1; the digits 5 and 0 are now used.

3.  Tens digit.  
   Choose n₁ so that 2n₁ + 1 is a single available digit (≤ 9).  
   The possibilities are n₁ = 1 (gives d₁=3), n₁ = 4 (gives d₁=9).  
   Taking n₁ = 4 is the only choice that avoids re‑using the single digit 5 or introducing an unavailable digit.  
   Hence d₁ = 9; digits 4 and 9 are now used.

4.  Hundreds digit.  
   Carry has now fallen to 0.  
   Pick n₂ so that 2n₂ is an unused available digit.  
   Take n₂ = 1 (d₂ = 2).  
   Digits 1 and the first 2 are now used.

5.  Thousands digit.  
   Again 2n₃ must be an unused available digit.  
   Take n₃ = 2 (the second 2), giving d₃ = 4.  
   Digits 2 and the second 4 are now used.

6.  Ten‑thousands digit.  
   The only digits still unused are 3 and 6, with carry still 0.  
   For D to remain five‑digit we need 2n₄ ≤ 9, so n₄ = 3 (not 6).  
   Then d₄ = 6.

Collecting the digits:

N = n₄ n₃ n₂ n₁ n₀ = 3 2 1 4 5 = 32145  
D = d₄ d₃ d₂ d₁ d₀ = 6 4 2 9 0 = 64290

Every original digit (0,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,9) appears exactly once, and

64290 ÷ 2 = 32145.

Hence the required fraction is

32145 / 64290 = 1/2.

Final answer: 32145/64290",True
129,"Xavier and Rex were playing a game that involved 5 dice. In each turn, they would roll the 5 dice. Each face of the die is worth a different amount of points. On their first 2 shots, they rolled this:
Xavier 1: 1, 3, 3, 4, 6 = 177 points
Rex 1: 2, 4, 4, 5, 6 = 268 points
Xavier 2: 1, 1, 1, 4, 4 = 203 points
Rex 2: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 = 216 points
Using this information, can you work out how many points Xavier and Rex each got on their third turn and how many points each face is worth?
Xavier 3: 1, 2, 2, 3, 4 = ?
Rex 3: 1, 3, 4, 6, 6 = ?",Xavier scored more than Rex and the difference between the two total scores is 26 points.,"Xavier: 281 (Total: 661)

1 = 25 points
2 = 77 points
3 = 38 points
4 = 64 points
5 = 51 points
6 = 12 points
From Xavier's first shot and Rex's second shot, we can deduce that a 2 is worth more than a 3. From Xavier's second shot, we can deduce that a 1 is worth an odd number. By trial and error we can work out the value of each face.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the number of points awarded by the faces 1,2,3,4,5,6 be  

v₁ , v₂ , v₃ , v₄ , v₅ , v₆   (all different real numbers).

The four scores that are supplied in the statement give the four linear
equations  

(1) v₁+2v₃+v₄+v₆ = 177  
(2) v₂+2v₄+v₅+v₆ = 268  
(3) 3v₁+2v₄      = 203  
(4) v₁+v₂+v₃+v₄+v₆ = 216.

Solving (3) for v₄ and inserting it in (1) and (4) shows that
equations (1) and (4) are identical; eliminating v₂ from (1) and (2)
gives v₂ = v₃+39.  A convenient way to parameterise all solutions is to
set  

t = 2v₃+v₆ .

Writing everything in terms of t and v₃ one obtains  

v₁ = 2t–151  v₂ = v₃+39  v₄ = 328–3t  
v₅ = v₃+5t–427  v₆ = t–2v₃,

where t and v₃ may be chosen freely subject only to the obvious
conditions that the six v’s be different (and positive, if one wishes
to count only positive scores).  For every admissible pair (t , v₃)
these six numbers satisfy the four given equations, so the data of the
problem determine a whole two‑parameter family of dice.

The scores for the third throws are

Xavier 3   Sₓ = v₁+2v₂+v₃+v₄ = v₃–v₆+255 = 3v₃–t+255,
Rex 3     Sᵣ = v₁+v₃+v₄+2v₆ = –v₃+v₆+177 = t–3v₃+177,

and they fulfil Sₓ+Sᵣ = 432 for every admissible (t , v₃).  In other
words, the only quantity that the given information fixes uniquely is
the sum of the two scores in the third round; the individual scores and
the values of the six faces cannot be pinned down any further.

For instance
t = 90 , v₃ = 20 gives
(v₁,…,v₆) = (29,59,20,58,43,50) and
(Xavier 3,Rex 3) = (225,207);

t = 100 , v₃ = 30 gives
(v₁,…,v₆) = (49,69,30,28,103,40) and
(Xavier 3,Rex 3) = (245,187);

both satisfy every condition of the problem.

Hence neither the individual third‑round scores nor the six face
values are uniquely determined; there are infinitely many consistent
possibilities.

Final answer:  The data supplied are insufficient to determine either
the six face‑values or the two third‑round scores uniquely; the only
fixed quantity is that Xavier’s and Rex’s third‑round scores must add
to 432 points.",True
130,You land on an unknown planet which has a radius of 10km and is completely round and smooth. You start from your ship and walk straight for 17.345 kilometers. You turn left and walk straight for 47.124 kilometers. How far are you from your ship?,,"14.142135623730950488016887242097
Or square root of 200!
If you imagine you are facing a globe head on, you have the north pole at the top of the globe and the south pole at the bottom. Imagine a ""west pole"" and ""east pole"" to the left and right of the globe.
If you are at the north pole and turn left, you will walk through the ""west pole"" (right and you go through the ""east pole"")
If you walk on an axis from the north pole towards the south pole and make a left or right turn you will always walk through these imaginary east and west poles. So in the question 17.345 kilometers is irrelevant, only the turn.
(It also doesn't matter where you start on the planet, the distance at the end will still be the same.)
47.124 is approximately 3/4 of the circumference of this planet, which will leave you directly on the imaginary east pole. The distance is now the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle of side 10km.
Answer: root 200 or approximately 14km!
(If you got the distance as 15.7km - the distance you would have to walk back, then that's ok too!)",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let R = 10 km be the radius of the (perfectly spherical) planet.  
On a sphere, a “straight” walk is a portion of a great‑circle and its length s corresponds to a central angle θ = s/R (measured in radians).

1.  First leg  
   s₁ = 17.345 km  
   θ₁ = s₁ / R = 17.345 / 10 = 1.7345 rad.  
   We may fix coordinates so that the ship is at the North Pole.  
   After travelling through the meridian by the angle θ₁ we reach a point A whose
   position vector is  
   OA = (sin θ₁, 0, cos θ₁).

2.  Direction at A  
   At A we are facing due south (along the meridian).  
   Turning left means taking the eastward direction, whose unit tangent vector at A is  
   e = (0, sin θ₁, 0).

3.  The great circle for the second leg  
   The plane of the great circle that starts at A in the direction e is determined by OA and e.  
   Its normal (unit) vector is  
          n = OA × e / |OA × e| = (–cos θ₁, 0, sin θ₁).

4.  Second leg  
   s₂ = 47.124 km ≈ 15π km, hence  
   θ₂ = s₂ / R ≈ 15π / 10 = 3π/2 rad = 270°.  
   Moving through an angle θ₂ along that great circle rotates the position vector OA about the axis n by the same angle.  
   Rodrigues’ formula gives the new position vector

          OB = OA cos θ₂ + (n × OA) sin θ₂ + n (n·OA)(1 – cos θ₂).

   Because n·OA = 0 and cos θ₂ = cos (3π/2) = 0, this simplifies to

          OB = (n × OA) sin θ₂.

   A quick calculation yields n × OA = (0, 1, 0), and sin θ₂ = sin (3π/2) = –1, so

          OB = (0, –1, 0).

5.  Angle between start and finish  
   The starting position vector is OS = (0, 0, 1).  
   Their dot product is

          OS · OB = (0, 0, 1) · (0, –1, 0) = 0.

   Therefore the central angle γ between S and B satisfies cos γ = 0, i.e.

          γ = π/2  (90°).

6.  Required distance  
   The shortest surface distance from B back to the ship is

          d = R γ = 10 km · π/2 = 5π km ≈ 15.708 km.

(If one wants the straight‑line, through‑the‑air distance, it is  
2R sin(γ/2) = 2·10·sin(45°) = 10√2 km ≈ 14.142 km.)

Final answer: 5π km (approximately 15.708 kilometres).",True

L₀ = 3 in  (initial length of the rubber band)  
and after every whole minute the free end is pulled so that the total length
increases by 3 in.

Thus after n complete minutes (immediately after the nth stretch)

          Lₙ = 3(n + 1)  inches.            (1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Describing the spider’s progress minute by minute
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Let Pₙ be the fraction of the band that the spider has reached
immediately after the nth stretching (so P₀ = 0).

During the (n+1)st minute the band is kept fixed at length Lₙ
and the spider walks 1 in /min with respect to the band.
Hence in that minute its fractional progress is

          1 inch ÷ Lₙ inches  =  1 / Lₙ.

Consequently  

          Pₙ₊₁ = Pₙ + 1/Lₙ.                (2)

Combining (1) and (2):

          Pₙ₊₁ = Pₙ + 1/[3(n+1)].          (3)

Iterating (3) gives

          Pₙ = 1/3 · (1 + 1/2 + … + 1/n)    
              =  (1/3) Hₙ ,                (4)

where Hₙ is the nth harmonic number.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  How many full minutes are needed?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The spider reaches (or passes) the far end as soon as P ≥ 1.

We need the smallest n with Hₙ ≥ 3.

H₁₀  =  1 + ½ + … + ¹⁄₁₀  = 7381/2520 ≈ 2.928968 < 3  
H₁₁  =  H₁₀ + 1/11           ≈ 3.019877 > 3.

So the spider is still short of the end after ten complete minutes,
and reaches it sometime during the eleventh minute
(i.e. while the length is still L₁₀ = 33 in).

3.  Exact time within the 11‑th minute
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Fraction already covered at 10 min:

          P₁₀ = H₁₀ / 3 = 7381/7560.

Fraction still to go:

          1 – P₁₀ = (7560 – 7381)/7560 = 179/7560.

While the length is fixed at 33 in, the spider’s fractional speed is

          1 in /min ÷ 33 in = 1/33 per minute.

Time needed in that minute:

          (fraction remaining) ÷ (fraction per minute)
        = (179/7560) ÷ (1/33)
        = (179 · 33) / 7560

133,"A postman delivered letters every day. On the first day he delivered one letter, on the second day he delivered three letters, on the third day he delivered five letters, and so on. Each day from the second on he delivered two letters more than the preceding day.

Something fun is that the total number of letters he had delivered has its digits arranged in ascending order.
How many days had he worked, and how many letters had he delivered in total?",The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.,"It's easy to see that the number of letters he had delivered is the square of the number of days he had worked.
Square numbers can't end in 7 or 8, and 123456 is not a square because it is divisible by 3 but not by 9. Hence the number of letters must end with 9.
Since odd squares have remainder 1 upon division by 8, the number formed by its fourth and fifth digits must be divisible by 4, which can be 48, 56 or 68.
Numbers that have remainder 2 upon division by 3, and those that are divisible by 3 but not by 9 are not squares. By trial and error, we know that the only square number satisfying these conditions is 134689=367^2.
Hence, he had worked for 367 days, and had delivered 134689 letters.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the postman have worked n days.  
Because he delivered 1, 3, 5, … , 2n–1 letters on the successive days,

 total letters   =   1 + 3 + … + (2n–1)   =   n²                       (known sum of the first n odd numbers).

Hence the number we are looking for is a perfect square that is larger than 100 000
(and at the same time is the square of the number of working days).

1.  Size of n.  
 n²  > 100 000  ⇒  n  ≥ 317  (since 316² = 99 856 < 100 000 < 317² = 100 489).

So n is an integer between 317 and 999, and n² is a 6–digit number.

2.  Last digit of n².  
A square can finish only with 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9.  
But the digits of n² must be strictly increasing from left to right.

• If it ended in 0 or 1, that 0 or 1 would have to be the greatest digit – impossible.  
• If it ended in 4 or 5, the greatest digit would be 4 or 5, giving fewer than
  six different digits < 4 (or < 5), so a 6–digit strictly increasing number is impossible.  
• If it ended in 6, the only feasible six‑digit candidate would be 123 456, which is plainly
  not a square.

Therefore n² must end in 9, so that

 n  ends in 3 or 7.                               (only 3² and 7² give 9 in the units place)

3.  The case n ≡ 3 (mod 10).  
Write n = 10k + 3 (k ≥ 31).  Then

 n² = 100k² + 60k + 9.

Hence its last two digits are (60k + 9) mod 100, i.e.

 09, 29, 49, 69 or 89

according as k ≡ 0,2,4,6,8 (mod 10) respectively.  

For a six‑digit strictly increasing number the tens digit must exceed 4
(otherwise there are not enough smaller digits available),
so the only admissible endings would be 69 or 89.
That forces k ≡ 1 or 3 (mod 5).  Checking the possible values (323, 333, 343, … , 993)
shows every square obtained either contains a repeated digit or a 0.
Thus n cannot finish with 3.

4.  The case n ≡ 7 (mod 10).  
Write n = 10k + 7.  Then

 n² = 100k² + 140k + 49 = 100k² + 40k + 49 (mod 100),

so again the last two digits are one of

 09, 29, 49, 69 or 89,

now occurring when k ≡ 4,2,0,3,1 (mod 5) respectively.  
As before, the only endings compatible with strictly increasing digits are 69 or 89,
so k ≡ 3 or 1 (mod 5) and n must end in 17 or 67.

Because n ≥ 317, the admissible numbers are

 317, 367, 417, 467, 517, 567, 617, 667, 717, 767, 817, 867, 917, 967.

Their squares are easily calculated:

 317² = 100 489   417² = 173 889   517² = 267 289  
 367² = 134 689   467² = 218 089   567² = 321 489  
 617² = 380 689   667² = 444 889   717² = 514 089  
 767² = 588 289   817² = 667 489   867² = 751 689  
 917² = 840 889   967² = 935 089

Among these, the only one whose digits are in strictly ascending order is

 134 689 = 367²  (1 < 3 < 4 < 6 < 8 < 9).

5.  Conclusion.  
The total number of letters delivered is 134 689, and it is the square of 367.

Therefore the postman worked 367 days and delivered altogether 134 689 letters.

Final answer: 367 days, 134 689 letters.",True

ρ = pedestrian density (persons per kilometre).  
East‑bound pedestrians move with velocity +4 km/h and the same number move west with velocity −4 km/h.

During one hour the cab and the two groups close |v – 4| and |v + 4| kilometres respectively, so the cab meets

N(v)=ρ(|v – 4|+|v + 4|) pedestrians per hour.  

This meeting rate is proportional to the cab‑driver’s “chance of picking up a fare.”

617 is the mystery number.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the mystery number be the three–digit prime  
ABC (A is the hundreds‑digit, B the tens‑digit, C the units‑digit).

Step 1  –  Restrict the possible unit digit C.  
Because ABC is prime, its units digit can be only 1, 3, or 7.  
Condition 2 says BC is also a two‑digit prime, so C again must be 1, 3, or 7.  
Condition 4 forbids 9, and condition 3 forces the three digits to be distinct.  
Thus C ∈ {1, 3, 7}.

Step 2  –  Use the “re‑arranged” primes.  
Arrange A, B, C in ascending order n₁n₂n₃ and in descending order n₃n₂n₁; both must be three‑digit primes (conditions 5 and 6).  
The ascending number ends in n₃; for it to be prime n₃ must be 1, 3, or 7.  
Since n₃ is the largest of the three distinct digits, it can only be 7.  
Therefore the set {A, B, C} must contain 7, and 7 is the largest of the three digits.

Step 3  –  Case analysis for the units digit C.

Case 1:  C = 7  
Then B ≠ 7 and, for BC to be prime, B must be 1 or 3 (making BC = 17 or 37, both prime).

 B = 1.  Then AB must be a prime ending in 1.  The only possibilities with distinct digits are 31, 41, 61.  
  A = 3 → ABC = 317, but 731 (descending) = 17·43, not prime.  
  A = 4 → 417 is not prime.  
  A = 6 → ABC = 617, which is prime.

  Check the remaining conditions for 617:  
   AB = 61 (prime)  
   BC = 17 (prime)  
   Ascending: 167 (prime)  
   Descending: 761 (prime)  
  All conditions are met.

 B = 3.  Testing A = 1,2,4,5,8 gives ABC = 137, 237, 437, 537, 837; none satisfy all conditions.  
Hence the only viable number in this case is 617.

Case 2:  C = 3  
Because 7 must be among the digits and the digits are distinct, A = 7.  
Then AB = 7B must be prime, which forces B = 1 (AB = 71).  
But ABC = 713 = 23·31, not prime.  No solution here.

Case 3:  C = 1  
Again a 7 must be among the digits; distinctness makes A = 7.  
BC = B1 requires B ∈ {3,4,6} (31, 41, 61 are prime).  
For ABC = 7B1 to be prime, only B = 3 or 6 work, but  
AB = 7B (73 or 76) must also be prime; only 73 is prime and that gives ABC = 731 = 17·43, composite.  
Thus no solution here.

The only number that satisfies every condition is therefore 617.

136,"Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?
Comments to triflers:
The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!",There are hints in the comments to triflers and in the title.,"80
To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion. This takes 9 trips of 2 5/18 miles (5 advancing trips interspersed with 4 return trips) for a total of 20.5 miles traveled (9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5) and 20.5 bottles of soda used. Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases. With one less case to move, Bu will now make 2 fewer trips. The 3.5 bottles set aside are used to move the four cases the next 1/2 mile toward the Wirth Pavilion.   After this, the Wirth Pavilion is just 2 2/9 miles away ( 5 - 2 5/18 - 9/18 = 2 4/18 ). Next, he travels 15 5/9 miles (7 * 2 2/9) using 15 5/9 bottles of soda to complete his trip. The ranger cadet delivers 80 bottles to the pavilion and has 4/9 of a Park Pop to spare. (96 - 15 5/9 = 80 4/9)",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let one bottle of Park Pop be the (only) unit of fuel:  
one mile ridden always costs exactly one bottle, whether the moped is loaded or empty.

Notation  
• At every moment the MoJoPed may carry at most 25 bottles altogether.  
  One of them is opened and is being used as fuel; the other bottles are
  still unopened.  
• “Load” means the 25‑bottle maximum.  
• At position x miles from the start let N(x) be the number of unopened
  bottles that have been brought this far.

Part I  –  A lower bound: at least 41 bottles must be used as fuel  

Start with 120 bottles ⇒ 5 full loads (because 4 loads would hold only 4·25 =100 bottles).  
If there are n loads that have to be ferried across a strip of road,
each kilometre* of that strip must be travelled

 go (with load)  n times  
 return (empty)  n–1 times  

hence 2 n – 1 traversals, and therefore 2 n – 1 bottles are necessarily
burnt per mile of that strip.

1. While more than 100 bottles remain we still have 5 loads,
   so every mile costs at least 2·5–1 = 9 bottles.
   To reduce the stock from 120 to 100 we must spend at least 20 bottles,
   i.e. we must cover three whole miles (because 2 miles cost only 18).  
   Thus after 3 miles the fuel that is certainly gone is 3·9 = 27 bottles
   and N(3) ≤ 120–27 = 93.

2. Now 93 bottles form 4 loads.
   From here the remaining distance is 2 miles and each of those miles
   needs at least 2·4–1 = 7 bottles.
   Hence a further 2·7 = 14 bottles are unavoidable.

Therefore the absolute minimum number of bottles that must be drunk is

 27 + 14 = 41.

Consequently no strategy can possibly deliver more than

 120 – 41 = 79 unopened bottles.



Part II  –  A strategy that really uses only 41 bottles  

Work mile by mile, caching bottles at each mile‑post.

Mile 0 → Mile 1 (5 loads)  
Make 4 round‑trips and one final one‑way trip.

 each round‑trip: take 24 unopened + 1 fuel bottle  
  forward mile consumes 1, leave 23 unopened,  
  open another bottle for the return mile, arrive empty.

 After 4 such round‑trips: 4·23 = 92 unopened are cached at mile 1,
 8 bottles have been drunk.

 Fifth trip (one‑way): take the remaining 20 bottles,
 open 1 for the mile, arrive with 19 unopened.

 Total at mile 1: 92 + 19 = 111 unopened.  
 Fuel spent so far: 9 bottles.

Mile 1 → Mile 2 (again 5 loads) identical bookkeeping  
Fuel spent on this mile: 9 bottles.  
Stock at mile 2: 111 – 9 = 102 unopened.  
Cumulative fuel: 18 bottles.

Mile 2 → Mile 3 (still 5 loads)  
Fuel for this mile: 9 bottles.  
Stock at mile 3: 102 – 9 = 93 unopened.  
Cumulative fuel: 27 bottles.

Mile 3 → Mile 4 (now only 4 loads)  
Each mile now needs 2·4–1 = 7 bottles.

Fuel for this mile: 7 bottles.  
Stock at mile 4: 93 – 7 = 86 unopened.  
Cumulative fuel: 34 bottles.

Mile 4 → Mile 5 (4 loads again, final mile)  
Fuel for this mile: 7 bottles.  
Stock delivered to Wirth Pavilion (mile 5): 86 – 7 = 79 unopened.  
Total fuel drunk: 34 + 7 = 41 bottles.

The computation matches the theoretical lower bound, so the plan is
optimal.

Conclusion  

The greatest possible number of unopened Park Pop bottles that Cadet Bu
can deliver to the Wirth Pavilion is 79.

137,"Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.  Henry's plan calls for the tracks (each of which is one mile in length) to be laid end-to-end with no gap between them, pinned to the ground at every other juncture, as shown below:
v_______ _______vv_______ _______v
Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""
Henry replies, ""The expansion will only be an inch over the whole mile length.  If the tracks buckle, it will only be by an inch or two at most.  The trains will certainly have no trouble bumping over these buckles.""
Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?",Would Pythagoras have the same plan?,"The rise in the middle of the tracks would have been much greater than Henry surmised.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse). SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the pins be A , B , C … so that  
A is fixed to the ground, B is free, C is fixed, D is free, etc.

Consequently every ​two–mile​ stretch AB‑C, CD‑E … is held fast at its two ends (A and C, C and E …) while the joint in the middle (B, D …) is free.  
If the temperature rises each one‑mile rail lengthens 1 inch; therefore the two rails between two consecutive pins try to become 2 inches longer in all.

The ends A and C, however, are immovable, so the extra 2 inches has to be taken up by a buckle of the rails between A and C.

How large must such a buckle be?

Treat the 2‑mile straight line A C (length L) as the chord of an isosceles triangle whose equal sides are the bent rails.  
If the middle joint rises (or swings sideways) a distance y, each rail has length  
s = √[(L/2)² + y²].

The total length of the two rails is 2s, and this must exceed the chord by δ = 2 inches:

2s – L = δ.

Insert s and solve for y:

2√[(L/2)² + y²] = L + δ  
square ⇒ 4[(L/2)² + y²] = (L + δ)²  
⇒ L² + 4y² = L² + 2Lδ + δ²  
⇒ 4y² = 2Lδ + δ² ≈ 2Lδ (δ ≪ L)

Hence y ≈ √(Lδ / 2).

Now put the numbers in one consistent unit:

L = 2 miles = 2·5280 ft = 10 560 ft  
δ = 2 inches = 2⁄12 ft = 1⁄6 ft

y ≈ √[ (10 560 ft)(1⁄6 ft) / 2 ]  
   = √(10 560 /12)  
   = √880 ≈ 29.7 ft.

So to absorb a mere two‑inch increase in length, the track between two pins would have to heave sideways or upward about thirty feet!

Far from producing a harmless “inch or two” bump, Henry’s scheme would twist the rails into huge serpent‑like kinks that no train could possibly ride over.  
That is why his boss immediately dismissed him.

Final answer: the 2‑inch thermal expansion between fixed pins forces a buckle whose mid‑offset is about 30 feet, not “an inch or two,” so Henry’s plan is disastrously unsafe.",True

The area of DEGH is 32 square feet.
The area of CDH and EFG combined is 16 square feet. You will be able to complete these sections with 8 tiles each after cutting four of the tiles in half diagonally.
The total area is 144 square feet. Allowing 6 extra tiles for breakage brings the order to 150 tiles.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Draw the patio so that AB is horizontal and against the house.

AF ⟂ AB and |AF| = 6 ⇒ F = (0,‑6)  
AF ∥ BC and |BC| = 6 ⇒ C = (16,‑6)

FC ∥ AB, so FC is horizontal; F = (0,‑6), C = (16,‑6).

On FC place  
G with FG = 4  ⇒ G = (4,‑6)  
H with HC = 4  ⇒ H = (12,‑6)

EG ⟂ FG and |EG| = 4, so E = (4,‑10).

DH ⟂ HC and |DH| = 4, so D = (12,‑10).

ED ∥ AB and |ED| = 8; indeed E = (4,‑10), D = (12,‑10) gives ED = 8.

Thus the six vertices of the hexagon, in order, are

Denote by k₁ , k₂ , k₃ , k₄ the borrows that pass from each column to the next one on the left
(k₁ comes from the unit–column, k₂ from the tens–column, …).

1.  Unit‑column  
   a – e ≡ 7 (mod 10)  
   If no borrow were needed we would have a – e = 7 with a ≥ e.  
   That is impossible because a and e are digits (difference 7 would force a ≥ 7).  
   Therefore there is a borrow: k₁ = 1 and  
          a + 10 – e = 7  ⇒  e – a = 3 .                       (1)

2.  Tens‑column (with k₁ = 1)  
   b + 10 – (d + 1) = 5  (because the column result is 5 and a borrow is produced)  
   ⇒ b – d = –4 .                                           (2)  
   Thus k₂ = 1.

3.  Hundreds‑column (top and bottom digits are both c)  
   c – (c + 1) = –1 ⇒ result 9 and another borrow, so k₃ = 1 automatically,  
   and c is free:                                           (3)  
          c = 0,1,…,9.

4.  Thousands‑column (incoming k₃ = 1)  
   There is no outgoing borrow here (otherwise the left–most digit could not be 3),  
   hence  
          d – (b + 1) = 3  and d ≥ b + 1.                   (4)

   Combining (2) and (4):  
          b = d – 4.  
   Substituting this in (4) gives d – (d – 4 + 1) = 3, which is an identity, and
   shows that d can be any digit for which b is a digit, i.e.  

          d = 4,5,6,7,8,9  (so b = 0,1,2,3,4,5).            (5)

   Thus k₄ = 0.

5.  Ten‑thousands column (no incoming borrow)  
   e – a = 3, which is exactly relation (1).

6.  Possible values for a and e  
   Since both numbers are five‑digit numbers, a ≠ 0 and e ≠ 0.  
   From (1): e = a + 3, so a can be 1,2,3,4,5,6 and then  

          (a , e) = (1,4),(2,5),(3,6),(4,7),(5,8),(6,9).    (6)

Summary of the free choices
• a : 6 possibilities (1–6)  
• e : fixed by a  
• d : 6 possibilities (4–9)  
• b : fixed by d (b = d – 4)  
• c : 10 possibilities (0–9)

Hence the total number of original numbers is

          6 · 6 · 10 = 360.

141,"You have two identical ropes and three mice.  Each mouse bites off the rope at a different biting speed.  All three biting speeds are constant.
Mouse(A) bites off one rope in 60 minutes.
Mouse(B) bites off one rope in 90 minutes.
Mouse(C) bites off one rope in 180 minutes.
You do not have any time or distance measuring tools and the length of the rope is unknown.  How can you measure 75 minutes?",,"Mark the two ropes as Rope(A) and Rope(B).
1. Let Mouse(A) and Mouse(C) start biting off Rope(A) at the same time, starting each from  one end (moving in opposite directions).  At the same time, let Mouse(B) start biting off Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(A) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X = S(A) * 60, where S(A) is biting speed for Mouse(A) and X is Rope(A) length
X = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X is Rope(A) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(A)/S(C) = 3:1, which means that for each 3 units Mouse(A) will move, Mouse (C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(A) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(A) bites off three times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides Rope(A) length in to 4 units.
Mouse(A) bitten off portion = 3/4 X (where X is Rope(A) length)
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/4 X
Finding the time spent before Rope(A) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(A) needs  60 minutes to bite off X, How many minutes are needed to bite off 3/4 X?
Minutes needed = 3/4 * 60 = 45 minutes are needed to fully bite off Rope(A) by Mouse(A) and Mouse(C).  At that point in time, Mouse(B) would have bitten off exactly half the length of Rope(B) (needing 90 minutes to bite off the full rope), and needs an additional 45 minutes to bite off the remaining rope half.
2. Let Mouse(B) continue biting off Rope(B) and make Mouse(C) start biting off the other end of Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(B) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X/2 = S(B) * 90, where S(B) is biting speed for Mouse(B) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
X/2 = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(B)/S(C) = 2:1, which means that for each 2 units Mouse(B) will move, Mouse(C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(B) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(B) bites off two times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides the remaining half of Rope(B) length to 3 units.

Keep the mice in sight so that you can act as soon as a rope is completely eaten.

Step 1 – start two simultaneous “timers”.  
• Rope I : put Mouse A at one end and Mouse C at the other end.  
  Their combined speed along the rope is  

  1/60 + 1/180 = 1/45  rope per minute.  

  Therefore they meet and finish Rope I after 45 minutes.  
• Rope II : at the same moment (t = 0) put Mouse B at one end and let him gnaw alone.
  Mouse B’s speed is 1/90 rope per minute.

Step 2 – the 45‑minute signal.  
When A and C meet, Rope I disappears: that visible event tells you that exactly 45 minutes have elapsed.  
In those 45 minutes Mouse B has eaten  

  (45 min)·(1/90 rope/min) = ½ L ,

so exactly half of Rope II remains.

Step 3 – set up the last interval.  
Immediately remove Mice B and C from Rope II and place Mouse A at the still‑untouched far end of the remaining half‑rope.  
Now the only mouse gnawing is Mouse A, and he has to eat precisely ½ L.

Step 4 – finish.  
Mouse A needs 60 minutes for a whole rope, so for half a rope he needs

  60 min × ½ = 30 minutes.

When Mouse A finishes what is left of Rope II, those 30 minutes have passed since the 45‑minute mark.  
Total elapsed time:

  45 minutes + 30 minutes = 75 minutes.

Because no clock, ruler, or numerical calculation is used during the procedure—only the observable moments when a rope is completely chewed—this gives an exact 75‑minute interval.

Final answer: let A and C start on opposite ends of one rope while B alone chews the second; when A and C meet (45 min), move A to the untouched end of the half‑rope that remains, let him finish it (30 min), and the moment he is done exactly 75 minutes have elapsed.",True

1.  Divisibility by 225.  
    225 = 9·25, so N must be divisible by 9 and by 25.

2.  Consequence of the factor 25.  
    A decimal number is divisible by 25 iff its last two digits are 00, 25, 50 or 75.  
    Since every digit of N is 0 or 1, the only possibility is

                  last two digits = 00.                                   (1)

3.  Consequence of the factor 9.  
    A decimal number is divisible by 9 iff the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  
    Because each digit of N is 0 or 1, that sum equals the number of 1’s appearing in N.  Hence

                 (number of 1’s in N) ≡ 0 (mod 9).                        (2)

4.  The minimum possible length of N.  
    Because of (1), the final two digits are fixed as 00, leaving all other digits free to be 0 or 1.  
    Let n be the total number of digits of N.  Then the count of available digits for 1’s is n−2.

    Condition (2) says we need at least 9 ones.  Therefore

                 n – 2  ≥  9     ⇒     n ≥ 11.                            (3)

    So N has at least 11 digits.

5.  The unique 11–digit candidate.  
    If n = 11, there are exactly 9 positions before the mandatory ending “00”.  
    To supply 9 ones, every one of those 9 positions must be 1.  
    Thus the only 11–digit number that satisfies (1) and (2) is

                 N = 11111111100.                                         (4)

6.  Verification.  
       •  Last two digits are 00  ⇒  divisible by 25.  
       •  It contains 9 ones      ⇒  digit–sum = 9 ⇒ divisible by 9.  
       •  Therefore divisible by 9·25 = 225.

7.  Minimality.  
    Any decimal with more than 11 digits is at least 10¹¹ = 100 000 000 000,  
    which is larger than 11111111100 = 11 111 111 100.  
    Hence no longer number made solely of 0’s and 1’s can be smaller than (4).  
    Combined with (3), this shows that (4) is the absolute minimum.

Therefore the least possible number of gums Rob could have eaten is

Multiplying by 11 gives the denominator whose digits, working from the right, are

d , c+d , b+c , a+b , a

1.  The units digit d appears both in the numerator and the denominator, so d must be one of the digits that occurs twice in the given multiset; therefore d ∈ {1,3,4}.

2.  We have no 0,6,8,9 in the multiset; hence none of the five denominator digits may be 0,6,8,9.

Choose d = 1 (the same reasoning with d = 3 or 4 leads to contradictions).

Then c + 1 must be a single allowed digit (no carry); therefore c ∈ {2,3,4}.  
If c = 5 or 7 we would obtain 6 or 8, which are forbidden.

Take c = 2 (the other choices give impossibilities in later steps).

Now b + c = b + 2 must again be an allowed single digit, so b can be 3 or 5 or 7, but
b = 5 or 7 would give 7 or 9, and 9 is forbidden.  
Thus b = 3.

The only way to get a trailing zero is by multiplying a factor of 1000! which is 2 by a factor of 1000! which is 5. The modified problem is thus: How many such pairs of factors are there?
There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5.

Since 7*14=98, there was only one cyclist that he never beat and that was the champion.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Observe the three facts that govern the situation.  

1.  In every stage Charles is 93rd, so in every stage  
  • 92 riders finish ahead of him;  
  • 7 riders finish behind him.  

2.  There are 100 – 2 = 98 riders other than Charles and the eventual champion.  
   The total number of “places‑behind‑Charles” that must be filled during the
   14 stages is  
  14 stages × 7 places = 98 places.  

3.  Therefore each one of those 98 riders can (and, in the construction
   below, will) occupy a place behind Charles exactly once and a place ahead
   of Charles in the other 13 stages.

Now choose the actual riding times so that being
“behind Charles” once costs far more time than the small advantage that can
be gained from finishing just ahead of him in the other stages.

One concrete way to do this

Stage‑by‑stage times (Champion = 0 each day)

• Charles: always 0 h 0 m 30 s behind the champion.  
• Any rider who is ahead of Charles that day: 0 h 0 m 20 s behind the champion  
 (ten seconds in front of Charles).  
• The seven riders who are behind Charles that day: 0 h 20 m 00 s behind
 the champion (19 m 30 s behind Charles).

How this plays out for every rival R (not the champion)

– “Good” stages (13 of them): R gains 10 s on Charles each time → 13 × 10 s =
   130 s = 2 m 10 s gained.  
– His single “bad” stage: R loses 19 m 30 s to Charles.  

Net loss of R to Charles = 19 m 30 s – 2 m 10 s = 17 m 20 s.

Thus every one of the 98 other riders finishes the race more than
17 minutes slower than Charles even though each of them beats him on 13 of
the 14 days.

The champion, however, takes 30 s a day from Charles
(14 × 30 s = 7 m total) and therefore wins the general classification.
Charles, having lost only those 7 minutes to the champion and having gained
at least 17 minutes on everyone else, is runner‑up overall even though he
never placed better than 93rd on any individual stage.

So it is perfectly possible: Charles was consistently close to the front
while every other rider (except the winner) suffered one disastrous stage,
and that single catastrophe for each of them outweighed all of the small
advantages they accumulated on their better days.

Final answer: Each of the other 98 riders had one stage in which he fell behind Charles by a huge margin (seven riders per stage, 14 stages give 98 such “bad‑stage” slots); the time lost in that one disastrous stage was greater than the small amounts they gained by finishing just ahead of Charles in the other 13 stages, so Charles’s total time was second best even though his individual placings were always 93rd.",True

A third said that the number of cadet legs was 14 more than the total number of cadet and shark heads.  How many sharks were killed?",,"7 sharks were killed.
Since there were 4 times as many cadets, there were 28 cadets.  The number of cadet legs is equal to the square of the number of sharks, which would be 49 legs.  49 legs is 14 more than the number of cadet and shark heads: 7 sharks plus 28 cadets equals 35 heads.
Note that although all of the cadets survived, nothing was said about possible injuries.  In fact, each shark had bitten off one leg from each of 7 cadets.  This explains the shortage of legs, since 28 cadets should have had 56 legs, not 49.  Also note the statement of the second cadet, who said 'the number of legs they NOW had ...'.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  
 s = number of sharks killed,  
 c = number of cadets in the test,

(We are told no cadet was killed, but nothing says every cadet kept both of his legs.)

1. “There were 4 times as many cadets in the water as there were sharks.”  
   ⇒ c = 4 s.                                            …(1)

2. “The number of legs they now had was equal to the square of the number of sharks.”

3. “The number of cadet legs was 14 more than the total number of cadet and shark heads.”  
   Every cadet and every shark has one head, hence total heads = c + s.  
   Therefore  
  ℓ = (c + s) + 14.                                    …(3)

Substitute c from (1) into (3):

ℓ = (4s + s) + 14  = 5s + 14.                           …(4)

But ℓ = s² from (2), so

s² = 5s + 14  
s² − 5s − 14 = 0  
(s − 7)(s + 2) = 0.

Since s > 0, we obtain s = 7.

Thus 7 sharks were killed.

(For completeness, the other quantities are c = 4·7 = 28 cadets and ℓ = 7² = 49 cadet legs, meaning exactly 7 legs were lost in the fray, consistent with all statements.)

Let the original price of the Red Rose bouquet  be 'B' Roka.
It is given that during a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%.
Hence after a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 162 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)
(since B(1+Y) is the price during inflation and  B(1-Y)(1+Y) the price during the slowdown)
Therefore the decrease in price after one year
= B - B(1-Y^2)
= B - B + B*Y^2

Hence after another year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 147.42 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y)

151,"In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.
On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.
About this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, ""Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.""
Knowing Junior, we asked, ""How big a headache is your math gonna give us?""
She answered, ""I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.""
Name the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.",Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.,"Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.
After labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, ""Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof. First, I mark a line from A to D.  This creates a trapezoid (trapezium in Britain) ABCD.  Next, I mark the lines EH, BG, and CF.  These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.""
The partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's. (The second and third cuts can be made in reverse order.)
...
The pieces from two arrangements follow:
1) ABCD, DEFG, ADH, and DGH.
2) ABCD, EFGH, ADH, and DEH.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Junior’s solution works with a regular nonagon (a nine‑sided regular polygon).

How to cut it  
Label the vertices of the nonagon consecutively A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I round the edge.

1. First cut Join A to D.  
   That diagonal separates quadrilateral A‑B‑C‑D from the rest of the cake, so after this cut we have  
   • one finished portion: quadrilateral A‑B‑C‑D,  
   • one remainder.

2. Second (and last) cut Inside the remainder draw the diagonal D to G.  
   This splits what is left into  
   • quadrilateral D‑E‑F‑G and  
   • quadrilateral G‑H‑I‑A.  

Altogether there are three pieces, created exactly as required: the first cut produced one finished piece, the last cut produced the final two.

Why the three pieces are equal  
Rotate the whole figure through 120° (one third of a full turn) about the centre of the nonagon.

• That rotation is an isometry (it preserves lengths and areas) and it carries the nonagon onto itself.  
• It sends quadrilateral A‑B‑C‑D to quadrilateral D‑E‑F‑G, and another 120° rotation sends that to quadrilateral G‑H‑I‑A.  

Thus each piece can be carried onto any other by a symmetry of the original polygon; therefore the three quadrilaterals are congruent and have exactly the same area. No trigonometry, powers, roots or Pythagoras are needed—only the rotational symmetry of the regular nonagon.

Hence Junior’s promise is fulfilled: a regular nonagon, cut first along A‑D and then along D‑G, yields more than two (in fact three) exactly equal portions, with the last cut producing two of them.",True

Introduce A = x – 2 , B = y – 2 , C = z – 2  
(thus A , B , C are even positive integers).

Equation (1) becomes  

(A+2)(B+2)(C+2) = 2ABC.                                (2)

Divide by ABC (≠0):

(1 + 2/A)(1 + 2/B)(1 + 2/C) = 2.                        (3)

Write f(n) = 1 + 2/n = (n+2)/n ;  f( n ) > 1 and decreases as n increases.

The three factors on the left of (3) are f(A), f(B), f(C) ; their product is 2.

Step 1.  Smallest possible value of A.  
If A = 4 then f(A) = 3/2.  
Because f(B) ≥ f(C) ≥ 1, we need f(B)f(C) = 4/3.

Put A = 4 in (2) and solve for C:

6(B+2)(C+2) = 8BC  
⇔ C = 6(B+2)/(B−6).

With B even and > 6 this gives

(B , C) = (8,30), (10,18), (12,14), (14,12), (18,10), …  

so the smallest product ABC obtained with A = 4 is

4·12·14 = 672.                                         (4)

Step 2.  A = 6.  
Now f(6) = 4/3.  
We need f(B)f(C) = 3/2.

Put A = 6 in (2):

8(B+2)(C+2) = 12BC  
⇔ C = 2(B+2)/(B−4).                                     (5)

The smallest even B for which the denominator in (5) is positive is B = 6, giving C = 16 (ABC = 576).  
The next possibility is B = 8, giving C = 10 and

ABC = 6·8·10 = 480.                                     (6)

Any larger B only increases the product.

Step 3.  A ≥ 8.  
Then f(A) ≤ 5/4.  
Hence f(A)f(B)f(C) ≤ (5/4)³ = 1.953 < 2 – impossible.

Therefore the least possible value of ABC is the one found in (6), namely 480.

Step 4.  Total number of 1 cm cubes.  
From (2), xyz = 2ABC, so with ABC = 480

xyz = 2 × 480 = 960.

Thus the smallest possible total number of little cubes is 960.

222, 444, 666, 888, 2222, 4444, 6666, 8888.  (2)

3.  The five candidates that accompany every repdigit  
Since c ∈ {1,3,5,7,9},

X·Y = R + c  takes one of the five values  R+1, R+3, R+5, R+7, R+9.  (3)

4.  The list of possible two–digit factors  
Using the five odd digits without repetition the only two–digit numbers
we can form are  

13,15,17,19,31,35,37,39,51,53,57,59,71,73,75,79,91,93,95,97.  (4)

Both factors of X·Y must come from this list and must have no digit in
common.

5.  Testing the repdigits of (2)

•  R = 222, 444, 666, 888  
All numbers in (3) lie below 900.  Checking their factorizations shows
that none of them can be written as a product of two different numbers
from (4) (either a factor is not in (4) or a digit is repeated).  
Hence these four repdigits are impossible.

•  R = 4444, 6666, 8888  
Every number in (3) is above 4400, so each factor would exceed √4400 ≈ 67.
The only members of (4) that are ≥ 67 are 71, 73, 75, 79, 91, 93, 95, 97.
A direct check shows that none of the numbers in (3) is a product of
two members of this short sub‑list with disjoint digits.  
Thus these three repdigits are also impossible.

•  R = 2222  
Now the five candidates (3) are  

2223, 2225, 2227, 2229, 2231.

Try the factors of (4) that are close to √2222 ≈ 47 : 57 and 39 fit:

57 × 39 = 2223.                        (5)

The four digits 5,7,3,9 are all different, so they may appear in the
four outside positions.  Equation (1) demands  

c = 2223 – 2222 = 1,

a digit that is still unused.  Therefore the five‑digit number must be

57 1 39 or 39 1 57.

6.  Verifying the two numbers  

For N₁ = 57139 : first two digits 57, last two digits 39,  
57·39 – 1 = 2223 – 1 = 2222, a repdigit of 2’s.

For N₂ = 39157 : first two digits 39, last two digits 57,  
39·57 – 1 = 2223 – 1 = 2222, again a repdigit of 2’s.

Both satisfy the required condition and, by the elimination in steps 1‑5,
no other arrangement is possible.

Final answer: 57139 and 39157",True
155,"Old Farmer McDoughnut owns a piece of grassland in the heart of Madadia and has three animals: a Madadian Burger Cow, a Spare Kebab Goat, and a Scotch Egg laying Goose. McDoughnut discovered the following:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 45 days.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 90 days also.
For how long can the three animals graze on the field together?",,"The cow, the goat, and the goose eat grass with a constant speed (amount per day): v1 for the cow, v2 for the goat, v3 for the goose.
The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:
v1 = 3 x h/180,
v2 = 2 x h/180,
v3 = 1 x h/180,
k = 1 x h/180.
Then holds for the time t that the three animals can graze together: h-tx(v1+v2+v3-k) = 0, so t = h/(v1+v2+v3-k) = h/(3xh/180+2xh/180+1xh/180-1xh/180) = 36. The three animals can graze together for 36 days.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

I  = initial amount of grass (in “grass‑units”)  
r  = rate at which the field re‑grows grass (grass‑units /day)  
c, g, h = daily consumption rates of the cow, goat and goose respectively.

For any set of animals that finishes the pasture in T days,

I + rT = T · (sum of their daily consumptions).      (1)

The data give four such situations.

1. Cow + Goat, T = 45  
   I + 45r = 45(c + g).                                         (2)

2. Cow + Goose, T = 60  
   I + 60r = 60(c + h).                                         (3)

3. Cow alone, T = 90  
   I + 90r = 90c.                                               (4)

4. Goat + Goose, T = 90  
   I + 90r = 90(g + h).                                         (5)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Eliminate I.

(3) – (4):  (I + 60r) − (I + 90r) = 60(c + h) − 90c  
     −30r = 60h − 30c ⇒ r = c − 2h.                          (6)

(2) – (4):  (I + 45r) − (I + 90r) = 45(c + g) − 90c  
     −45r = 45g − 45c ⇒ r = c − g.                           (7)

(5) – (4):  (I + 90r) − (I + 90r) = 90(g + h) − 90c  
     0 = 90(g + h − c) ⇒ g + h = c.                           (8)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Solve for the individual rates.

From (7): g = c − r.                                           (9)

Insert (9) into (8): (c − r) + h = c  ⇒ h = r.                 (10)

Insert h = r into (6): r = c − 2r  ⇒ c = 3r.                   (11)

Therefore        c : g : h = 3r : 2r : r.                      (12)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Find I (any convenient equation will do, e.g. (4)).

Using (11) and h = r in (4):  
I + 90r = 90(3r) = 270r  ⇒ I = 180r.                          (13)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4: Time T with all three animals together.

All three consume c + g + h = 3r + 2r + r = 6r per day.

Insert into (1):

I + rT = T·6r  
180r + rT = 6rT  
180 + T = 6T  
180 = 5T  
T = 36.                                                        (14)

What is the smallest number of calls needed so that everyone knows everything?,,"1 for n=2

This can be achieved as follows: choose four people (A, B, C, and D) as the ""core group"". Each person outside the core group phones a member of the core group (it doesn't matter which); this takes n-4 calls. Now the core group makes 4 calls: A-B, C-D, A-C, and B-D. At this point, each member of the core group knows everything. Now, each person outside the core group calls anybody who knows everything; this again requires n-4 calls, for a total of 2n-4.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"For 1 person no telephone call is necessary, for 2 persons one call is enough and for 3 persons three calls are needed.

157,"Use all the digits from 1 to 9 to complete the equation
??? x 3? = ????",1?? x 3? = ?254,186 x 39 = 7254,GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

 M = the three–digit multiplicand (its digits are all different and not 3),  
 N = the two–digit multiplier = 3d (d ≠ 3),  
 P = the four–digit product.  

Altogether the nine different digits 1–9 must appear once each in the three numbers  
M · N = P.  

────────────────────────────────────────  
1.  A first elimination with the last digit  
────────────────────────────────────────  
The last (units) digit of P is the units digit of M·d :

•  If d = 1, that last digit equals the units digit of M itself, so one digit would be
   repeated in M and P – impossible.  
•  If d = 5, 5·(even) gives 0, 5·(odd) gives 5, so the last digit of P would be 0 or   5, neither of which is allowed (0 is forbidden, 5 would duplicate the 5 in N).  

Hence d ∉ {1,5}.  The admissible values are now  
 d ∈ {2,4,6,7,8,9}.  

────────────────────────────────────────  
2.  A digit–sum (mod‑9) argument  
────────────────────────────────────────  
The sum of the nine digits 1+2+⋯+9 is 45, a multiple of 9, so

 sum digits(M) + sum digits(N) + sum digits(P) ≡ 0 (mod 9).       (1)

But digit–sums are preserved modulo 9 under multiplication, therefore  

 sum digits(P) ≡ [sum digits(M)] · [sum digits(N)]  (mod 9).    (2)

Put A ≡ sum digits(M) (mod 9) and B ≡ sum digits(N)=3+d (mod 9).
Equation (1) together with (2) gives  

 A + B + AB ≡ 0 (mod 9)  ⟺ (A+1)(B+1) ≡ 1 (mod 9).       (3)

For each admissible d we have B (=3+d) mod 9 and can test (3):

d   2   4   6   7   8   9  
B   5   7   0   1   2   3  
B+1 6   8   1   2   3   4  

To satisfy (A+1)(B+1) ≡ 1 (mod 9) the factor (B+1) must be invertible mod 9,
so d = 2 or 8 (B+1 = 6 or 3, not invertible) are impossible.
The remaining possibilities and the required value of A are:

d  = 4 ⇒ B+1=8  inverse 8 ⇒ A+1≡8 ⇒ A≡7  
d  = 6 ⇒ B+1=1  A≡0  
d  = 7 ⇒ B+1=2  inverse 5 ⇒ A+1≡5 ⇒ A≡4  
d  = 9 ⇒ B+1=4  inverse 7 ⇒ A+1≡7 ⇒ A≡6

Thus only four cases are left:

( i )  N = 34, sum digits(M) ≡ 7 (mod 9)  
(ii )  N = 36, sum digits(M) ≡ 0 (mod 9)  
(iii)  N = 37, sum digits(M) ≡ 4 (mod 9)  
(iv)  N = 39, sum digits(M) ≡ 6 (mod 9)

────────────────────────────────────────  
3.  Bounding the size of M  
────────────────────────────────────────  
Because P has four digits,

 1000 ≤ M·N ≤ 9999 ⇒ M ≤ ⌊9999 / N⌋.

The upper bounds are:

 N 34 → M ≤ 294  N 36 → M ≤ 277  
 N 37 → M ≤ 270  N 39 → M ≤ 256.

So in every surviving case M is a three–digit number beginning with 1 or 2.

────────────────────────────────────────  
4.  Dealing with the four cases  
────────────────────────────────────────  

(i)  N = 34 ( units–digit 4 )  
 The last digit of P is 4·(units of M) mod 10.
 If that units digit is 1 or 6 the result is 4, duplicating a digit of N;
 if it is 5 the result is 0; otherwise it is an even digit already used in M.  
 All possibilities lead to a repetition, so N = 34 is impossible.

(ii)  N = 36 (units digit 6)  
 Last digit of P = 6·(units of M) mod 10.
 Trying all admissible units digits shows that the only non‑repeating possibilities
 are units 7 (giving 2) or 9 (giving 4).
 But with N = 36 we must have sum digits(M)=9 or 18.  
 A units digit 7 forces M to contain the digit 2 as well (it appears in P),
 contradicting the rule of uniqueness; the units digit 9 forces M>256.  
 Hence N = 36 is impossible.

(iii) N = 37 (units digit 7)  
 Last digit of P = 7·(units of M) mod 10.
 The only permitted units digits are 2 (giving 4), 4 (giving 8), 6 (giving 2) or 8 (giving 6).
 But with N = 37 we need sum digits(M)=13 or 22, and none of the permissible triples
 of digits add to 13 or 22 while keeping M ≤ 270.  
 So N = 37 is impossible.

(iv)  N = 39 (units digit 9)  
 Last digit of P = 9·(units of M) mod 10.  
 If the units digit of M is c, the units digit of P is 9c ≡ 10−c (mod 10):

 c  2  4  6  8         →  units of P  8  6  4  2.

 The units digit cannot duplicate c nor be 3 or 9, so only c ∈ {2,4,6,8} are admissible.
 With N = 39 we must have sum digits(M)=15.

 •  c = 2 ⇒ remaining two digits must sum to 13; every arrangement makes M > 256.  
 •  c = 4 ⇒ remaining two digits must sum to 11; impossible with a leading 1 or 2.  
 •  c = 8 ⇒ remaining two digits must sum to 7; the only candidate 1–6–8 (i.e. 168)
  gives P = 6552, which repeats the digit 5.  
 •  c = 6 ⇒ remaining two digits must sum to 9; possibilities (1,8), (2,7), (4,5).

  – 276 or 267 exceed 256;  
  – 456 or 465 begin with 4;  
  – the choice (1,8,6) gives M = 186, which is ≤ 256.

Checking this final candidate: 186 × 39 = 7254.  
The nine digits appearing are  

 M : 1 8 6  N : 3 9  P : 7 2 5 4,

all different and together they are exactly the digits 1 to 9.

Since every other possibility has been eliminated, this is the unique solution.

Now the nth person will know (n-1) people; (n-1)th person will know (n-2) people because no one knows the same number of people; similarly (n-2)th person will known (n-3) people. Thus, the 2nd person will know 1 person. Hence the 1st person[say A] will know 0 people or will know no one. Now since the nth person knows every one, he knows A .Therefore A knows the nth person. Hence our supposition is wrong and at least 2 people know the same number of people.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let n be the number of people at the party (n ≥ 2).  
For every person P, let d(P) denote how many people P knows, where “knowing’’ counts oneself and the relation “knows’’ is symmetric:

• 1 ≤ d(P) ≤ n for every person P.  
  (They know at least themselves and at most everybody.)

We wish to show that two distinct persons have the same value of d.

Step 1.  List the possible values of d.  
The only arithmetically possible values are the integers 1,2,…,n – a total of n distinct numbers.

Step 2.  Observe that not all n values can actually occur simultaneously.

• Suppose someone, call her A, has d(A) = n (she knows everybody).  
  Then for any other person B, A knows B, so B knows A as well; hence B knows at least A and B himself, giving d(B) ≥ 2.  
  Therefore, if the value n occurs, the value 1 cannot occur.

• Conversely, if some person C has d(C) = 1 (he knows only himself), then no one can have d = n, for whoever would know everybody would in particular know C, forcing C to know him back and so to know at least two people.  
  Thus, if the value 1 occurs, the value n cannot occur.

Consequently, at most n − 1 of the n arithmetically possible values can actually appear among the n people.

Step 3.  Apply the pigeon‑hole principle.  
We have n people (pigeons) but only at most n − 1 different acquaintance-numbers (holes) available. Hence two different people must fall into the same “hole’’—i.e., must have the same number of acquaintances.

1. k = 1  (two–digit numbers)  
   2·10^{1} – 3 = 17, gcd(17, 28) = 1.

2. k = 2  (three–digit numbers)  
   2·10^{2} – 3 = 197, 197 ≡ 1 (mod 28), gcd(197, 28) = 1.

5. k = 5  (six–digit numbers)  
   2·10^{5} – 3 = 199997, 199997 ≡ 21 (mod 28).  
   Now gcd(199997, 28) = 7, so (5) becomes  

   d·199997 = 28Q ⇒ 7 divides the left automatically; we still need a factor 4.

Each ferry travels at a constant speed, although the ""Lead Balloon"" is faster than the ""Iceberg Magnet"".
The two boats leave from opposite shores at the same time.  They pass at a point of 720 yards from Lard Sculptures.  Upon arriving at the opposite shore, each boat stays in its slip for 5 minutes, and then starts back. They pass again 400 yards from Kebab Fountains. Assume both boats travel along a straight line.  How far is it from Kebab Fountains to Lard Sculptures by water?",,"Let X = the distance between the two ports.  Note that the 5 minutes spent in their slips is irrelevant to solving the problem.
The ratio of the distance traveled by the two boats when they pass each other for the first time is:  (X - 720) / 720.
The ratio of the total distance traveled by the two boats when they pass each other for the second time is:  (2x - 400) / (X + 400).

D = length of the route in yards,  
vL = speed of the “Lead Balloon”,  
vI = speed of the “Iceberg Magnet.”  

Because the Lead Balloon is faster, vL > vI.

FIRST MEETING  
The boats start simultaneously from opposite shores.  
They meet 720 yd from Lard Sculptures (the west shore).

Distance already covered by Iceberg Magnet = 720 yd.  
Distance already covered by Lead Balloon     = D – 720 yd.

Since the times are the same,

(D – 720)/vL = 720/vI.                                     (1)

Hence  
vL / vI = (D – 720)/720.                                 (2)

SECOND MEETING  
Each boat reaches the opposite bank, waits 5 min, then returns.

Time for Lead Balloon to reach the west shore  

TL = 720/vI + 720/vL.                                    (3)

Time for Iceberg Magnet to reach the east shore  

TI = 720/vI + (D – 720)/vI = D / vI.                      (4)

Using (2) to replace vL in (3),

TL = 720/vI · (1 + 720/(D – 720))  
   = 720D / [vI (D – 720)].                              (5)

Because vL > vI we have D > 1440, so TL < TI;  
therefore the Lead Balloon turns back 5 min before the Iceberg Magnet does.

Return–departure instants  
Lead Balloon: TL + 5.  
Iceberg Magnet: TI + 5.

At their second meeting they are 400 yd from Kebab Fountains (the east shore),

Lead Balloon (coming from west): distance traveled on the return leg = D – 400  
Iceberg Magnet (coming from east): distance traveled on the return leg = 400.

Let t be the clock–time of the second meeting.  
Measured from their individual return departures,

t – (TL + 5) = (D – 400)/vL,  
t – (TI + 5) = 400/vI.

Subtracting the second equality from the first and eliminating t gives

(D – 400)/vL – 400/vI = TI – TL.                         (6)

Insert vL from (2) and TI – TL from (4) & (5):

vL = vI (D – 720)/720,  
TI – TL = D/vI – 720D/[vI (D – 720)]  
        = D(D – 1440)/[vI (D – 720)].

Equation (6) becomes

(D – 400)·720/(D – 720) – 400 = D(D – 1440)/(D – 720).

Multiply by (D – 720):

720(D – 400) = 400(D – 720) + D(D – 1440).

Simplify:

720D – 288 000 = 400D – 288 000 + D² – 1440D  
0 = D² – 1760D  
D(D – 1760) = 0.

Since D ≠ 0,  

D = 1760 yards.

A check with any convenient numerical speeds (e.g. vI = 9 yd/min, vL = 13 yd/min) confirms both meetings occur at the required positions and times.

165,"Said Alf to Bert, ""The last time we met, our ages were both prime numbers, and when I was a quarter of the age I am now, you were that age plus half the age your father would have been thirty years previous to when he was six times the age you would have been when I was half your age"".

Since their ages have always had the same difference we have
B - A = 3b - 15 = b - a
and since 2a = b then a = 3 and b = 6. So their ages differ by 3. Since all primes except 2 are odd and differ by an even number we can only have 2 and 5, Bert being the older of the two. The father plays no part in the problem!",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

A  = Alf’s present age (in years)  
B  = Bert’s present age (in years)

All ages are measured in years and are assumed to be whole numbers.

1.  Translate Alf’s sentence word by word.

   “When I was a quarter of the age I am now …”  
   Alf’s age was A⁄4 exactly 3A⁄4 years ago.  
   Let that instant be Time T₁.

   “… you were that age plus half the age your father would have been
   thirty years previous to when he was six times the age you would have
   been when I was half your age.”

   Work from the innermost clause outward.

   •  Time T₂ : “when I was half your age.”  
      Let t₂ be the number of years ago that happened.

      A – t₂  =  ½(B – t₂)                     (Alf then was half Bert’s then)
      2A – B = t₂.                                             (1)

      Hence Bert’s age at T₂ is
      B_T₂ = B – t₂ = B – (2A – B) = 2B – 2A.                 (2)

   •  Time T₃ : “when [Bert’s father] was six times the age you
      would have been (i.e. 2B – 2A) at T₂.”

      So at T₃ the father’s age was 6(2B – 2A).

      Thirty years before that, the father’s age was
      6(2B – 2A) – 30.                                        (3)

      Half of that is
      3(2B – 2A) – 15 = 6B – 6A – 15.                         (4)

   •  Bert’s age at T₁ (3A⁄4 years ago) is
      B – ¾A.                                                 (5)

   Alf states that Bert’s age (5) equals
      “that age” (Alf’s A⁄4) plus (4):

      B – ¾A = A⁄4 + 6B – 6A – 15.                            (6)

2.  Solve (6).

      B – ¾A = A⁄4 + 6B – 6A – 15  
      0 = A⁄4 + 6B – 6A – 15 – B + ¾A  
      0 = –5A + 5B – 15  
      B = A + 3.                                              (7)

   Thus Bert is exactly three years older than Alf at every moment.

3.  Let t be the number of years since “the last time we met.”
    At that meeting:

      Alf’s age  = A – t,    a prime number p  
      Bert’s age = B – t = (A + 3) – t = p + 3, a prime q.    (8)

    Hence we need two primes which differ by 3.

4.  Show that the only such pair is 2 and 5.

    Any prime p > 3 is 1 or 5 mod 6.

      • If p ≡ 1 (mod 6), then p + 3 ≡ 4 (mod 6) and is even (>2), hence composite.  
      • If p ≡ 5 (mod 6), then p + 3 ≡ 2 (mod 6) and is again even (>2), composite.

    Therefore the only possible pair of primes differing by 3 is p = 2 and p + 3 = 5.

5.  Conclude the ages at the last meeting.

      Alf’s age then  = 2 years  
      Bert’s age then = 5 years

    These satisfy all the conditions (in particular, Bert is indeed three
    years older than Alf).

Final answer: Alf was 2 years old and Bert was 5 years old the last time they met.",True

Now you are 60*3=180 miles from the broken truck. The tank and L are still full, but F is empty. Leave F behind and make a run for it, carrying L. Refill the tank from L as needed. There are 55 gallons of fuel left so you can travel an additional 55*12=660 miles, for a maximum of (180+660) 840 miles.  Since you only have a total of 800 miles to go, you will make it to your base camp.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the point where the truck broke down be O and the base camp be B,  
       with OB = 800 mi.  
Initially we have

• DPV tank : 10 gal  
• barrel 1 : 45 gal  
• barrel 2 : 45 gal                    (total 100 gal)

The DPV makes 12 mi / gal.

1.  A fundamental limitation (range with one barrel)

The DPV can carry at most one barrel at a time, so the most fuel it can
ever have on board is

  tank 10 gal + one barrel 45 gal = 55 gal.

Fifty‑five gallons take the vehicle at most

  55 gal × 12 mi / gal = 660 mi.

Hence, no matter what manoeuvres are made beforehand, the *last*
660 mi of the journey must be covered without ever returning for another
barrel.

Consequently every mile of the first

  800 mi – 660 mi = 140 mi

has to be travelled *three* times (out with a barrel, back empty,
and out again with the other barrel) before the final,
non‑returning leg can begin.

2.  Fuel cost of the first 140 miles

Whenever a section is travelled three times, 3 miles are driven to gain
1 mile of net progress, so the fuel required is

  3 mi × (1 / 12) gal / mi = ¼ gal per mile of progress.

For the 140 mi shuttle zone the fuel consumed is

  140 mi × ¼ gal / mi = 35 gal.

After those 140 mi the stock has fallen from 100 gal to

  100 gal – 35 gal = 65 gal.

3.  How much of that 65 gal can be taken farther?

At the end of the shuttle zone the two barrels are side by side,
but from then on only *one* barrel may be taken.
The vehicle can therefore carry at most 55 gal.
This means that at least

  65 gal – 55 gal = 10 gal

must be left behind; only 55 gal can go on.

4.  Is 55 gal enough for the remaining 660 mi?

The remaining distance after the shuttle zone is

  800 mi – 140 mi = 660 mi,

and the fuel needed is

  660 mi × (1 / 12) gal / mi = 55 gal.

So the load that can be carried forward is exactly what is required; no
fuel may be wasted in any way after the shuttle zone.

5.  Why this exact match is still impossible

During the 140‑mile shuttle each barrel is carried*
at least once*.
Whichever barrel is to be taken on the final leg therefore loses **at
least**

  140 mi × (1 / 12) gal / mi = 11 2⁄3 gal.

Hence the *full* barrel at the start of the final leg can contain at
most

  45 gal – 11 2⁄3 gal = 33 1⁄3 gal.

Adding the 10 gal in the tank, the maximum fuel that can be on board at
the start of the 660‑mile run is

  33 1⁄3 gal + 10 gal = 43 1⁄3 gal,

yet the run needs 55 gal.  The deficiency is

  55 gal – 43 1⁄3 gal = 11 2⁄3 gal.

6.  General impossibility

The argument does not depend on choosing 140 mi for the shuttle zone.
Let L be the length of the zone in which back‑and‑forth hauling is done.
Because every mile there is driven three times, the fuel used there is
L/4 gal, and the extra distance driven is 2L mi.  The total distance
driven is therefore

  800 mi + 2L mi,

and with only 100 gal available we must have

  800 + 2L ≤ 1200  ⇒ L ≤ 200 mi.

Whichever barrel is taken on the one‑way part has been carried at least
L mi and has therefore lost at least L/12 gal.  Its content is
at most 45 – L/12 gal, so the most fuel on board at the beginning of the
final (800 – L) mi is

  10 + 45 – L/12 = 55 – L/12 gal.

The fuel that journey needs is

  (800 – L)/12 = 66 ⅔ – L/12 gal.

Thus we must have 55 – L/12 ≥ 66 ⅔ – L/12, i.e. 55 ≥ 66 ⅔,  
which is impossible.

7.  Conclusion

No sequence of shuttling and caching that respects the
rules (tank 10 gal, carry one barrel at a time, no fuel transfer between
barrels) can bring the DPV the remaining 800 miles.  The mission
cannot be completed.

n = a + (a+1) + … + (a+k–1)  (k ≥ 2 , a ≥ 0)                                             (1)

be a representation of n as a sum of consecutive non‑negative integers.  
Formula (1) gives  

2n = k(2a+k–1).                                                                               (2)

The factor 2a+k–1 is always odd.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  When does such a representation exist?
-------------------------------------------------
Equation (2) shows that 2n is written as the product of k and an odd number.  
Hence

• If n is a power of two, 2n is a power of two; but a power of two cannot
  be decomposed into two factors of which one is odd and both exceed 1.
  Thus a power of two has no representation (1).

• Conversely, suppose n is not a power of two.  Write n = 2^s·t with t odd
  and t ≥ 3.

  – If s = 0 (n is odd) choose k = 2.  
    Then a = (n–1)/2 ≥ 0 and n = a+(a+1).

  – If s ≥ 1 choose k to be the least odd divisor p of t (p ≥ 3).  
    Put

         a = n/k – (k–1)/2.

    Because p ≤ √t ≤ √n, we have k(k–1)/2 ≤ k^2/2 ≤ n/2 < n, so a ≥ 0.
    Thus (1) is a valid representation.

Therefore every positive integer that is NOT a power of two can be written
as a sum of at least two consecutive non‑negative integers, while a power
of two cannot.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Numbers between 1000 and 2000
-------------------------------------------------
Between 1000 and 2000 the only power of two is

         2^10 = 1024.

By the result above, 1024 cannot be written in the required way, whereas
every other integer in that interval can.

-------------------------------------------------
3.  Verification that 1024 really fails
-------------------------------------------------
Assume, for contradiction, that 1024 satisfies (1) with k ≥ 2.

From (2):  2048 = k(2a+k–1).  
The right side is the product of k (even) and an odd number (2a+k–1).
Since 2048 is a power of two, the odd factor must be 1, giving 2a+k–1 = 1
and hence 2a = 2–k.  Because a ≥ 0, this forces k ≤ 2.  But k = 1 is
excluded and k = 2 would give a = 0, producing 0+1 = 1 ≠ 1024.
Contradiction.  Hence 1024 is impossible.

The unique integer between 1000 and 2000 that cannot be expressed as a sum
of consecutive non‑negative integers is

1024.

169,"Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.
We were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?",,"It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.
Hence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.
Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90. These 90 id's will not have a corresponding number when written in reverse order.
Secondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order. For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.
Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.
Therefore total number of valid employee id's possible = 90 + 90 + 360 = 540.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let an admissible employee–ID be a 3–digit string ABC with

• A ∈ {1,2,… ,9}  (the first digit may not be 0)  
• B , C ∈ {0,1,… ,9}.  

There are 9·10·10 = 900 such IDs (100 through 999).

For every admissible ID X, write r(X) for the 3–digit string obtained by reversing its digits.  
The company’s rule is

 never assign two different IDs X and Y with r(X)=Y.

Thus the admissible IDs must be chosen so that, in each “reversal class”
 { X }                 if r(X)=X (a palindrome) or r(X) is not admissible,  
 { X , r(X) }          if X≠r(X) and r(X) is admissible,

at most one ID is actually used.

Step 1.  Isolating the 1–element classes  
(a) Palindromes:  A=B=A, that is, ABA with A≠0.  
 Choices: A = 1–9 (9 ways), B = 0–9 (10 ways) ⇒ 9·10 = 90 IDs.  
 Each of these forms a 1–element class because r(X)=X.

(b) Numbers whose last digit is 0:  AB0 with A≠0.  
 Choices: A = 1–9 (9 ways), B = 0–9 (10 ways) ⇒ 9·10 = 90 IDs.  
 For AB0 the reverse is 0BA, which begins with 0 and is therefore not an admissible ID, so AB0 is alone in its class.

Hence there are 90 + 90 = 180 one–element classes, and all 180 IDs can certainly be assigned.

Step 2.  The remaining IDs  
Remove the 180 singled–out IDs from the total of 900.  
Left over: 900 – 180 = 720 IDs.

For any such remaining ID, its last digit is non–zero and it is not a palindrome, so its reverse is another distinct admissible ID.  
Consequently these 720 IDs break up into 720⁄2 = 360 disjoint 2–element reversal classes, and from each we may choose at most one ID.

Step 3.  Maximum possible number of employees  
• from the 180 singletons we may use all 180 IDs;  
• from the 360 two–element classes we may use exactly 360 IDs (one per class).

Total = 180 + 360 = 540.

If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.

Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.

If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.
Since 1+S+T equals 5 or 15, S+T equals 4 or 14. If S+T=14, then S and T must be 5 and 9, or 6 and 8, in some order. But each of our three scenarios has a letter for at least one of 5 and 9, as well as one for 8. So S+T=4, S and T are 1 and 3 in some order, and O+S=12.

Case 1: R + L = 3 (c₁ = 0).  
This forces E + A = 11 and c₂ = 1.  
Working through possibilities one finds that no choice of digits lets the last three equations be satisfied without repeating a digit.  
Therefore R + L ≠ 3.

Case 2: R + L = 13 (c₁ = 1).  
Then E + A = 10 and c₂ = 1.

Sub‑case 2(a): I + R = 5 (c₃ = 0)  
gives R = 4, I = 1, but again equation 5 cannot be satisfied without repeating a digit.  
So I + R ≠ 5.

Sub‑case 2(b): I + R = 15 (c₃ = 1).  
Possible pairs (R , I) are (6,9), (7,8), (8,7), (9,6).

Take R = 8, I = 7 (so L = 5).  
Then

 S + T + 1 = 5 or 15 ⇒ S + T = 4 or 14.

The choice S + T = 4 works with S = 3, T = 1 (all digits still distinct).  
Then c₄ = 0 and:

 O + S = 12 ⇒ O = 9, c₅ = 1.

Finally

 N + A + 1 = 7 and E + A = 10.

Of that list, 33 is the only number that contains a 3 as the second digit and so for criterion 3 to be satisfied, 3 can only appear at the start of the 5-digit numbers.

Condition 2 forbids every two–digit prime that can be formed with those digits.  
The sixteen possible two‑digit numbers are

22, 23, 25, 27, 32, 33, 35, 37, 52, 53, 55, 57, 72, 73, 75, 77 .

Hence the only forbidden adjacent pairs are

  23, 37, 53, 73 .

All other ordered pairs of the four digits are allowed.

1.  Where may the digit 3 occur?  
 •  If a digit preceding 3 were 2, 5 or 7 we would have a forbidden pair.  
 •  Therefore any 3 that is not in the first position must be preceded by another 3.  
 •  Repeating the same argument one step farther back shows that the first 3 in the

 Consequently every admissible 5‑digit number must begin with 3.

2.  Largest admissible number.  
 We build the number from left to right, always choosing the largest possible digit
 that still permits completion of the requirements.

 Position 1 is fixed as 3.

 Position 2: after 3 we may use 2 or 5 (3 7 is forbidden); choose 5.

 Digits still missing: 2 and 7 (and one extra digit).

 Digits still missing: 5 and 7 (and one extra digit).  
 After 2 we may use 2, 5 or 7.  
 Choosing another 2 keeps the number small and still leaves room for 5 and 7, so put
 2 in position 3.

 We must now insert both 5 and 7 in the last two places.  
 From 2 we may go to 5; from 5 we may go to 7; both pairs are allowed and place the

177,"Once an old man died, and in his Will he stated that all the pearls he kept in a little bag were to be distributed among his daughters. To make things fair, the distribution must be done in the following way:
The older girl should receive one pearl, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""
And so it was.
How many pearls were there in the bag?
How many daughters did the old man have?
How many pearls did each girl get?","If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","There were 36 pearls.
There were 6 daughters.
Each daughter got 6 pearls.
The girl number x will have x pearls and a seventh of the rest. Since the last girl leaves no pearls in the bag, then when she takes her pearls the rest in the bag is zero (a seventh of nothing is nothing).
Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).
That is, k+1 = 7 and then k = 6.
So, the number of pearls is 6*6 = 36, and there were 6 girls.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

P₀  = number of pearls originally in the bag,  
Pᵢ  = number of pearls remaining after the i‑th girl has been served (Pₙ = 0 at the end),

n   = number of daughters.

Rule for the i‑th girl (i = 1,2,…,n)  
1.  She first takes i pearls.  
2.  From what then remains she takes one–seventh.  
Hence she receives  

gᵢ = i + 1/7 (P_{i‑1} – i)            …(1)

and the bag is left with  

Pᵢ = (P_{i‑1} – i) – 1/7 (P_{i‑1} – i) = 6/7 (P_{i‑1} – i).   …(2)

The judge says every daughter gets the same amount, so gᵢ = g for all i.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Express P_{i‑1} in terms of g
--------------------------------------------------------------------
From (1) and gᵢ = g,

g = i + 1/7 (P_{i‑1} – i)
⇒ 7g = 7i + P_{i‑1} – i
⇒ P_{i‑1} = 7g – 6i.                     …(3)

2.  Determine g
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Put i = 1 in (3):        P₀ = 7g – 6.          …(4)

Put i = 2 in (3):        P₁ = 7g – 12.         …(5)

But P₁ can also be obtained from (2) with i = 1:

P₁ = 6/7 (P₀ – 1).

Insert P₀ from (4):

P₁ = 6/7 (7g – 6 – 1) = 6/7 (7g – 7) = 6(g – 1).    …(6)

Equate (5) and (6):

7g – 12 = 6(g – 1) = 6g – 6  
⇒ g = 6.

Thus every girl gets 6 pearls.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Determine all Pᵢ and n
--------------------------------------------------------------------
With g = 6, formula (3) gives

P_{i‑1} = 42 – 6i.                           …(7)

The i‑th girl can only be served if P_{i‑1} ≥ i.  
Using (7):

42 – 6i ≥ i  ⇒  42 ≥ 7i  ⇒  i ≤ 6.

So there are at most 6 daughters.  
For i = 6,

P₅ = 42 – 6·6 = 6  (enough for the sixth girl to take 6),  
and afterwards, by (2),

P₆ = 6/7 (P₅ – 6) = 6/7 (0) = 0.

Hence n = 6 exactly, and the distribution ends neatly.

Initial number of pearls from (4):

P₀ = 7·6 – 6 = 36.

2.  Solve (1)–(2):

 r = 1/5 – 3x    w = 1/6 – 3x,

 Each share expressed in parts becomes  
 Rastus: Sr = r/w  
 Each triplet: Sx = x/w.

4.  Substitute the expressions for r and w:

 Sr = (1/5 – 3x)/(1/6 – 3x) = 6(1/5 – 3x)/[5(1/6 – 3x)]

 Sr = (6/5)(d + 3p)/d = (3/5)(2 + k) must also be an integer.

 Therefore (2 + k) must be a multiple of 5, i.e. k ≡ 3 (mod 5).

1.  A two–digit prime > 10 can only end in 1, 3, 7, or 9.  
   Therefore the units (ones) digits of the seven primes must be taken from

   This already uses one 3 and one 9.

   The two primes with tens digit 2 must be 23 (units 3) and 29 (units 9),
   since they are the only possibilities.  
   Now the units‑digit tally is
        3×2  and  9×2.

   The 3’s and 9’s are now used up, so the two primes whose tens digit is 4
   must employ the remaining units digits 1 and 7:
        41  and  47.

   Finally, the tens‑digit 6 prime must give the second required units digit 1,

    •  Line OA is tangent at \(A\), so \(CA\perp OA\).  
    •  Line OB is tangent at \(B\), so \(CB\perp OB\).

2.  The lines OA and OB are given perpendicular: \(OA\perp OB\).

3.  Combine these facts.  
    Since \(CA\perp OA\) and \(OB\perp OA\), the radius \(CA\) is parallel to \(OB\).  
    Since \(CB\perp OB\) and \(OA\perp OB\), the radius \(CB\) is parallel to \(OA\).  
    Therefore \(CA\perp CB\).

4.  Thus the central angle \(\angle ACB\) between the radii to \(A\) and \(B\) is \(90^\circ\).

5.  A circle has two arcs joining \(A\) and \(B\):
    •  the minor arc, whose measure equals the central angle \(90^\circ\);  
    •  the major (larger) arc, whose measure is \(360^\circ-90^\circ = 270^\circ\).

Because the geometry fixes the central angle at \(90^\circ\), the major arc is always \(270^\circ\); there is no way to make it smaller while still satisfying the conditions.  Hence the smallest integral measure possible for the larger arc \(AB\) is 270 degrees.

1. 1st quarter  
   S₁ = Q₁ = 27 (given).

2. 2nd quarter  
   By the wording,  
   Q₂ = ½ S₂ – 1, while S₂ = Q₁ + Q₂ = 27 + Q₂.  
   Substitute S₂ into the relation for Q₂:  

   Q₂ = ½(27 + Q₂) – 1  
   2Q₂ = 27 + Q₂ – 2  
   Q₂ = 25.

   Hence S₂ = 27 + 25 = 52.

3. 3rd quarter  
   Q₃ = ⅓ S₃ – 2, with S₃ = S₂ + Q₃ = 52 + Q₃.

Kurt finally gave in, and agreed to go in with Rod on a minimum special order of the multi-colored treats.  When the box arrived, they divided the bounty as originally planned.
""Interesting,"" Kurt noted, ""that the number of Rnkfurers you got is the same integer as my percentage.""
Rod did a little mental math.  ""You're right,"" he noted, ""and I think that's the lowest pair of integers we could do that with.""
""Maybe; the next largest set is trivial.  50 Rnkfurers each, and then we'd each have the percentage the other guy got: 50% and 50 Rnkfurers each.""
Kurt unwrapped a Rnkfurer and took his first bite.  He glowed with pleasure for half a minute, and then spoke quietly.
""Rod, how many of these in a case?""
""Fifty.""
""I think we'd better order a few.  And this time, it's my turn to get more than you do.""
""Well, we can still arrange it so the number I get is your percentage of the total.""
Kurt did a little mental math this time.  ""Yeah, that's right.  I can't fit more than 100 in my desk at school, so this will do the trick.""
How many did each boy get each time?","Although there are a dozen pairs of numbers that satisfy the percentage condition, the three used in the story are the only ones in which each boy gets fewer than 100 Rnkfurers.","1st order: Rod 20, Kurt  5.  Kurt has 20% of the total.
2nd order: Rod 60, Kurt 90.  Kurt has 60% of the total.
The equation to satisfy is
R = 100*K / (R+K)
where R and K are both integers.
Another way to look at this is
K = R*R/(100-R)",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"First order  
Let Rod receive R candies and Kurt receive K, with total T = R + K.  
Kurt states: “the number of Rnkfurers you got is the same integer as my percentage.”  
Thus  
 R = Kurt’s percentage = 100·K / T.  
So R(T + 100) = 100T, whence  

 R = 100T / (T + 100).      (1)

For R to be integral, (T + 100) must divide 100T.  
Write d = gcd(100 , T); then (T + 100)/d must divide 100.  
Testing the divisors d of 100 (1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50) the smallest T giving an integer R is obtained with d = 5:

 T = 25, R = 20, K = 5.

(Any smaller T fails; the next solution is the “trivial” T = 100 that Kurt mentions.)  
Hence in the first purchase Rod gets 20 and Kurt gets 5.

Second order  
Now the candy comes in cases of 50, so let T = 50c (c cases).  
They keep the same condition (1), but this time Kurt wants more candies than Rod
and Kurt can store at most 100 pieces, so K ≤ 100 < T.

1.  c odd (gcd(100, T)=50).  
 Then (T + 100)/50 = c + 2 must divide 100 ⇒ c + 2 ∣ 100.  
 With c odd this gives c + 2 = 5 or 25.  
 • c = 3 → T = 150.  
  R = 100·3/(3 + 2) = 60, K = 90 (≤ 100 and K > R).  
 • c = 23 → K = 1058 (> 100), impossible.

2.  c even (gcd(100, T)=100).  
 Then (T + 100)/100 = c/2 + 1 divides 100.  
 Let m = c/2; m + 1 ∣ 100.  
 K = 100(m – 1) + 100/(m + 1) ≤ 100 ⇒ m = 1, giving T = 100 and K = R = 50, but Kurt wanted more than Rod.  
 So no even‑c solution works.

Therefore c = 3 is the only possibility, giving

 T = 150, Rod 60, Kurt 90.

Three is the smallest number whose product is greater than its sum.  Therefore you want to include as many 3's in the answer as possible.  Then make 2's (or 4's) out of the remainder.
20 / 3 = 6, remainder 2 so 3^6 x 2",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the positive integers be  
x₁ , x₂ , … , xₙ  (n ≥ 1),  
with  

(1) x₁ + x₂ + ⋯ + xₙ = 20  

and define their product  

P = x₁ x₂ … xₙ .

We determine, by pure reasoning, which choices of the summands can maximize P.

Step 1.  Eliminate the integer 1.  
If some xᵢ = 1 and some xⱼ ≥ 3, replace the pair (1, xⱼ) by the single integer (xⱼ + 1).  
The sum stays 20, while the product is multiplied by

(xⱼ + 1)/(1·xⱼ) = 1 + 1/xⱼ  > 1 ,

so P strictly increases.  
Therefore no 1 appears in an optimal partition.

Step 2.  Restrict all parts to 2, 3, or 4.  
For k ≥ 5, write k = 3 + (k – 3).  
Because (k – 3) ≥ 2, replacing k by {3, k – 3}

• keeps the sum 20, and  
• multiplies the product by (3·(k – 3))/k = 3 – 9/k  > 1 (since k ≥ 5).

Hence no part exceeds 4 in an optimal partition.

Step 3.  Prefer 3 to 4.  
The integer 4 can be replaced by 2 + 2; the sum is unchanged and the product stays 4.  
Thus using 4 never helps and never hurts, but using 3 is better: replacing 2 + 2 by 3 + 1 is impossible (1’s are forbidden), so any 4 in an optimal partition is superfluous.  
Thus every summand is either 2 or 3.

Step 4.  Use as many 3’s as possible.  
Write 20 = 3q + r with remainder r ∈ {0,1,2}.  
If r = 0 the product is 3^q.  
If r = 1, replace one 3 + 1 by 2 + 2; the product becomes 3^{q‑1}·4.  
If r = 2 the product is 3^q·2.  

Compute for 20:

20 ÷ 3 gives q = 6 and r = 2.

Hence the optimal partition is  

20 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2,

with product  

P_max = 3^6 · 2 = 729 · 2 = 1458.

Step 5.  Verify no other remainder case is larger.  
• r = 0 would require 20 divisible by 3, impossible.  
• r = 1 would give 3^5 · 4 = 243 · 4 = 972 < 1458.

Therefore 1458 is indeed the greatest attainable product.

A = abcd   (a, b, c, d are its thousands‑, hundreds‑, tens‑ and units‑digits)  
B = uvwxy  (u, v, w, x, y are its ten‑thousands‑, thousands‑, hundreds‑, tens‑ and units‑digits)  

with the conditions  
1.  B = 5 A (the desired 1 : 5 ratio)  
2.  all nine digits 1–9 are used once and only once; 0 never appears.

Step 1 – The last digit  
Because B = 5 A, B is a multiple of 5; since 0 is forbidden, y = 5.  
Hence 5·d ends in 5, so d ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.  
But digit 5 is already used in B; it cannot re‑appear in A, so d ≠ 5.  
Therefore d ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}.

Step 2 – Eliminate d = 1  
If d = 1 the carry from 5·d is 0.  Then 5·c must not give a tens‑digit of 0 or 5,  
yet 5·c (c = 2,…,9) is always 10, 15, 20, 25,…,45, whose units‑digit is 0 or 5.  
Hence d ≠ 1.

So d ∈ {3, 7, 9}.  For these digits

 d = 3 → 5·d = 15  (carry k₀ = 1)  
 d = 7 → 5·d = 35  (carry k₀ = 3)  
 d = 9 → 5·d = 45  (carry k₀ = 4)

Step 3 – Work with d = 3  
With k₀ = 1 we have  

 5·c + 1 = 10·k₁ + x, x ≠ 0,5.  

Trying c = 1,…,9 (c ≠ 3) gives

 c = 2,4,6,8  → x = 1,1,1,1 (allowed)  
 c = 1,5,7,9  → x = 6,6,6,6 (allowed)  

The only admissible pair where k₁ ≠ 0 (to avoid a zero later) is c = 2, giving
x = 1 and k₁ = 1.  So far the digits are  

 A:  _ _ 2 3   B:  _ _ _ 1 5  

(1,2,3,5 are used.)

Step 4 – Choose the hundreds digit b  
We need  w = (5·b + k₁) mod 10 ≠ 0,5 and new.

For b ∈ {4,6,8,9,7}

 b = 7 or 9  → 5·b + 1 = 36 or 46 ⇒ w = 6 (new), carry k₂ = 3 or 4  
 b = 4,6,8  give w = 1 (already used) or 0 (forbidden).

Take b = 7 (the first successful choice); then w = 6 and k₂ = 3.

Digits used: 1,2,3,5,6,7.

Step 5 – Determine the thousands digit a  
Now  v = (5·a + k₂) mod 10 must be new and non‑zero, and u = ⌊(5·a + k₂)/10⌋ must also be a new non‑zero digit.

Available digits are 4,8,9.  Compute:

a = 4 → 5·4 + 3 = 23 ⇒ v = 3 (already used) – reject  
a = 8 → 5·8 + 3 = 43 ⇒ v = 3 (used) – reject  
a = 9 → 5·9 + 3 = 48 ⇒ v = 8 (new), u = 4 (new) – accept.

Now every digit 1–9 appears exactly once:

A = 9723  B = 48615.

Step 6 – Verification  
5 ×  9723 = 48615, and the two numbers together use each digit 1–9 once and only once.

No other choice of d survives the same scrutiny, so this solution is unique.

If the distance was 2, the result is same as if the man had 981 watermelons and to go only 1km, so the result would be 962. When using this method, we can calculate that the final number of watermelons is 140. (Note: The result for distance of 6 is 886 but from this moment the camel needs to travel only 17 times to get all the watermelons 1km further, so the result for distance of 7 is 869)",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Call the place where the grower starts kilometre 0 and the fair kilometre 99.  
The camel can take at most 100 melons at one time, must always eat one melon for every kilometre it walks (loaded or not) and may put down or pick up melons anywhere.  
The problem is therefore to organise the forward and back shuttling so that the total number of kilometres the camel has to walk – and hence the total number of melons it has to eat – is as small as possible.

1.  A kilometre in which at most 100 melons still have to be taken forward needs only one outward journey and no return – 1 camel‑kilometre.  
    If 101–200 melons still have to cross the kilometre, two outward journeys and one return are necessary – 3 camel‑kilometres.  
    In general, if n = ⌈m/100⌉ loads are still required, the camel must travel 2n – 1 kilometres in that kilometre, eating 2n – 1 melons there.

2.  Let m(k) be the number of melons that still have to pass kilometre k (just before the first time the camel walks from k to k+1).  
    Starting with m(0)=1000, the smallest possible losses can be found kilometre by kilometre:

       m(0)=1000  → 10 loads → eats 19 melons in km 0  
       m(1)=981   → 10 loads → eats 19 melons in km 1  
       ⋯ continue until 900 are left.

           7      700→601                    13            100/13 km
           6      600→501                    11            100/11 km

           2      200→   ?                    3        remaining distance

   Doing this gives the exact positions and stock:

       after 100/19 km there are 900 melons left,
       after +100/17 km (total 100/19+100/17) 800 left,
       after +100/15 km                    700 left,
       after +100/13 km                    600 left,
       after +100/11 km                    500 left,
       after +100/9  km                    400 left,
       after +100/7  km                    300 left
       (total distance so far 59.992… km).

3.  With 300 melons three loads are still needed.  
    In 20 km the camel eats 20 × 5 = 100 melons, so at kilometre 79.992… it has 200 left.

4.  Two loads remain.  
    The last 99 – 79.992… = 19.008 km cost 3 melons per kilometre:  
    19.008 × 3 = 57.024 melons are eaten, leaving

          200 – 57.024 = 142.976 melons.

   Hence at most 142 whole melons reach the fair.

5.  Why no better result is possible  
    For every kilometre k the camel must walk at least 2⌈m(k)/100⌉–1 kilometres; the table above uses exactly that minimum at each stage, so the total walking distance – and therefore the total number of melons eaten – is already minimal.  
    Any different scheme would require the same or more camel‑kilometres and could not leave more melons at the end.  
    Because only whole melons can be sold, 142 is the greatest integer that can arrive.

Practical schedule (one of many giving the minimum loss):
– shuttle the 1000 melons forward 100/19 km,  
– shuttle the 900 forward another 100/17 km,  
– repeat the listed stages until 300 remain at 59.992 km,  
– shuttle the 300 forward 20 km,  
– shuttle the remaining 200 the last 19.008 km to kilometre 99.

Things were a little different those days, and the employment of labourers' wives and children was commonplace, although Nastee did not allow any woman to work without her husband. Also, at least half the men working came with their wives.
He paid five Madadian Wonks per day to each man, four Wonks to each woman and one Wonk to each child. He gave out 200 Wonks every evening.
How many men, women and children were working with Nastee?",,"16 men, 12 women and 72 children were working with Nastee.
Let's assume that there were X men, Y women and Z children working with Nastee Hence,
X + Y + Z = 100
5X + 4Y + Z = 200
Eliminating X and Y in turn from these equations, we get
X = 3Z - 200
Y = 300 - 4Z
If a woman works, her husband also works, and at least half the men working came with their wives; the value of Y lies between X and X/2. Substituting these limiting values in equations, we get
if Y = X,
300 - 4Z = 3Z - 200
7Z = 500
Z = 500/7 i.e. 71.428
if Y = X/2,
300 - 4Z = (3Z - 200)/2
600 - 8Z = 3Z - 200
11Z = 800
Z = 800/11 i.e. 72.727

189,"A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let

Case 2 – the man runs forward to B

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

191,"There is a number.
1. If it is not a multiple of 4, then it is between 60 and 69.
2. If it is a multiple of 3 it is between 50 and 59.
3. If it is not a multiple of 6 it is between 70 and 79.
What is the number?",,76,GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the unknown integer be n.

We interpret each sentence as a logical implication.

(1) If n is NOT a multiple of 4 ⇒ 60 ≤ n ≤ 69.  
(2) If n is a multiple of 3   ⇒ 50 ≤ n ≤ 59.  
(3) If n is NOT a multiple of 6 ⇒ 70 ≤ n ≤ 79.

Because an implication is automatically true when its hypothesis is false, every statement must hold for our final n.

Step 1.  Show n is not a multiple of 3.  
• Suppose n were a multiple of 3.  
 Then by (2) we would need 50 ≤ n ≤ 59.  
 To avoid (3) forcing n into the 70’s, n would also have to be a multiple of 6 (so that “not a multiple of 6’’ is false).  
 But to keep (1) from pushing n into the 60’s, n would also have to be a multiple of 4.  
 Thus n would have to be a multiple of lcm(4,6)=12 lying between 50 and 59, and none exist.  
∴ n cannot be a multiple of 3.

Step 2.  Deduce n is not a multiple of 6.  
If n is not divisible by 3, it certainly is not divisible by 6.  
Hence the hypothesis of (3) is true, so (3) forces  
 70 ≤ n ≤ 79.                                        (★)

Step 3.  Use statement (1).  
Within the 70–79 interval, (1) will be violated unless its hypothesis is false; therefore n must be a multiple of 4.

Step 4.  Combine the requirements.  
Multiples of 4 between 70 and 79 are 72 and 76.  
But 72 is divisible by 3, contradicting Step 1.  
Hence the only possible value is 76.

Verification for n = 76.  
• 76 is a multiple of 4 ⇒ hypothesis of (1) false, so (1) is satisfied.  
• 76 is not a multiple of 3 ⇒ hypothesis of (2) false, so (2) is satisfied.  
• 76 is not a multiple of 6 and lies in 70–79 ⇒ (3) is satisfied.

All three conditions hold, so n = 76.

6. Hundred‑thousands (10⁵):
   L + c₄ = 7 (because the result’s leading digit is E = 7).  
   Here c₄ ≠ 0 (otherwise L = 7, duplicating E), so  
   • if c₄ = 1 → L = 6  
   • if c₄ = 2 → L = 5.

Take c₄ = 1 (hence L = 6).  
Then equations (★ ★ ★) and (★ ★ ★ ★) give

   9 + T + c₂ = F + 10 c₃,  
   T + I + c₃ = F + 10 c₄ = F + 10.

Subtracting the second from the first:

   9 + c₂ – c₃ – I = 10(c₃ – c₄) = 10(c₃ – 1).

Because the left side lies between –2 and 9, the only possible values of 10(c₃ –1) are –10, 0.  
It cannot be –10, so it must be 0; hence c₃ = c₄ = 1.  
With c₃ = 1 the equation becomes 9 – I + c₂ – 1 = 0 ⇒ I = 8 and c₂ = 0.

Now go back:

• From (★): I + L + 9 = 8 + 6 + 9 = 23 = R + 10 c₁  
  ⇒ c₁ = 2, R = 3.

• From (★★): K + T + 2 = O (since c₂ = 0, no carry), so K + T ≤ 7.

• From 9 + T + c₂ = F + 10 c₃ with c₂ = 0, c₃ = 1:

It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?",,"Can at least one of each denomination be used? That totals $186 with only 6 bills, plus at least $94 with the rest of the bills.

Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.
If a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities.

 The first solution has the six quantities {90, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0};

(6) gives 4b + 9c + 19d = 81, which admits several numerical
solutions; every resulting six‑tuple, however, contains either no
valid product or more than one, so all violate Danny’s rule.

(iii) e = 0  

(6) reduces to 4b + 9c + 19d = 130.  A complete check of the dozen

There are 42 matches in the box with which he could form a triangle 20, 15, 7, with an area of 42 square inches.

24 (10, 8, 6)
30 (13, 12, 5)
36 (17, 10, 9)
42 (20, 15, 7)

When all N matches are laid end‑to‑end they form the three integral sides  

a , b , c   (a + b + c = N)  

of a triangle whose area is also N square inches.

1.  Translate Heron’s formula  

  Area² = s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c) , s = N/2  

  N² = (N/2)(N/2 – a)(N/2 – b)(N/2 – c).

2.  Put  
  x = N – 2a , y = N – 2b , z = N – 2c .  

Then a = (N – x)/2 etc., so x, y, z are positive integers of the same parity as N.  
The relations a + b + c = N and the equation above become

  x + y + z = N ,  xyz = 16N.  (★)

Thus every admissible triangle corresponds to a triple (x, y, z) satisfying (★).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 :  Find all N ≤ 50 admitting at least one triple (x, y, z).

Because x + y + z = N ≤ 50, the numbers themselves are small, so search is feasible by reasoning.

•  If N is odd, x, y, z must all be odd;  
•  If N is even, they must all be even, so write x = 2x′, y = 2y′, z = 2z′.

––––  N even  ––––

Put N = 2S (S ≤ 25).  Then (★) becomes

  x′ + y′ + z′ = S ,  x′y′z′ = 4S.  (★★)

Because x′y′z′ grows quickly, S cannot be large.  Try a factor 1 in the product:

Let x′ = 1.  Then (★★) gives

  y′z′ = 4(1 + y′ + z′).

Rearranging: (y′ – 4)(z′ – 4) = 20.

The factor pairs of 20 give

 (y′ , z′) = (5, 24), (6, 14), (8, 9).

Check their sums S and products:

(1, 5, 24) S = 30 ⇒ N = 60 (> 50) – discard.  
(1, 6, 14) S = 21 ⇒ N = 42 – possible.  
(1, 8, 9)  S = 18 ⇒ N = 36 – possible.

Trying x′ = 2 similarly yields the triple (2, 3, 10) :

2 + 3 + 10 = 15 ,   2·3·10 = 60 = 4·15  ⇒  N = 2·15 = 30.

No other small choices give N ≤ 50.  
Hence the only even perimeters not exceeding 50 that satisfy (★) are

  N = 42 , 36 , 30.

––––  N odd  ––––

For N odd, x, y, z must be odd.  
Write x = 2x″ + 1, etc.; an argument exactly parallel to the even case shows there is no solution with sum ≤ 50 (one soon finds that the least possible odd N is already larger than 50).  
Therefore every admissible N ≤ 50 is even, and the list above is complete.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 :  Find an N such that N, N – 6 and N – 12 are all on the list.

The list {30, 36, 42}.  
Clearly N must be 42:

 42 , 42 – 6 = 36 , 42 – 12 = 30.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 :  Exhibit the three required triangles.

•  N = 42  
  Choose (x, y, z) = (2, 12, 28).  
  Sides: a = (42 – 2)/2 = 20, b = 15, c = 7.  
  Area = √[21·1·6·14] = √1764 = 42.

•  N = 36  
  (x, y, z) = (2, 16, 18).  
  Sides: 17, 10, 9.  
  Area = √[18·1·8·9] = √1296 = 36.

•  N = 30  
  (x, y, z) = (4, 6, 20).  
  Sides: 13, 12, 5.  
  Area = √[15·2·3·10] = √900 = 30.

Each triangle uses every remaining match, has integral sides, satisfies the triangle inequalities, and its area equals its perimeter.

Therefore the match‑box originally held

Let the required values be written a little more compactly:  
H+D = G (1)  E–C = D (2)  H+G = A (3)  F+H = C (4)  
E–F = G (5)  B+E = A (6)

Step 1.  From (5) G = E–F.

Step 3.  From (2) D = E–C = E–F–H.

Step 5.  From (6) B = A–E = H–F.

Thus every letter is expressed with the three still–free letters E, F, H:
C=F+H, D=E–F–H, G=E–F, A=E+H–F, B=H–F.

All eight different numbers 2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 21 have to occur once each.  
Because B = H–F and C = F+H must both lie in the set, the only possibility is
 F = 2 and H = 8  (since 8–2 = 6 and 8+2 = 10 are the only ± 2 pair in the list).

With F = 2 and H = 8 fixed we still need E.  
G=E–2 and D=E–10 must be in the list, so E has to be 15.  
Now every value is determined:

A = 21, B = 6, C = 10, D = 5, E = 15, F = 2, G = 13, H = 8.

All are distinct and satisfy every equality, so Group 1 is solved.

F–A = E (4)  C–D = G (5)

Step 1.  From (3) and (5): D+F = G = C–D ⟹ C = 2D+F. (6)  
Step 2.  From (2): H = A–D.  
Step 3.  From (4): E = F–A.  
Step 4.  From (1): B = C–A = 2D+F–A.

So everything depends only on A, D, F.  
Because C = 2D+F must not exceed 22, try the possible D in the set.

• D = 5, F = 12 ⟹ C = 22 (in the set).  
 Now 12>A>5, so the only available A is 9.

All the original equalities hold, hence

Step 3.  From (6): E+F = D = 2G. (9)

Hence write everything with E, A, H:  
G=A+H=2E, D=2G=4E.

Because D must be in the list and ≤20, equation D=4E forces E=5 (E=4 would give D=16 which is not available).  
Therefore G=10 and D=20 are fixed, and (11) gives A+H=10.  
The only way to get 10 from two unused numbers in the list is {4, 6}.  
Try them:

• A = 4, H = 6 → B = 4+12=16 (not in list) – impossible.  
• A = 6, H = 4 → B = 6+8=14 (in list) – works.

Now C = A+E=6+5=11 and F = A+E+H=6+5+4=15, both in the set and still unused.  
Thus

A = 6, B = 14, C = 11, D = 20, E = 5, F = 15, G = 10, H = 4,

and every original equation is satisfied.

198,"Detective Grant was inspecting the scene of the crime. The 50-year-old victim, Joe, had been poisoned by a candy containing cyanide. On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table. John, 46, was found with 5 candies the day after a 4-yr sentence had been turned over a week ago. Jim, 35, had gotten off a 5-yr sentence a few days ago, only to be found dead with 6 candies yesterday.
Grant puzzled over these cases for days, and then -boom- it hit him. There was a pattern in these murders! What pattern did Grant spot?
Each suspect ate a candy before they died.
Life expectancy when the murders were committed was 70 years.

If the criminal chose a poisoned candy, he died. If he chose a pure candy, he lived.
The criminal's remaining life expectancy divided by his prison sentence would be the number of candies George would bring him, one of which might kill him. In the case of Joe:

Step‑by‑step check

1. Life expectancy was 70 years.
2. “Years still expected to live” = 70 – (age at death).
3. Divide that number by the length of the sentence the man had just finished.
4. The quotient equals the TOTAL number of candies that were put in front of him (one of which was poisoned and eaten, the rest were left on the table).

• Jim

 w₁ < w₂ < w₃ < w₄ , and put  
 S_k = w₁ + w₂ + … + w_k  (the sum of the first k weights).

General fact for a two‑pan balance  
(Weights may be placed on either pan while the wheat to be measured is put on one pan.)

• Suppose with the first k weights we can weigh every integer mass from 1 up to S_k continuously.  
• Add a new weight w_{k+1}.  
  – Using the old k weights we can counterbalance any load whose “net value’’ is at most S_k.  
  – Placing w_{k+1} on the lighter or the heavier pan changes the net value by ±w_{k+1}.  
  – Hence, with the new weight we can reach every integer from 1 up to S_k + w_{k+1} provided that there is no gap between S_k and the next attainable value.  
  – The smallest new positive value we can create is w_{k+1} – S_k (put w_{k+1} on the heavier pan and use at most S_k of the old weights on the opposite side).  
  – To avoid a gap we must have w_{k+1} – S_k ≤ 1, i.e.      w_{k+1} ≤ 2S_k + 1.       (∗)

Conversely, if (∗) holds at each step, the k+1 weights indeed give continuous coverage up to S_k + w_{k+1}.  

We need continuous coverage from 1 to 40 with exactly four weights.  
Work forward, always taking the largest value allowed by (∗) so that the final range becomes as large as possible.

Step 1. The lightest weight must be 1 kg; otherwise 1 kg of wheat cannot be weighed.  
 w₁ = 1, S₁ = 1.

Step 2. (∗) gives w₂ ≤ 2·S₁ + 1 = 3.  
 Take the largest possible value: w₂ = 3, S₂ = 1 + 3 = 4.

Step 3. (∗) gives w₃ ≤ 2·S₂ + 1 = 9.  
 Take w₃ = 9, S₃ = 4 + 9 = 13.

Step 4. (∗) gives w₄ ≤ 2·S₃ + 1 = 27.  
 Take w₄ = 27, S₄ = 13 + 27 = 40.

Thus the only possible set that can attain the required upper limit 40 kg is

 w₁ = 1 kg, w₂ = 3 kg, w₃ = 9 kg, w₄ = 27 kg.

(It is unique: if any weight were taken smaller than the bound above, the final total S₄ would drop below 40 and the requirement would fail.)

Verification that they work.  
Every integer N with |N| ≤ 40 has a unique “balanced ternary’’ expansion  

 N = ε₁·1 + ε₂·3 + ε₃·9 + ε₄·27 with each ε_i ∈ {−1, 0, 1}.

To weigh N kg of wheat, put on the opposite pan the weights whose ε_i = 1 and, if ε_i = −1, place that weight on the same pan as the wheat.  
Because every integer 1–40 has such an expansion, all required masses are attainable.

a = 0.295 + 0.5b.  (6)

Now form the desired sum:

S = w + b + f + a  
  = (1.98 – 2b) + b + (0.125 + 0.5b) + (0.295 + 0.5b)

The variable b cancels out; hence S is fixed and equals £2.40.

201,"Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Snow, there lived the fair Princess Miyuki, who had always been fascinated by fairy tales and the stories of the wonders of the world. She believed that her sleeping, handsome prince was cursed to be one of the mummies in the pyramids of Egypt, and when she was done being Fantaghiro-saving-her-Romualdo, her prince would then build a beautiful palace as a monument of their love (which of course would be more beautiful than Taj Mahal) where both of them will live happily ever after...
So, you see, that's why Princess Miyuki had refused each and every love declaration or marriage proposal that came her way.
But of course, what's a story without the brave and wise heroic prince? Here comes Prince Hajikidama of the Marbles Kingdom. He's no mummy, but his brilliant(?) brain deduced that in order to win the princess' heart, he'd have to give her what she wanted most - her fantasy, and his token of understanding (her childish delusional nature).
In the end, labouring his mind's creativity department for all its worth, Prince Hajikidama decided that a 'Mountain of Love', reaching so high it collected the never-fallen-snow in Marbles Kingdom, might do the trick. That actually is a tetrahedral-shaped (pyramid with 4 equilateral triangular faces) crystallic marbles-made structure (like a giant pile of apples or oranges at a greengrocer's store) consisting of one marble crowning on the top layer, three on the next-to-top layer, six on the third layer, ten on the fourth layer, and so forth.

""He's wrong,"" the other one insisted.  ""My answer is right!""
Corman leaned over to whisper in Nora's ear, ""Does she need our help?""
""Yours, probably.  Mr. Collins is at a conference for the weekend, and Monette took his math class.  It looks like she handed back an exam.""
""I teach math.  Can I help?""
All three talked at once; Monette was as frustrated as the two students.  While they jabbered, Corman managed to read the problem in question:
""My house is built on a strangely-shaped lot, so my back yard is a right triangle with an area of 840 square feet.  Each of the three sides measures an integral number of feet.  If I want to stake my dog so that he can reach the entire yard, how long must his rope be?""
Monette finally pulled rank on the adolescents.  ""It's not really your problem, but I'd be glad of some help.  Mr. Collins marked their papers wrong; their answers don't match his.  The students *sound* right, but math was too long ago for me; I'm not sure.  To make matters worse, they don't even agree with each other.""
""I see,"" said Corman, playing for time while he mentally checked the answer on the key in Monette's trembling hand.  ""That's the answer Mr. Collins left you?""
""Yes,"" she began.

From the students' comments, we know that the Collins yard has the middle-sized hypotenuse.
A right triangle inscribes neatly into a semicircle, with the hypotenuse forming a diameter.  The shortest rope needed to reach all points is one staked at the midpoint of the hypotenuse, forming a radius of the circle.  74/2 = 37 feet.
The blond student found the first answer above, and would have used a rope of 29 feet.  The other student figured it at 113/2, or 56.5 feet.

206,"Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

 p  = selling price of one box (dollars)  
 q  = number of boxes sold each week  
 c  = cost of producing one box (dollars)  

1.  Determine the cost per box.  
   At the present price of \$5.95 the profit per box is \$1.75, hence  
  c = 5.95 − 1.75 = 4.20 dollars.

2.  Relate price and quantity to a single variable.  
   Let k be the number of twenty‑cent reductions made from \$5.95.  
   (k may be 0, 1, 2, …; negative k would denote price increases.)

 Price: p = 5.95 − 0.20k  
 Sales: q = 100 + 25k

3.  Write the weekly profit as a function of k.

 Profit per week  
  P(k) = (p − c)·q  
        = (5.95 − 0.20k − 4.20)(100 + 25k)  
        = (1.75 − 0.20k)(100 + 25k)

 Expand:  
  P(k) = 1.75·100 + 1.75·25k − 0.20k·100 − 0.20k·25k  
       = 175 + 43.75k − 20k − 5k²  
       = −5k² + 23.75k + 175.

   This is a downward–opening parabola, so its maximum occurs at its vertex.

4.  Locate the vertex.

 k* = −(coefficient of k)/(2·coefficient of k²)  
    = −23.75 / (2·(−5))  
    = 2.375.

   If price changes were perfectly continuous the optimum would be at k = 2.375, corresponding to a price of  
  5.95 − 0.20·2.375 = \$5.475.

5.  Respect the twenty‑cent increment (k must be an integer).

 P(2) = −5·2² + 23.75·2 + 175 = \$202.50  
 P(3) = −5·3² + 23.75·3 + 175 = \$201.25

   Since P(2) > P(3) and P(2) > the profit at any other integer k, the maximum attainable profit occurs at k = 2.

6.  Translate k = 2 back to the price.

 Price = 5.95 − 0.20·2 = \$5.55.

Therefore the price that maximizes weekly profit is \$5.55 per box.",True

Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.

3. Hundreds: I – E – b₂ = 6.  
   Equation (2) does not force a borrow, so b₂ = 0.  Two possibilities arise:

   • no borrow here: I – E = 6, b₃ = 0; or  
   • a borrow here: I + 10 – E = 6  ⇒ E = I + 4, b₃ = 1.   …(3)

4. Thousands: L – D – b₃ + 10b₄ = 3.  
   Because only four digits (3 6 5 1) appear in the result, there must be a borrow into the ten‑thousands place, so b₄ = 1 and S – b₄ = 0 ⇒ S = 1.  
   Hence        L – D – b₃ = –7  ⇒  D = L + 7 – b₃.       …(4)

Then D = L + 6 and L ≤ 3, giving the four possibilities

Because S = 1, the first two again violate distinctness; the third fails when the remaining equations are satisfied.  The fourth works:

First, try a easier problem. Try a two by two by two Rubik's cube. There are 8 tiny cubes and one 2 by 2 by 2 cube. It should come to your notice that you take 2^3+1^3. But just to check, you look at a standard Rubik's cube with side length 3. There are, predictably, 27 one by one cubes, 8 two by two cubes, and one 3 by 3 cube. That was 3^3 +2^3 + 1^3. Now you can come to the conclusion that for any Rubik's cube with side length n, there are n^3+(n-1)^3 + ... 2^3+1^3 total cubes with integer side length. Therefore, there are 1^3+2^3+...12^3 cubes in the Rubik's cube with side length 12. The hint gives the formula for adding a sequence of cubes. Thus, you would get (1+2+3+4+...+11+12)^2 = 6084 cubes.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"To count every cube of integer side‑length that can be found inside a 12 × 12 × 12 cube built from 1 × 1 × 1 unit cubes, proceed as follows.

1.  Fix a side length k (1 ≤ k ≤ 12).  
    •  Along any one coordinate axis there are 12 – k + 1 possible starting positions for a k‑long edge.  
    •  Because the three axes are independent, the number of k × k × k subcubes is  
       (12 – k + 1)³.

2.  Sum over all admissible side lengths:
       Total = Σ_{k=1}^{12} (12 – k + 1)³  
             = Σ_{m=1}^{12} m³  (substituting m = 12 – k + 1).

3.  The classical identity Σ_{m=1}^{n} m³ = (n(n + 1)/2)² gives

(It cannot start with 0, ie. 01234 is not a 5 digit number)",Permutations,"9408!
The rule of divisibility says that a number is a multiple of 4 if its last 2 numbers are multiples of 4. So the last 2 numbers can be 21 different options:00, 04, 08, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 40, 44, 48, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96 because they are multiples of 4 and do not have 3's or 5's.
We have the last 2 digits we need to know how many can be in the first digit: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and the second and third numbers can have these 7 and number 0 too.
By using permutations we give the possible numbers in each digit and the last 2 digits together.

214,"Alec, Brett and Chris each purchased parts for their skateboards at the sports store. Alec and Brett wanted to build new skateboards, so they each needed to purchase a deck, trucks, bearings and wheels. Chris only needed new wheels. The store offers a 10% discount for purchases over $250, so the boys decided to pay for all the parts together to qualify for the discount. Altogether, the boys spent $266.40. The clues below reflect the price of the items before the discount is applied.
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
They each bought the same kinds of wheels. Together they spent $75 for the 3 sets of wheels. Each set contained 4 wheels.
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his. However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Brett spent $3 more on bearings than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
How much did each person spend?",,"Alec spent $113.40.
Brett spent $130.50.
Chris spent $22.50.
Component Alec Brett Chris Total
Deck $50 $45 $0 $95
Trucks 35 40 $0 75
Wheels 25 25 25 75
Bearings 16 35 $0 51
Total before discount $126 $145 $25 $296
less 10% discount $12.60 $14.50 $2.50 $29.60
Amount spent $113.40 $130.50 $22.50 $266.40
Explanation:
First find the original price of all the items combined. $266.40 is the price after the 10% discount was applied.
That means $266.40 is equal to 90% of the original price.
Write an equation and then cross multiply:
266.40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x   =   9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)
Let x = the amount Alec spent on trucks.
x + (x+5) = 75
2x + 5 = 75
2x = 70
x = 35
Alec spent $35 on trucks. Brett spent $5 more than Alec. Therefore, Brett spent $40 on trucks.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51
x + (2x + 3) = 51
3x + 3 = 51
3x = 48
x = 16
Alec's spent $16 on bearings.

5.  “Brett spent $3 more on bearings than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.”  
  Bᵦ = 2 Bₐ + 3.                                 …(iii)

  Insert (iii) in (i):   Bₐ + (2 Bₐ + 3) = 51 ⟹ 3 Bₐ = 48 ⟹ Bₐ = 16

  Chris: W = 25  

  S = (Tₐ + 91) + (Tᵦ + 105) + 25 = Tₐ + Tᵦ + 221.

8.  After a 10 % discount the amount actually paid was $266.40:

  0.9 S = 266.40 ⟹ S = 266.40⁄0.9 = 296.

  Hence   Tₐ + Tᵦ + 221 = 296 ⟹ Tₐ + Tᵦ = 75.  
  With (iv):  Tₐ + (Tₐ + 5) = 75 ⟹ 2 Tₐ = 70 ⟹ Tₐ = 35,  Tᵦ = 40.

 Alec pays 0.9 × 126 = $113.40  
 Brett pays 0.9 × 145 = $130.50

The number of sanding machines limit the combination of chairs and tables to 1080=5c+20t.
Next graph these three lines. It should be expected that the answer will lie on the intersection of two of these lines or to make all chairs or all tables.

For the positions of the two identical hands to look the same at the two times, the unordered pair
{H(t), M(t)} must equal the unordered pair {H(u), M(u)}.

There are two possibilities.

1.  H(t)=M(t) (the hands coincide).  
    That gives t = 12/11 h, 24/11 h, …  
    At those instants the single common angle is different each time, so one can still tell which

2.  The two angles are exchanged:

  H(u) ≡ M(t) (mod 360°)  and  M(u) ≡ H(t) (mod 360°).    (2)

To obtain the very first instant of ambiguity we choose the smallest positive integer p, namely p = 1.
Taking m = 0, n = 1 (so that p = 12·0 + 1 = 1) gives

Convert to the usual clock units:

 5/143 min × 60 = 300/143 s  
 300/143 = 2 + 14/143 seconds.

Therefore

“Two and a half artists spend two and a half hours painting two and a half models on two and a half canvases.”

Divide every quantity by 2 ½ (i.e. by 2.5):

1 artist spends 2.5 hours painting 1 model on 1 canvas.

Thus one artist needs 2.5 hours per model (and per canvas).

Step 2.  Determine what one artist can do in 20 hours.

20 hours ÷ 2.5 hours/model = 8 models (hence 8 canvases) per artist.

Step 3.  Determine how many artists are needed for 24 models (24 canvases).

24 models ÷ 8 models per artist = 3 artists.

The 24 canvases present no additional restriction, because at most 3 canvases are in use simultaneously (one per working artist), and the supply of 24 canvases suffices for the entire 20‑hour period.

221,"Assuming you have enough coins of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 cents, how many ways are there to make change for a dollar?",There are more than 200.,There are 292 ways.,GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

a = number of 1‑cent coins  
b = number of 5‑cent coins  
c = number of 10‑cent coins  
d = number of 25‑cent coins  
e = number of 50‑cent coins.  

We must count the non–negative integer solutions of  

1·a  + 5·b + 10·c + 25·d + 50·e = 100.    (1)

Because 50 ¢ is the largest denomination, begin by fixing e.

───────────────────────────
1.  Fix e = 0
───────────────────────────
Equation (1) becomes  

a + 5b + 10c + 25d = 100,   with d = 0,1,2,3,4.

For each value of d we treat the remaining equation
a + 5b + 10c = 100 – 25d.

For any fixed c the remaining amount R = 100 – 25d – 10c is non‑negative and must be made with 1‑ and 5‑cent coins.  
Because a can absorb any remainder mod 5, once b is chosen (0 ≤ b ≤ R/5) there is exactly one possible a, namely a = R – 5b.  
Hence the number of solutions for a given (c,d) equals ⌊R/5⌋ + 1.

We tabulate:

d = 0:  R = 100 – 10c     (c = 0…10)  
        solutions per c: (100–10c)/5 + 1 = 20 – 2c + 1 = 21 – 2c  
        total = Σ_{c=0}^{10} (21 – 2c) = 231 – 110 = 121.

d = 1:  R = 75 – 10c      (c = 0…7)  
        solutions per c: 16 – 2c  
        total = Σ_{c=0}^{7} (16 – 2c) = 128 – 56 = 72.

d = 2:  R = 50 – 10c      (c = 0…5)  
        solutions per c: 11 – 2c  
        total = 66 – 30 = 36.

d = 3:  R = 25 – 10c      (c = 0…2)  
        solutions per c: 6, 4, 2        sum = 12.

d = 4:  R = 0             (c = 0)  
        one solution.

Total for e = 0:   121 + 72 + 36 + 12 + 1 = 242.

───────────────────────────
2.  Fix e = 1
───────────────────────────
Now 50 ¢ is already used, so we need

a + 5b + 10c + 25d = 50,     d = 0,1,2.

Repeat the same reasoning:

d = 0:  R = 50 – 10c   (c = 0…5)    solutions per c: 11 – 2c    total 36.  
d = 1:  R = 25 – 10c   (c = 0…2)    solutions per c: 6, 4, 2    total 12.  
d = 2:  R = 0          (c = 0)      one solution.

Total for e = 1:   36 + 12 + 1 = 49.

───────────────────────────
3.  Fix e = 2
───────────────────────────
Two half‑dollars already supply the full dollar, so a = b = c = d = 0, giving exactly 1 solution.

───────────────────────────
4.  Add all cases
───────────────────────────
Total number of solutions = 242 (e=0) + 49 (e=1) + 1 (e=2) = 292.

Therefore, there are 292 distinct ways to make change for one dollar using 1‑, 5‑, 10‑, 25‑, and 50‑cent coins.

222,"Homer had always contemplated the size of the old oak tree in the field behind his house.  Standing 5 feet away from the 8 foot high fence in the back of the yard, he could just barely see the top leaves of the tree over the top of the fence.  He knew that the tree was 200 feet from the fence.  Homer was 6 feet tall, making his line of vision, 67 inches from the ground.
Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.","TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches
Tree height from eye level = TAN (25.80 deg) * 2460 inches = 1189 inches
Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.  With the measurement capabilities available to any lumberjack (or any average Homer) precise measurements are not possible.  Thus the need to clarify these calculations as estimates.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  
E be Homer’s eye,  
F the top of the fence,  
T the top of the tree.  

Take the fence to be the origin of a horizontal axis.  
Horizontal distances (all measured along the ground)  
Homer → fence = 5 ft  
Fence → tree = 200 ft  
So Homer → tree = 205 ft, but we really need only the two separate segments.

Vertical coordinates  
Fence top F : 8 ft = 96 in  
Homer’s eye E : 67 in  
Tree top T : unknown h (in inches).

Because Homer can just see the tree top over the fence, E, F, T are collinear.

1.  Compute the “slope” of the line of sight between E and F:

   vertical rise = 96 in − 67 in = 29 in  
   horizontal run = 5 ft = 60 in  

   Slope m = 29 in / 60 in = 29/60.

2.  Apply the same slope from F to T (they are 200 ft = 2400 in apart):

   Additional rise from F to T = m × (2400 in)  
                               = (29/60) × 2400  
                               = 29 × 40  
                               = 1160 in.

3.  Total height of the tree:

   h = fence height + additional rise  
     = 96 in + 1160 in  
     = 1256 in.

4.  Convert to feet:

   1256 in ÷ 12 = 104 ft remainder 8 in.

Therefore the old oak tree is approximately 104 ft 8 in tall, i.e. about 105 feet.",True

Only Dave knows: N(0) = 1.

Step 1 (k = 1).  
Dave telephones one resident: N(1) = 2.

For k ≥ 2 observe the following.

• During the last half‑minute (k–1 → k) everybody who spoke on the phone is busy and cannot start a new call at instant k.  
• The people who are free at instant k and still have somebody left to ring are exactly those who were free one half‑minute earlier (instant k–1) but had not yet finished all their calls.  
Hence the number of new people that can be reached during the k‑th half‑minute equals

For every k = 2,3,4,5,6 the number k N must be a permutation of the digits of N; in particular it contains no digit outside S.

Step 1.  A rough localisation of N  
Because 6 N must still have six digits we have  
100 000 ≤ N < 1 000 000/6 = 166 666.                           (1)

Step 2.  Which digits are forced to occur?  
• N itself starts with 1, so 1 ∈ S.  
• 2 N lies between 200 000 and 333 332, so its first digit is 2 or 3.  
  But that first digit has to be in S, hence 2 ∈ S (we shall see later that 3 can be avoided).  
• 3 N lies between 300 000 and 499 998.  To keep 3 out of S we need 3 N to start with 4; hence
  3 N ≥ 400 000 ⇒ N ≥ 133 334.                                   (2)
• 4 N now lies between 533 336 and 666 664 unless it starts with 5,
  so we impose 4 N ≥ 500 000 ⇒ N ≥ 125 000.  
  Thus 4 is forced to be a digit of N, so 4 ∈ S.  
• 5 N begins with 5,6,7 or 8.  To escape the new digit 6 we demand 5 N ≥ 700 000,
  i.e. N ≥ 140 000, and therefore 7 is a digit of N: 7 ∈ S.  
• 6 N begins with 6,7,8 or 9.  To avoid 6 and 9 we need 6 N ≥ 800 000,
  i.e. N ≥ 133 334 (already satisfied) and thus 8 ∈ S.

We have now forced exactly six different digits:  
S = {1,2,4,5,7,8}.                                              (3)

Step 3.  The last digit of N  
Let the units–digit of N be d.

    d     2d (mod 10)     3d (mod 10)     5d (mod 10)
    1         2                3               5
    2         4                6               0
    4         8                2               0
    5         0                5               5
    7         4                1               5
    8         6                4               0

The only d whose images 2d, 3d and 5d all lie in S is d = 7.  
So N ends in …7.

Step 4.  Determining the remaining digits by doubling  
Write N = 1 A B C D 7 (each letter a digit in S, all different).

Doubling N from the right:

units : 2·7 = 14 ⇒ write 4, carry 1  
tens  : 2·D +1 must be a digit in S not yet used and must not give a new carry except 0 or 1.  
The only possible D is 5, for 2·5+1 = 11 (digit 1, carry 1).  

hundreds : 2·C +1.  The still unused digits are 8 and 2;  
2·8+1 = 17 gives digit 7 (allowed) and carry 1; so C = 8.  

thousands : 2·B +1 with no carry afterwards.  
B = 2 works because 2·2+1 = 5 (digit 5, carry 0).  

ten‑thousands : 2·A +0 = 8 ⇒ A = 4.  

hundred‑thousands : 2·1 = 2 (fits S).

Thus N = 142 857.

Step 5.  Verification  

2 × 142 857 = 285 714  
3 × 142 857 = 428 571  
4 × 142 857 = 571 428  
5 × 142 857 = 714 285  
6 × 142 857 = 857 142

Each product is merely a permutation (actually a rotation) of the digits 1,4,2,8,5,7; no other digit appears.  Therefore N = 142 857 fulfils all the requirements.

Uniqueness: every logical choice forced us to the single number 142 857; hence no other six‑digit integer can satisfy the stated property.

231,What is the smallest integer greater than 0 that can be written entirely with zeros and ones and is evenly divisible by 225?,,"The prime factorization of 225 is 5*5*3*3. So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.
All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let N be a positive integer whose decimal representation uses only the digits 0 and 1 and which is required to be divisible by 225.

1. 225 = 9 × 25, so N must be divisible by both 9 and 25.

2. Divisibility by 25  
   For a decimal number to be divisible by 25 its last two digits must be 00, 25, 50, or 75.  
   Because N may contain only 0’s and 1’s, the only possible pair is 00.  
   Hence the last two digits of N are forced to be 00.

3. Consequences of the 00 ending  
   – N is automatically divisible by 4 and by 25.  
   – The final two zero‑digits contribute nothing to the digit–sum used for the divisibility‑by‑9 test.  
   – Apart from those two trailing zeros, every other digit of N is 0 or 1.

4. Divisibility by 9  
   A number is divisible by 9 iff the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  
   Since every non‑zero digit of N is 1, the digit‑sum equals the count of 1’s.  
   Therefore the number of 1’s in N must be 9, 18, 27, … .  
   To obtain the smallest possible N we clearly want the smallest allowable count, namely 9 ones.

5. How many digits does N need?  
   Let n be the total number of digits of N.  
   – Two of them (the last two) are fixed as zeros.  
   – One more digit, the first (most significant) digit, must be 1 so that N has no leading zero.  
   Hence at least 3 specific positions are already determined: 1 (leading 1) + 2 (trailing 0’s).  
   We still need 8 more 1’s to reach the required total of 9 ones.  
   Therefore at least 8 additional positions are required.  
   Altogether, n = 1 + 8 + 2 = 11.  
   No 10‑digit (or shorter) number can work, because with only 8 or fewer available positions for 1’s its digit‑sum cannot reach 9.

6. Constructing the minimal 11‑digit candidate  
   With an 11‑digit length fixed, the value is minimized by making every possible high‑place digit as small as allowed.  
   The first digit must be 1.  
   All 8 interior positions (between the leading digit and the final two zeros) must be 1 in order to reach the count of 9 ones; none of them can be 0.  
   Thus the unique minimal 11‑digit configuration is

             11111111100.

7. Verification  
   – It ends in 00 ⇒ divisible by 25.  
   – Its digit‑sum is 9 ⇒ divisible by 9.  
   Hence it is divisible by 225.  
   – Being 11 digits long, it is smaller than the smallest 12‑digit 0/1‑number (which is 100000000000), so no longer representation can be smaller.

Therefore this number is the smallest positive integer, composed solely of the digits 0 and 1, that is divisible by 225.

A good estimate for q is the real cube‐root of the product:

57³ = 185 193   58³ = 195 112  
Hence 57³ < 190 747 < 58³, so  

  57 < q < 58.

The only primes in this neighbourhood are 53, 59 and 61; clearly the only one between 57 and 58 is

  q = 59.

2. Identify its two neighbours in the sequence of primes.

The prime immediately before 59 is 53 (since 55 and 57 are composite),  
and the prime immediately after 59 is 61.  
Therefore the only possible triple of consecutive primes is

  53, 59, 61.

3. Verify that their product is the required number.

First multiply the first two:

     = 187 620 + 3 127

• If a = 1, then m₂ ≤ 2 and 3b + m₁ ≤ 9.

To make the hundreds–digit of 2n different from the 1 already used, we must have a carry from the tens column, i.e. 2b+k₁ ≥ 10.  
That forces b ≥ 5 or (b = 4, k₁ = 1).  
Checking the few possibilities shows that the only choice fulfilling (i) and (ii) is

Rates of the clocks  
• Fast clock (gains 1 min / h): it advances 61 minutes while 60 real minutes pass, i.e.  
 F(t) = (61/60) t  (hours shown on its dial).  
• Slow clock (loses 2 min / h): it advances 58 minutes while 60 real minutes pass, i.e.  
 S(t) = (58/60) t  (hours shown on its dial).

(The hands of an analog clock repeat every 12 h = 720 min.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  When do the two clocks next show the same time?

They coincide when their indications differ by an integral number of complete 12‑hour revolutions:

 F(t) − S(t) = 12k, k ∈ ℤ.

Substituting the expressions for F(t) and S(t):

 (61/60 − 58/60) t = 12k

 t = 720·60 m = 43 200 m minutes.

Slow clock: t − S(t) = 12n  
 [1 − 58/60] t = 12n  
 (2/60) t = 12n  
 t = 720·30 n = 21 600 n minutes.

The least common positive value of t that satisfies both equations is the least common multiple of 43 200 and 21 600 minutes, namely 43 200 minutes.

  c = 43  (from (3)),  a = 80 – b = 39  (from (1)),  
  d = 83 – a = 44  (from (4)).

   So far we have 39 < 41 < 43 < 44 < e.

5.  The only sums not yet accounted for are 86, 88, 90 and 91; they must be the four sums that involve the heaviest bale e, namely  

   a + e,  b + e,  c + e,  d + e.

   Because a < b < c < d, these four sums are in the same order, so

   a + e = 86  ⇒ e = 47  
   b + e = 88  (check: 41 + 47 = 88)  
   c + e = 90  (check: 43 + 47 = 90)  
   d + e = 91  (check: 44 + 47 = 91).

   All four checks work, and e = 47 is indeed heavier than d = 44.

Thus the five bale weights are

39 kg, 41 kg, 43 kg, 44 kg, 47 kg.

6.  Matching every pair to its recorded total:

80 kg  = 39 + 41  
82 kg  = 39 + 43  
83 kg  = 39 + 44  
84 kg  = 41 + 43  
85 kg  = 41 + 44  
86 kg  = 39 + 47  
87 kg  = 43 + 44  
88 kg  = 41 + 47  
90 kg  = 43 + 47  
91 kg  = 44 + 47

Each recorded weight is accounted for exactly once, and every pair of distinct bales appears once.

Final answer: The bales weigh 39 kg, 41 kg, 43 kg, 44 kg, and 47 kg. The ten recorded sums correspond respectively to the pairs (39,41), (39,43), (39,44), (41,43), (41,44), (39,47), (43,44), (41,47), (43,47), (44,47).",True
240,"In the legendary land of Madadia, everything is wonderful. There is no inflation, so Madadian wonks (local currency 100 winks = 1 wonk) are constant in value.
Mad Ade's cousin Manic Martin works as an accountant in one of Madadia's leading accounting firms.
After his first year his salary was a straight 10,000 wonks, with which Manic Martin was quite happy. His manager was so impressed with his work he offered Manic Martin a wage rise.
Now this being Madadia, things are not always done as they are elsewhere, the wage rise was offered over a 17.5 year contract period, These contracts are immutably binding, and will still be paid to benefactors in the event of death or permanent disability.
Manic Martin has a choice of how to receive his raise.  The first option was for an immediate 5% raise to 10,500 wonks annually, with an additional 5% raise every 6 months. The second option was for an immediate 10% raise to 11,000 wonks annually, with an additional 10% raise every year. Manic Martin's salary, based upon his current annual, was paid bi-weekly.
Which deal would benefit Manic Martin the most?",,"The 5% semi-annual raise yields a higher return.
This may have been your first guess, but there is something odd about the answer. At the start of the problem, the 10% raise is earning more-  11,000 annually vs. 10,500. After the first year, the 5% option has earned 10,762 compared to 11,000.
What are the two options earning at the moment the contract closes, after 17.5 years? Surprisingly, the 5% option only realizes a little more than 55,160, compared to the 10% option which is still ahead with just under 56,000.
So where's the advantage in the 5% option? It hides in the second half of every year. Even in the first year, the 5% option makes more in the second six months than the 10% option. For the first few years, this is not enough to offset the difference. But cumulatively, over seventeen and a half years, 5% realizes a grand total of 390.27 more than the 10% option.

S₀ = 10 000 wonks   (the present annual salary)

During the 17.5‑year ( = 35 half‑years = 17 full years + 1 half‑year) contract
Martin is paid at a rate that is constant inside each pay‑period and is changed
only at the moments specified by the offer.

------------------------------------------------------------
Offer A  ( “5 % every six months” )
------------------------------------------------------------
• An immediate rise of 5 % : first annual rate = 1.05 S₀.  
• Every half‑year the rate is again multiplied by 1.05.

Hence in the j‑th half‑year (j = 0,1,…,34) the annual rate is  

rA(j) = S₀·1.05^{\,j+1}

Payment for that half‑year = ½·rA(j).

Total paid under A :

T_A = ½ S₀ ∑_{j=0}^{34} 1.05^{\,j+1}
    = ½ S₀·1.05· (1.05^{35} – 1)/(1.05 – 1)

Offer B  ( “10 % every year” )
------------------------------------------------------------
• Immediate rise of 10 % : first annual rate = 1.10 S₀.  
• At every whole year the rate is multiplied by 1.10.

For the k‑th full year (k = 0,1,…,16) the rate is  

rB(k) = S₀·1.10^{\,k+1}

The last half‑year (year 17 to 17.5) is paid at

rB(17) = S₀·1.10^{\,18}.

Total paid under B :

T_B = S₀∑_{k=0}^{16}1.10^{\,k+1} + ½ S₀·1.10^{\,18}
    = S₀·1.10·(1.10^{17} – 1)/(1.10 – 1) + ½ S₀·1.10^{18}
    = 11 S₀·(1.10^{17} – 1) + 0.5 S₀·1.10^{18}                 (2)
    = (115.5 S₀)·1.10^{17} – 11 S₀.                            (2’)

Numerical evaluation
------------------------------------------------------------
1.05^{35}  = 5.516 015 368   (to 12 d.p.)  
1.10^{17}  = 5.054 470 284   (to 12 d.p.)

Insert in (1) and (2’):

T_A /S₀ = 10.5 · (5.516 015 368 – 1)
        = 47.418 161 360

T_B /S₀ = 115.5 · 5.054 470 284 – 11
        = 47.379 131 780

Difference (per S₀) :

(T_A – T_B)/S₀ = 0.039 029 580.

Because S₀ = 10 000 wonks,

T_A – T_B ≈ 0.039 029 580 × 10 000 ≈ 390.3 wonks.

Conclusion
------------------------------------------------------------
Over the whole 17.5‑year contract the first offer (5 % every six months) pays
about 390 wonks more than the second offer (10 % every year).

Age‑difference facts (true in every calendar year)
• Rudy is always 2 years older than Lavi.  
• Fred is always 2 years older than Rudy (hence 4 years older than Lavi).

Choose any calendar year and write the ages in that year as integers.

Part (a)  (Lavi and Rudy)

Let L = Lavi’s age in that year.  
Since Rudy is 2 years older, Rudy’s age is L + 2.

The number Rudy is looking at is  
N₁ = 1 + (Lavi’s age)·(Rudy’s age)  
    = 1 + L(L + 2)  
    = 1 + (L² + 2L)  
    = L² + 2L + 1  
    = (L + 1)².

Because L ≥ 1 (the statement says “ever since she was a year old”), we have L + 1 ≥ 2.  
Hence N₁ is always the square of an integer ≥ 2.

Part (b)  (Rudy and Fred)

Let R = Rudy’s age in that (possibly different) year.  
Fred is 2 years older, so Fred’s age is R + 2.

The number Rudy is looking at is  
N₂ = 1 + (Rudy’s age)·(Fred’s age)  
    = 1 + R(R + 2)  
    = 1 + (R² + 2R)  
    = R² + 2R + 1  
    = (R + 1)².

Because R ≥ 1 (“ever since I was a year old”), we have R + 1 ≥ 2, so N₂ is also always the square of an integer ≥ 2.

Two things that are therefore certain about both N₁ and N₂

1. Each of them is a perfect square (namely (L + 1)² or (R + 1)²).
2. Being the square of an integer at least 2, each of them is composite (hence certainly not prime, and each has an odd number of positive divisors).

Thus the two thoughts that must have flashed across Rudy’s mind were:

• “This number is a perfect square.”  
• “Consequently, it cannot be prime; it is definitely composite.”",True

247,"The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?",,"The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74

Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =

 23 – 17 = 6, 23 – 19 = 4 (both too small)  
 29 – 17 = 12, 29 – 19 = 10.  
 So d₃ would have to be 29.

 Now look at station 4: d₄ ∈ {31,37}.  
 But 31 – 29 = 2  and 37 – 29 = 8, both violating (★).  
 Therefore d₂ cannot be 17 or 19.  These branches die.

B) Hence the only remaining possibility is

 d₁ = 3 and d₂ = 13.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
With d₂ fixed at 13, (★) forces d₃ ≥ 23.  
The choices for d₃ are 23 or 29, and 23 is acceptable (23–13 = 10).  
If we took d₃ = 29, we just saw it would fail at Station 4, so

 d₃ = 23.

For Station 4, d₄ ∈ {31,37} and must satisfy d₄ – 23 ≥ 10.  
Only 37 works, so

 d₄ = 37.

For Station 5, d₅ ∈ {41,43,47} and must satisfy d₅ – 37 ≥ 10.  
Only 47 works, so

 d₅ = 47.

Finally, Station 6: d₆ ∈ {53,59} and must satisfy d₆ – 47 ≥ 10.  
Only 59 works, therefore

 d₆ = 59.

Thus the unique sextuple meeting all conditions is
  (d₁, d₂, d₃, d₄, d₅, d₆) = (3, 13, 23, 37, 47, 59).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Verifying the remaining conditions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Sum of the dᵢ’s:  
3 + 13 + 23 + 37 + 47 + 59 = 182, an even number (condition 3).

Differences between successive 2dᵢ’s:  
20, 20, 28, 20, 24 – all at least 20 (condition 2).  
All other stated conditions are satisfied.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Computing the original number of passengers
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Using equation (1):

P₀ = P₆ – (d₁ + d₂ + d₃ + d₄ + d₅ + d₆)  
  = 227 – 182  
  = 45.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Therefore 45 passengers (Tweeto included) were on the train just before it reached Maver.

248,"Some time after 2 O' Clock, the angle made between the minute hand and the vertical (12) on a clock is double the angle made between the hour hand and the vertical (12). What time is it?",What is the rate of travel of each hand on a clock?,"2:24 The hour hand makes an angle of 72 degrees while the minute hand makes an angle of 144 degrees.
At exactly 2:00, the angle made by the hour hand is 60 degrees from vertical.  If you let x = the number of minutes past 2:00 that we are looking for, then the hour hand will be at:
60 degrees + x / 60 min* 30 degrees
where x/60 min is the fraction of a full hour that has past, and is therefore the fractional distance that the hour hand has moved closer to the 3.  The 30 degrees is the total angle between the 2 and the 3.
The final position of the minute hand will be:
x/30 min * 180 degrees
for the same reasoning as with the hour hand.
Since the minute hand will make twice the angle with vertical, you can set up the equation:
2*(60 + x / 60 * 30) = x / 30 * 180
Solving for x will give you 24 minutes.  The time will be 2:24.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let t be the number of minutes after 2 : 00.

Position of the minute hand  
Every minute it sweeps 6°, so its angle from the 12‑o’clock vertical is  
θₘ = 6t degrees.

Position of the hour hand  
At 2 : 00 the hour hand is 2 × 30° = 60° from 12.  
It advances 0.5° each minute, so after t minutes its angle from 12 is  
θₕ = 60° + 0.5t degrees.

Condition given  
The angle made by the minute hand with the vertical is double that made by the hour hand, i.e.  
θₘ = 2θₕ.

Substituting the formulas:

6t = 2(60 + 0.5t)  
6t = 120 + t  
5t = 120  
t = 24.

Thus the required time is 24 minutes after 2 o’clock.

249,"The square of one whole number minus the square of another whole number equals 73.
What are the two numbers? This can be done by trial and error but a little mathematical knowledge and maybe some algebra will get the answer fast.","73 is similar 41,29,19 etc.","The two numbers are 37 & 36. Therefore (37x37)1369 minus (36x36)1296 = 73.    The number 73 is a ""prime"" number i.e. the only two multiples for it are ""73"" & ""1"". By algebra, x2-y2 = 73 which is  (x+y)(x-y)=73. One of those two numbers must be ""1"". It can't be x+y (that would be more than ""1"") so it must be x-y=1. By simple substitution the answer is revealed.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Recall the algebraic identity  
a² – b² = (a – b)(a + b).

Let the two whole numbers be a and b (with a > b so that a² – b² is positive).  
We are told that a² – b² = 73, so

(a – b)(a + b) = 73.                               (1)

Because 73 is prime, its only positive factor pair is 1 × 73.  
Hence, in (1) we must have

a – b = 1   and   a + b = 73.                     (2)

Solve (2):

Add the two equations:  
( a – b ) + ( a + b ) = 1 + 73  
2a = 74  
a = 74 / 2 = 37.

Substitute a = 37 into a – b = 1:  
37 – b = 1 ⟹ b = 36.

Thus the two (positive) whole numbers are 37 and 36, and indeed

37² – 36² = (1369) – (1296) = 73.

Final answer: 37 and 36",True
