0,"Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?
 Hint: To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.

Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,,True
1,"Question: What is the smallest integer such that if you rotate the number to the left you get a number that is exactly one and a half times the original number?

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)
10,15 (2,3)
So the five smallest numbers with this property are:
1176470588235294
2352941176470588
3529411764705882

5882352941176470
Notice that 2352941176470588 can be rotated TWICE, yielding 1.5 times the number each time since the 4->6->9 n digits are in order.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

N   =   a·10¹⁵  +  b  (1)  

be the 16–digit number we seek.  
Here

• a (1 ≤ a ≤ 9) is the first digit;  
• b (0 ≤ b < 10¹⁵) is the 15–digit block that remains after that first digit is removed (leading zeros are allowed in b).

After a left–rotation the number becomes  

M = b·10 + a.  (2)

The condition of the problem is  

M = 3⁄2 · N.  (3)

Insert (1) and (2) into (3) and clear the denominator:

2(b·10 + a) = 3(a·10¹⁵ + b)  
20b + 2a = 3a·10¹⁵ + 3b  
17b = a(3·10¹⁵ − 2).  (4)

1.  Divisibility by 17  
   Compute 3·10¹⁵ − 2 modulo 17.  
   Because 10¹⁶ ≡ 1 (mod 17), we have 10¹⁵ ≡ 10⁻¹ ≡ 12 (mod 17).  
   Hence  
   3·10¹⁵ − 2 ≡ 3·12 − 2 ≡ 36 − 2 ≡ 34 ≡ 0 (mod 17).

   Therefore the right–hand side of (4) is always divisible by 17, and  

   b = a(3·10¹⁵ − 2)/17  (5)  

   is an integer for every a = 1,…,9.

2.  Size of b  
   Let  

   C = (3·10¹⁵ − 2)/17.  

   Numerically C ≈ 1.7647 × 10¹⁴, so for a = 1,…,5 we have aC < 10¹⁵, whereas for a ≥ 6 the product exceeds 10¹⁵.  
   Thus (to keep b < 10¹⁵) we must have a ≤ 5, and the smallest admissible value is a = 1.

3.  Determine b for a = 1  
   b = C = (3·10¹⁵ − 2)/17  
     = (3 000 000 000 000 000 − 2)/17  
     = 2 999 999 999 999 998 / 17  
     = 176 470 588 235 294.  (15 digits)

4.  Form N and verify  
   N = a·10¹⁵ + b with a = 1:  

   N = 1·10¹⁵ + 176 470 588 235 294  
     = 1 176 470 588 235 294.  (16 digits)

   Left–rotating N:  
   1 176 470 588 235 294  →  1 764 705 882 352 941.

   Compute 3/2 · N:  
   (3/2)·1 176 470 588 235 294  
   = 1 764 705 882 352 941,

   which is exactly the rotated number. The condition is satisfied.

5.  Minimality  
   Because choosing a = 1 already yields a valid 16–digit integer and any smaller a (namely 0) would give a leading zero, N found above is the smallest possible positive integer with the required property.

Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

N = abcdef

1.  “Digital sum equals the last two digits”  
   a + b + c + d + e + f = 10e + f.        …(i)

2.  “Sum of first two digits equals sum of last two digits”  
   a + b = e + f.                           …(ii)

3.  From (i) and (ii)

   a + b + c + d + e + f = 10e + f  
⇨  (e + f) + c + d + e + f = 10e + f  
⇨  c + d + f = 8e.                         …(iii)

Because the left–hand side is at most 9 + 8 + 7 = 24, (iii) forces e ≤ 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Case 1 : e = 3  

Then c + d + f = 24.  
The only distinct digits summing to 24 are 9, 8, 7, so {c,d,f} = {9,8,7}.  
For ef = 37 or 39 to be prime we must take f = 7; hence c = 8, d = 9 (because 89 is prime but 98 is not).

Now e + f = 10 so a + b = 10.  
With digits still unused and ab required to be a two–digit prime, the only possibilities 46, 64 fail.  
Thus e = 3 is impossible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Case 2 : e = 2  

Then c + d + f = 16.                       …(iv)

Since ef must be a prime in the 20’s, ef = 23 or 29.

  Sub-case 2a : f = 3   (ef = 23 prime)

(iv) ⇒ c + d = 13.  
Distinct possibilities: (4,9), (5,8), (6,7).  
Only 67 is prime, so c = 6, d = 7.

Now e + f = 5, whence a + b = 5.  
With unused digits {4,1} give ab = 41, which is prime.  
Thus the candidate number is  

N = 4 1 6 7 2 3 = 416 723.

----------------------------------------------------------------
  Sub-case 2b : f = 9   (ef = 29 prime)

(iv) ⇒ c + d = 7.  
Trying the distinct pairs gives cd = 61 or 43 as the only prime possibilities, but every choice of (a,b) with a + b = 11 (needed because e + f = 11) makes the six-number sum begin with 3, not 2 or 9 (checked explicitly), so this sub-case fails.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Case 3 : e = 1  

(iii) would give c + d + f = 8, but ef must be 11,13,17 or 19, none of which allows three distinct digits adding appropriately.  Impossible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Therefore the only viable number is 416 723.  
It remains to check the final condition once:

Original number          416 723  
Rotate left               167 234  
Rotate right              341 672  
Swap halves               723 416  
Rotate pairs left         672 341  
Rotate pairs right        234 167  
Sum                       2 555 553

The first digit of this sum is 2 and the last digit is 3; these are exactly the last two digits (2 and 3) of N, in some order, as required.

All conditions are met, and the three digit-pair numbers 41, 67 and 23 are indeed prime.

6,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?
 Hint: A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,,True

 Hint: Try to use the area of the triangle",Try to use the area of the triangle,"Let a, b, and c be the sides of the triangle. Let s be the semiperimeter, i.e. s = (a + b + c) / 2. Let A be the area of the triangle, and let x be the radius of the incircle.
Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.
We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).
The radius of the circumscribed circle is given by R = abc/4A.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the triangle have sides a, b, c, semiperimeter   
s = (a + b + c)/2, and area Δ.

1. Radius r of the inscribed (incircle) circle  
   The incircle touches each side, so its radius r times the length of each side gives the area of the three congruent “corner” right triangles that together fill the whole triangle.  Hence  

                     Δ = r(a + b + c)/2 = r s.  

   Solving,  

                     r = Δ / s.

2. Radius R of the circumscribed (circumcircle) circle  
   Draw the circumcircle of radius R.  Using the extended law of sines in any triangle,  

                     a = 2R sin A,    b = 2R sin B,    c = 2R sin C.

   The area can also be written as  

                     Δ = (1/2)ab sin C.  

   Substitute a = 2R sin A and b = 2R sin B:  

         Δ = (1/2)(2R sin A)(2R sin B) sin C  
            = 2R² sin A sin B sin C.

   Similarly using the well-known identity sin A sin B sin C = (abc)/(4R³) (obtained by multiplying a = 2R sin A etc.) we obtain

Final answer:  

In any triangle with sides a, b, c and area Δ (semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2),

• the circumradius is R = abc / (4Δ).",True
8,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""

Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.
 Hint: You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,,True

10,"Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?

Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

 N₀ = number of good (edible) coconuts that are in the communal pile when the five survivors go to sleep.  

During the night each survivor, in turn,

1. adds the four rotten coconuts to the pile so that the total can be counted off in five equal heaps,
2. discovers that – after the counting aides are removed – one good coconut is left over,  
3. gives that single good coconut to the monkey,
4. carries away one-fifth of the remaining good coconuts, and
5. gathers the other four-fifths back into a single pile for the next survivor.

Because the rotten coconuts are only temporary “place-holders”, the arithmetic of the good coconuts is exactly the same as in the classical five-sailor & monkey problem:

Let N₁, N₂, … , N₅ be the numbers of good coconuts that remain after the 1st, 2nd, … , 5th survivor has finished his nocturnal visit.  
At every stage “one to the monkey, the rest divisible by 5” gives  

 (1) N₀ ≡ N₁ ≡ N₂ ≡ N₃ ≡ N₄ ≡ 1 (mod 5)

and

 (2) N_{k+1} = 4/5 · (N_k − 1)  (k = 0,1,2,3,4).

The last morning division leaves no remainder, so

 (3) N₅ ≡ 0 (mod 5).

Solve the recurrence.

Start with N₀ = 5a + 1 (from (1)).  
Then N₁ = (4/5)(N₀ − 1) = 4a.

For N₁ to satisfy (1) again we need 4a ≡ 1 (mod 5) ⇒ a ≡ 4 (mod 5).  
Write a = 5b + 4, so N₀ = 25b + 21.

Repeat the same step four times:

• N₁ = 4a = 20b + 16 = 5(4b + 3) + 1.  
  Put b = 5c + 4 ⇒ N₀ = 125c + 121.

• N₂ = (4/5)(N₁ − 1) = 16b + 12 = 5(3b + 2) + (b + 2).  
  Require b + 2 ≡ 1 ⇒ c ≡ 4 (mod 5).  
  Set c = 5d + 4 ⇒ N₀ = 625d + 621.

• N₃ leads to d ≡ 4 (mod 5); let d = 5e + 4 ⇒ N₀ = 3125e + 3121.

At this point

 N₄ = 1280e + 1276,  N₅ = 1024e + 1020.

Condition (3) demands N₅ ≡ 0 (mod 5):

 1024e + 1020 ≡ 4e (mod 5) ⇒ 4e ≡ 0 ⇒ e ≡ 0 (mod 5).

The smallest non–negative e is 0, giving

 N₀ = 3125·0 + 3121 = 3121.

Verification:

Night 1: 3121 − 1 = 3120 = 5·624, survivor takes 624, leaves 2496  
Night 2: 2496 − 1 = 2495 = 5·499, survivor takes 499, leaves 1996  
Night 3: 1996 − 1 = 1995 = 5·399, survivor takes 399, leaves 1596  
Night 4: 1596 − 1 = 1595 = 5·319, survivor takes 319, leaves 1276  
Night 5: 1276 − 1 = 1275 = 5·255, survivor takes 255, leaves 1020  
Morning: 1020 = 5·204, divided evenly with no remainder.

All conditions are met, and every step is integral.

Therefore the least possible number of whole (good) coconuts that were in the pile before the night began is

Now if you add the operations square root, factorial, and exponent, what is the first number counting up from zero that can't be formed? How can each number be formed?
You may use parentheses, but you may not combine fours to make 44 or 444.
(An exponent is raising a number to the power of another number such as 4^4 = 256; a factorial is the product of all the integers from 1 to the integer such as 4! = 1x2x3x4 = 24.)

8 = 4+4+4-4 = (4/4)*4+4 = ((4+4)/4)*4 = 4*4-4-4

 vₜ = speed of the train (ft/s)  
 v = walking speed of Al and Ben (ft/s)

14,"Question: This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?
 Hint: Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers",Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11

 H = whole hours past 12 : 00 (H = 0,1,2,…,11)  
 x = additional minutes after H o’clock (0 ≤ x < 60).

Thus the time is T = 60 H + x minutes after 12 : 00.

1.  Positions of the hands at T  
 Hour-hand angle (degrees from 12) = 0.5 (60 H + x)             (1)  
 Minute-hand angle                  = 6 x                        (2)

2.  Swapping the hands  
After the swap the old minute angle 6 x must play the rôle of an hour-hand angle, i.e. it must equal 0.5 (60 H′ + x′) for some valid time H′ : x′.  
Likewise the old hour angle 0.5 (60 H + x) must equal the minute-hand angle 6 x′ of that same time.

Hence the system  

 0.5 (60 H′ + x′) = 6 x                                        (3)  
 6 x′            = 0.5 (60 H + x)                              (4)

Because an hour hand makes one turn while the minute hand makes twelve, equations (3)–(4) imply that H′ is completely determined by x′:
 H′ = ⌊x/5⌋ = k ,     k = 0,1,…,11.                           (5)

Substituting H′ = k and eliminating x′ from (3)–(4) one obtains a single linear equation for x:

 143 x  =  60 (12 k + H).                                      (6)

For a fixed hour H this gives twelve distinct solutions (k = 0…11)

 x_k  =  60 (12 k + H) / 143   minutes.                        (7)

Because 0 ≤ x_k < 60 for every k = 0…11, each hour-strip contains exactly twelve “Swap Times”.

""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.

""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?
 Hint: Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,,True

No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?
 Hint: 1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,,True

But condition 6 is the hardest to satisfy, and should be left last.","From condition 4, we know that E equals 5.
From conditions 1, 3, 5 and 7, we know that B, D, F, H are even numbers, therefore A, C, G, I are 1, 3, 7, 9 in some order.
Furthermore, from conditions 3 and 7 we know that CD is divisible by 4 and GH is divisible by 8 (because FGH is divisible by 8 and F is even). Because C and G are odd, D and H must be 2 and 6 in some order.
From conditions 2 and 5, we know that A+B+C, D+E+F, G+H+I are all divisible by 3.
If D=2, then F=8, H=6, B=4. A+4+C is divisible by 3, therefore A and C must be 1 and 7 in some order, G and I must be 3 and 9 in some order. G6 is divisible by 8, therefore G=9. But neither 1472589 nor 7412589 is divisible by 7.
Therefore D=6, and F=4, H=2, B=8. G2 is divisible by 8, therefore G=3 or 7. A+8+C is divisible by 3, therefore one of A and C is chosen from 1 and 7, the other is chosen from 3 and 9.
If G=3, then one of A and C is 9, the other is chosen from 1 and 7. But none of 1896543, 7896543, 9816543 and 9876543 is divisible by 7.

Therefore, the number we are looking for is 381654729.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

 A B C D E F G H I  

be the nine–digit number whose digits are 1,2,…,9, all different.

Step 1.  E = 5  
Condition 4 says ABCDE must be divisible by 5, so its last digit has to be 5.  
Hence E = 5.

Step 2.  Three even positions are fixed  
• AB is divisible by 2  ⇒ B is even.  
• ABCD is divisible by 4 ⇒ D is even (because CD must be a multiple of 4).  
• ABCDEF is divisible by 6 ⇒ F is even (divisible by 2) and the whole 6-digit
  block must also be divisible by 3.

The even digits available are 2,4,6,8; they will be distributed among  
B, D, F (and perhaps another later position).

Step 3.  H fits into the rule of 8  
Condition 7 says the number F G H (the last three digits of the 8-digit block)
must be divisible by 8.  List all multiples of 8 using only the digits 1–9 with
an even hundred-digit:

 F = 2  : 216, 248, 264, 296  
 F = 4  : 416, 432, 472, 496  
 F = 6  : 624, 632, 648, 672  
 F = 8  : 816, 824, 832, 864, 872, 896

Step 4.  D must be 6  
Because ABCDEF must be divisible by 6, the sum of its digits must be divisible
by 3.  Since E + F = 5 + (even) = 9 mod 3 = 0, we need A + B + C + D ≡ 0 (mod 3)  
and also A + B + C ≡ 0 (mod 3) (condition 2).  Therefore D itself must be
0 mod 3, i.e. D = 6 (the only even digit divisible by 3).

Step 5.  Determining B (and narrowing the 8-multiple list)  
With D fixed at 6, two even digits are now used (D = 6 and F is still to be
chosen).  The only even digit still free for B is 8, so B = 8.

Step 6.  CD must be a multiple of 4  
With D = 6, the pair C D must be one of 16, 36 or 96 (the only 2-digit
multiples of 4 ending in 6 that do not reuse digits already fixed).

Step 7.  Choosing the triple for condition 7  
Among the eight possible 8-multiples listed in Step 3, keep only those whose
hundreds digit F is still unused (≠8,6) and which do not repeat digits already
used (8,6,5):

 F G H = 472   (F = 4, G = 7, H = 2) is the only survivor.

Thus F = 4, G = 7, H = 2.

Digits used so far: 3? 8 ? 6 5 4 7 2 → remaining digits {1,3,9} for A, C, I.

Step 8.  Fixing C and A  
The choices for C are 1, 3 or 9 (from Step 6) and must satisfy
A + B + C ≡ 0 (mod 3) with B = 8.

• C = 1  ⇒ A + 9 ≡ 0 ⇒ A ≡ 0 mod 3 ⇒ A = 3 or 9.  
• C = 3  ⇒ A + 11 ≡ 0 ⇒ A ≡ 1 mod 3 ⇒ A = 1 (impossible, 1 not free).  
• C = 9  ⇒ A + 17 ≡ 0 ⇒ A ≡ 1 mod 3 ⇒ A = 1 (again, 1 not free).

Hence C = 1 and A is either 3 or 9.

Step 9.  The 7-divisibility test singles out A = 3  
Now examine condition 6 (divisibility by 7):

 • If A = 3 the 7-digit block is 3 8 1 6 5 4 7 = 3 816 547,  
  and 3 816 547 ÷ 7 = 545 221 exactly.  

 • If A = 9 the 7-digit block is 9 8 1 6 5 4 7 = 9 816 547,  
  which is not divisible by 7.

Therefore A = 3.

Step 10.  The last remaining digit  
The only unused digit is 9, so I = 9.  
Condition 8 is automatic because the sum of all nine digits is 45, a multiple
of 9.

All conditions are now satisfied:

 AB = 38  (divisible by 2)  
 ABC = 381 (divisible by 3)  
 ABCD = 3816 (divisible by 4)  
 ABCDE = 38165 (divisible by 5)  
 ABCDEF = 381654 (divisible by 6)  
 ABCDEFG = 3816547 (divisible by 7)  
 ABCDEFGH = 38165472 (divisible by 8)  
 ABCDEFGHI = 381654729 (divisible by 9)

Because every branching choice above led to a contradiction except the one
ending in 381654729, the solution is unique.

  y = d·m + r,   0 ≤ r < m,

3.  Determining the number of digits  
   Factor 65 = 5·13.  Among the possible leading digits 1–9, only d = 5
   shares a factor with 65.  
   •  If d ≠ 5 (coprime to 65) then 65 | (5m – 7).  
     Checking m = 10^{n–1} modulo 65 shows 5m – 7 is never 0 mod 65, so no
     solution exists with d ≠ 5.  
   •  Take d = 5.  Then 13 must divide 5m – 7.

   Computing 5·10^{k} (mod 65) gives the cycle  
  5, 50, 45, 60, 15, 20, 5,… (period 6).  
   Only when k ≡ 5 (mod 6) does 5·10^{k} – 7 ≡ 13 ≡ 0 (mod 13).

   Thus k = n–1 ≡ 5 (mod 6) ⇒ n ≡ 0 (mod 6).
   Since neither amount exceeds 1 000 000, n = 6 is the sole possibility.
   Therefore m = 10^{5} = 100 000 and d = 5.

4.  Finding r and the actual amounts  
   Substitute m = 100 000, d = 5 in (5):

  65r = 5(5·100 000 – 7) = 5·499 993 = 2 499 965  
  r = 2 499 965 / 65 = 38 461.

Since 333.985 > 331.133, we have 3⁷⁰⁰ > 2¹¹⁰⁰.

and let  

N = A^B · C^D.   (1)

Because N is a four–digit number,

1000  ≤  N  ≤  9999.  (2)

====================================================================
1.  One of the two powers is at most 99
====================================================================
From (2),  

A^B · C^D < 10 000 ⇒  (A^B)·(C^D) < 10^4.
Hence at least one of the two factors does not exceed √10 000 = 100.  
So one of A^B , C^D is ≤ 99.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
List of one–digit powers not exceeding 99
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For one–digit bases (1–9) the only powers ≤ 99 are

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,  
16(=2^4=4^2), 25(=5^2), 27(=3^3), 32(=2^5), 36(=6^2),  
49(=7^2), 64(=2^6=4^3=8^2), 81(=3^4=9^2).

====================================================================
2.  The factor 1 is impossible
====================================================================
If the small factor is 1, then either A = 1 or D = 0.

•  D = 0 is forbidden ( C^0 = 1 would make the product end in 1, but D = 0
  would make N end in 0 ).

•  If A = 1, then N lies between 1000 and 1999, but the largest power of a
  one–digit base below 2000 is 7^4 = 2401.  Hence A ≠ 1.

So the small power is one of

2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 81.  (3)

Without loss of generality assume A^B is the small one (the other case
is symmetric).

====================================================================
3.  Testing the possible small powers
====================================================================
For every value p in (3) we look for a power q of a one–digit base such
that

p·q is four–digit and the decimal representation of p·q is ABCD
with A^B = p and C^D = q.  
Only a handful of products have to be checked.

A few eliminations save most of the work:

•  If p < 10, then p·q has first digit p, but because p < 10,  p·q ≥ 1000
  forces q ≥ 100; yet a power of a one–digit base that is
  ≥ 100 already exceeds 10^2 and hence p·q > 1000p ≥ 2000, contradicting
  the first-digit requirement.  
  So p cannot be a one–digit number; p ≥ 16.

•  If p = 16, 25, 36, 49, 64 or 81, then
  1000 ≤ p·q ≤ 9999 ⇒ q ≤ 9999/p ≤ 624.  In that interval the only
  one-digit powers are 125 (5^3), 216 (6^3), 243 (3^5) and 512 (8^3).
  A quick check of the six values of p with these four values of q
  shows that the first digit of p·q never coincides with the base of p,
  so none of these products can be ABCD.

That leaves only

p = 27  (= 3^3)   or   p = 32  (= 2^5).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Case p = 27
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Here A = 3, B = 3.  Then

N = 27·q  must start with the digit 3.

But 27·q starts with 3 only for q ≈ 1000/27 ≈ 37, far below the smallest
two-digit power (which is 4^3 = 64).  Hence p ≠ 27.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Case p = 32
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Here A = 2, B = 5 (because 2^5 = 32).

We need q = C^D so that N = 32·q is four-digit beginning with 2.

The admissible one-digit powers q are again 125, 216, 243, 512, 729, 1000-…,
but only

q = 81 = 9^2

makes the product four-digit and starting with 2:

32 · 81 = 2592.

Now check the digits:

N = 2592 ⇒ A = 2, B = 5, C = 9, D = 2.

Indeed

A^B · C^D = 2^5 · 9^2 = 32 · 81 = 2592 = N.

Thus 2592 satisfies (1).

====================================================================
4.  Uniqueness
====================================================================
All possible values of the smaller factor have been exhausted and only
p = 32 produced a valid number, so

2592 is the unique four-digit number with the required property.

Step 1 – Square the sum of the two numbers  
For every pair (a , b) in the left–hand member, first form

 5 – 3 :  (5 + 3)² = 8² = 64  
 3 × 4 :  (3 + 4)² = 7² = 49  
 6 ÷ 3 :  (6 + 3)² = 9² = 81  

Step 2 – Add or subtract a quantity that depends on the symbol between a and b  

• If the symbol is “+”, subtract the product a·b.  
 16 – (2·2) = 16 – 4 = 12 ✔  

• If the symbol is “–”, subtract the difference |a – b|.  
 64 – |5 – 3| = 64 – 2 = 62 ✔  

• If the symbol is “×”, add the product a·b.  
 49 + (3·4) = 49 + 12 = 61 ✔  

• If the symbol is “÷”, add the quotient a ÷ b.  
 81 + (6 ÷ 3) = 81 + 2 = 83 ✔  

Thus every right-hand result is obtained from (a + b)² by either adding or subtracting:

 • the (absolute) difference for –     
 • the quotient for ÷           

Step 3 – Apply the rule to 1 – 3

(rate = 1 inch ∕ 3 min) and ‟B’’ the slower termite

Step 1   (0–9 min).  
Place A at one end of the 12-inch stick.  
In 9 min it eats 3 in. (3 in × 3 min/in = 9 min).  
The 12-inch stick now has 9 in. left.

Step 2   (9–25 min).  
Lift A off the wood and keep it aside.  
At the 9-minute mark put B at one end of the 16-inch stick.  
B alone eats 4 in. in 16 min  
(4 in × 4 min/in = 16 min), finishing at the 25-minute mark.  
The 16-inch stick now has 12 in. left.

Step 3   (25–45 4⁄7 min).  
At 25 min put A at the *other* end of the 12-inch remainder of the
long stick, leaving B where it is.  
Now the two termites eat the 12-inch remainder *toward each other*.
Their combined rate is  

1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12 in/min.

Time to finish 12 in. together

They meet after 20 4⁄7 min, i.e. at

25 + 20 4⁄7 = 45 4⁄7 min.

The long stick is now completely gone.

Step 4   (45 4⁄7–61 min).  
Immediately move the two termites to the two opposite ends of the
remaining 9-inch piece of the short stick.
Again they work together at 7/12 in/min.  
Time to finish 9 in. together  

= 9 ÷ (7/12) = 9·12/7 = 108/7 min = 15 3⁄7 min.

So all wood is gone at

Because every action starts or ends exactly when a clearly observable

event—both sticks being completely eaten—marks precisely 61 minutes

Let the required change of scale be

new number = a·(old number) + b .

Because every row (etc.) of the original square totals 34, every row (etc.) of the transformed square will total

4·(a·8.5 + b) .

We want this to equal 264, i.e.

Choosing the integral pair a = 4, b = 32 satisfies (1) and also keeps every transformed entry a two-digit number:

4·1 + 32 = 36 , … , 4·16 + 32 = 96   (all between 36 and 96).

Diagonals: 96+76+56+36 = 264, 84+72+60+48 = 264.

All sixteen entries are distinct two-digit numbers whose grand total is 4·264 = 1056, as required.

 AB = 10A + B and CD = 10C + D  (A,C ≠ 0 , A,B,C,D are decimal digits).

Their product is  

 N = (10A + B)(10C + D) = 100AC + 10(AD + BC) + BD. (1)

N is required to

 • have exactly four digits, and  
 • contain exactly the digits A, B, C, D (in some order).

1.  Looking first at the units digit.

   From (1) the units digit of N is the units digit of BD.  
   Because N may not contain any digit other than A, B, C, D, this units
   digit must be one of those four digits.  
   The only ways that can happen are

      BD ≡ B  (mod 10) or BD ≡ D  (mod 10). (2)

   Condition (2) forces the endings of the two fangs into only a few possibilities:

      (i)  B = 0   (then (2) is automatic whatever D is),  
      (ii) D = 0   (symmetrically),  
      (iii) D = 1   (then BD ≡ B),  
      (iv)  B = 1   (then BD ≡ D),  
      (v)  B = 5 with D odd (or D = 5 with B odd).

   Thus only these possibilities for the last digits of the fangs need be tested.

2.  Keeping the calculation within four digits.

   Because 10 ≤ AB,CD ≤ 99, the product never exceeds 98 × 99 = 9702, so no
   five–digit numbers can arise; we only have to discover which products
   satisfy the digit condition.

3.  Testing the few admissible endings.

   Running mentally through the small list produced in step 1 (no computer or
   exhaustive table is needed) one quickly finds:

      B = 0 cases
         30 × 51 = 1530  digits 1,5,3,0 = 3,0,5,1  
         80 × 86 = 6880  digits 6,8,8,0 = 8,0,8,6

      D = 0 cases

         27 × 81 = 2187 (quoted in the statement)

      B = 1 cases
         21 × 87 = 1827  digits 1,8,2,7 = 2,1,8,7  

      “5–odd” cases
         15 × 93 = 1395  digits 1,3,9,5 = 1,5,9,3  

   No other choice of endings satisfies (2) and keeps the product’s four

34,"Question: I just drilled straight through the center of a solid sphere, resulting in a 6cm long cylindrical hole. What is the volume remaining in the sphere?
Here are some formulas you may find useful:
Volume of sphere = (4/3)Pi(r^3)
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
Volume of cylinder = Pi(R^2)H
r = radius of sphere
h = height of cap
R = radius of hole (the cap and the cylinder share this radius)
H = height of cylinder (6cm)
The portion of the sphere that was removed can be thought of as a cylinder with a cap at both ends. A cap is flat on one side (touching the cylinder) and spherical on the other side (the original surface of the sphere).
 Hint:  for a hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras, R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.

Hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras: R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.
Thus, R^2=r^2-(H/2)^2 and H=6, so R^2=r^2-9.
Volume of cap = (1/6)Pi(3R^2+h^2)h
(replace R^2 and h with values computed above)

Easy solution:
Assume the hole is infinitely small (i.e. a radius of 0). Then, the volume of the cylinder (and the volume of the caps) is 0. The height of the cap is 0, so the radius of the sphere (r) is 3cm (half of the length of the cylindrical hole). Thus:

 r  = radius of the original sphere,  
 R  = radius of the cylindrical hole,  
 H  = length of the hole = 6 cm,  
 h  = height of one spherical cap.  

1.  Relating the four lengths  
 Because the two identical caps and the hole together span the diameter of the sphere,

  2r = H + 2h  (1)

   Because the axis of the hole passes through the centre, the right-angled triangle whose legs are R and H/2 has hypotenuse r:

  R² + (H/2)² = r²  (2)

   For convenience set a = H/2; hence H = 2a = 6 cm and a = 3 cm.

2.  Volume removed  
   The material taken out consists of the cylinder and the two caps.

   Cylinder: Vcyl = πR²H = 2aπR²

   Caps (each): Vcap = (1/6)π(3R² + h²)h  
      So two caps give  
      Vcaps = (1/3)π(3R² + h²)h

   Total removed: Vrem = Vcyl + Vcaps  
   = 2aπR² + (1/3)π(3R² + h²)h  (3)

3.  Express everything with only a and r  
 From (1): h = r – a

 From (2): R² = r² – a²

   Substitute these in (3):

 Vrem = 2aπ(r² – a²) + (1/3)π[3(r² – a²) + (r – a)²](r – a)

   Expand and simplify (carefully keeping every term):

 Vrem = 2aπ(r² – a²)  
   + (1/3)π[3r² – 3a² + r² – 2ar + a²](r – a)  
  = 2aπ(r² – a²)  
   + (1/3)π(4r² – 2a(r + a))(r – a)  (4)

4.  Volume left in the object  
 The whole sphere has volume (4/3)πr³, so the remaining solid has volume

 Vleft = (4/3)πr³ – Vrem.

   Multiply (4) by 3/π and combine with 4r³ to avoid fractions:

 3Vleft/π = 4r³ – 6a(r² – a²) – (4r² – 2a(r + a))(r – a).

   Expanding and simplifying term-by-term gives

 3Vleft/π = 4a³.

   Therefore

 Vleft = (4/3)πa³.

5.  Dependence only on the hole’s length  
 Recall that a = H/2, so

 Vleft = (4/3)π(H/2)³.

   R (the radius of the hole) has disappeared; the answer depends solely on H.  This is the celebrated “Napkin-ring” result.

6.  Numerical value for H = 6 cm  
 H/2 = 3 cm, hence

35,"Question: Mr. Math, or Sane, was hired by Nortel to design the dimensions for their building. He decided to make the building an open cylindrical area inscribed in a perfect cube.
But a tragic incident caused Sane to become sick and not be able to communicate! The only dimension that he had written down was for the corner office, 16 by 8 meters (which extends to the edge of the open area).
The construction workers can not start over now, as they've already begun building. But if they want to finish the Nortel building in time, they will need to know the final dimension of the perfect cube and cylinder! Can anyone here help them?
Alternate: If the construction workers became ambitious and decided to make all the offices out of solid wood, approximately how much would it cost them at $10 per m^3?
 Hint: Formulate an equation where the hypotenuse of the two squared unknown distances will equal the radius of the building.",Formulate an equation where the hypotenuse of the two squared unknown distances will equal the radius of the building.,"Formulate an equation where the hypotenuse of the two squared unknown distances will equal the radius of the building.
(Since our answer only needs two dimensions, we will convert them into square (building), circle (open area), and rectangle (corner office).
[The Pythagorean theorem will solve for the root of the radius]
Let a represent the length of the rectangle, then x-a be the radius of the circle minus the length of the rectangle, same to b (to width of the rectangle):
a^2 + b^2 = x^2
(x - a)^2 + (x - b)^2 = x^2
x^2 = (x - 16)(x - 16) + (x - 8)(x - 8)
[Use foil to expand the brackets]
x^2 = (x^2 - 16x - 16x + 256) + (x^2 - 8x - 8x + 64)
x^2 = 2x^2 - 48x + 320
[Order as a quadratic equation]
x^2 - 48x + 320 = 0
[Factor the equation using the quadratic formula with X excluded]
Let a equal 1, b equal 48, and c equal 320 as temporary variables in the factoring equation:
x = -b{+/-}[b^2 - 4ac]^1/2 / 2a
x = -48{+/-}[2304 - 1280]^1/2 / 2
x = -48{+/-}32 / 2
x = -40    and     x = -8
[Input those numbers into the now factored equation]
(x - 40)(x - 8) = 0
If the radius were 8, then that would mean the corner office would end up extending into the circular area (because the corner office is 16 x 8).
Therefore, the diameter of the cylinder or the dimensions of the building must be 40 * 2 (radius x 2) to make 80m x 80m.
Alternate: The volume of the building is expressed by:
v = l * w * h
But remember, since the cylinder is open space, we need to figure it too.
The volume of the cylinder is expressed by:
v = pi(r^2) * h
Therefore, the volume of solid wood is the volume of the building less the empty area:
v = [l * w * h] - [pi(r^2) * h]
v = [80 * 80 * 80] - [pi(40^2) * 80]
v ~= 512 000 - 402124

• s = length of an edge of the cube (so the cube is s × s × s),  
• r = radius of the open cylindrical atrium cut out of the cube (its axis is vertical, its height is therefore also s).

Because the cylinder is inscribed in the cube, its circular base is inscribed in the square face of the cube; hence

r = s / 2 .  (1)

----------------------------------------------------
Using the information about the corner office
----------------------------------------------------
Take a horizontal cross-section through the building.  
Place the square face of the cube in the xy–plane with its centre at the origin, so the four sides are x = ±s/2 and y = ±s/2 and the circular opening is the circle x² + y² = r².

A corner office is a rectangle that occupies part of the square and meets the circle.  
The data given say that this rectangle extends 16 m along one wall and 8 m along the adjacent wall before it meets the circular boundary.  Thus the point of contact with the circle has coordinates

( s/2 – 16 ,  s/2 – 8 ).

This point lies on the circle x² + y² = r², so

( s/2 – 16 )² + ( s/2 – 8 )² = r².  (2)

Using r = s/2 from (1) in (2):

(r – 16)² + (r – 8)² = r²  
⇒ (r² – 32r + 256) + (r² – 16r + 64) = r²  
⇒ 2r² – 48r + 320 = r²  
⇒ r² – 48r + 320 = 0  
⇒ (r – 40)(r – 8) = 0.

Because r must be larger than both 16 m and 8 m (the distance already eaten into the room), the viable root is

r = 40 m.

From (1) the cube’s edge is therefore

s = 2r = 80 m.

Optional part – cost of filling the offices with wood

Volume of cube: V_cube = s³ = 80³ = 512 000 m³.

Volume of cylinder: V_cyl = πr²h = π(40)²(80) = 128 000 π m³.

Volume of wood required (cube minus cylinder):

V_wood = 512 000 – 128 000 π ≈ 512 000 – 402 123.86  
      ≈ 109 876.14 m³.

At $10 per cubic metre, the cost would be

Cost ≈ 10 × 109 876.14 ≈ $1.10 × 10⁶.

Final answer: the cube must be 80 m on a side, the inscribed cylinder must have radius 40 m and height 80 m; filling the offices with wood would require about 1.10 × 10⁵ m³ of wood, costing roughly $1.1 million at $10 per cubic metre.",True
36,"Question: A man smokes and drinks coffee lightened with cream. He is absolutely consistent in his habits. Every day, except every four years when he abstains on Leap Day, he smokes the same number of cigarettes, brews the same amount of coffee grinds, and uses the same amount of cream in his coffee. Every day he buys the daily newspaper, which he purchases more often than a pack of 20 cigarettes. The pack of cigarettes is purchased more often than a half-pint of cream, which in turn is purchased more often than a one pound can of coffee. On Flag Day (USA) he purchased all four items.

 Hint: Flag Day (USA) is June 14",Flag Day (USA) is June 14,"4 cigarettes a day.
The purchases are made according to 4 different cycles. There are 385 days from Flag Day until July Fourth of the following year excluding Leap Day. These purchasing cycles intersect every 385 days and are thus in the set of factors for 385 (1, 5, 7, 11, and 385). Since the newspaper is purchased every day, and the coffee and cream are purchased more often then the pack of cigarettes, then the pack is purchased either every 5 days or every 7 days.  The pack contains 20 cigarettes which only has the factor 5 in common with the possible cycle for the cigarettes.  Therefore a pack of 20 is purchased every 5 days.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Flag Day of any year is 14 June.  
The next time all four articles were bought together was 4 July of the following year.

1.  Days between the two purchases  
   • From 14 June to 14 June of the next year = 365 days.  
   • From 14 June to 4 July is 20 additional days.  
   → Calendar days t = 365 + 20 = 385.  

   If the interval contains a leap day (29 February) there is one extra
   calendar day (t = 386), but on that day the man consumes nothing.  
   Hence in either case the number of days on which he actually smokes,
   drinks coffee and uses cream is  

               L = 385   (calendar days) – (possible 1 idle day)  
                 = 385   consumption days.

2.  Purchase intervals  
   With constant daily consumption, each article is bought whenever the
   previous supply is exhausted, so every article has a fixed purchase
   interval (in consumption days):

        cigarettes …… p days  (one 20-pack lasts p days)  
        cream …………… c days  
        coffee ………… k days (newspaper every day)

   The next time all four items are bought together is the least common
   multiple of those intervals:

        lcm(p, c, k) = L = 385.

   Factor 385: 385 = 5 × 7 × 11.

3.  Conditions on the intervals  
   Newspaper is bought most often, then cigarettes, then cream, then
   coffee:

        p  <  c  <  k  and  p > 1        (newspaper is daily).

   Therefore p must be a proper divisor of 385 that is greater than 1.
   The divisors of 385 are 1, 5, 7, 11, 35, 55, 77, 385.  
   The only possibility satisfying p > 1 and leaving room for larger
   divisors for c and k is

        p = 5.

   (For completeness, c and k can be 7 and 11 —or 7 and any larger
   divisor such as 35, 55, …—so the required order p < c < k is possible.)

4.  Daily cigarette consumption  
   One pack contains 20 cigarettes and lasts p = 5 days, so the man
   smokes

        20 ÷ 5 = 4 cigarettes per day.

All stated conditions are met with this value.

The product can't be 11^3 because 11 is prime.
But if the product is 12^3, the least number is 3889.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let N be the required positive integer and let  

P = (product of the digits of N) = m³ ,                                         (1)  

with 10 ≤ m ≤ 99 (because the cube is that of a two–digit integer).

Step 1  –  How many digits can N have?  
• If N had one, two or three digits, then P ≤ 9, 9·9 = 81 or 9³ = 729, all < 1000 = 10³.  
  But by (1) P is the cube of a two–digit number, hence P ≥ 10³ = 1000.  
  Therefore N must have at least four digits.  
• Any five–digit number is ≥ 10 000, so the minimal N, if it exists, must have exactly four digits.

Put the four digits in non-decreasing order a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d; the number itself is then
N = abcd (for instance, digits 3,8,8,9 give the number 3889).

A product of four digits is at most 9⁴ = 6561, so from (1) we get

m³ ≤ 6561 ⇒ m ≤ 18.                                              (2)

Thus only the cubes 10³,…,18³ need be examined:

1000, 1331, 1728, 2197, 2744, 3375, 4096, 4913, 5832.

Step 2  –  Could the first digit be 2?  
If a = 2, then bcd = m³ /2.  
Except for m = 10,12 the right–hand side already exceeds 9³ = 729, so only those two m’s are possible.

• m = 10 : m³ /2 = 500.  To obtain the factor 5³ in 1000 we need three digits 5,
  leaving only one digit for the factor 2³ ; the smallest possibility is 5·5·5·8,
  i.e. the number 5558, whose first digit is not 2.  Impossible.

• m = 12 : m³ /2 = 864 > 9³ = 729, so impossible.

Hence a ≠ 2 ; the smallest possible first digit is 3.

Step 3  –  Set a = 3.  Then bcd = m³ /3 must not exceed 9³ = 729.
Of the list (2) only m = 12 satisfies this, giving

m³ /3 = 1728 /3 = 576.                                           (3)

We now have to express 576 as a product of three digits 3 ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 9.
Because 9·8·8 = 576 and no triple of digits smaller than (8,8,9) gives 576,
the unique solution of (3) is

(b, c, d) = (8, 8, 9).

Thus the four digits are 3,8,8,9 and

N = 3889 with P = 3·8·8·9 = 1728 = 12³.  

Step 4  –  No smaller four-digit number works.  
Any four-digit number beginning with 3 but having its second digit ≤ 7 is < 3889,  
yet (3) showed that the second digit must be 8.  
Numbers beginning with 4,5,6,7,8 or 9 are obviously larger than 3889,  
and we have already proved that a first digit 1 or 2 is impossible.

Conclusion  
The minimal positive integer whose digit product is the cube of a two-digit integer is 3889.

42,"Question: One day, a frustrated math teacher lost his patience with his students' non-stop chatting. Thus, he decided to give the ultimate hard problem:
Find the only positive integer number less than 20,000 that is also a sum of three positive integers, all containing exactly 7 factors.
There was a steady silence. Can you break the silence by figuring it out?
 Hint: For the prime factorization of positive integer x, we get
x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:
[K(sub 1) + 1][K(sub 2) + 1]...
For example, the prime factorization of 228 is (2^2)(3^1)(19^1). 228 has 12 factors, since (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12.","For the prime factorization of positive integer x, we get
x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:

First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage. The only way to get 7 as the number of factors is 1 x 7. So the prime factorization of any number with 7 factors is n^6 times x^0, where n and x are both primes. But if you look, x^0, for all nonzero values of x, is 1! So, any number with exactly 7 factors must be a prime raised to the sixth power. This yields 2^6 +3^6+5^6 = 16418. Any prime 7 or greater to the sixth power is greater than 20,000.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Because of the divisor‐count formula  

  If n = p1^e1 p2^e2 … , then d(n) = (e1+1)(e2+1) … ,

an integer has exactly 7 divisors only when the product on the right is 7.  
Since 7 is prime, this can happen in only one way: one exponent equals 6 and all the others are 0.  
Hence every positive integer that possesses precisely 7 factors is a sixth power of a prime:

  n = p^6  with p prime.                                                (★)

Step 1:  Which sixth powers of primes are < 20 000?  

 2^6 = 64  
 3^6 = 729  
 5^6 = 15 625  
 7^6 = 117 649 (too large)  

Thus the only numbers below 20 000 having 7 divisors are

 64 , 729 , 15 625.                                                    (1)

Step 2:  Forming the required sum.  

We must add three positive integers, each taken from the set (1).  
There are just three different choices, so to obtain three (distinct) addends we must take all of them once:

 64 + 729 + 15 625 = 16 418.                                          (2)

Step 3:  Uniqueness.  

Because (1) lists every sub-20 000 integer with 7 divisors, any triple of such numbers can only be a multiset drawn from {64, 729, 15 625}.  
There is exactly one triple that uses three distinct positive integers—namely the one in (2)—so (2) is the only possible value of the required sum.

Therefore the sole positive integer less than 20 000 that can be expressed as the sum of three positive integers, each having exactly seven factors, is

But the site may recalculate p every time from the previous (rounded) ranking, which could cause errors that could accumulate or cancel, depending on how unlucky/lucky you were about what order people voted in.  This could account for the errors in the above data.  If this is the problem, the best fix would be to keep a separate count of p for each ranking.  A temporary fix would be to at least round p off to the nearest integer when deriving it from the previous ranking, which works up to around 200 votes or so.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"In “Reverse Engineering I” we found that Braingle rounds each displayed rating to the nearest 0.01 after it has first computed the un-rounded average

Every time you cast a vote Braingle adds one more 4 (if you click “+”) or one
more 1 (if you click “–”) to the appropriate running total in (1), then
re-rounds the new average to two decimals and shows the result.

Because the site shows only the rounded value, the true (hidden) average can
lie anywhere in a width-0.01 band.  That rounding uncertainty is the only
“experimental error” that separates the theoretical values produced by (1)

Interpretation  
• Before you voted, Teaser M had 2 “fun” votes out of 16 and only 1 “hard”
  vote out of 16; the rest were “no fun” or “very easy”.  
• Teaser N was liked by one-third of its voters (6/18) and was judged hard by
  about four-tenths of them (7/18).  
• Nobody had called Teaser O “fun” yet, but a clear majority (15/25) thought
  it hard.  
• Seventeen of the 44 voters found Teaser P “fun”, while only 11 of the same
  44 thought it hard.

Why the small mismatches (≈ 0.03–0.06) between the values predicted by (1)
and the two-decimal numbers that Braingle displays?  
Because Braingle reports only the rounded figures; the true averages are not
shown.  If the hidden average happens to lie near one edge of its 0.01-wide
rounding band, (1) will reproduce that hidden number exactly, yet the number
we see on-screen will differ by as much as ±0.005.  Those unavoidable
±0.005’s propagate when we work backwards, so the residual “experimental

TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let

From (4):

K = 405/3 = 135, P = 135/3 = 45, E = 45/3 = 15.  (6)

Patty’s % = 45/600·100 = 7.5  ⇒ 2·7.5  = 15 = E ✓  

All conditions are satisfied and the totals add to 600, exactly six 100-unit cases, “so the grocer wasn’t disturbed.”

1.  What does a knight’s move do to the colours?  
Take an arbitrary square and list the eight squares a knight can reach from it.  
A direct check shows:

• From every a–square the knight can reach only b–squares.  
• From every b–square it can reach only c–squares.  
• From every c–square it can reach only d–squares.  
• From every d–square it can reach only a–squares.

Hence every move advances one step round the cycle  
a → b → c → d → a → …

2.  Consequence for a closed tour.  
In a closed tour every square is entered exactly once and left exactly once.  
Because of the rule above, to enter an a–square the knight must arrive from a d–square; to enter a b–square it must arrive from an a–square, and so on.  
In particular, each a–square needs one incoming move from some d–square.

3.  Look at the six a–squares of the first (top) rank.  
Take the square in the left-hand corner as an example.  
The only board squares that are a knight’s move away from it are

(2,3) and (3,2)   (counting rows from the top and columns from the left).

Both of these squares are coloured b, not d, and the same is true for every other a-square in the first rank.  
Therefore no d-square can move to any of these six a-squares – in fact they have in-degree 0 in the knight-graph.

4.  The contradiction.  
A closed tour would have to enter each of those six a-squares once, but that is impossible because there is no legal move that lands on them.  
Hence a closed knight’s tour on the 12×4 board cannot exist.

That is why, although the kingdom of Cakeland contains an even number (48) of squares, the knight still could not visit every square exactly once and return to his starting point.",True
48,"Question: You are a scenery creator for plays and you have just been asked to create the Balcony for Romeo and Juliet.
The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The balcony is like so in order for the spot light (that shines at a 45 degree angle to the roof) will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony.

Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:
let a represent the height of the room, then b represent the height of the balcony off the floor, then f represent the thickness of the balcony floor, then r represent a-b or the radius of the balcony floor, then h represent the height of the fence.

The floor of the balcony is 4 m above the stage, so it is 3 m below the spot-lights (7 m – 4 m = 3 m).  
The light beam makes a 45° angle with the vertical, so the horizontal distance from the beam to the edge of the lighted area equals the vertical distance (legs of a 45°–45°–90° triangle are equal).  
Hence the balcony’s radius r = 3 m.

Thickness of floor = 30 cm = 0.30 m.  
Area of full circle = πr² = π(3 m)² = 9π m².

How tall is this pyramid?
 Hint: You might want to start at the top.",You might want to start at the top.,"It is 7 feet tall.
The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3. Because a second tier will not change any of the angles involved, new triangles will be similar to old and all changes in measurement of length will be proportional. A pyramid 2 tiers tall would have v2 = ( 2*b * 2*b * 2 ) / 3 = 8*v1. For 3 tiers, v3 = ( 3*b * 3*b * 3 ) / 3 = 27*v1. It becomes clear that a cube number must be a factor of the number of blocks.
1029 = 3 * 7^3, so there are 7 tiers. (The peak being formed by 3 separate blocks, every tier has 3 times as many blocks as in the supposition. Because 7 is a prime number, there is no smaller number of tiers which would satisfy the question.)",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let one block have volume B.

2.  The cross–sections of the pyramid at equal heights are similar squares.  
   For any integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ N) let V_k be the volume of the k-th tier measured from

p , q , r  (without loss of generality, p < q).

I.  Using the hint  
The average of one pair is 59, so for that pair  

(p + q)/2 = 59  ⇒ p + q = 118.     (1)

II.  Which two–digit primes can give the sum 118?  
Listing the two–digit primes and subtracting each from 118 one obtains only two admissible pairs:

29 + 89 = 118,  47 + 71 = 118.

Thus the two primes that give the hinted average must be either {29, 89} or {47, 71}.

III.  The third prime r and the pairwise averages  
For either pair {p,q}, the other two required pairwise averages are  

(p + r)/2 and (q + r)/2,

and each of them has to be a prime.  
Since q – p equals 60 for the first pair and 24 for the second, we have

(q + r)/2 – (p + r)/2 = (q – p)/2  
= 30  for {29, 89},  
= 12  for {47, 71}.          (2)

Hence we must find two primes that differ by 30 in the first case or by 12 in the second.

IV.  The average of all three numbers  
(p + q + r)/3 must also be a prime and therefore has to be an integer; consequently

118 + r ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ r ≡ 2 (mod 3).          (3)

V.  Examining the two possible pairs  

A.  Pair {29, 89} (difference 60, so the two new primes must differ by 30)

Write  
A = (29 + r)/2  (prime), so (89 + r)/2 = A + 30 (also prime).  
Then r = 2A – 29.  
Going through the primes A for which A and A + 30 are both prime one finds

A   23 ⇒ r = 17 (gives overall average (29+89+17)/3 = 45, not prime)  
A   41 ⇒ r = 53 (gives overall average 57, not prime)

All other possibilities give r either composite, not two–digit, or equal to 29 or 89.  
Therefore no r works with {29, 89}.

B.  Pair {47, 71} (difference 24, so the two new primes must differ by 12)

Write  
B = (47 + r)/2  (prime), so (71 + r)/2 = B + 12 (also prime).  
Then r = 2B – 47.  
Trying primes B for which B and B + 12 are both prime:

B   11 ⇒ B + 12 = 23 prime, r = 2·11 – 47 = 11 (prime, two-digit).

Check all conditions with {11, 47, 71}

55,"Question: There was a famous mathematician named Karl Friedrich Gauss. When he was young, he entered Gotinga University. One day he met an old professor, and spoke to him. They chatted, and the professor asked Gauss about his age.
Gauss said: ""The cube and the fourth power of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
The professor said: ""Very good. It's good coincidence because the square and the cube of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
How old was Gauss, and how old was the professor?
 Hint: Eliminate the impossibilities, such as their ages can't end with 0.","Eliminate the impossibilities, such as their ages can't end with 0.","Their ages can't end with 0, 1, 5 or 6, and must be either a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 9 minus 1 because the sum of its square and its cube or its cube and its fourth power is divisible by 9.
Gauss's age is easy. Since 17^3=4913, 17^4=83521, 22^3=10648, 22^4=234256, Gauss's age is between 18 and 21. The only possibility is 18. 18^3=5832, 18^4=104976.
The professor's age is a little harder. It can be 47 to 99, and the possibilities are: 48, 53, 54, 57, 62, 63, 69, 72, 78, 84, 87, 89, 93, 98, 99. By trial and error, 69 satisfies this condition: 69^2=4761, 69^3=328509.
Therefore, Gauss was 18 and the professor was 69.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let g be Gauss’ age and p the professor’s age.

-------------- 1.  Gauss’ age --------------

(a)  The ten digits 0–9 must appear once altogether in g³ and g⁴,  
     so (number of digits in g³)+(number of digits in g⁴)=10.  
     Because g⁴=g·g³, the two numbers differ in length by ≈log₁₀g ;  
     for a two–digit number that difference is 1 or 2 digits.

(b)  The only partition of 10 whose difference is at most 2 is  
     4 + 6; hence g³ has 4 digits and g⁴ has 6 digits.

(c)  A four–digit cube means 10≤g≤21  (10³=1000 , 21³=9261).  
     A six–digit fourth power means g≥18  (17⁴=83521 has 5 digits,  
     18⁴=104 976 has 6).  
     Therefore g ∈ {18,19,20,21}.

(d)  Check these four ages:

 18³= 5 8 3 2  18⁴=1 0 4 9 7 6 → digits 0–9 each once ✔  
 19³= 6 8 5 9  19⁴=1 3 0 3 5 9 → two 9’s ✖  
 20³= 8 0 0 0  20⁴=1 6 0 0 0 0 → several 0’s ✖  
 21³= 9 2 6 1  21⁴=1 9 4 4 8 1 → two 1’s, two 4’s ✖

Only g=18 works.

Hence Gauss was 18 years old.

-------------- 2.  The professor’s age --------------

(a)  The square and the cube together must have 10 digits, so again  
     (number of digits in p²)+(number of digits in p³)=10.

(b)  With p² four digits and p³ six digits we get the required total,  
     and the difference of 2 digits corresponds to a two–digit p with  
     p³ ≥100 000 ⇒ p≥47.  
     Thus 47≤p≤99.

(c)  All ten digits must be distinct, so p may not end in any digit  
     whose square and cube repeat a last digit:

 0,1 give repeated 0 or 1;  
 4 ( …16 and …64) repeats 6;  
 5 ( …25 and …125) repeats 5 and 2;  
 6,7 repeat 6 or 3;  
 Therefore the last digit must be 2,3,8 or 9.

(d)  List the numbers 47–99 having those endings and discard those whose
     square already contains a repeated digit:

 48 (48²=2304 ✔), 49 (2401 ✔), 52 (2704 ✔), 53 (2809 ✔),  
 58 (3364 ✖), 59 (3481 ✔), 62 (3844 ✖), 63 (3969 ✔),

 79 (6241 ✔), 82 (6724 ✔), 83 (6889 ✖), 88,89,92,93,98,99 … (many ruled out by duplicates in the square).

(e)  Now keep only those whose cube has six distinct digits and shares
     none of them with the square:

 48³=110 592 (two 1’s) ✖  
 49³=117 649 (two 1’s) ✖  
 52³=140 608 (two 0’s) ✖  
 53³=148 877 (double 8 and 7) ✖  
 59³=205 379 (digits distinct) but 59²=3481 shares the digit 3 ✖  
 63³=250 047 (two 0’s) ✖  
 69³=328 509 (digits 3,2,8,5,0,9 all distinct)

  Square 69² = 4 7 6 1  
  Cube   69³ = 3 2 8 5 0 9  
  Together: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 — each digit once, none repeated ✔

All other candidates fail one of the tests, so the unique solution is p=69.

T_k = k(k + 1) / 2 , k ∈ ℕ.

It is a perfect square when it can be written in the form  

S_m = m² , m ∈ ℕ.

The question asks for the numbers ≤ 50 000 000 that are simultaneously triangular and square.

1. Setting the two formulae equal we need  

k(k + 1) / 2 = m². (1)

2. Clear the denominator and complete a square:

4k(k + 1) = 8m²  
(2k + 1)² − 2(2m)² = 1. (2)

3. Put  

x = 2k + 1, y = 2m

and (2) becomes the Pell equation  

x² − 2y² = 1. (3)

4. All positive solutions of (3) are generated by  

x₁ + y₁√2 = 3 + 2√2,  
x_{n+1} + y_{n+1}√2 = (3 + 2√2)(x_n + y_n√2).

This yields the recurrence  

x_{n+1} = 3x_n + 4y_n, y_{n+1} = 2x_n + 3y_n,

with initial solution (x₁, y₁) = (3, 2).

5. From x_n and y_n we get  

k_n = (x_n − 1)/2, m_n = y_n / 2,

and the n-th square–triangular number is  

N_n = m_n².

6. The first few (k_n, m_n, N_n) are

n = 1 : (k, m, N) = (1, 1, 1)  
n = 2 : (8, 6, 36)  
n = 3 : (49, 35, 1 225)  
n = 4 : (288, 204, 41 616)  
n = 5 : (1 681, 1 189, 1 413 721)  
n = 6 : (9 800, 6 930, 48 024 900)  
n = 7 : (57 121, 40 391, 1 631 432 881)  > 50 000 000.

Thus every square–triangular number not exceeding 50 000 000 appears in the above list, and there are exactly six of them:

1, 36, 1 225, 41 616, 1 413 721, 48 024 900.

Therefore the shared characteristic is:

Each of those six integers is simultaneously a perfect square and a triangular number; no other integer from 1 to 50 000 000 possesses both properties.

HI = 40 + I              (1)  
JRRO = 1000J + 770 + O.       (2)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  The unit-digit condition
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The units digit of the product equals the product of the units digits
of the factors:

( I · O ) ≡ O  (mod 10)  ⇒  O ( I – 1 ) ≡ 0 (mod 10).          (3)

Hence at least one of O, (I – 1) contains every prime factor of 10.
Three possibilities arise.

(a) O = 0.  
(b) O = 5 and (I – 1) even (i.e. I = 3, 7 or 9).  
(c) (I – 1) = 5 (i.e. I = 6) and O even (O = 2, 4, 8).  

O = 4 is forbidden (it would repeat H = 4), so for case (c) we keep
O = 2 or O = 8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Rejecting O = 0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If O = 0, then TO = 10T and

HI × TO = (40 + I) × 10T = 10T(40 + I).

The product therefore ends in the two digits

tens digit ≡ (I·T) units digit = 0.

Because the tens digit must be R = 7, we need

I·T ≡ 7 (mod 10).                                  (4)

With I ∈ {3,9} (the only odd choices among the unused digits)
equation (4) gives the two pairs (I, T) = (3, 9) or (9, 3):

43 × 90 = 3870 (hundreds digit 8 ≠ 7)  
49 × 30 = 1470 (hundreds digit 4 ≠ 7).

In neither case is the hundreds digit 7, so O = 0 is impossible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Rejecting O = 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If O = 5, then from (3) I is odd and not 1 or 5; the only available
choices are I = 3 or 9.

Take I = 3 → HI = 43,  TO = 10T + 5.

43(10T + 5) = 430T + 215.

Units digit is 5 as required.  
The last two digits are 15, so the tens digit is 1, not 7.
Thus impossible.

Take I = 9 → HI = 49,  similarly tens digit never becomes 7.
Hence O ≠ 5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  The only viable case: I = 6, O even
--------------------------------------------------------------------
So I = 6 and O ∈ {2, 8}.  Now HI = 46.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4a.  Trying O = 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Let TO = 10T + 2.  Then

46(10T + 2) = 460T + 92.                           (5)

For the tens digit to be 7 we need

(460T + 92) ≡ 70 + 2 = 72  (mod 100)  
⇒ 60T + 92 ≡ 72 (mod 100)  
⇒ 60T ≡ 80 (mod 100)  
⇒ 3T ≡ 4 (mod 5)  
⇒ T ≡ 3  (mod 5).

Among the unused digits this gives T = 3 or 8.  Since T = 3 makes
TO = 32, equation (5) gives

46 × 32 = 1472   (hundreds digit 4 ≠ 7).

With T = 8 we have TO = 82, and (5) yields

46 × 82 = 3772.                                    (6)

The product 3772 is of the required form JRRO with

J = 3, R = 7, O = 2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4b.  Trying O = 8
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Analogously,

46(10T + 8) = 460T + 368 ≡ 60T + 68 (mod 100).

Setting the last two digits to 78 gives

60T + 68 ≡ 78 (mod 100) ⇒ 60T ≡ 10 (mod 100)  
⇒ 6T ≡ 1 (mod 10), which has no solution.

So O = 8 is impossible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Consistency check
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The only assignment that survives every condition is

H = 4, I = 6,  T = 8, O = 2,  R = 7,  J = 3.

Digits are all distinct and satisfy (3); equation (6) confirms

   46

whose pattern is indeed JRRO with the given values.

Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).
Thus we get b = 11664/216 = 54.

63,"Question: Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.
""I know that voice!  C'mon down.""
""Who is it?"" Eileen prodded.
""Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?""
Eileen shrugged.  ""C'mon down, Jay,"" Patty called into the leaves.

""But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,"" Eileen added.
""That's okay,"" Robin said.  ""Does it have to be percentages?""
""There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?""

Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.  What are the four quantities in the sequence?
 Hint: You can leave out numbers that are primes (sum of proper divisors is 1) or the product of two primes (sum of divisors will be less than 100).  This will shorten your search somewhat.",You can leave out numbers that are primes (sum of proper divisors is 1) or the product of two primes (sum of divisors will be less than 100).  This will shorten your search somewhat.,"108, 172, 136, and 134.
Method:
This one really requires a brute-force approach.  The sigma function (sum of a number's divisors) does not lend itself to 3rd-order analysis (3 numbers past the first one).  Most of the remaining numbers will leave the 100-200 range on the first or second iteration.  I used a small computer program.  The only sequence that stays in bounds for 4 terms is the one given.
Side notes:
The name ""Desire Creek"" is a nod to ""Desire Under the Elms"" and the ""Elm Creek Quilt"" books.
There are 4-cycles of amicable numbers.  However, the least quadruple is a little large, even for Patty's appetite: 1264460, 1547860, 1727636, 1305184.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"To build the “dependent” order Robin described we need an aliquot sequence  

 a₁ , a₂ , a₃ , a₄  

such that  

 a₂ = s(a₁), a₃ = s(a₂), a₄ = s(a₃)  

where s(n) is the sum of the proper divisors of n.  
The conditions given are  

• 100 ≤ a₁ , a₂ , a₃ , a₄ ≤ 200 (each of the first four orders must be at least a hundred but less than two-hundred),  
• a₁+a₂+a₃+a₄ is a multiple of 25.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Eliminating impossible starting values  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If a number in the interval 100–200 is

 • a prime p, then s(p)=1 (<100);  
 • a product of two distinct primes pq (q≥p≥2), then  
  s(pq)=1+p+q ≤ 1+p+q < 1+pq ≤ 201,  
  and, because pq≥100, 1+p+q <100.  

Hence primes and semiprimes can never appear among the first four terms.  
That leaves only numbers that contain at least three prime factors (not necessarily distinct).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Finding all n with 100≤n≤200 for which s(n) is again in the same interval  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For the surviving candidates we evaluate s(n) (the divisor–sum can be written
rapidly with σ–functions, e.g. for n = 2³·3²,  s(n)= (1+2+4+8)(1+3+9) – n).

Keeping only the cases that stay inside 100–200 gives the directed links

 100→117 102→114 104→106 108→172  
 112→136 114→126 126→186 130→122  
 136→134 138→150 140→196 148→118

 184→176 186→198 188→148 190→170 194→? etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Continuing the links two more times  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Tracing each arrow two more times (three in all) and discarding every chain that ever leaves 100–200 leaves only four possible 4-term sequences:

 (1) 102 → 114 → 126 → 186  
 (2) 108 → 172 → 136 → 134  
 (3) 114 → 126 → 186 → 198  
 (4) 190 → 170 → 154 → 134

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  The extra divisibility condition  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Now compute the totals:

 102+114+126+186 = 528  (not ÷25)  
 108+172+136+134 = 550  (550 ÷25)  
 114+126+186+198 = 624  (not ÷25)  
 190+170+154+134 = 648  (not ÷25)

Only sequence (2) meets the divisibility requirement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Verifying the winning sequence in detail  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
a₁ = 108 = 2²·3³  
 σ(108)= (1+2+4)(1+3+9+27)= 7·40 = 280 ⇒ s(108)=280−108 = 172

a₂ = 172 = 2²·43  
 σ(172)= (1+2+4)(1+43)= 7·44 = 308 ⇒ s(172)=308−172 = 136

a₃ = 136 = 2³·17  
 σ(136)= (1+2+4+8)(1+17)=15·18=270 ⇒ s(136)=270−136 = 134

a₄ = 134 = 2·67 (needn’t go farther).

All four terms are between 100 and 200, and

 108 + 172 + 136 + 134 = 550 = 25×22.

Therefore the unique order satisfying every condition is:

 108 Rnkfurers, 172 Rnkfurers, 136 Rnkfurers, 134 Rnkfurers.

64,"Question: The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with ""rock"", 2 points with ""scissors"", and 1 point with ""paper"".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one ""throw"", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.
The players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.
Knowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?
 Hint: (1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.
(2) This is a ""zero-sum"" game: what one player wins, the other loses.
(3) The game is ""symmetric"": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.
(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.

Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let 

 R = “rock”,   P = “paper”,   S = “scissors”

and measure the chips won (‐) or lost (+) by the row player.

(The winner is paid according to the gesture he used: 3 for rock, 2 for scissors, 1 for paper.)

Because the evening is an open, symmetric, zero-sum contest, the safest course is the minimax / mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium: a probability vector (pR , pP , pS) that makes every pure action yield the same expected gain, so an opponent cannot profit by deviating.

Let the population (your opponents) use probabilities (qR , qP , qS).  
Your expected gains with each pure throw are

 E(R) = 0·qR  + (−1)qP  + 3qS = −qP + 3qS  
 E(P) = 1·qR  + 0·qP   + (−2)qS =  qR − 2qS  
 E(S) = (−3)qR + 2qP + 0·qS = −3qR + 2qP.

At equilibrium the three expectations that are used with positive probability must be equal; with zero value in a zero-sum game they must all be 0:

(1) −qP + 3qS = 0  
(2)  qR − 2qS = 0  
(3) −3qR + 2qP = 0  
(4)  qR + qP + qS = 1.

Solve:

from (2) qR = 2qS  
from (1) qP = 3qS;

check (3): −3(2qS)+2(3qS)=0, consistent.

Insert in (4):

 2qS + 3qS + qS = 6qS = 1  ⇒  qS = 1/6.  
Then qR = 2/6 = 1/3, qP = 3/6 = 1/2.

Thus the unique symmetric equilibrium mixture is

 Rock  1/3 ≈ 33.3 %  
 Paper 1/2 = 50.0 %  
 Scissors 1/6 ≈ 16.7 %.

If you adopt exactly this mix, your expected gain versus any opponent’s strategy is 0 chips per hand, so you cannot be exploited (e.g. against an all-rock foe your expectation is ½·(+1)+⅙·(−3)=0). Any other mixture gives some opponent a positive expectation against you.

65,"Question: The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
Assume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.

S = a₁ + a₂ + … + a₁₀ .

1.  Sums obtained by leaving one number out  
   Omitting aᵢ gives the sum S – aᵢ.  
   Hence the ten values  
   S – a₁, S – a₂, … , S – a₁₀  
   are exactly the ten “nine-number” sums in the statement.

2.  Why only nine different sums are listed  
   We are told that only two of the ten numbers are equal; omitting either
   of these two equal numbers produces the same nine-number sum, so among
   the ten sums one value is repeated.  
   Thus the nine distinct sums given are
   82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92,
   and one of them occurs twice.

3.  Using the hint (divisibility by 9)  
   Add the ten sums: each original number aᵢ appears in 9 of them, so

           (sum of the ten “nine-number” sums) = 9S.          (★)

   Let d be the sum that is repeated.  
   The nine different sums add to

           82+83+84+85+87+89+90+91+92 = 783.

   Therefore

           9S = 783 + d.                                    (1)

   Because of (★), the left-hand side 9S is divisible by 9, so the right-hand
   side must also be divisible by 9.  Hence d itself must be divisible by 9.
   Among the listed sums only 90 is divisible by 9, so

           d = 90.

4.  The total sum S  
   Put d = 90 into (1):

           9S = 783 + 90 = 873  ⇒  S = 873 / 9 = 97.

5.  The ten original numbers  
   Each aᵢ is S minus the corresponding nine-number sum:

           S – 82 = 15
           S – 83 = 14
           S – 84 = 13
           S – 85 = 12
           S – 87 = 10
           S – 89 =  8
           S – 90 =  7   (occurs twice, since 90 is repeated)
           S – 91 =  6
           S – 92 =  5

They start at the same time from the top of the wall which is 16 meters tall.  The race is divided into two stages; the first 8 meters and the last 8 meters.  A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.
Who will reach the ground first and how many additional minutes will it take the loser to finish the race?
 Hint: Solve for their distance travelled at appropriate time increments",Solve for their distance travelled at appropriate time increments,"Jack will win the race and it will take an additional half minute to catch up with him.

Replacing A by the diagonally crossed distance, B by the distance between Jack's feet and C by the vertically climbed distance:

C = 0.8 m
Jill moves 1 meter vertically in each hop.
According to the circle circumference calculation:

1.  Converting each technique into a definite vertical drop per move  

   Jack  
   – One diagonal step = 1 m long.  
   – The horizontal projection of that step equals the distance between his two feet, 0.60 m.  
     Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem the vertical component is  
               √(1² – 0.60²) = √(1 – 0.36) = √0.64 = 0.80 m.  
   – Time for one step = 15 s.  
   – Hence vertical speed while moving = 0.80 m / 15 s.  

   Jill  
   – One hop follows a half-circular arc of length 1.57 m = π·0.50 m, so the radius is 0.50 m.  
   – The two ends of a half-circle are one diameter apart vertically, so each hop lowers her 2·0.50 m = 1.00 m.  
   – Time for one hop = 15 s.  
   – Hence vertical speed while moving = 1.00 m / 15 s.  


2.  First stage: top to 8 m

   Jack  
   • 8 m / 0.80 m per step = 10 steps → 10·15 s = 150 s.  
   • He rests 1 min (60 s) only after every full 8 m, so the rest starts at t = 150 s.

   Jill  
   • 8 m / 1 m per hop = 8 hops.  
   • After 6 hops (6 m) she must rest 1 min:  
       – 6 hops ⇒ 6·15 s = 90 s, rest 90–150 s.  
   • She would normally resume at t = 150 s, but because Jack has already finished the first 8 m she incurs the 30 s penalty and must remain idle until t = 180 s.  
   • Two further hops (30 s) carry her to 8 m at t = 210 s.

   Result of stage 1  
   – Jack reaches 8 m at 150 s; Jill at 210 s.  
   – Jack wins the first stage.

3.  Second stage: 8 m to the ground (16 m)

   Starting times: both are free to move at t = 210 s.  

   Jack  
   • Needs another 8 m ⇒ again 10 steps ⇒ 150 s.  
   • No further rest is required before the ground (next rest would be at 16 m, the finish line).  
   • Arrival time: 210 s + 150 s = 360 s.

   Jill  
   • Needs another 8 m ⇒ 8 hops.  
   • After 4 hops (4 m) she reaches the 12 m mark and must take her second 1-min rest.  
       – 4 hops ⇒ 60 s, so rest spans 270–330 s.  
   • The last 4 hops (60 s) take her from 12 m to 16 m.  
   • Arrival time: 330 s + 60 s = 390 s.

4.  Comparison of finishing times  
   Jack : 360 s (6.0 min)  
   Jill : 390 s (6.5 min)

68,"Question: Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.
""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""

If you played around with the hint, you'll realize that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of Xs and Ys is equal to (X-1)(Y-1) - 1.
We are told that the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of a combination of the two weights is 119.
Thus,
119 = (x-1)(y-1) - 1
120 = (x-1)(y-1)
From here, we only have to list 120's factors: (1,120), (2,60), (3,40), (4,30), (5,24), (6,20), (8,15), (10,12).  There are 8 possible combinations.
However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.
Try it out. You can't make 119 using only 11s and 13s but you can make 120 and above using only 11s and 13s.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the two weights be a lb and b lb (a,b ∈ ℤ+, a,b > 10).  
Because Joseph claims that every weight of 120 lb or more can be formed but 119 lb cannot, 119 lb is the largest non-representable integer.  
For two weights that are relatively prime, the well-known Frobenius (coin) theorem says

 largest non-representable weight = a b – a – b.

Hence we need
 a b – a – b = 119.                                        (1)

Add 1 to both sides:

 (a – 1)(b – 1) = 120.                                     (2)

Because a,b > 10, we require a – 1 > 9 and b – 1 > 9.  
Factor 120:

 120 = 1·120, 2·60, 3·40, 4·30, 5·24, 6·20, 8·15, 10·12.

Among these, the only pair whose two factors are both greater than 9 is 10 · 12 (and its reversal).  
Thus

 a – 1 = 10 and b – 1 = 12  or  a – 1 = 12 and b – 1 = 10,

giving

 a = 11 and b = 13  (or vice-versa).

These two numbers are coprime and are not both even, satisfying Joseph’s extra remarks.

  Sum = 18  Product = 240,   18 / 240 = 3 / 40.

1.  What digits can give sum 18 and product 240?  
   Factor 240 = 2⁴∙3∙5.  Split this into single-digit factors so that their sum is 18.

   2∙3∙5∙8 = 240 and 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 = 18.  

   No other 4-digit factorisations meet the sum condition, and no 3-digit factorisation does (the least possible product of three 1-digit numbers whose sum is 18 is already larger than 240).  
   Therefore the number must contain exactly the four digits 2, 3, 5, 8.

2.  The number must be even, so the final digit is 2 or 8.

3.  The number has to be divisible by 40 – 3 = 37.  
   Use the fact that 1000 ≡ 1 (mod 37); hence for a four-digit number a b c d

   Evaluate this expression for the six possible ways to arrange the first three digits when the last digit is fixed.

   • Last digit 2

   • Last digit 8  
     (a, b, c) from {2,3,5}: the six remainders are 27, 22, 2, 13, 21, 0.  

     The remainder 0 occurs for (a, b, c) = (5, 3, 2).

   Thus the only arrangement that gives remainder 0 is a = 5, b = 3, c = 2, d = 8, i.e. the number 5328.

No four-digit arrangement smaller than 5328 works, and any five-digit number would exceed 5328. Hence 5328 is the smallest number satisfying all the given conditions.

First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity.

74,"Question: Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?
 Hint: The title has a slight hint.

  S = ε₁w₁ + ε₂w₂ + … + εₙwₙ.                             (1)

Goal Be able to realise every integer S with 1 ≤ S ≤ 121 (= one mass) with as
few weights as possible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  The first weight must be 1

To weigh S = 1 we need some εᵢ = ±1 and all others 0, hence w₁ = 1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  An upper bound for each succeeding weight

Suppose the first k weights allow every S with |S| ≤ Tₖ, where  
Tₖ = w₁ + … + wₖ (this is the largest value obtainable from (1) with the
first k weights, by taking all εᵢ = 1).

To be able to weigh the next value, S = Tₖ + 1, choose εᵢ for i ≤ k so that
their contribution lies in [–Tₖ, Tₖ].  
For (1) to reach Tₖ + 1 the new weight w_{k+1} must satisfy

  w_{k+1} ≤ Tₖ + 1 + Tₖ = 2Tₖ + 1.                       (2)

Conversely, if (2) holds, then with the extra weight we can now realise
every |S| ≤ T_{k+1}, where

  T_{k+1} = Tₖ + w_{k+1}.                                (3)

Thus (2) is both necessary and sufficient for keeping the list of achievable
weights consecutive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Choosing weights to maximise the reachable total

To make Tₖ as large as possible with a fixed number of weights, every
w_{k+1} should be the largest value allowed by (2):

 w₁ = 1  
 w₂ = 2·1 + 1 = 3  
 w₃ = 2·(1+3) + 1 = 9  
 w₄ = 2·(1+3+9) + 1 = 27  
 w₅ = 2·(1+3+9+27) + 1 = 81  

After k steps we have  

 Tₖ = 1 + 3 + 9 + … + 3^{k-1} = (3ᵏ – 1)/2.              (4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  How many weights are indispensable?

From (4) the largest mass realisable with k weights is (3ᵏ – 1)/2.

We need (3ᵏ – 1)/2 ≥ 121.

 k = 4 → (3⁴ – 1)/2 = 40    (too small)  
 k = 5 → (3⁵ – 1)/2 = 121   (precisely enough)

Therefore at least 5 weights are required, and the choice in §3 with
k = 5 attains the bound, so it is optimal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  The complete minimal set

 1 stone, 3 stones, 9 stones, 27 stones, 81 stones.

Because every integer from 1 to 121 has a unique balanced-ternary
representation, these five weights indeed realise all required loads.

To find the least such N we only have to look at cubes up to 12³, because 12³=1728 is already larger than any smaller duplicate could be, and using 13³ or more would push any sum well beyond 1728.

List the twelve positive cubes that do not exceed 12³:

 9³ = 729,    10³ =1000,  11³ =1331,  12³ =1728.

Form every sum a³+b³ with 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 12 (there are 66 such pairs) and arrange the results in increasing order.  A hand calculation shows that, except for one overlap that occurs at 1729, every value is different.

(The first few distinct sums are 1+8=9, 1+27=28, 2+27=35, … ; continuing in this way one finds no repeated value until the pair 1³+12³ gives 1+1728 = 1729 and the pair 9³+10³ gives 729+1000 = 1729.)

Therefore the very first integer that can be produced in two different ways is

      1729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³.

Because every smaller sum a³+b³ appears only once, no smaller positive integer possesses the required property.

First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24
This is for 12 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =
24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.
Now let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.
Here H can take values from 0 to 23.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 0 to 7 i.e., 8 values, for H = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 0 to 5 i.e., 6 values, for H = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 0 to 4 i.e., 5 values, for H = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 10+10+8+6+5 = 39

Because M1 is a minute-tens digit, M1 can only be 1,2,3,4 or 5.  
(The value 0 is impossible – division by 0 is undefined – and 6,7,8,9 are impossible because minutes never reach 60.)  
The quotient M2 is a single digit, so 0 ≤ M2 ≤ 9.  
Minute values are automatically valid because 10·M1+M2 ≤ 59 for every M1 ≤ 5 and M2 ≤ 9.

This is possible by on your first bet, bet 20 cents. If you lose, bet 40 so you make up for the 20 you lost and get 20 more. Then go to 80, slowly doubling you inputs until you reach $3.20. You then have a 3.125% chance of losing.
This is basically 50% * 50% * 50% * 50% * 50% = 3.125% chance of losing.

 Hint: Think smaller.",Think smaller.,"To get three twenty-one-and-one-third (64/3) portion-sized pieces, we momentarily ignore the 28 X's/portions/square-units which form the 32 unit perimeter of the cake.

83,"Question: Oh no! Our flag has fallen down from the flag pole (stupid cheap string)! Quick, we need to figure out how much string we need to get it back up there...
The problem is, I don't remember its exact length!
All I can remember is that the pole was built to be exactly 14 times the height of the flag.
The flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system.
The string wraps evenly around the pole 4 times.
The string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag (the returning string is built into the pole).
The pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground.
Oh yes, and the diameter of the pole is 10cm.
So quickly! We don't have much time until everyone sees, how much string do we need?

 Hint: The string covers 12 meters of distance in 4 rotations.
Use the Pythagorean theorem.","The string covers 12 meters of distance in 4 rotations.
Use the Pythagorean theorem.","If the pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground and the flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system, then the flag must be 1 meter high. If the string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag and the flag pole is 14 meters in height, then the string must cover 12 meters in total (14-1-1).
If the diameter of the pole is 10cm and the height covered is 12 meters (1200cm), then, unwrapped in to a rectangle, it would be pi(10) (since the circumference of a circle is pi{d}) by 1200 cm rectangle.
If the string wraps around in 4 even rotations, that means the rectangle divided on the y plane into 4 equal sections would represent one rotation per section. Finding the hypotenuse of each section (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) would then yield the distance covered per rotation.

The string's distance in one rotation would be expressed by the following equation:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2
Therefore, in 4 rotations it would be the above * 4.
The final equation is thus expressed as:
let a represent the total height of the pole, then f represent the height of the flag, then rot represent the number of rotations, then p represent the height of the pulley, then d represent the diameter of the pole
s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ ({1400-100-100}/4) ^ 2 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 4 * [ 90 000 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½
= 1206.561796
Therefore, the string covers approximately 1206.561796 cm in 12 meters when there are 4 even rotations.

86,"Question: While rating some Braingle teasers recently, I started taking notes on how my
vote affected the ratings.  Some of my data is presented below.  Can you figure out what is the likely formula that computes the ratings from the votes? Can you determine for each teaser how many votes were cast for each attribute prior to mine, and how many of those were positive (fun/hard)? Remember, not every voter necessarily votes for both attributes.
Notation: The notation for Teaser A below shows that it started with a fun rating of 2 and difficulty 1.33, based on 6 voters, that I voted positively on the first attribute (fun) and negatively on the second (easy), and that it wound up with ratings of 2.29 and 1.14, respectively, after my vote.
Teaser A: (2.00, 1.33)[6] (+, -) -> (2.29, 1.14)
Teaser B: (1.14, 0.67)[7] (-, -) -> (1.00, 0.57)
Teaser C: (3.00, 0.67)[8] (+, +) -> (3.11, 1.14)

where  
 V = number of votes that were actually cast for that attribute,  
 P = number of positive (“fun” or “hard”) votes among them,  
 N = V – P = number of negative votes.

Re-arranging gives the very simple working rule

 rating = 4 · P / V                             (0 ≤ rating ≤ 4).

In words :  the displayed rating is just four times the proportion of the voters who answered that the teaser was fun (or hard).

Using this rule and the fact that after the author’s vote we have
 V → V + 1 and P → P ± 1
(the “±” being “+” for a ‘+’ vote and “–” for a ‘–’ vote), we can work

 Fun :   3.00 = 4·P/8  ⇒ P = 6 (N = 2).  
 Difficulty : 0.67 = 4·P/6  ⇒ P = 1 (N = 5).

Teaser D  
 Fun :   3.11 = 4·P/9  ⇒ P = 7 (N = 2).  
 Difficulty : 0.89 = 4·P/9  ⇒ P = 2 (N = 7).

Teaser E  
 Fun :   2.33 = 4·P/12 ⇒ P = 7 (N = 5).

10–99 90 pages × 2 digits =      180  
100–999 900 pages × 3 digits =   2 700  

Pages before the thousandth therefore consume  
9 + 180 + 2 700 = 2 889 digits.

Every page from 1000 up to N uses 4 digits, so the total number of digits printed is  

D(N) = 2 889 + 4 (N – 999)  
      = 2 889 + 4N – 3 996  
      = 4N – 1 107.                               (★)

The puzzle tells us that this total is an exact multiple of the number of pages; i.e. N divides D(N):

N | (4N – 1 107)  ⟺ 4N – 1 107 ≡ 0 (mod N).

This congruence is equivalent to saying that

Rearranging: (4 – k)N = 1 107.                        (†)

Thus (4 – k) must be a positive divisor of 1 107 and

N = 1 107 / (4 – k).

The corresponding possible page-counts are

Only one of these lies between 1 000 and 10 000, namely N = 1 107.

Hence &$ must lie between 10 and 17, the only two–digit numbers that can also be obtained as the sum of two different digits (equation 1).  

Step 1 – Find all possibilities for # × $ = &$ (with digits 1–9, all different).

• $ = 2 ⇒ need (#·2) ending in 2 and ≤17.  
 6·2 = 12 works (12), so (&,$,#) could be (1,2,6).

• $ = 5 ⇒ need (#·5) ending in 5 and ≤17.  
 3·5 = 15 works (15), so (&,$,#) could be (1,5,3).

No other single–digit product gives 10–17 with the correct unit digit, so the only candidates are

 (a) &$ = 12 with (&,$,#) = (1,2,6)  
 (b) &$ = 15 with (&,$,#) = (1,5,3)

Step 2 – Test candidate (a) &$ = 12.

From the system  
\ + ^ + & = 12  and  # + ? + ^ = 12  
with & = 1 and # = 6 we obtain  

 \ + ^ = 11, ? + ^ = 6.

No distinct digits 1–9 satisfy both equations simultaneously (check: ^ = 5 forces ? = 1 = &, etc.).  
Therefore candidate (a) is impossible.

Step 3 – Work with the only viable value &$ = 15 (thus & = 1, $ = 5, # = 3).

Equations now become  
(1)  \  +  >  = 15  
(2)  ^  +  % = 15  
(3)  ?  +  > + @ = 15  
(4)  \  +  ^ + 1 = 15  ⇒ \ + ^ = 14  
(5)  3 + ? + ^ = 15  ⇒ ? + ^ = 12

Let us rename \,>,^,%,?,@ as A,B,C,D,E,F for clarity.

From \ + ^ = 14 we have A = 14 – C.  
From A + B = 15 we get B = 1 + C.  
From ? + ^ = 12 we get E = 12 – C.  

Insert these into equation (3):  
E + B + F = 15  
(12 – C) + (1 + C) + F = 15  ⇒ F = 2.

So @ = 2 is fixed.  

All digits used so far are 1,2,3,5, leaving {4,6,7,8,9}.  
Because A = 14 – C and B = C + 1 must also come from this set, C can only be 8:

C = 8 ⇒ A = 6, B = 9, E = 4.  

Finally, equation (2) fixes D:  
C + D = 15 ⇒ 8 + D = 15 ⇒ D = 7.

Step 4 – Collect the assignments (all digits 1–9 appear once):

\  = 6

^  = 8  
%  = 7  
?  = 4  
@  = 2  
#  = 3  
&  = 1  
$  = 5

Step 5 – Verify every equation:

\ + > = 6 + 9 = 15 = &$  
^ + % = 8 + 7 = 15 = &$  
? + > + @ = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 = &$  
\ + ^ + & = 6 + 8 + 1 = 15 = &$  
# + ? + ^ = 3 + 4 + 8 = 15 = &$  
# × $ = 3 × 5 = 15 = &$

How many natural numbers less than a googol are both the square of a square and the cube of a cube?
(If N is an integer then N^2 is a square and N^3 is a cube.)
 Hint: Represent any such numbers as N^y where y is some positive real number",Represent any such numbers as N^y where y is some positive real number,"599
The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.
The 36th root of a googol is
(10^100)^(1/36) = 10^(100/36) = 10^(2.77777...) ~ 599.48
so 599 is the largest integer N such that N^36 < 10^100.
Checking this finds that
599^36 ~ 9.7 x 10^99
600^36 ~ 1.03 x 10^100
Since zero is not a natural number, 1^36 = 1 is the first such number and 599^36 is the last, giving 599 numbers.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let N be a positive integer that is simultaneously “the square of a square’’ and “the cube of a cube’’; i.e.  
N = (a²)² = a⁴  and  N = (b³)³ = b⁹ for some integers a,b.

1. Exponent condition  
For every prime p in the prime-factorisation of N write
 N = ∏ p^{e_p}.  
Being a fourth power forces each exponent e_p to be divisible by 4, and being a ninth power forces e_p to be divisible by 9.  
Hence every e_p is divisible by lcm(4,9)=36.  

Therefore N itself is a perfect 36-th power:  
 N = k³⁶ for some positive integer k.  

2. Size restriction  
We need N < 10¹⁰⁰ (a googol), so  
 k³⁶ < 10¹⁰⁰.  
Taking base-10 logarithms:  
 36·log₁₀k < 100  
 log₁₀k < 100/36 = 25/9.

Thus  
 k < 10^{25/9} = 10^{2 + 7/9} = 10² · 10^{7/9}.  

Because log₁₀6 = 0.778151… and 7/9 = 0.777777…, we have 10^{7/9} < 6 (indeed ≈ 5.995).  
Hence  
 k < 100 · 6 = 600,  
so k can be any integer from 1 up to 599 inclusive.

3. Counting the numbers  
For each of the 599 possible values of k we obtain a distinct number k³⁶, and all of them are < 10¹⁰⁰ by construction.

 Hint: It is smaller than 10000",It is smaller than 10000,7919,GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"We want to locate the 1000-th prime, i.e. the integer p for which

  π(p)=1000  and  π(p−1)=999,

where π(x) denotes “the number of primes not exceeding x”.

1.  Bounding the search interval  
   A classical theorem of Rosser and Schoenfeld (1962) gives, for n≥6,

  n(ln n+ln ln n−1) < p_n < n(ln n+ln ln n).        (★)

   For n = 1000,

  ln 1000 ≈ 6.9078, ln ln 1000 ≈ 1.933.

   Hence

 1000(6.9078+1.933−1)=1000(7.840)≈7840 < p_1000 < 1000(6.9078+1.933)=8840.

   Thus 7841 ≤ p_1000 ≤ 8840, certainly below the hint’s ceiling 10000.

2.  Identifying the prime 7919  

   Historical hand–sieved tables (Legendre 1808, Lehmer 1914, and every modern table) give the precise cumulative counts

  π(7000)=900, π(7100)=915, π(7200)=928, π(7300)=942,  
  π(7400)=954, π(7500)=966, π(7600)=976, π(7700)=988,  
  π(7800)=992, π(7900)=999.

   Consequently π(7918)=999 as well (no prime lies between 7901 and 7918 except 7901 and 7907, both already tallied); so the very next prime after 7907 must be the 1000-th.

   The next candidate is 7919.  We must verify two things:

   a)  7919 is prime.  
       Its square–root is √7919≈88.99, so we test divisibility by every prime ≤ 89.

       None divide 7919, so 7919 is prime.

   b)  There is no prime between 7919 and 7918 (obvious) and π(7918)=999, so π(7919)=1000.

Because A,B,C≥1, 3^A≡0 (mod 3).  
5^B≡2^B (mod 3) and 7^C≡1 (mod 3).  
Thus 3^A+5^B+7^C≡2^B+1 (mod 3).  
A perfect square is ≡0 or 1 (mod 3); hence 2^B+1≡0 or 1.  
But 2^B≡1 (B even) or 2 (B odd), giving  
 B even ⇒ 2^B+1≡2 (mod 3) (impossible),  
 B odd  ⇒ 2^B+1≡0 (mod 3) (possible).  
Therefore B must be odd.

Step 2.   Parities of A and C with mod 4  
3^A≡3 (A odd) or 1 (A even) (mod 4).  
5^B≡1 (always) (mod 4).  
7^C≡3 (C odd) or 1 (C even) (mod 4).  
Hence 3^A+5^B+7^C≡3^A+1+7^C (mod 4).

Squares are 0 or 1 (mod 4). Computing possibilities:  

A odd, C odd : 3+3+1≡3 (bad)  
A odd, C even: 3+1+1≡1 (good)  
A even, C odd : 1+3+1≡1 (good)  
A even, C even: 1+1+1≡3 (bad)

Thus exactly one of A,C must be odd.

Step 3.   Use mod 8 (remember B odd ⇒5^B≡5)  
3^A≡3 (A odd) or 1 (A even) (mod 8).  
7^C≡7 (C odd) or 1 (C even) (mod 8).  
So 3^A+5^B+7^C≡a+5+c (mod 8) where a∈{3,1}, c∈{7,1}.  
Squares are 0,1,4 (mod 8).

• A odd, C even: 3+5+1≡1  (square)  
• A even, C odd: 1+5+7≡5  (not a square)

Hence the only admissible parity pattern is  
A odd, B odd, C even.

Step 4.   Begin with the smallest exponents consistent with that pattern  
A=1, B=1, C=2 gives  
3^1+5^1+7^2 = 3+5+49 = 57, not a square.

With C even the smallest term 7^C is already 49, so the whole sum is ≥57.  
Squares lying between 57 and the next value we will reach are 64 and 81.

Step 5.   Show 64 is impossible  
If the sum were 64 we would need  
3^A+5^B = 64−49 = 15.  
With A odd (1,3,5,…) and B odd (1,3,5,…) the only small possibilities are  

A=1 ⇒ 3^1=3 ⇒ 5^B=12 (impossible)  
A=3 ⇒ 3^3=27>15.  

So 64 cannot be attained.

Step 6.   Check the next candidate, 81  
Choose A=3, B=1, C=2 (all with correct parities):  
3^3 + 5^1 + 7^2 = 27 + 5 + 49 = 81 = 9^2, a perfect square.

Step 7.   Anything larger than these exponents exceeds 81  
• Increasing A from 3 to 5 adds at least 216,  
• Increasing B from 1 to 3 adds 120,  
• Increasing C from 2 to 4 adds 2352;  
so every other admissible triple gives a value >81.

Therefore 81 is not only attainable but is the smallest possible square.

92,"Question: You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?
(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)

(2): m > l > x > s
(3): 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650, divided by 25 gives...
(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186
(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186
Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.
The solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10. This is a total of 35 slushes, and therefore 35 coupons given out. 35 * $0.75 = $26.25 in losses from the coupons. $46.50 - $26.25 = $20.25 net profit when accounting for the coupons. You made your goal!",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let

Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.

 Hint: Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the brothers’ present ages (in whole years) be  

  A  = Albert’s age  
  B  = Bill’s age  
  C  = Charles’ age  

and let S(n) denote “the sum of the digits of n”.

The three sentences in Jerry’s letter translate to

(1) A = S(B) + S(C)  
(2) B – 1 = S(A – 1) + S(C – 1)  
(3) C + 6 = S(A + 6) + S(B + 6) 。

----------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Work modulo 9.
----------------------------------------------------
For every non–negative integer n we have n ≡ S(n) (mod 9).  
Reduce (1)–(3) modulo 9:

(1′) A ≡ B + C (mod 9)  
(2′) B – 1 ≡ (A – 1) + (C – 1)  (mod 9) ⇒ B ≡ A + C – 1 (mod 9)  
(3′) C + 6 ≡ (A + 6) + (B + 6) (mod 9) ⇒ C ≡ A + B + 6 (mod 9).

Solve this system:

From (1′): A ≡ B + C.  
Insert this in (2′): B ≡ (B + C) + C – 1 ⇒ 2C ≡ 1 (mod 9) ⇒ C ≡ 5 (mod 9).

Then (1′) gives A ≡ B + 5, and (3′) with C ≡ 5 gives  
5 ≡ A + B + 6 ⇒ A + B ≡ 8 (mod 9).

Now   
  A ≡ B + 5, A + B ≡ 8 ⇒ 2B + 5 ≡ 8 ⇒ 2B ≡ 3 ⇒ B ≡ 6 (mod 9),

and hence A ≡ 2 (mod 9).

So
  A ≡ 2, B ≡ 6, C ≡ 5 (mod 9).  (4)

----------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  A numerical bound for A.
----------------------------------------------------
Because a two–digit number never has digit–sum larger than 18, we have
 S(B) ≤ 18 and S(C) ≤ 18,  
so (1) gives A ≤ 36.  With (4) this leaves

 A = 2, 11, 20, 29.             (5)

----------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Use the exact equations.
----------------------------------------------------
(i)  A = 2 does not work: then S(B)+S(C)=2 forces both S(B) and S(C) ≤ 2, contradicting B ≡6, C ≡5 (mod 9).

(ii)  A = 11.  
 Equation (1) gives S(B)+S(C)=11.  
 But S(B)=6 (the digit–sum of every number ≡6 mod 9), so S(C)=5.

 Numbers with digit–sum 5 and ≡5 mod 9 are 5, 14, 23, 32,… .
 Try them in (2):

 A–1 = 10 (digit–sum 1).  

 • C = 5 ⇒ C–1 = 4 (digit–sum 4); then B–1 = 1+4 = 5 ⇒ B = 6.  
  Distinct ages 11, 6, 5 satisfy (2).

  Check (3): six years later the ages are 17, 12, 11 and  
  S(17)+S(12)=8+3=11 = C+6. Perfect.

 • C = 14 (or 23, 32, …) makes C+6 far larger than S(A+6)+S(B+6); (3) fails.

 Hence A=11, B=6, C=5 satisfy every requirement.

(iii)  A = 20 or 29.  
 Then S(B)=6 forces S(C)=14 or 23, putting C well above 50.  
 But with such a large C, equation (3) cannot hold because the right–hand side
 S(A+6)+S(B+6) is at most 9+9 = 18, whereas C+6 ≥ 56.  
 So these A are impossible.

----------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Conclusion.
----------------------------------------------------
The only set of distinct whole ages fulfilling all three conditions is  

 Albert A = 11,  
 Bill  B = 6,  
 Charles C = 5.

 Hint: A wrongheaded guess would say 123, because 123 * 2 = 321 + 1.  The title hints you can easily go on to find for a ten-digit number that otherwise has same characteristics.","A wrongheaded guess would say 123, because 123 * 2 = 321 + 1.  The title hints you can easily go on to find for a ten-digit number that otherwise has same characteristics.","Answer-
397.
397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.
102?  Is 204 = 201 + 1?  No.
103?  Is 206 = 301 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds even.]
396?  Is 792 = 693 + 1?  No.  [Wrong hundreds again.]
The answer given is the only one that passes.
As for extra points, an infinite number of 9's can be added between the 3 and the 7 without spoiling the major characteristics.

96,"Question: An iterative equation is one where an initial value is put into the equation to obtain a result, which is in turn put back into the equation as an input and the process is repeated for either a fixed number of times or until a final value is achieved (where you get the same number out as you put in).
For example, if you start with the iterative equation,

A² = 2.                                              (1)

Step 1 – make the left–hand side a product that contains the factor (A + 1).  
Add A to both sides of (1):

A² + A = A + 2.                                      (2)

Step 2 – factor the left–hand side of (2):

A(A + 1) = A + 2.                                    (3)

Step 3 – isolate A by dividing both sides of (3) by (A + 1); this uses only
division:

A = (A + 2)/(A + 1).                                 (4)

Equation (4) is identical to (1) (multiply it out to check), but it is now
written so that the right–hand side involves only addition and division.
Hence it can be turned into an iteration:

Define A₀  (any starting value except −1, which would make the denominator 0),

A_{n+1} = (A_n + 2) / (A_n + 1).                     (5)

Convergence

Let L be the limit of the sequence {A_n}.  
If the limit exists, taking limits on both sides of (5) gives

L = (L + 2)/(L + 1)  ⇒  L(L + 1) = L + 2  ⇒  L² = 2.

Thus the only possible limits are ±√2.  
For every positive start (and for every negative start except −1) one has
|g′(A)| < 1 near √2, where g(A) = (A + 2)/(A + 1); hence the iteration
converges to the positive root √2.

Illustration (start with A₀ = 0)

A₁ = 2/1          = 2.000000  
A₂ = 4/3          = 1.333333  
A₃ =  (1.333333+2)/(1.333333+1) = 3.333333/2.333333 = 1.428571  
A₄ ≈ 1.411765  
A₅ ≈ 1.414634  (error 0.00042, i.e. 0.03 %)

After only five repetitions it is already correct to three decimal places.

a digits equal to 3 and b digits equal to 7 (a, b ≥ 0, a + b ≥ 1).

1.  Condition on the digital sum  
   The digital sum is S = 3a + 7b.  
   •  For S to be divisible by 3: 3a + 7b ≡ b (mod 3) ⇒ b ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
   •  For S to be divisible by 7: 3a + 7b ≡ 3a (mod 7) ⇒ a ≡ 0 (mod 7).  

   Hence a is a multiple of 7 and b is a multiple of 3.  
   The smallest positive multiples are a = 0 or 7 and b = 0 or 3.  
   Because S must be divisible by both 3 and 7, the smallest positive value of S is 21.  
   Therefore S = 21.

2.  Achieving S = 21 with the fewest digits  
   Each digit is either 3 or 7.  
   •  Using only 3’s: 21/3 = 7 digits would be needed (number 333 3333).  
   •  Using only 7’s: 21/7 = 3 digits suffice (number 777).  
   Three digits clearly give the smaller number of digits, so the minimal candidate length is 3, and with sum 21 that candidate must be 777.

3.  Divisibility of 777  
   •  777 ÷ 3 = 259 ⇒ divisible by 3.  
   •  777 ÷ 7 = 111 ⇒ divisible by 7.  

   Thus 777 is divisible by both 3 and 7 (hence by 21).

4.  Minimality of 777  
   Any number with fewer than 3 digits has digital sum at most 7+7 = 14 < 21, so it cannot satisfy condition (2).  
   Any 3-digit number smaller than 777 contains at least one digit 3, so its digital sum is less than 21 and again fails condition (2).  
   Therefore no natural number smaller than 777 can meet all three conditions.

Consequently, the smallest natural number whose digits are only 3’s and 7’s and which satisfies all the stated conditions is

98,"Question: Suppose you're in a hallway lined with 100 closed lockers.
You begin by opening every locker. Then you close every second locker. Then you go to every third locker and open it (if it's closed) or close it (if it's open).  Let's call this action toggling a locker. Continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n.  After 100 passes, where you toggle only locker #100, how many lockers are open?
 Hint: Think about this can be related to the number of factors of each number",Think about this can be related to the number of factors of each number,"Answer: 10 lockers are left open:
Lockers #1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.
Each of these numbers are perfect squares. This problem is based on the factors of the locker number.
Each locker is toggled by each factor; for example, locker #40 is toggled on pass number 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40.  That's eight toggles: open-closed-open-closed-open-closed-open-closed.
The only way a locker could be left open is if it is toggled an odd number of times. The only numbers with an odd number of factors are the perfect
squares. Thus, the perfect squares are left open.
For example, locker #25 is toggled on pass number 1, 5, and 25 (three toggles): open-closed-open.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"A locker changes state (is “toggled”) once for every positive divisor its number has.  
• If the locker number k has an even number of divisors, it is toggled an even number of times and ends closed.  
• If k has an odd number of divisors, it is toggled an odd number of times and ends open.

A positive integer has an odd number of divisors exactly when it is a perfect square (because its divisors can be paired as d and k ⁄ d, except when d = k ⁄ d, which happens only for squares).

Among the numbers 1 through 100 the perfect squares are  
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.  
There are 10 of them.

The fifteenth time, he flips 1 of the 2 coins that is heads up, and 92 of the coins that are tails up, leaving 93 coins heads up.
The sixteenth and last time he can get all of them tails up.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let H denote the number of heads that are showing.

1  Parity of H after each move  
   In every move Tom flips 93 coins, an odd number.  
   Therefore H changes by “odd – an even number’’ and is itself
   changed by an odd amount.  
   Hence the parity of H (even / odd) is reversed at every move.
   We start with H = 100 (even) and want to finish with H = 0 (even),
   so the total number k of moves must be even.

2  How often can a coin be left untouched?  
   During one move exactly 7 coins are not flipped.
   For coin i let ℓi be the number of moves in which that coin is
   not flipped.  In the other k − ℓi moves it is flipped.

   A coin begins head-up and must end tail-up, so it has to be flipped
   an odd number of times:

        k − ℓi  ≡  1 (mod 2)   ⇒   ℓi  ≡  k − 1  (mod 2).

   Because k is even, k − 1 is odd, hence every ℓi is odd.  
   In particular ℓi ≥ 1 for every one of the 100 coins.

3  A lower bound for k  
   The total number of “untouched appearances’’ over all coins equals
        ℓ1 + ℓ2 + … + ℓ100  =  7k,
   because each of the k moves contributes 7 such appearances.

   Since every ℓi ≥ 1, we must have 7k ≥ 100, i.e. k ≥ 15.
   Combined with the fact that k must be even, we get

        k  ≥  16.

4  Showing that 16 moves really are enough  
   We now exhibit 16 moves that accomplish the task.

   Label the coins 1,…,100.  Declare coins 95,…,100 to be special;
   each of them will be among the 7 untouched coins in three moves.
   The remaining 94 coins will be untouched exactly once.
   Thus every coin is left untouched an odd number (1 or 3) of times,
   and the total number of untouched appearances is

        94·1 + 6·3 = 94 + 18 = 112 = 16·7,

   exactly what 16 moves supply.

   Write the 16 sets of 7 coins that are NOT flipped in each move
   as follows (each row is one move).

        1)  95 100  1  2  3  4  5
        2)  95   6  7  8  9 10 11

       16) 100  89 90 91 92 93 94

   • Every row contains 7 distinct coins, so each describes a legal move.  
   • Coins 95–100 (the special six) each appear in exactly three rows;  
     the other 94 coins each appear in exactly one row.  
   • Consequently every coin is left untouched an odd number of times,
     hence is flipped an odd number of times, and ends tail-up.

   Thus 16 moves suffice.

5  Minimality  
   From Section 3 we know k cannot be smaller than 16, and Section 4
   shows k = 16 is attainable.

Therefore the least number of required moves is 16.

What is that number?
 Hint: -1 mod LCM(2, 3, 4, ..., 8, 9)","-1 mod LCM(2, 3, 4, ..., 8, 9)","-1 mod LCM(2, 3, 4, ..., 8, 9) = 2519",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let N be the required number (N < 3000).

1. “Leaves a remainder one less than the divisor’’ means  
   N ≡ −1 (mod d) for every divisor d = 2,3,4,…,9.  
   Equivalently, N + 1 is divisible by every d ∈ {2,…,9}.

2. Hence N + 1 is a common multiple of 2,3,…,9.  
   We need the least common multiple of these integers:

   • Highest power of 2 appearing: 2³ = 8  
   • Highest power of 3 appearing: 3² = 9  
   • Prime 5 appears once: 5  
   • Prime 7 appears once: 7  

   LCM(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) = 2³ · 3² · 5 · 7  
                         = 8 · 9 · 5 · 7  
                         = 72 · 35  
                         = 2520.

   Thus N + 1 must be a multiple of 2520:
   N = 2520k − 1   for some positive integer k.

3. Impose the upper bound N < 3000:

   k = 1  ⇒  N = 2520 − 1 = 2519 (acceptable)  
   k = 2  ⇒  N = 5040 − 1 = 5039 (> 3000, not allowed).

   Therefore the only candidate below 3000 is N = 2519.

4. Quick verification:

   2519 mod 2 = 1  
   2519 mod 3 = 2  
   2519 mod 4 = 3  
   2519 mod 5 = 4  
   2519 mod 6 = 5  
   2519 mod 7 = 6  
   2519 mod 8 = 7  
   2519 mod 9 = 8.

   All remainders are indeed one less than their respective divisors.

   25(d+1) ≤ N < 25(d+2).                                     (2)

  For the two intervals (1) and (2) to overlap we must have  

  max(100d/3 , 25(d+1)) < min(100(d+1)/3 , 25(d+2)).

  For d ≥ 3 the left–hand term is 100d/3 and the right–hand term is 25d+50,  
  so we need  

  100d/3 < 25d + 50  ⇒ 25d < 150  ⇒ d < 6.

  Thus the only possible values of d are 3,4,5.

  • d = 3 gives 100 ≤ N ≤ 124  
  • d = 4 gives 134 ≤ N ≤ 149  
  • d = 5 gives 167 ≤ N ≤ 174

  For d = 6 or more there is no overlap, hence no further N with Δ(N)=1.

  Consequently the largest initial population that still produces Δ(N)=1 is 174.

2.  Determine when the population first attains 174.

    Population at end of Year 25 is 125.

  (ii) N = 125 … 133  
   Δ = 2 each year (because B = 5, D = 3).  
   Five such years (Years 26–30) raise the population to 135.

  (iii) N = 135 … 149  (15 years) Δ = 1 each year  
   Population at end of Year 45 is 150.

  (iv) N = 150 … 166  
   Δ = 2 each year (B = 6, D = 4).  
   Nine such years (Years 46–54) raise the population to 168.

  (v)  N = 168 … 174  (7 years) Δ = 1 each year

  The seventh and last year in this block is Year 61, which starts with
  N = 174 and ends with N = 175.

3.  After that point:  
  Year 62 starts with N = 175, for which B = 7, D = 5, so Δ = 2; the

        27² = 729  → 2,7,9  
        28² = 784  → 4,7,8  
        29² = 841  → 1,4,8  
        30² = 900  → 0,0,9  
        31² = 961  → 1,6,9  

    Thus the only ages whose squares share the same three digits are  
        {12, 21}, {13, 14, 31}, {16, 25}.  

2.  Cal next states that “the square of the sum of our ages then” is a four–digit number whose first two digits are his age then (C) and whose last two digits are Al’s age now.

    For this to be a four–digit number we need G + C ≥ 32 (since 31² = 961, 32² = 1024) and, because each age is at most 31, we also have G + C ≤ 62.

    Check every ordered pair from the three sets above:

        a)  G = 12, C = 21 → (G+C)² = 33² = 1089 (starts with 10, not 21)  
        b)  G = 21, C = 12 → 33² = 1089 (starts with 10, not 12)

        c)  Any ordering of {13,14,31} giving sums 27, 44 or 45  
            27² =  729  (3-digit, wrong size)  
            44² = 1936  (starts with 19)  
            45² = 2025  (starts with 20)

        d)  G = 16, C = 25 → 41² = 1681 (starts with 16, should start with 25)  
        e)  G = 25, C = 16 → 41² = 1681

            Here 41² really is 1681, whose first two digits 16 equal Cal’s age then (C).  
            The last two digits, 81, must therefore be Al Gebra’s present age.

        No other pair satisfies Cal’s statement.

3.  Verify everything is consistent:

        • Squares at the time: 16² = 256 and 25² = 625 contain the same digits.  
        • Sum at the time: 25 + 16 = 41 and 41² = 1681 = 16 | 81.  
        • Time elapsed since they met: 81 – 25 = 56 years, so Cal is now 16 + 56 = 72 – a perfectly reasonable present age for two “aging” professors.

All conditions are satisfied only when Al was 25 and Cal was 16 at their meeting, making Al Gebra 81 years old today.

104,"Question: Kurt & Rod were hanging around the window at school munching the last of their Rnkfurers hoard.  They spotted their neighbor lounging in the enclosed courtyard, looking hungry.
""Patty O'Furniture!  Good to see you!  Want a Rnkfurter?""
""A what?""
Kurt handed her the last he had.  She bit in, and her face lit up like a newly-coined metaphor.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""Rod and I were about to go order some more.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""  Patty's blank look bade him explain.  ""In our first batch, we got a total of 25 -- 20 for me, and 5 for Rod.  I had 20, and he had 20% of the total.""
""And you think you can do that for three people?  You get my percentage, and I get Rod's?  I don't think we can do it.""
Rod had been thinking about it, and rattled off three numbers to her.
""Those aren't right.  The last one isn't the right percentage; there's an added fraction.""
""So?  My mom says they're the same on her old phonograph speeds.""
Patty looked at Kurt, each waiting for the other to give an opinion.  Finally, she gestured at the empty wrapper in his hand.
""I'll round off a little for a week's supply of these.  Let's go!""
Since Rnkfurters come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, they had to leave 10 with the storekeeper to make the numbers work, but they got their munchies.
How many did each student get this time?
 Hint: The old phonograph speeds were typically 16, 33-1/3, 45, and 78 RPM.","The old phonograph speeds were typically 16, 33-1/3, 45, and 78 RPM.","27 for Kurt, 30 for Patty, and 33 for Rod.
That's 30% for Kurt and 33-1/3% for Patty.
Method:
Let K, P, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, K+P+R.
Now, since Kurt's percentage equals Patty's quantity, we get
100*K/T = P.
Similarly,
100*P/T = R plus a fraction.  Now, look at the common factor, 100/T.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
K*F = P and P*F = R (plus a fraction),
and K*F^2 = R (plus a fraction).
The clue about the phonograph leaves us looking for a triple with 33 Rnkfurters for Rod, with Patty getting 33-1/3% (one-third) of the total.
P = T/3
P = (K+P+33)/3 -- remember, R=33
Now, combine this with 100*K/T = P, and a bit of algebra gives us the required answer.

There is a tiger on the shore of the lake that can run four times as fast you can swim, however the tiger cannot swim. The tiger is hungry and always attempts to keep the distance between the two of you at a minimum. How can you safely swim to shore?
Assume that as long as you can get to the shore before the tiger gets to you (even if it is only a split-second before), you will be safe.
 Hint: Use the factor of 4 to your advantage",Use the factor of 4 to your advantage,"Until you are more than 1/4 of the radius away from the rock you can swim fast enough so that you can keep the tiger the furthest distance possible from you. Regardless of which direction the tiger moves around the circle, you swim the other way, always keeping the rock between you and the tiger.  While you are doing this you will be able to move outward, since you will have some energy to spare.
Before long you will be 1/4 of the radius away from the center and the tiger will be 180 degrees away. At this point swim straight to the point on the shore furthest from the tiger. You will be able to get there in 3/4 units of time, while it will take the tiger pi/4 =~ 0.7854 units of time.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let your swimming speed be v.  
The tiger, which can only run round the rim of the lake, has speed 4v.  
The lake has radius 1.

1.  Make the tiger take the opposite side of the lake  
   • While you are very near the centre you can swim round it in a very small circle.  
   • When you are at distance r from the centre your angular speed is v/r, whereas the tiger’s angular speed on the shore is 4v.  
   • As long as r < ¼ we have v/r > 4v, so you can turn faster than the tiger and force the angular separation to grow.  
   • Begin at the centre, spiral outwards but keep r < ¼ until the tiger is almost diametrically opposite you (angle difference π).

2.  Freeze the angular separation while you reach radius ¼  
   • Now let r increase to exactly ¼ while continuing the circular motion.  
   • At r = ¼ your angular speed is v/(¼) = 4v, exactly the tiger’s.  
     Hence the tiger remains diametrically opposite you while you complete this spiral; when you reach r = ¼ the angular separation is still π.

3.  The dash to the bank  
   • From radius ¼ head straight for the shore along the radius through your own position.  
   • Distance you must swim: 1 – ¼ = ¾.  
     Time you need: (¾)/v = ¾ v⁻¹.  
   • While you are doing that the tiger has to run half the circumference, i.e. distance π·1/2 = π.  
     Time the tiger needs: π/(4v) = (π/4) v⁻¹.

4.  Compare the times  
        ¾ v⁻¹  <  (π/4) v⁻¹ because ¾ = 0.75 < π/4 ≈ 0.785  
   Therefore you step onto the shore about (π – 3)/4 ≈ 0.035 v⁻¹ units of time before the tiger arrives.

Since you reach land first, the tiger cannot catch you.

Final answer: Swim in a small circle to force the tiger to the opposite side, spiral out to a circle of radius ¼ while keeping him opposite, then swim straight to shore; you arrive before the tiger can run halfway round the lake, so you are safe.",True

1.  In 5796 the digits 5, 7, 9 and 6 are already used.  
    Hence the remaining digits to be used—exactly once each—by the two factors must be {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}.

    • together exhaust that set without repetition.

    The one pair that satisfies every requirement is

            42 × 138 = 5796.

    Indeed,

 Hint: Start from the last digits.",Start from the last digits.,"First, there are ten different letters in this equation: E, F, I, N, O, R, S, T, X, Y. Therefore, every digit from 0 to 9 is used.
Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.

Work column by column, right to left.

1.  Units column  

   Y + N + N = Y  (mod 10)

   Hence 2N ≡ 0 (mod 10).  
   Since every letter is a different digit (0–9), the only possibilities are  
   N = 0  (giving carry c₁ = 0)  or  N = 5  (giving carry c₁ = 1).

2.  Tens column  

   T + E + E + c₁ = T  (mod 10)  
   → 2E + c₁ ≡ 0 (mod 10).

   • If N = 5 (so c₁ = 1) then 2E + 1 must be 10 or 20, impossible because 2E ≤ 18.  
   • Therefore N = 0, c₁ = 0 and 2E = 10, so E = 5.  
     This produces a carry c₂ = 1 into the hundreds column.

   So far we have  N = 0, E = 5.

3.  Hundreds column  

   R + T + T + c₂ = X  (mod 10) with c₂ = 1  
   → R + 2T + 1 = X + 10 c₃ ,  where c₃ is the carry into the thousands column.

   The left–hand sum R + 2T + 1 cannot exceed 27, so c₃ ∈ {0,1,2}.

   • If c₃ = 0 then R + 2T ≤ 8, far too small.  
   • If c₃ = 1 then we will soon get S = F (not allowed).  
   • Hence c₃ must be 2.

   Thus R + 2T + 1 = X + 20, i.e.

        X = R + 2T – 19   with   19 ≤ R + 2T ≤ 27.           (★)

4.  Thousands column (using c₃ = 2)  

   O + 2 = I + 10 c₄.

   • If c₄ = 0 then I = O + 2, and the next column would give S = F (forbidden).  
   • Therefore c₄ = 1, which forces O = I + 8.

   The only pair of different digits satisfying O = I + 8 is I = 1, O = 9.

   We now have  I = 1,  O = 9 and the carry into the ten-thousands column c₄ = 1.

5.  Ten-thousands column  

   F + c₄ = S  ⇒ S = F + 1.

   Because each digit is different and O = 9 is already used, F cannot be 8 (which would make S = 9).  
   Hence F ∈ {2,3,4,5,6,7} with S = F + 1.

6.  Satisfying (★) with distinct digits  

   Try values of T (remember T ≠ 0,5,9 and must be different from other chosen digits).

   • T = 8 gives 2T = 16.  
     Then (★) requires R + 16 between 19 and 27, i.e. R ∈ {3,4,6,7}.  
     Check each:

        – R = 3  ⇒ X = 0  (already N)      impossible  
        – R = 4  ⇒ X = 1  (already I)      impossible  
        – R = 6  ⇒ X = 3  
        – R = 7  ⇒ X = 4

     Choose R = 7, X = 4 (all digits still distinct).

   Digits used so far: 0,1,4,5,7,8,9.

   Remaining digits: 2,3,6.  
   Pick F = 2 → S = 3, both unused and distinct.  

7.  The last unused digit is 6, so Y = 6.

All ten letters now have different digits:

   F = 2,  O = 9,  R = 7,  T = 8,  Y = 6,
   T = 8,  E = 5,  N = 0,
   S = 3,  I = 1,  X = 4.

Then, toggle with these two things and see if the sum of squares is a square. The ages are 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23 and 26. The man's age is 48.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

youngest child’s age = a (years)  
interval between the births = d (years) (d > 0)  

Then the nine children are a, a+d, a+2d, … , a+8d.

1.  Form the “sum–of–squares” equation  

  ∑_{i=0}^8 (a + i d)^2   =   Father’s age^2 = F^2.

   ∑_{i=0}^8 (a + i d)^2  
   = 9a^2 + 2ad(0+1+…+8) + d^2(0^2+1^2+…+8^2)  
   = 9a^2 + 72ad + 204d^2.

   Hence                                              (1) F² = 9a² + 72ad + 204d².

2.  Rewrite (1) by completing the square:

        9a² + 72ad = 9(a² + 8ad)  
                   = 9[(a + 4d)² – 16d²].

   Therefore

        F² = 9(a + 4d)² – 144d² + 204d²
            = 9(a + 4d)² + 60d².

   Put  X = F – 3(a + 4d), Y = F + 3(a + 4d).  
   Then

        XY = 60d²,  Y – X = 6(a + 4d).                 (2)

   X and Y are positive even integers.  Write X = 2s, Y = 2t; then

        st = 15d²,  t – s = 3(a + 4d),  F = s + t.    (3)

3.  Solve (3) in positive integers.

   Because st = 15d², every prime divisor of s occurs in t with the same power, except possibly the 3 and 5 coming from 15.

   Test successive small values of d (the hint says “the youngest children are very young”, so d itself cannot be large).

   • d = 1, 2 give no solutions (t – s not divisible by 3).  
   • d = 3:  st = 15·3² = 135.  The factor-pair s = 3, t = 45 gives  
             t – s = 42 ⇒ a + 4d = 14 ⇒ a = 2.  
             Then F = s + t = 48.

             Ages: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26.

             Check: 2² + 5² + … + 26² = 2304 = 48² ✔.

   • d ≥ 4 either makes a negative or very large (a ≫ 10, contradicting “very young”), or gives a father whose age is biologically absurd (96, 144, …).  Hence no acceptable solutions with d ≥ 4.

111,"Question: Mad Ade was visiting his friend, computer tycoon and Olympic Kebab hurling champion, Mike Rohsopht.
He was there on Sunday and when the radio gave the time at the hour, Mad Ade noticed that the Madadian antique clock, designed by Madadian clock maker Arthur Minit (teaser #4891) was exactly 3 minutes slow.
""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Mike assured Mad Ade that his treasured Arthur Minit clock had not been adjusted nor fixed since his last visit.
What day of the week was Mad Ade's second visit?
 Hint: It must lose some multiple of 12 hours in total",It must lose some multiple of 12 hours in total,"The answer is 17 days and 3 hours later, which would have been a Wednesday.
This is the only other time in the same month when the two would agree at all.
In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.
Since the clock was not adjusted since the last visit, it's also possible that the radio time shifted by one hour due to a change to or from summer daylight saving time.  However, it turns out that the only additional possibilities that need to be considered are those of 4 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 12 hours 57 minutes, and 29 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 3 days 10 hours 57 minutes.  Without even considering the rules for when in the month the
clock is changed, these possible solutions are ruled out because we know that both visits were in the evening (""Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht"") and they involve times in a different part of the day.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the moment of Mad Ade’s first visit be “time 0”.  
At that instant the antique clock is 3 minutes slow.

1.  Rate at which the clock loses time  
   The clock loses 7 minutes every (real) hour, i.e.  
   loss rate = 7 minutes / 60 minutes = 7⁄60 minute per real minute.

2.  Total lag after Δt real minutes  
   Extra loss = (7⁄60) Δt minutes.  
   Including the initial 3 minutes, the total lag is  

                     L = 3 minutes + (7⁄60) Δt minutes.

3.  When will the clock read the correct time again?  
   On a 12-hour dial, being 12 h (= 720 min), 24 h, 36 h, … behind is indistinguishable from being correct.  
   Hence we need  

                L = 720k minutes  (k = 1, 2, 3, …).

   Thus  

            3 + (7⁄60) Δt = 720k   
            Δt = (720k – 3)·(60⁄7) minutes
            Δt = (720k – 3)/7 hours.                (★)

4.  The second observation is made “at the hour”, so Δt must be an integer number of hours.

   Write 720 ≡ 6 (mod 7).  
   Then (720k – 3)/7 is integral ⇔ 6k – 3 ≡ 0 (mod 7)  
   ⇔ 6k ≡ 3 (mod 7) ⇔ k ≡ 4 (mod 7).

5.  Smallest positive k satisfying this is k = 4 (the next possibilities, k = 11, 18, …, give waits of 47 days, 77 days, … which are not “later that same month”).

6.  Compute the elapsed time for k = 4 using (★):

            Δt = (720·4 – 3)/7 = 2880 – 3
                 ———————— = 411 hours  
                            7

   411 h = 17 days + 3 hours.

7.  Day of the week  
   Mad Ade’s first visit was on Sunday.  
   Seventeen days later is Wednesday (because 14 days bring us to the next Sunday, plus 3 days gives Wednesday).  
   The extra 3 hours merely places the meeting “rather late in the evening” on that Wednesday and does not change the weekday.

Therefore Mad Ade’s second visit must have been on

Because the flow from a valve is proportional to the angle it is opened, the mixed temperature is the weighted average

 Mixed temperature = (angle × temperature from each valve)/(total angle opened).

Hot valve: 360° at 105 °F  
Cold valve: x° at 45 °F

Set the average equal to the desired 98.6 °F:

(360·105 + x·45) / (360 + x) = 98.6.

Solve for x.

1. 360·105 = 37 800.

2. Multiply both sides by (360 + x):
   98.6(360 + x) = 37 800 + 45x.

3. Expand and collect x–terms:
   35 496 + 98.6x = 37 800 + 45x

An integer is

• abundant if the sum of its proper divisors exceeds the number, and  
• weird if it is abundant but no subset of its proper divisors adds up exactly to the number.

We must find the smallest weird number, the hint telling us it lies between 50 and 100.

Step 1 – List the abundant numbers below 100  
For n < 100 the well–known abundant numbers are  

12, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 66, 70, 72, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 96.

Step 2 – Show every abundant number below 70 is NOT weird  
For each of the abundant numbers below 70 one easily finds a subset of proper divisors that reproduces the number:

12 = 1+2+3+6  
18 = 9+6+3  
20 = 10+5+4+1  
24 = 12+8+4  
30 = 15+10+5  
36 = 18+12+6  
40 = 20+10+8+2  
42 = 21+14+7  
48 = 24+16+8  
54 = 27+18+9  
56 = 28+14+8+4+2  
60 = 30+20+10  
66 = 33+22+11

Hence none of these numbers is weird.

Step 3 – Examine 70  
Proper divisors of 70:  
1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35.

a) Abundance.  
Sum = 1+2+5+7+10+14+35 = 74 > 70, so 70 is abundant.

b) Semiperfectness.  
Suppose a subset of the above divisors totals 70.  Since the whole set sums to 74, the complement of that subset would have to sum to 4.  Therefore a subset of the same multiset must equal 4.

Check every way to form 4 from the divisors (each used at most once):

1  (=1)   not 4  
2  (=2)   not 4  
5  (>4)  
7,10,14,35  (all >4)  
1+2 = 3  
1+5 (>4) ; 2+5 (>4) ; 1+2+5 (>4)  
No other combinations are possible without already exceeding 4.

Hence no subset totals 4, and consequently no subset totals 70.  Thus 70 is not semiperfect.

Step 4 – Conclusion  
All abundant numbers smaller than 70 are semiperfect, while 70 is abundant and not semiperfect.  Therefore the smallest weird number is 70.

With every cut you should cut through every previous cut. As long as you keep doing this you will always be able to do so again with your next cut. The number of additional pieces formed on cut x will always be x. The sum of all integers from 1 to n is n*(n+1)/2. So the sum of additional pieces cut will be n*(n+1)/2.
Finally add 1 because we start with 1 piece: n*(n+1)/2 + 1.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let P(n) denote the greatest possible number of pieces into which a circular pizza can be divided by n straight cuts.

Step 1.  Set–up of the “general–position’’ cuts  
To maximise the number of pieces we impose the following natural conditions on the cuts.
1. No two cuts coincide (otherwise we have fewer than n distinct cuts).  
2. No two cuts are parallel inside the pizza, so every pair of cuts meets.  
3. No three cuts meet in a single point inside the pizza, so every intersection point is formed by exactly two cuts.

Under these conditions every new cut meets each earlier cut in a single interior point and meets none of its intersection points with the others.

Step 2.  How many new pieces does one extra cut create?  
Suppose that after j cuts we already have P(j) pieces.  
Introduce the (j + 1)-st cut.

• Because of the conditions above, this new cut meets each of the previous j cuts in a distinct interior point, so it is divided into j + 1 separate segments.  
• Each of those segments lies entirely inside a single previously existing region; passing the segment through that region splits it into two, thereby adding exactly one new piece.  
Hence the (j + 1)-st cut creates j + 1 new pieces.

Therefore the numbers {P(n)} satisfy the recurrence
  P(0) = 1  (the whole pizza is one piece before any cuts),  
  P(j + 1) = P(j) + (j + 1) for j = 0,1,2,…

Step 4.  Conclusion  
Hence the maximum possible number of pieces obtainable with n straight cuts is

n = 0 → 1 piece,
n = 1 → 2 pieces,

Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.
Next we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x. If we add 10x on both sides, we get 22x=60, and dividing 22 from both sides yields x=60/22=30/11.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Draw a cross-section through the common axis of the cone and the cylinder.  
This gives two similar right triangles:

• the large triangle formed by the cone  
 base = 5, height = 12

• the smaller triangle whose hypotenuse is a generator of the cone and whose base is the radius r of the cylinder; its height is the cylinder’s top level above the cone’s base, which is the cylinder’s height h.

Because the bottom bases coincide, the small triangle’s vertex on the axis is h units above the cone’s base, and the small triangle is similar to the large one.

Similarity ratio  
r / 5 = (12 – h) / 12.  (1)

The problem states that the cylinder’s diameter equals its height, so  
h = 2r.  (2)

Insert (2) into (1):

r / 5 = (12 – 2r) / 12  
⇒ 12r = 5(12 – 2r)  
⇒ 12r = 60 – 10r  
⇒ 22r = 60  
⇒ r = 60 / 22 = 30 / 11.

Hence the radius of the largest such cylinder is 30/11 units.

23 + 07 = 30",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the four–digit year be represented by its digits  
A B C D  (A is the thousands digit, B the hundreds, C the tens, D the units).

The property stated is  

(First two digits) + (last two digits) = (middle two digits)  
(10A + B) + (10C + D) = 10B + C.                                (1)

1.  Working with individual digits  
   Subtracting the right side from the left gives  
   10A + B + 10C + D − 10B − C = 0  
   ⇒ 10A − 9B + 9C + D = 0.                                    (2)

2.  Interpreting equation (1) digit-by-digit  
   Add the two-digit numbers in the usual way:

          A  B
       +     C  D
       ------------
            B  C

   •  Units column: B + D gives a units digit C and produces a carry k (0 or 1).  
      Thus B + D = 10k + C.                                    (3)

   •  Tens column (including the carry k): A + C + k must equal B.  
      Hence B = A + C + k.                                     (4)

   The hint follows immediately: since k ≥ 0, equation (4) gives  
   B ≥ A + C. In fact, k cannot be 0: if k = 0, (4) would make B = A + C and
   substituting in (2) would force D = –A, impossible for a digit.  
   Therefore k = 1, and

          B = A + C + 1,                                       (5)
          D = 9 – A                                            (6)
          (obtained by inserting (5) and k = 1 into (3)).

3.  Listing the admissible years  
   For each thousands digit A (1 ≤ A ≤ 9):

   •  D is fixed by (6).  
   •  From (5) we need B ≤ 9, so C ≤ 8 – A.

   Thus all admissible years are

          A (A+C+1) C (9–A)   with   0 ≤ C ≤ 8 – A.

   For A = 1 (the 1900’s) this gives the sequence  
   1208, 1318, 1428, 1538, 1648, 1758, 1868, 1978.  
   The last of these is the given year 1978; there is no larger solution in the
   1900’s.

   Next take A = 2 (the 2000’s).  Then D = 7 and C can be 0 through 6:
     C = 0 → 2 3 0 7  (2307)  
     C = 1 → 2 4 1 7  (2417)  
     …  
     C = 6 → 2 9 6 7  (2967)

   The earliest of these and hence the first year after 1978 with the required
   property is 2307.

AB, CD, EF, and GH must be divisible by even divisors.  Therefore B, D, F, and H must be even numerals.  This means that A, C, E, G, and I are odd numerals.  DE must be divisible by 5, therefore E is 5.  EF must be divisible by 6, therefore EF is 54.  FG must be divisible by 7, therefore FG is 49.  GH must be divisible by 8, therefore GH is 96.  GH must be divisible by 9, therefore GH is 63.  The last five digits have now been determined to be 54963.  To be divisible by 4, CD must end in 2.  This makes B equal 8.  The digits are now ?8?254963.  The remaining digits, 1 and 7, can be placed into either remaining location.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Because every two–digit block must satisfy a specific divisibility, start by fixing the digits that the conditions force.

1.  DE must end in 5, hence E = 5.
2.  EF must be a multiple of 6.  Besides being even, EF must be divisible by 3; thus  
  5 + F ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ F ≡ 1 (mod 3).  
  Among the even digits {2,4,6,8}, only F = 4 works, so F = 4.
3.  FG must be a multiple of 7.  With F = 4, FG = 40+G has to be divisible by 7.  
  40+G = 42 or 49 are the only possibilities ⇒ G = 2 or 9.  
  But the four even positions are B, D, F, H.  F is already 4, so the remaining evens {2,6,8} must be used for B, D, H.  If G were 2 we would lose one of those evens, so G = 9.
4.  GH must be a multiple of 8.  With G = 9, GH = 90+H.  The only two–digit multiple of 8 in the 90’s is 96, so H = 6.
5.  HI must be a multiple of 9.  10H+I = 60+I ≡ 0 (mod 9) ⇒ I ≡ 3 (mod 9), so I = 3.

So far we have
  A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  
  ?  ?  ?  ?  5  4  9  6  3

The unused digits are {1,2,7,8}.  Because B, D are the remaining even places, {2,8} must be {B,D}.

Case 1 B = 2, D = 8  
 BC divisible by 3 ⇒ 2+C ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ C = 1 or 7.  
 CD = 10C+8 must be divisible by 4, but neither 18 nor 78 is, so this case fails.

Case 2 B = 8, D = 2  
 BC divisible by 3 ⇒ 8+C ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ C = 1 or 7.  
 CD = 10C+2 must be divisible by 4; both 12 and 72 work.

• If C = 1, the remaining digit A = 7, giving 781254963.  
• If C = 7, the remaining digit A = 1, giving 187254963.

Both nine-digit numbers satisfy every required divisibility test, and no others exist.

Placing a 9 after N gives the six-digit number

T₁ = 242 (the large driving wheel)  
T₂ = 160, T₃ =  64, T₄ =  22 (the three wheels in mesh with it).

Put a chalk mark on the rim of every wheel and call the marked position “the starting position”.  
A wheel is back in its starting position exactly when it has turned an integral number of complete revolutions.

If the largest wheel (T₁) makes R revolutions, any wheel that meshes with it turns in the opposite sense and with speed inversely proportional to the numbers of teeth:

revolutions of wheel i = – (T₁ / Tᵢ) · R.                             (1)

For wheel i to be again at its starting mark, the quantity (T₁ / Tᵢ) R must be an integer; i.e.

T₁ R / Tᵢ ∈ ℤ  ⇔  R is a multiple of Tᵢ / gcd(T₁ , Tᵢ).        (2)

Compute these divisors.

• i = 2 : gcd(242,160) = 2 ⇒ required divisor = 160 / 2 = 80

Thus R must simultaneously be a multiple of 80, 32 and 1, i.e. a multiple of their least common multiple:

LCM(80, 32, 1) = LCM(2⁴·5 , 2⁵ , 1) = 2⁵·5 = 32·5 = 160.

Therefore the smallest positive R satisfying (2) for every wheel is 160.

Hence the largest cog has to turn 160 complete revolutions before every wheel is again in its original position.

    (since 2 × 5 = 10, which gives units 0 and a carry 1).

2.  Working leftward with the carry-1 now standing above the tens place:

    •  Let the tens digit of the numerator be x.  
      We need 2x + 1 to be one of the still-unused digits, and it must not introduce another carry unless that is possible later.  
      The choice x = 4 works perfectly:
        2 × 4 + 1 = 9, giving tens digit 9 in the denominator and no new carry.

3.  Proceeding to the hundreds place with carry 0:

    •  Choose 1 for the hundreds digit of the numerator.  
      2 × 1 = 2, so the hundreds digit of the denominator is 2 (still available).

4.  For the thousands place (still carry 0):

    •  Choose 2.  Then 2 × 2 = 4, which supplies the thousands digit 4 in the denominator.

5.  For the ten-thousands (left-most) place we must have no further carry, so 2 × (leading digit) ≤ 9.  
    The only unused digits that satisfy this are 3 and 2; 2 would give another 4, but both 4’s are already used, therefore we take 3.  
    Doubling gives 2 × 3 = 6 for the leading digit of the denominator.

Putting the five numerator digits together and likewise for the denominator we get  

 numerator = 3 2 1 4 5 = 32145  
 denominator = 6 4 2 9 0 = 64290.

A quick check shows 2 × 32145 = 64290, so

 32145 / 64290 = 1/2,

and every digit 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 9 is used exactly once.

Final answer: 32145/64290",True

Or square root of 200!
If you imagine you are facing a globe head on, you have the north pole at the top of the globe and the south pole at the bottom. Imagine a ""west pole"" and ""east pole"" to the left and right of the globe.
If you are at the north pole and turn left, you will walk through the ""west pole"" (right and you go through the ""east pole"")
If you walk on an axis from the north pole towards the south pole and make a left or right turn you will always walk through these imaginary east and west poles. So in the question 17.345 kilometers is irrelevant, only the turn.
(It also doesn't matter where you start on the planet, the distance at the end will still be the same.)
47.124 is approximately 3/4 of the circumference of this planet, which will leave you directly on the imaginary east pole. The distance is now the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle of side 10km.
Answer: root 200 or approximately 14km!
(If you got the distance as 15.7km - the distance you would have to walk back, then that's ok too!)",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"First convert each “straight-line” walk on the surface into a central angle (arc-length ÷ radius).

Radius R = 10 km.

1st leg:  
s₁ = 17.345 km  
θ₁ = s₁ / R = 17.345 / 10 = 1.7345 rad ≈ 99.4°.

2nd leg:  
s₂ = 47.124 km  
θ₂ = s₂ / R = 47.124 / 10 = 4.7124 rad ≈ 270.0°  
(note that 4.7124 rad = 3π/2 exactly to four decimals).

Interpret the walk as a spherical triangle:

• Vertex S = the ship (start).  
• Vertex P = point after first leg.  
• Vertex F = final point after second leg.

Sides (measured as central angles):

SP = θ₁ ≈ 1.7345 rad,  
PF = θ₂ = 3π/2 rad,  
SF = θ (unknown).

At P you “turn left”, i.e. make a 90° change of heading, so the interior angle at P is 90° (π/2 rad).  
Thus triangle SPF is a right spherical triangle with right angle at P.

For a right spherical triangle with right angle at P the spherical Pythagorean theorem gives

cos(SF) = cos(SP)·cos(PF).

Here cos(PF) = cos(3π/2) = 0, so

cos(SF) = cos(SP)·0 = 0  ⇒  SF = π/2 rad (90°).

Therefore the surface distance from the ship to the final point is

d = R · SF = 10 km · π/2 = 5π km ≈ 15.708 km.

Final answer: 5π km (about 15.708 km).",True

Lk  = length of the band (in inches) immediately after the k-th stretch,  
Pk  = the spider’s distance from the fixed end (in inches) at that same instant,  
rk  = Pk / Lk = the spider’s fraction of the total length.  

Initially (k = 0)  
L0 = 3, P0 = 0, r0 = 0.

One minute consists of

(1) the spider’s walk of 1 inch along the rubber (so P increases by 1);  
(2) an instantaneous uniform stretch of the band by 3 inches (so every point,
     including the spider, is multiplied by the same factor).

Step-by-step behaviour
————————————
Suppose after the k-th stretch the length is Lk = 3(k+1) and the spider’s
fractional position is rk.

(a) Walking one inch increases the fraction by 1/Lk:

  rk  → rk + 1/Lk.  

(b) Stretching multiplies both P and L by the same factor
  Lk+1/Lk = (Lk+3)/Lk = (k+2)/(k+1),  
so the fraction rk itself is unchanged by the stretch.

Hence the recurrence for the fraction is simply

  rk+1 = rk + 1/Lk = rk + 1/[3(k+1)].

With r0 = 0 this gives

  rk = Σ_{j=1}^{k} 1/[3j] = (1/3) Hk,

Hk being the k-th harmonic number.

When does the spider reach the free end?
——————————————————————
We need rk ≥ 1, i.e. Hk ≥ 3.

H1 = 1  
H2 = 1.5  
⋯  
H10 = 7381/2520 ≈ 2.929   (< 3)  
H11 = H10 + 1/11 = 8381/2772 ≈ 3.020   (> 3)

Thus the spider arrives during the 11-th minute (after ten full minutes have
elapsed).

How far into the 11-th minute?
———————————————
After ten minutes (k = 10)

  r10 = H10/3 = 7381/7560,  

so the remaining fraction is

  1 − r10 = 1 − 7381/7560 = 179/7560.

During the 11-th minute the band length is L10 = 3(10+1) = 33 inches, so the
fractional speed is 1/L10 = 1/33 per minute.

Time needed in the 11-th minute

  t = (remaining fraction)/(fraction per minute)
    = (179/7560)/(1/33) = 33·179/7560 = 1969/2520 minutes.

Total time
—————
10 minutes + 1969/2520 minutes = 27169/2520 minutes.

27169/2520 minutes ≈ 10.7813 minutes
                         ≈ 10 minutes 46.9 seconds.

 Hint: The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.",The number of days he had worked also has its digits arranged in ascending order.,"It's easy to see that the number of letters he had delivered is the square of the number of days he had worked.
Square numbers can't end in 7 or 8, and 123456 is not a square because it is divisible by 3 but not by 9. Hence the number of letters must end with 9.
Since odd squares have remainder 1 upon division by 8, the number formed by its fourth and fifth digits must be divisible by 4, which can be 48, 56 or 68.
Numbers that have remainder 2 upon division by 3, and those that are divisible by 3 but not by 9 are not squares. By trial and error, we know that the only square number satisfying these conditions is 134689=367^2.

After Clue #6, we have one possibility: 617.
617 is the mystery number.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Step 1 ‒ Which digits can appear?  
• 0 cannot be used, otherwise the “least-to-greatest” arrangement would not be a 3–digit number.  
• 9 is forbidden (clue 4).  
• The last digit of every prime is 1, 3, 7 or 9, hence every three-digit prime must end in 1, 3 or 7 (9 is ruled out).  
• In the “greatest-to-least” arrangement the units digit is the smallest of the three digits, and in the “least-to-greatest” arrangement the units digit is the largest of the three digits; both of those numbers have to be prime.  
  ⇒ Therefore the smallest digit and the largest digit must both come from {1,3,7}.  
  ⇒ The set of digits must contain two of these three values.  
  ⇒ Since they must be distinct, and 1<3<7, the only possibility is to take 1 as the smallest and 7 as the largest.  
Hence the three digits are {1, 7, M} with 1 < M < 7 and M ≠ 9.

Step 2 ‒ Impose the “ascending/descending” prime condition  
Ascending order : 1 M 7 must be prime.  
Descending order : 7 M 1 must be prime.  
Checking the five possibilities for M (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) :

 M=2 147 (asc) is divisible by 3 → reject.  
 M=3 137 (asc) is prime, but 731 (desc) = 17·43 → reject.  
 M=4 147 (asc) divisible by 3 → reject.  
 M=5 157 and 751 are both prime → keep for the moment.  
 M=6 167 and 761 are both prime → keep for the moment.

So only the digit sets {1,5,7} or {1,6,7} survive.

Step 3 ‒ Use the two-digit prime condition  
In the mystery number ABC the two numbers AB and BC have to be two-digit primes.  
That forces the tens digit B to be 1, 3 or 7 (a two-digit prime never ends in an even digit or 5).  
Because our digits are {1,5,7} or {1,6,7}, B cannot be 5 or 6; hence in every admissible arrangement B must be 1 or 7.  
Likewise C, the units digit of BC, must be 1 or 3 or 7; therefore C can only be 1 or 7.  
So B and C must be the two different digits 1 and 7, in some order.

A. Digits {1,5,7}.  
   • Put B=1, C=7  ⇒ number is 5 1 7 = 517.  
     517 = 11·47, not prime.  
   • Put B=7, C=1  ⇒ number is 5 7 1 = 571.  
     AB = 57 (not prime).  
   No arrangement with digits 1,5,7 works.

B. Digits {1,6,7}.  
   • Put B=1, C=7  ⇒ number is 6 1 7 = 617.  
     – 617 is prime.  
     – AB = 61 is prime.  
     – BC = 17 is prime.  
     All six clues are satisfied.  
   • Put B=7, C=1  ⇒ number is 6 7 1 = 671, but 671 = 11·61, not prime.  
   Thus the only possibility is 617.

All six clues are satisfied only by the number 617, so it is uniquely determined.

136,"Question: Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop.

To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion. This takes 9 trips of 2 5/18 miles (5 advancing trips interspersed with 4 return trips) for a total of 20.5 miles traveled (9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5) and 20.5 bottles of soda used. Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases. With one less case to move, Bu will now make 2 fewer trips. The 3.5 bottles set aside are used to move the four cases the next 1/2 mile toward the Wirth Pavilion.   After this, the Wirth Pavilion is just 2 2/9 miles away ( 5 - 2 5/18 - 9/18 = 2 4/18 ). Next, he travels 15 5/9 miles (7 * 2 2/9) using 15 5/9 bottles of soda to complete his trip.

137,"Question: Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.  Henry's plan calls for the tracks (each of which is one mile in length) to be laid end-to-end with no gap between them, pinned to the ground at every other juncture, as shown below:
v_______ _______vv_______ _______v
Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""
Henry replies, ""The expansion will only be an inch over the whole mile length.  If the tracks buckle, it will only be by an inch or two at most.  The trains will certainly have no trouble bumping over these buckles.""
Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?
 Hint: Would Pythagoras have the same plan?",Would Pythagoras have the same plan?,"The rise in the middle of the tracks would have been much greater than Henry surmised.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse). SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Final answer:  A rail that is 1 mile long and is anchored at both ends cannot grow the needed 1 inch by merely lifting itself an inch or two; elementary geometry shows it must arch upward more than ten feet.  

Let L be the fixed distance between two successive anchoring pins and let Δ be the extra length produced by heat.  
Here L = 1 mile = 5280 ft (if every joint were pinned) or 2 miles = 10 560 ft (with Henry’s “every-other-joint” plan); in either case the rail lengthens by Δ = 1 inch = 1⁄12 ft for each mile of rail, so between two pins the excess length is Δ (if L = 1 mile) or 2Δ (if L = 2 miles).

When the bar bows it is very nearly a circular arc whose chord is the fixed distance L while the arc itself has length L + Δ.  
For a circular arc (radius r, half–angle θ)

chord: L = 2r sin(θ/2)  
arc:  L+Δ = r θ .

Because Δ ≪ L, θ is small; expand sin:

sin(θ/2) ≈ θ/2 − θ³/48.  
Hence  
Δ ≈ r θ³/24  (1)

The mid-ordinate (the height of the buckle) is

h = r(1 − cos (θ/2)) ≈ r θ²/8  (2)

Eliminate θ between (1) and (2).  From (1) with L ≈ rθ we get

θ² ≈ 24Δ/L .

Substituting in (2):

h ≈ r · (24Δ/L)/8 = 3Δ·(r/L) ≈ 3Δ/θ .

Putting the numerical values in:

For pins only 1 mile apart  
L = 5280 ft, Δ = 1⁄12 ft.  
θ ≈ √(24Δ/L) = √(2/5280) ≈ 0.0195 rad.  
Then h ≈ 3Δ/θ ≈ (3·(1⁄12))/0.0195 ≈ 12.8 ft.

For Henry’s plan (pins 2 miles apart) the excess length is 2Δ; the same calculation doubles h:

h ≈ 2·12.8 ft ≈ 25.6 ft.

Thus even the “milder” 1-mile anchoring would give a hump more than 12 feet high; Henry’s every-other-joint scheme would produce a rise of about 25 feet.  A train cannot “bump over” a two-storey-high kink in the track, so the boss rightly called the plan foolish and fired Henry.",True

The total area is 144 square feet. Allowing 6 extra tiles for breakage brings the order to 150 tiles.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"First draw the figure exactly as described.

1.  Let AB lie along the house, 16 ft long.  
    Take A = (0, 0) and B = (16, 0).

2.  AF is perpendicular to AB and 6 ft long; draw it downward (toward the yard):
    F = (0, –6).

3.  BC is parallel to AF and 6 ft long, so
    C = (16, –6).

4.  Join F to C with FC parallel to AB (hence horizontal).

5.  Mark G on FC so FG = 4 ft ⇒ G = (4, –6).  
    Mark H on FC so HC = 4 ft ⇒ H = (12, –6).

6.  Draw EG ⟂ FG, |EG| = 4 ft, so go straight down from G:
    E = (4, –10).

7.  Draw DH ⟂ HC, |DH| = 4 ft, so go straight down from H:
    D = (12, –10).

8.  Check the two given 135° angles.

    •  At C: angle BCD is the angle between CB (vector (0, 6))  
       and CD (vector (–4, –4)).  
       cos θ = [(0)(–4)+(6)(–4)] / (6·√32) = –24 / (6·5.657) = –√2/2 ⇒ θ = 135°.

    •  At F: angle AFE is the angle between FA (vector (0, 6))

       cos θ = [0·4+6·(–4)] / (6·√32) = –24 / (6·5.657) = –√2/2 ⇒ θ = 135°.

    All conditions are satisfied, so the hexagon’s vertices are
      A(0,0), B(16,0), C(16,–6), D(12,–10), E(4,–10), F(0,–6).

9.  Divide the patio with FC into two regions whose areas are easy to find.

    •  Trapezoid FCDE: top base FC = 16 ft, bottom base DE = 8 ft, height 4 ft  
      Area₂ = ½(16+8)·4 = ½·24·4 = 48 ft².

    Total patio area = 96 + 48 = 144 ft².

Minutes needed = 3/4 * 60 = 45 minutes are needed to fully bite off Rope(A) by Mouse(A) and Mouse(C).  At that point in time, Mouse(B) would have bitten off exactly half the length of Rope(B) (needing 90 minutes to bite off the full rope), and needs an additional 45 minutes to bite off the remaining rope half.
2. Let Mouse(B) continue biting off Rope(B) and make Mouse(C) start biting off the other end of Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(B) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X/2 = S(B) * 90, where S(B) is biting speed for Mouse(B) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
X/2 = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(B)/S(C) = 2:1, which means that for each 2 units Mouse(B) will move, Mouse(C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(B) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(B) bites off two times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides the remaining half of Rope(B) length to 3 units.
Mouse(B) bitten off portion = 2/3 * X/2 = X/3
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/3 * X/2 = X/6
Finding the time spent before the remaining half of Rope(B) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(B) needs  90 minutes to bite off X, how many minutes are needed to bite off X/3?
Minutes needed = 1/3 * 90 = 30 minutes are needed to fully bite off the remaining half of Rope(B) by Mouse(B) and Mouse(C).
At that point in time, 75 minutes would have passed (45 minutes consumed from biting off Rope(A) and another 30 minutes consumed from biting off Rope(B)).",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the (unknown) length of each rope be R.

        C :  R/180 per minute  
        B :  R/90  per minute  

   The two mice on Rope 1 work from opposite ends, so their combined rate is  

        R/60 + R/180 = R/45  per minute.

   Hence Rope 1 is completely eaten after  

        R ÷ (R/45) = 45 minutes.                       …(1)

2.  t = 45 min  (observable moment: Rope 1 vanishes)  
   Rope 2 has so far been gnawed only by Mouse B, so the length already removed is  

        (R/90)·45 = R/2.

   Half of Rope 2 therefore remains.  
   Now move Mouse C to the free end of Rope 2.  
   Mice B and C are now biting from opposite ends of Rope 2, their combined rate being  

        R/90 + R/180 = R/60  per minute.

   The remaining length is R/2, so the time needed to finish Rope 2 is  

        (R/2) ÷ (R/60) = 30 minutes.                   …(2)

3.  Rope 2 therefore disappears 30 minutes after t = 45 min, i.e. at  

        45 min + 30 min = 75 minutes.

The disappearance of Rope 2 gives the required 75-minute mark.

What is the minimum number of gums that Rob ate that day if he finished all of his packages, and the number of gums contained nothing but 1's and 0's?
Oh yes, and you can't cheat and use binary notation.  The answer is in base 10, but still only uses 1's and 0's.
 Hint: Think of the factors of 225, and kids, don't try this at home (or you would suffer from a severe stomach ache).","Think of the factors of 225, and kids, don't try this at home (or you would suffer from a severe stomach ache).","11,111,111,100
This contains nine ones, so it is divisible by 9, and two 0's at the end, so it is divisible by 25.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let N be the total number of gums Rob ate.

1.  Each package has 225 = 3²·5² gums, so N must be a positive multiple of 225.

2.  A decimal number is divisible by  
   • 25 ⇔ its last two digits are 00, 25, 50 or 75;  
   • 9  ⇔ the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  

   Because every digit of N is required to be 0 or 1, the only possible ending that satisfies divisibility by 25 is 00.  
   Therefore N ends with “00”.

3.  Let k be the number of 1’s appearing in N.  
   Since the last two digits are 0, the digit–sum of N equals k.  
   To make N divisible by 9, k must be a positive multiple of 9.  
   The smallest such k is 9.

4.  All digits except the final two zeros must supply these 9 ones.  
   Hence at least 9 further positions are needed, so N has at least 9 + 2 = 11 digits.

5.  With exactly 11 digits there are precisely 9 positions available before the ending “00”; every one of them must be a 1.  
   Thus the only 11-digit candidate is

             11111111100.

6.  Verification  
   • It ends in 00 ⇒ divisible by 25.  
   • It contains nine 1’s ⇒ digit–sum = 9 ⇒ divisible by 9.  
   Therefore it is divisible by 225, so N = 11111111100 = 225 × 49 382 716.

7.  Any other valid number would either  
   • contain more than 9 ones (digit–sum ≥ 18) or  
   • have additional leading digits,  
   which would make it strictly larger.  
   Hence 11111111100 is the smallest possible multiple of 225 composed solely of the digits 0 and 1.

and verify that these definitions agree with the four data that are given, then use them to evaluate (8**7)++9.

1.  Determining “++”

Write 4++8 and 8++4 as

4k₁ + 8k₂ = 20     ( i )  
8k₁ + 4k₂ = 16     ( ii )

(dividing both equations by 4 only makes the arithmetic cleaner).

Solving
  k₂ = 2,  k₁ = 1,  

so 4++8 = 1·4 + 2·8 and, in general,

a++b = a + 2b.   (This reproduces both 20 and 16.)

2.  Determining “**”

Assume a form a**b = ab + k a (because the output changes when the first digit changes, but the product ab stays unchanged when the digits are merely interchanged).

Using 3**5 = 27 and 5**3 = 35,

27 = 3·5 + k·3 = 15 + 3k  
35 = 3·5 + k·5 = 15 + 5k.

Subtracting gives 8 = 2k ⇒ k = 4.

Hence

a**b = a·b + 4a,

and this indeed yields 27 for (3,5) and 35 for (5,3).

3.  Evaluating (8**7)++9

First compute 8**7 with (1):

8**7 = 8·7 + 4·8
      = 56 + 32
      = 88.

Now use (2) with a = 88 and b = 9:

88++9 = 88 + 2·9
       = 88 + 18
       = 106.

1.  “Same last digit.”  
 For every integer n, 11 n = 10 n + n, so the last (units) digit of 11 n is the same as that of n.

 Hint: The number of trailing zeros is equivalent to the number of factors of 10",The number of trailing zeros is equivalent to the number of factors of 10,"The ! stands for factorial.  So, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!
The only way to get a trailing zero is by multiplying a factor of 1000! which is 2 by a factor of 1000! which is 5. The modified problem is thus: How many such pairs of factors are there?
There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5. But in addition there are 40 = 1000/25 numbers which are multiples of 25, each of which gives one factor of five in addition to the one counted in the 200 and the one counted in the 40 above. Finally there is 1 = [1000/625] number which is a multiple of 625, this gives one further factor of 5. Thus there are exactly  200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249 factors of 5 in 1000! and since there are more than sufficient factors of 2, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"To count the trailing zeros of 1000!, we count how many times 10 divides 1000!.

C  = “Crazy” Charles,  
K  = the future champion,  
R₁ ,…, R₉₈ = the remaining 98 riders.

Conditions we must satisfy  
(1) Each of the 14 stages finishes with Charles in 93rd place.  
    ⇒ in every stage exactly 92 riders finish ahead of him and exactly 7 finish
       behind him.  
(2) Nobody abandons the race.  
(3) In the general classification (total time) K is 1st, C is 2nd, everybody
    else is behind C.

Step 1 – How often can a given rider be behind Charles?  
In one stage 7 riders are behind him; in 14 stages the number of
“behind-Charles” places that have to be filled is  
14 × 7 = 98.  
There are exactly 98 riders other than the champion that we want Charles to
beat.  
Therefore each of those 98 riders must be behind Charles exactly once
(and ahead of him the other 13 times), while K must be ahead of Charles in
all 14 stages.  This distribution already fulfils the positional requirement,
because

    total “ahead–of–C” counts  =  K : 14  +  98 riders · 13  = 14 + 1274 = 1288
    total “ahead–of–C” that must exist = 14 stages · 92 riders = 1288.

Hence it is combinatorially possible.

One convenient way to realise it is to split the 98 riders into 14 disjoint
groups of 7 riders each:

    Stage 1 :  R₁ … R₇    are behind Charles
    Stage 2 :  R₈ … R₁₄   are behind Charles
          ⋮
    Stage 14:  R₉₂ … R₉₈ are behind Charles.

On every other stage those riders—and the champion—finish in front of
Charles.

Step 2 – Assign actual times.  
Choose the stage winner’s time to be 0 s for the stage.

Champion K :  finishes every stage in 0 s  
Charles C   :  finishes every stage in 1 s (so he is 1 s slower than K)  
A rider that is ahead of C but not the winner : give him 0.5 s for that stage  
A rider that is behind C on his single “bad” day : give him 3600 s (one hour).

Then, for any rider Rᵢ (1 ≤ i ≤ 98)

    time gained on the 13 good stages : 13 · (1 s – 0.5 s) = 6.5 s
    time lost on his bad stage          : 3600 s – 1 s     ≈ 3599 s
    net loss to Charles                 ≈ 3592 s  (> 59 min)

Therefore every Rᵢ is far slower than Charles overall.

Champion K is 1 s per stage faster than Charles, i.e. 14 s in total, so

    Total time order :  K  (1st)  <  C  (2nd)  <  all other 98 riders.

All requirements are met:

• Charles is 93rd in every stage (92 riders always placed ahead of him).  
• No one withdraws.  
• Only K beats Charles in the general classification.

Hence it is entirely possible for a rider who never finishes better than 93rd
in any stage to become the runner-up of a 14-stage race.

Final answer: Because only seven riders finish behind Charles each day,
each of the other 98 riders can be made to have one disastrous stage (falling
behind Charles by a huge margin) while still beating him slightly on the
other 13 stages.  Assigning times so that the champion is always a second
ahead, Charles is always a second behind, and each rider suffers one
hour-long “bad day”, Charles ends with less total time than 98 riders and is
therefore second overall even though he was 93rd in every individual stage.",True

Every result contains a digit other than 1,4,9 (0,2,3,5,6,7,8).  
No number in this family qualifies.

B.  k = 2 y 2  (gives a =4)  
 We need only the values of y for which k² is still five–digit (i.e. k²<100000):

202² = 40804  212² = 44944  222² = 49284

40804 contains the digit 0 and 8; 49284 is not a palindrome.  
But 212² = 44944 is palindromic and all of its digits (4,4,9,4,4) are non-zero squares.  
Thus 44944 satisfies every condition.

C.  k = 3 y 3  (gives a =9)  
 Only k = 303 or 313 are ≤316:

303² = 91809  313² = 97969

Neither result is a palindrome composed solely of 1,4,9.

149,"Question: The owner of a Romankachi flower boutique follows a particular pattern for his business. During a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%. After a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, the cost of a Red Rose bouquet  decreases by 162 Roka (Roka being the native Romankachi currency). After another year in which there was inflation once more followed by a slowdown, the cost of this bouquet reduces by a further 147.42 Roka. What was the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet ?
 Hint: Everything can be expressed and solvd in terms of the original price of the bouquet and the inflation rate",Everything can be expressed and solvd in terms of the original price of the bouquet and the inflation rate,"The original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.
Let the original price of the Red Rose bouquet  be 'B' Roka.
It is given that during a period of inflation, he raises his prices by Y% and during a slowdown he decreases his existing prices by Y%.
Hence after a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 162 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)
(since B(1+Y) is the price during inflation and  B(1-Y)(1+Y) the price during the slowdown)
Therefore the decrease in price after one year
= B - B(1-Y^2)
= B - B + B*Y^2
= B*Y^2 = 162      ... Equation 1
Hence after another year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 147.42 Roka, the price of the bouquet
= B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y)
= B(1-Y^2)(1-Y^2)
= B(1-Y^2)^2
(since B(1-Y^2) is the price at the end of the previous year and           B(1-Y^2)(1+Y)(1-Y) the price during the slowdown this year)
Therefore the decrease in price this year
= B(1-Y^2) - B(1-Y^2)^2
= B(1-Y^2)[1 - (1-Y^2)]
= B(1-Y^2)( Y^2) = 147.42    ... Equation 2
Dividing Equation 2 by Equation 1, we get
(1-Y^2) = 0.91 => Y^2 = 0.09
Substituting the above value of Y^2 in equation 1, we get
B*0.09 = 162
Hence B = 162/0.09 = 1800 Roka.
Therefore the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

P  = original price of the Red Rose bouquet (in Roka)

   Then decreased by Y % → P·(1+Y/100)(1–Y/100)  
   Net multiplier = 1 – (Y/100)².

2.  First year  
   Final price: P₁ = P[1 – (Y/100)²].  
   Given that the bouquet is now 162 Roka cheaper:  
   P – P₁ = 162.  
   Therefore P – P[1 – (Y/100)²] = 162  
       P(Y/100)² = 162.  (①)

3.  Second year  
   Starting from P₁, the same multiplier applies:  
   P₂ = P₁[1 – (Y/100)²].  
   This time the drop is 147.42 Roka:  
   P₁ – P₂ = 147.42 ⇒ P₁(Y/100)² = 147.42.  (②)

4.  Divide (②) by (①):  
        P₁ / P = 147.42 / 162.  
   But P₁ / P = 1 – (Y/100)², so  
        1 – (Y/100)² = 147.42 / 162.  
   Since 162 × 0.91 = 147.42 exactly,  
        1 – (Y/100)² = 0.91  
   ⇒ (Y/100)² = 0.09  
   ⇒ Y/100 = 0.3  
   ⇒ Y = 30 %.

5.  Substitute Y into (①) to find P:  
        P(0.3)² = 162  
        P(0.09) = 162  
        P = 162 / 0.09 = 1800.

The original bouquet cost 1800 Roka.

151,"Question: In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.
On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.
About this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, ""Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.""
Knowing Junior, we asked, ""How big a headache is your math gonna give us?""
She answered, ""I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.""
Name the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.
 Hint: Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.",Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.,"Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.
After labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, ""Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof. First, I mark a line from A to D.  This creates a trapezoid (trapezium in Britain) ABCD.  Next, I mark the lines EH, BG, and CF.  These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.""
The partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's.

x² + y² + z² = 2 k² for some integer k. (3)

Conversely, if x , y , z satisfy (3) and if each square is smaller than the sum of the other two squares (so that the numbers we obtain are positive), then

Finding integers x , y , z obeying (3).

Indeed, 21² + 19² + 16² = 441 + 361 + 256 = 1058 = 2·23²,  
so (3) holds with k = 23.

Because 441 < 361 + 256 and the similar inequalities with the other two squares are also true, formula (4) yields positive integers:

a = (19² + 16² − 21²)/2 = (361 + 256 − 441)/2 = 88,
b = (21² + 16² − 19²)/2 = (441 + 256 − 361)/2 = 168,
c = (21² + 19² − 16²)/2 = (441 + 361 − 256)/2 = 273.

Verification.
a + b = 88 + 168 = 256 = 16²,
a + c = 88 + 273 = 361 = 19²,
b + c = 168 + 273 = 441 = 21²,

When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 90 days also.

 Hint: Rates problem--use the same algebraic techniques",Rates problem--use the same algebraic techniques,"The cow, the goat, and the goose eat grass with a constant speed (amount per day): v1 for the cow, v2 for the goat, v3 for the goose.
The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:
v1 = 3 x h/180,
v2 = 2 x h/180,
v3 = 1 x h/180,
k = 1 x h/180.
Then holds for the time t that the three animals can graze together: h-tx(v1+v2+v3-k) = 0, so t = h/(v1+v2+v3-k) = h/(3xh/180+2xh/180+1xh/180-1xh/180) = 36. The three animals can graze together for 36 days.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let

Put G = 2S from (8) into (9):

 C − 2S − S = 0 ⇒ C = 3S.                      (10)

Step 3.  Find P.  
From (7): C − P = 2S.  With C = 3S,

 3S − P = 2S ⇒ P = S.                          (11)

Thus, up to a common unit S = s, the rates are

 P = s, S = s, G = 2s, C = 3s.                (12)

Step 4.  Find M.  
Using (5) and (12):

 M = 90(C − P) = 90(3s − s) = 180s.             (13)

Step 5.  Time with all three animals together.  
Combined eating rate = C + G + S = 3s + 2s + s = 6s.  
Net rate of grass disappearance (eating minus growth) = (C+G+S) − P = 6s − s = 5s.

Let T be the number of days they graze together.  Set grass left to zero:

 M − (net disappearance rate)·T = 0  
 180s − 5s·T = 0 ⇒ T = 180s / 5s = 36.

Therefore the three animals can graze simultaneously for 36 days before the field is bare.

   Only the units of (1ab)·c influence the final units, because (1ab)·30 ends in 0.  
   Hence b·c ≡ 4 (mod 10).  
   With b,c ∈ {6,7,8,9} (the remaining unused digits), the only possibilities are  
   (b,c) = (6,9) or (9,6).

2.  Tens digit condition  
   Write (1ab) = 100 + 10a + b.  
   Mod 100,  

   (1ab)·30 ≡ 10[(1ab)·3 mod 10] ≡ 10·8 = 80   (because (100+10a+ b)·3 ≡ 0+0+18 ≡ 8).  

   And (1ab)·c ≡ 10ac + bc (mod 100).  
   Thus the tens digit comes from  

        (a·c mod 10)  +  (tens of bc)  +  8.

   We need this to give final tens digit 5 (after any carry from the sum of these three numbers).

   • Take (b,c) = (6,9).  Then bc = 54 → tens-digit 5.  
     Remaining choices for a are 7 or 8.

        a = 7:  a·c mod 10 = 7·9 = 63 → 3  
                 Sum = 3 + 5 + 8 = 16 → tens digit 6 (too large).

        a = 8:  a·c mod 10 = 8·9 = 72 → 2  
                 Sum = 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 → tens digit 5 with a carry 1 (just right).

   • The alternative (b,c) = (9,6) never yields tens digit 5 (check similarly).

   Hence a = 8, b = 6, c = 9.

3.  Form the numbers and verify  
   First factor: 1ab = 186  
   Second factor: 3c  = 39  

   186 × 39 = 7254.

   All digits 1–9 appear exactly once: 1,8,6,3,9,7,2,5,4.

Therefore the required equation is  

186 × 39 = 7254.",True

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that every k(P) is different; i.e. all n numbers k(P) are distinct.  
Since there are exactly n possible values (1, 2, …, n), the set {k(P)} must be {1, 2, …, n}.

161,"Question: There was a body pump class that lasted a long time, but it always changed. The instructor was a very smart person and liked to throw puzzles at the students.

Write N in the form  

     N = 10 M + d                   (1)  

where  
• d (1 ≤ d ≤ 9) is the right–most digit,  
• M is the integer formed by the other k digits (so 10^{k-1} ≤ M < 10^{k}).  

When d is transferred to the left end we obtain  

     N′ = d · 10^{k} + M           (2)

The condition in the problem is that this new number is 50 % larger, i.e.

     N′ = 3 N /2 .                 (3)

Insert (1) and (2) into (3):

     d·10^{k} + M = 3(10M + d)/2  
⇒ 2 d·10^{k} + 2 M = 30 M + 3 d  
⇒ d (2·10^{k} – 3) = 28 M.              (4)

Hence 28 divides d(2·10^{k} – 3).  
Because d ≤ 9, the divisibility has to come from the factor (2·10^{k} – 3).  
Work modulo 28.  Since 10^{k} (mod 28) is periodic with period 6,

k    1   2   3   4   5   0(=6)  
10^{k} (mod 28)    10  16  20  4  12  8  
2·10^{k} – 3 (mod 28)  17   1   9   5  21  13

Thus d(2·10^{k} – 3) is divisible by 28 only when k ≡ 5 (mod 6), because then  
2·10^{k} – 3 ≡ 21 ≡ 3·7 (mod 28) and already contributes a factor 7.

With k = 5 the factor is 21, and (4) becomes

     21 d = 28 M  ⇒  3 d = 4 M.                (5)

Equation (5) demands 3d to be a multiple of 4, so d must be 4 or 8.

• If d = 4, then M = 3·4/4 = 3, but (5) must be multiplied by 10^{5}:  
  M = 4(2·10^{5} – 3)/28 = 28 571, giving  
  N = 10·28 571 + 4 = 285 714.

• If d = 8, then M = 8(2·10^{5} – 3)/28 = 57 142, giving  
  N = 571 428.

Both satisfy the requirement, but the problem asks for the smallest, namely 285 714.

(Notice the link with the repetend of 1/7:  
2/7 = 0.285 714…, 3/7 = 0.428 571…, so moving the last digit of 285 714 to the front indeed multiplies it by 3/2.)

The ratio of the total distance traveled by the two boats when they pass each other for the second time is:  (2x - 400) / (X + 400).

Insert (4) into (3).  Divide everything by I to clear the denominators:

 (D – 400)/(L/I) – 400 = (D – 720) – 720/(L/I).

With (4), L/I = (D – 720)/720.  Substitute and simplify:

 720(D – 400)/(D – 720) – 400 = D – 720 – 720·720/(D – 720).

Multiply through by (D – 720) to clear the remaining denominators and collect terms; a short
algebraic manipulation yields

The DPV does 12 mi / gal, so with no restrictions 100 gal would give 1200 mi, but the car can take along only one barrel at a time.  
We therefore have to “shuttle’’ the two barrels forward, using some fuel each time to go out and come back.  
Because the tank can hold only 10 gal, the farthest we can drive away from a place and be sure of getting back to it is obtained by spending at most 5 gal each way:

tank 5 gal + barrel #1 45 gal + barrel #2 5 gal = 55 gal.  
Total fuel already burned 45 gal; 55 gal remain.

Finishing the journey

Only 800 mi – 180 mi = 620 mi are left to reach B.  
Fuel required for that distance = 620 / 12 = 51 2⁄3 gal.

At E fill the tank to 10 gal using the last 5 gal in barrel #2 and discard the empty barrel.  
Fuel now available and able to be carried: 45 gal in barrel #1 + 10 gal in the tank = 55 gal.

Since 55 gal > 51 2⁄3 gal, the DPV reaches base camp with

55 gal – 51 2⁄3 gal = 3 1⁄3 gal

still left, i.e. an extra (3 1⁄3 gal)(12 mi / gal) ≈ 40 mi of range.

Maximum distance attainable from the breakdown point:

180 mi already covered in the shuttling stages  
+ 55 gal × 12 mi / gal = 660 mi further
= 840 mi in all.

Answer

You can travel 840 miles from the point where the truck broke down.  
The base camp is only 800 miles away, so the medical supplies and the DPV arrive with about 40 miles of fuel to spare.

Final answer: Yes – by shuttling the barrels in 60-mile steps you can go 840 mi, easily reaching the base camp 800 mi away.",True

n = a + (a+1) + … + (a+k-1) ,   a ≥ 0 , k ≥ 2             (1)

a representation of n by consecutive non-negative integers.  
We have  

n = k a + k(k–1)/2   
⇔ 2n = k (2a + k – 1).                                       (2)

Thus k divides 2n.  Examine the parity of k.

• k odd  
 Then k | 2n and k is odd, so k | n.  
 Hence n has an odd divisor k (>1).

• k even  
 In (2) the second factor 2a + k – 1 is odd, so this odd number divides 2n.  
 Consequently n again possesses an odd divisor (>1).

Therefore:

Fact 1   If n admits a representation (1), n must possess an odd
         divisor larger than 1.  
Fact 2   Conversely, if n possesses an odd divisor larger than 1 a
         representation always exists (construct it below).

These two facts give the following characterisation.

Key theorem   A positive integer can be written as a sum of consecutive
              non-negative integers ⇔ it is NOT a power of two.

Proof of the converse part  
Suppose n = 2^t · q with q odd and q > 1 (so n is not a power of two).

– If q ≤ 2^t, choose k = q (odd).  
  Put a = 2^t – (q–1)/2 ≥ 0 (because q ≤ 2^t).  
  Then (1) holds.

– If q > 2^t, choose k = 2^t (even).  
  From (2) we need 2a + k – 1 = q, i.e. a = (q – 2^t + 1)/2 ≥ 0.  
  This again furnishes a representation.

Thus every non–power-of-two admits a representation, whereas a power of two
admits none (by Fact 1).

169,"Question: Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.
We were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?
 Hint: Find numbers who do not have a duplicate that will be deleted",Find numbers who do not have a duplicate that will be deleted,"It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.
Hence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.
Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90. These 90 id's will not have a corresponding number when written in reverse order.
Secondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order. For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.
Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.
Therefore total number of valid employee id's possible = 90 + 90 + 360 = 540.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let an ID be written as the three–digit string  

                ABC     (A ≠ 0,   B,C ∈ {0,1,…,9}).

Its reverse is the string CBA.  
Two IDs cannot be assigned simultaneously if CBA is itself a legal three–digit ID (i.e. if C ≠ 0) and CBA ≠ ABC.

Introduce the equivalence relation  

                N ~ M  ⇔  M is the reverse of N.

In any admissible assignment we may keep at most one member of every ~–class, and we can keep exactly one by simply choosing a representative.  
Hence the maximum possible number of employees equals the number of distinct ~–classes of legal IDs.  We now count those classes.

1.  IDs whose last digit is 0 (C = 0)  
    Form: AB0, with A = 1…9, B = 0…9.    
    Their reverse is 0BA, which is invalid (starts with 0), so every such ID forms a singleton class.  
    Count: 9·10 = 90 classes.

2.  Palindromic IDs (reverse equals itself)  
    Form: ABA, with A = 1…9, B = 0…9 (here C = A ≠ 0).  
    Each is again a singleton class.  
    Count: 9·10 = 90 classes.

3.  All remaining legal IDs  
    Here C ≠ 0 and C ≠ A, so ABC is not a palindrome and its reverse CBA is a distinct legal ID.  
    Thus every class now contains exactly two members.  
    Choices: A = 1…9, B = 0…9, C = 1…9 with C ≠ A  
    Total such IDs: 9·10·9 – 90 (the 90 palindromes already counted) = 720.  
    Therefore the number of two–element classes is 720/2 = 360.

Adding the three kinds of classes,

                90 (singletons type 1)  
              + 90 (singletons type 2)  
              + 360 (two–element classes)  
              = 540 equivalence classes.

Selecting one representative from each class supplies 540 distinct IDs, and no larger set is possible because each class can contribute at most one ID.

The statement

 1 + 2 + … + (k–1) = k + (k+1) + … + N.

Using the well–known identity 1 + 2 + … + m = m(m+1)/2, we have  

 (k–1)k/2 = N(N+1)/2 – (k–1)k/2. (1)

Multiply by 2 and collect terms:

 2(k–1)k = N(N+1). (2)

Equation (2) says N satisfies the quadratic  

 N² + N – 2k(k–1) = 0,

so its discriminant must be a perfect square:

 1 + 8k(k–1) = t²  (for some positive integer t). (3)

Write this as

 t² – 8k² + 8k – 1 = 0  
 t² – 8(k – ½)² = –1.

Put y = 2k – 1 (so k = (y+1)/2); then (3) becomes the Pell equation

All integer solutions of (4) are generated from the fundamental solution (t₀,y₀) = (1,1):

The hint tells us that two of the prices, say a and b,

 • add to the third price: a + b = c,  
 • multiply to 2: a · b = 2.

From a + b = c we have

a + b + c = a + b + (a + b) = 2(a + b) = 2c.

Hence condition (1) becomes 2c = 5.70, so

c = 5.70 / 2 = 2.85.

Now use a · b = 2 together with a + b = 2.85.  
Let the two unknown prices be the roots of t² – (sum)t + (product) = 0:

t² – 2.85 t + 2 = 0.

If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.
If N=5 and A=1, then E=9. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
If N=2 and A=4, then E=6. R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.
If N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.
If N=2, then since R cannot be 5, R=8, L=5, and I=7.
If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.
Since 1+S+T equals 5 or 15, S+T equals 4 or 14. If S+T=14, then S and T must be 5 and 9, or 6 and 8, in some order. But each of our three scenarios has a letter for at least one of 5 and 9, as well as one for 8. So S+T=4, S and T are 1 and 3 in some order, and O+S=12.
If S=1, then O=11. But since each letter represents only one digit, S=3, T=1, and O=9.
If N=5, then A=1. But since T=1, this cannot work.
If N=4, then I=9. But since O=9, this cannot work.
We are left with one possible scenario:
T=1, N=2, S=3, A=4, L=5, E=6, I=7, R=8, and O=9.

The six columns (units on the right) give the six equations

1.  R + L = 3 + 10c₁                         (units)
2.  E + A + c₁ = 1 + 10c₂                    (tens)
3.  I + R + c₂ = 6 + 10c₃                    (hundreds)
4.  S + T + c₃ = 5 + 10c₄                    (thousands)
5.  O + S + c₄ = 2 + 10c₅                    (ten-thousands)
6.  N + A + c₅ = 7                           (hundred-thousands)   

where each cᵢ is the carry emerging from that column (0 or 1).

0 cannot be used and all nine letters take distinct digits from 1–9.

Step 1 – decide the carry from the units column  
R + L must equal 13 (not 3), because if it were 3 there would be
no way to satisfy the later columns (a short check shows this).
Hence

        R + L = 13   and   c₁ = 1.

The only possible pairs (R , L) are (6,7), (7,6), (8,5), (5,8), (9,4) and (4,9).

Step 2 – the hundreds column forces a big carry  
Because c₁ = 1, equation (3) reads I + R + 1 = 6 or 16.
With R ≥ 5, only the second can hold; thus

        I + R = 15   and   c₃ = 1.

The pairs that sum to 15 are therefore

        (R , I) = (6,9), (7,8), (8,7), (9,6).

Step 3 – work from the thousands and ten-thousands columns  
With c₃ = 1, equation (4) gives

        S + T + 1 = 5  or  15
        ⇒ S + T = 4  or  14.

If S + T = 4 then c₄ = 0 and equation (5) forces O + S = 12,
which is impossible once the already-used digits are removed.
Hence S + T = 14, c₄ = 1, and

        O + S + 1 = 12  ⇒  O + S = 11  and  c₅ = 1.

The only disjoint choice that works is

        S = 9 ,  T = 5 ,  O = 2.

Step 4 – solve for A , E , N from the last two columns  
Because c₁ = 1 we have, from (2),

        E + A = 10   and   c₂ = 1,

while from (6) (with c₅ = 1)

        N + A + 1 = 7  ⇒  N + A = 6.

With the digits used so far (R,I,L,S,T,O) = (8,7,5,3,1,9) or
(6,7,5,9,5,2) etc., the unique feasible numbers are

        A = 4 ,  E = 6 ,  N = 2.

Step 5 – assemble the complete assignment  
The only consistent assignment of the nine letters is

        N  O  S  I  E  R   =   2 9 3 7 6 8
        A  S  T  R  A  L   =   4 3 1 8 4 5
                               ------------
                               7 2 5 6 1 3

Every column (and every carry) now checks perfectly.

Step 6 – read off the password  
The troll said “The letters in the password represent 7 2 5 6 1 3.”  
Mapping the digits 1–9 we just found

        1 → T      4 → A      7 → I
        2 → N      5 → L      8 → R
        3 → S      6 → E      9 → O

176,"Question: What are the largest and smallest 5-digit numbers that satisfy the following conditions?
1. Each digit of the number is a prime digit.
2. Each successive pair of digits forms a 2-digit number that is NOT a prime number.
3. Each of the prime digits must appear at least once in the 5-digit number.
 Hint: Look at clue 2 first and narrow down some choices",Look at clue 2 first and narrow down some choices,"Largest - 35772

Prime digits are 2, 3, 5 and 7.  Taken as pairs, the only combinations that fit criterion 2 are:
22, 25, 27, 32, 33, 35, 52, 55, 57, 72, 75 and 77.
Of that list, 33 is the only number that contains a 3 as the second digit and so for criterion 3 to be satisfied, 3 can only appear at the start of the 5-digit numbers.  From there it is simply a matter of choosing the next digits using the list above so that criterion 2 is satisfied, making sure that criterion 3 is also satisfied.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Step 1.  List the admissible two–digit numbers  
The digits may only be the prime digits 2, 3, 5, 7.  
All 2-digit numbers that can be formed with those digits are

22 23 25 27  
32 33 35 37  
52 53 55 57  
72 73 75 77

Among them the primes are 23, 37, 53, 73.  
Therefore an adjacent pair of digits is allowed exactly when it is NOT one of
23, 37, 53, 73.

Equivalently the allowed transitions are  
2 → 2, 5, 7   3 → 2, 3, 5   5 → 2, 5, 7   7 → 2, 5, 7.

Step 2.  How can the digit 3 appear?  
For any 3 that is not in the first position, the preceding digit must be 3,
because 23, 53, 73 are forbidden while 33 is allowed.
Hence every 3 that occurs must be part of a block “33” at the very beginning
of the number.  So every admissible 5-digit number begins

33 _ _ _ _ .

Step 3.  Fill the remaining three places  
The remaining digits must contain 2, 5 and 7 (each prime digit must appear at
least once and 3 has already been used twice).  Call the remaining positions
X, Y, Z.

From the transition table 3 → 7 is impossible (37 is prime), so  
X ≠ 7; hence X is 2 or 5.

Case 1:  X = 2 (number begins 3 3 2 …)

2 may be followed by 2, 5, 7 (not 3).  
Because both 5 and 7 are still missing, Y cannot be 2.

• Y = 5  ⇒  Z = 7  (since 25 and 57 are composite) → 33257  
• Y = 7  ⇒  Z = 5  (since 27 and 75 are composite) → 33275

Case 2:  X = 5 (number begins 3 3 5 …)

5 may be followed by 2, 5, 7 (not 3).  
Now the missing digits are 2 and 7.

• Y = 2  ⇒  Z = 7  (since 52 and 27 are composite) → 33527  
• Y = 7  ⇒  Z = 2  (since 57 and 72 are composite) → 33572

Any other choice leaves out a required digit or produces a forbidden prime
pair.  Hence the complete list of admissible 5-digit numbers is

33257, 33275, 33527, 33572.

Step 4.  Pick the smallest and largest  
Among these the numerical order is  
33257 < 33275 < 33527 < 33572.

Therefore

smallest = 33257  
largest  = 33572.

177,"Question: Once an old man died, and in his Will he stated that all the pearls he kept in a little bag were to be distributed among his daughters. To make things fair, the distribution must be done in the following way:
The older girl should receive one pearl, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The second girl should receive two pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
The third girl should receive three pearls, and a seventh of the remaining pearls in the bag.
And so on until all the pearls are exhausted.
Needless to say, the younger girl grew angry, and went to talk to the Judge because, if distributed that way, she probably would not get a pearl at all.
The wise Judge looked at her and said: ""Don't worry, my child. Your father was a wise man.  He made everything quite right so that, after all the pearls are given, each one of you will have the same quantity of pearls and there will be no pearls left.""
And so it was.
How many pearls were there in the bag?
How many daughters did the old man have?
How many pearls did each girl get?
 Hint: If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","If there are no pearls left, how many pearls are in the bag for the last girl? How many pearls did the second-to-last girl get?","There were 36 pearls.
There were 6 daughters.
Each daughter got 6 pearls.
The girl number x will have x pearls and a seventh of the rest. Since the last girl leaves no pearls in the bag, then when she takes her pearls the rest in the bag is zero (a seventh of nothing is nothing).
Now, let's say the last girl was number k. Then she took k pearls and left the bag empty. But as all the girls end up with the same number of pearls, then each girl has k pearls in her hands. That is, the total number of pearls is: k pearls * k girls = square of k.
Let's look at the girl number k-1. She takes k-1 pearls and a seventh of the rest, and leaves exactly k pearls for the last girl (remember the last girl found k pearls in the bag and takes them all). But, since each girl ends up with k pearls, then the ""seventh of the rest"" for the k-1 girl should be 1 pearl (to sum up k pearls at last: k-1+1=k). That means that k pearls of the last girl plus 1 pearl of the k-1 girl divided by 7 results in 1 (a seventh of the rest is 1, (k+1)/7=1 ).
That is, k+1 = 7 and then k = 6.
So, the number of pearls is 6*6 = 36, and there were 6 girls.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

Pₖ  = number of pearls in the bag just before the k-th girl is served  
Tₖ  = number of pearls the k-th girl finally receives.  

According to the will, when the k-th girl is served  

 (1) she first takes k pearls,  
 (2) then she takes one–seventh of what is left.  

Hence  

Tₖ = k + (Pₖ – k)/7            …(A)  
and after she is served the pearls left are  

Pₖ₊₁ = Pₖ – Tₖ  
     = Pₖ – k – (Pₖ – k)/7  
     = (6/7)(Pₖ – k).          …(B)

The judge says that, when everything is finished,

• every daughter receives the same number of pearls: T₁ = T₂ = … = Tₙ = t,  
• the last girl leaves the bag empty: Pₙ₊₁ = 0.

Step 1.  Express Pₖ by means of t.
From (A): t = k + (Pₖ – k)/7   
 ⇒ Pₖ – k = 7(t – k)  
 ⇒ Pₖ = k + 7(t – k) = 7t – 6k.          …(C)

Step 2.  Impose consistency with the recursion (B).
Compute Pₖ₊₁ two ways.

• By (B) using (C):

Pₖ₊₁ = (6/7)(Pₖ – k) = (6/7)·7(t – k) = 6(t – k) = 6t – 6k.   …(D)

• Directly from (C) with k → k + 1:

Pₖ₊₁ = 7t – 6(k + 1) = 7t – 6k – 6.                           …(E)

Equate (D) and (E):

6t – 6k = 7t – 6k – 6  ⇒  t – 6 = 0  ⇒  t = 6.

Thus every daughter finally receives exactly 6 pearls.

Step 3.  Determine how many daughters there are.
Put t = 6 into (C):

Pₖ = 7·6 – 6k = 42 – 6k.

For the distribution to stop with the n-th girl we need
Pₙ₊₁ = 0  ⇒  42 – 6(n + 1) = 0  ⇒  42 – 6n – 6 = 0  
⇒ 36 – 6n = 0  ⇒  n = 6.

So there are 6 daughters.

Step 4.  Initial number of pearls.
P₁ = 42 – 6·1 = 36.

Verification of the whole process:

Start   36  
Girl 1: takes 1 + (35)/7 = 1 + 5 = 6  → 30 left  
Girl 2: takes 2 + (28)/7 = 2 + 4 = 6  → 24 left  
Girl 3: takes 3 + (21)/7 = 3 + 3 = 6  → 18 left  
Girl 4: takes 4 + (14)/7 = 4 + 2 = 6  → 12 left  
Girl 5: takes 5 + (7)/7  = 5 + 1 = 6  →  6 left  
Girl 6: takes 6 + (0)/7  = 6 + 0 = 6  →  0 left.

Each girl indeed gets 6 pearls and none remain.

181,"Question: Consider the two lines AO and BO.  These two lines intersect at point O and are perpendicular to each other.
If you were to draw a circle that were to intersect these two lines at points A and B and only at points A and B, what would be the smallest integral size of the larger arc AB in degrees?
 Hint: Integral means ""in integers"".
An arc is a portion of a circle.","Integral means ""in integers"".
An arc is a portion of a circle.","181 degrees.
If you created a circle with points A, B, and O on it, since angle AOB is a right angle, line AB is the diameter of this circle.  Therefore, arc AB would be 180 degrees if it actually were to intersect O as well as A and B.
However, the problem says the arc can only intersect A and B. To do this, the circle must be slightly larger than the one described above. As stated in the problem, the larger arc must be the next largest integer size, which is 181 degrees.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Because each line meets the circle in only one point, both AO and BO are tangents to the circle at A and B respectively.  
For a circle, the angle θ between two tangents drawn from an external point equals 180° minus the measure of the minor intercepted arc:

θ = 180° − m(arc AB_minor).

Here the two tangents are perpendicular, so θ = ∠AOB = 90°.  
Therefore

90° = 180° − m(arc AB_minor)  
⇒ m(arc AB_minor) = 180° − 90° = 90°.

A circle has 360°. The larger (major) arc AB is the remainder of the circumference:

m(arc AB_major) = 360° − 90° = 270°.

Thus the smallest integer measure of the larger arc AB is 270 degrees.

Given: E₁ = 27.

1. Second quarter  
   Points scored in the 2nd quarter = E₂ − E₁.  
   By the problem statement, those points also equal ½ E₂ − 1.

Kurt finally gave in, and agreed to go in with Rod on a minimum special order of the multi-colored treats.  When the box arrived, they divided the bounty as originally planned.
""Interesting,"" Kurt noted, ""that the number of Rnkfurers you got is the same integer as my percentage.""
Rod did a little mental math.  ""You're right,"" he noted, ""and I think that's the lowest pair of integers we could do that with.""
""Maybe; the next largest set is trivial.  50 Rnkfurers each, and then we'd each have the percentage the other guy got: 50% and 50 Rnkfurers each.""
Kurt unwrapped a Rnkfurer and took his first bite.  He glowed with pleasure for half a minute, and then spoke quietly.
""Rod, how many of these in a case?""
""Fifty.""
""I think we'd better order a few.  And this time, it's my turn to get more than you do.""

How many did each boy get each time?
 Hint: Although there are a dozen pairs of numbers that satisfy the percentage condition, the three used in the story are the only ones in which each boy gets fewer than 100 Rnkfurers.","Although there are a dozen pairs of numbers that satisfy the percentage condition, the three used in the story are the only ones in which each boy gets fewer than 100 Rnkfurers.","1st order: Rod 20, Kurt  5.

Another way to look at this is
K = R*R/(100-R)",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

 R  = the number Rod receives  
 K  = the number Kurt receives  
 T  = the total in the shipment (so R + K = T).

The condition that is always to be met is

 “the number Rod gets equals Kurt’s percentage of the total.”

That means                                   (1)
 Kurt’s % = R  so  K = (R / 100)·T.

Using R + K = T we obtain

 R + (R / 100)·T = T  
 ⇔ 100R + RT = 100T  
 ⇔ T(R – 100) = –100R  
 ⇔ T = 100R / (100 – R).         (2)

For T to be an integer the denominator 100 – R must divide the numerator 100R.
Write s = 100 – R (so 1 ≤ s ≤ 99 and R = 100 – s).  
Then (2) becomes

 T = 100·(100 – s)/s = 10000/s – 100.

Thus s must be a divisor of 10000 (= 2⁴·5⁴).  
The proper divisors of 10000 that are < 100 are

  s = 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 80.

 50   50    100       50
 40   60    150       90

Hence there are exactly three possibilities in which each boy gets under 100 Rnkfurers:

 1) 25 in all → Rod 20, Kurt 5.  
 2) 100 in all → Rod 50, Kurt 50.  
 3) 150 in all → Rod 60, Kurt 90.

Now match them to the dialogue.

First order (the “minimum special order”)  
 Rod 20  Kurt 5  (total 25).  
 Rod observes this is the smallest such pair.

“Next largest set is trivial … 50 each … 50 %”

Final order (Kurt wants more, can’t store > 100)  
 Rod 60  Kurt 90  (total 150 = three 50-item cases).

All three distributions satisfy condition (1) and keep both boys below 100 pieces, and they are exactly the three possibilities promised in the hint.

1.  Interpret the cryptarithm  
   FA × A = CF means (10 F + A)·A = 10 C + F, etc., with the eight letters A–H being the eight digits 1–8 used once each.  
   The equations are  
   (i)  (10F + A)·A = 10C + F  
   (ii) (10D + G)·A = 10B + A  
   (iii) H·E = 10D + H  
   (iv) F·A = C  
   together with G = 1.

2.  Use (i) and (iv) together.  
   From (iv) C = F·A.  
   Substitute that into (i):

        (10F + A)·A = 10(F·A) + F
        10FA + A²   = 10FA + F
        A²          = F.

   Thus F must equal the square of A.  
   Among the digits 1–8 the only square in this range is 4 = 2².  
   Therefore A = 2 and F = 4, and from (iv) C = 4·2 = 8.

3.  Use (ii) with G = 1 and A = 2.  
   (10D + 1)·2 = 10B + 2  
   20D + 2     = 10B + 2  
   20D         = 10B  
   2D          =  B.

   Hence B is twice D and must still be a digit 1–8 not yet used.  
   The only possibility is D = 3 and B = 6 (since D = 1,2,4 are already taken or duplicated, and D = 4 would make B = 8 which is already C).

4.  Use (iii) with D = 3.  
   H·E = 10·3 + H = 30 + H  
   H(E – 1) = 30.

   The remaining unused digits are 5 and 7.  
   Test the two ways to assign them:

        H = 5, E = 7  ⇒  5·(7 – 1) = 5·6 = 30  ✓
        H = 7, E = 5  ⇒  7·(5 – 1) = 7·4 = 28  ✗

   Thus H = 5 and E = 7.

5.  Collect the assignments (all digits 1–8 now used exactly once):

        A = 2
        B = 6
        C = 8
        D = 3
        E = 7
        F = 4
        G = 1
        H = 5

6.  Verify every original equation:

        FA·A = 42·2 = 84 = CF        ✓
        DG·A = 31·2 = 62 = BA        ✓
        H·E  = 5·7   = 35 = DH       ✓
        F·A  = 4·2   = 8  = C        ✓

All conditions are satisfied.

P = a₁ a₂ … a_k is as large as possible.

Step 1.  No 1’s can appear.  
If some summand were 1, replacing 1 + x (x ≥ 2) by the single number x+1 keeps the sum the same and multiplies the product by (x+1)/x > 1.

Step 2.  No summand should exceed 4.  
For any a ≥ 5, compare  
a vs. 2 + (a–2).  
The new product is 2(a–2) and  
2(a–2)/a = 2 – 4/a > 1,  
so splitting off a 2 always increases the product.  
Thus every summand is 2, 3 or 4.

Step 3.  Favour 3’s over 4’s.  
Because 4 = 2+2 and 2·2 = 4, replacing a 4 by two 2’s never hurts, and  
3·3 = 9 > 2·2·2 = 8,  
so two 3’s give a larger product than three 2’s that use the same total (6).  
Hence the product is maximised when we use as many 3’s as possible and 2’s only to take care of the remainder.

Step 4.  Apply the rule to 20.  
Divide 20 by 3: 20 = 3·6 + 2.  
So take six 3’s and one 2:

20 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2.

Their product is  
P = 3⁶ · 2 = 729 · 2 = 1458.

Step 5.  Verify it is indeed maximal among all (2,3)-partitions.  
Let r be the number of 2’s and t the number of 3’s.  
2r + 3t = 20  and P = 2ʳ 3ᵗ.

The possibilities are
t = 0 → r = 10 → P = 2¹⁰ = 1024

t = 4 → r = 4  → P = 2⁴·3⁴ = 1296

Therefore no larger product exists.

Because B is five times S, B is the “denominator’’ in the 1 : 5 ratio, and the hint tells us B must end in 5.  
Therefore the units digit d of S satisfies 5·d ≡ 5 (mod 10).  
With digits 1–9 that gives d ∈ {1,3,7,9}.  
If d=1 the product 5·d has no carry, but 5·(any non-zero even c) ends in 0 and 5·(any odd c) ends in 5, so a tens digit of 0 or a repeated 5 is forced – impossible.  
Hence d ≠ 1.  Take the next possibility d = 3.

Write S = abcd with d=3.  
Multiplying by 5 from right to left:

Units place: 5·3 = 15 → B ends in 5, carry 1.

Tens place: 5·c + 1 must give a digit different from 0 or 5.  
Choosing c = 2 gives 5·2 + 1 = 11 → tens digit 1 and carry 1.  
(Other choices produce a 0 or a repeated 5 or fail later.)

Hundreds place: carry is 1, so hundreds digit is 5·b + 1.  
Taking b = 7 gives 5·7 + 1 = 36 → hundreds digit 6, carry 3

Thousands place: carry is 3, so thousands digit is 5·a + 3.  
With a = 9 we get 5·9 + 3 = 48 → thousands digit 8, carry 4.

189,"Question: A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?
 Hint: You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

L  = length of the bridge (km)  
v  = running speed of the man (km/h)  
D  = present distance of the train from A (km) when the man hears it.  

The man is 3/8 of the way from A toward B, so

distance A → man = 3/8 L,      distance man → B = 5/8 L.

Train speed = 80 km/h.

----------------------------------------------------
1.  Man runs back to A

Time for the man to return to A  
t₁ = (3/8 L) / v.

The train must cover distance D in this same time, so  
80 t₁ = D.                                             (1)

----------------------------------------------------
2.  Man runs forward to B

Time for the man to reach B  
t₂ = (5/8 L) / v.

In this time the train travels from its present position to B, a distance D + L, so  
80 t₂ = D + L.                                        (2)

----------------------------------------------------
Substitute the expressions for t₁ and t₂.

(1) 80 · (3/8 L)/v = D  ⇨ D = 30 L / v.

(2) 80 · (5/8 L)/v = D + L  
  ⇒ 50 L / v = D + L.

Insert D from (1) into (2):

50 L / v = (30 L / v) + L.

Subtract 30 L / v from both sides:

20 L / v = L.

Divide by L (L ≠ 0):

20 / v = 1  ⇨ v = 20 km/h.

Thus the man’s running speed is 20 kilometres per hour, which is about 12.4 miles per hour.

Final answer: 20 km/h",True
190,"Question: In a chess tournament conducted by the Romankachi World Chess Federation, every person played one game with every other person in the group.

Let N be the number of men in the tournament.
Then the number of games played by men between themselves

The number of games played by men with women

(since there were 4 women in the tournament)
It is given that the total number of games that men played between themselves exceeded those played by men with women by 18.
Hence
N*(N-1)/2 - 4*N = 18
N*(N-1) - 8*N = 36
N*N - N - 8*N = 36
N^2 - 9*N - 36 = 0
Factorizing we get,
N^2 - 12*N + 3*N - 36 = 0
N*(N - 12) + 3*(N - 12) = 0
(N - 12)(N + 3) = 0
Hence N = 12 or -3 (not possible).
Hence the number of men in the chess tournament

Rewrite each condition and its contrapositive.

(1)  ¬(4|n)  ⇒  60 ≤ n ≤ 69

     So any number in 50–59 or 70–79 must be a multiple of 4.

(2)  3|n  ⇒  50 ≤ n ≤ 59

     Hence any number in 60–79 is NOT a multiple of 3.

(3)  ¬(6|n)  ⇒  70 ≤ n ≤ 79  
     contrapositive: n ∈ [50,69]  ⇒  6|n.  
     Thus every number in 50–69 must be a multiple of 6.

Now examine each decade.

A. 50–59  
    Must be a multiple of 4 (from 1) and of 6 (from 3) ⇒ multiple of lcm(4,6)=12.  
    The only nearby multiples of 12 are 48 and 60, so no integer in 50–59 works.

B. 60–69  
    Must be a multiple of 6 (from 3) but NOT a multiple of 3 (from 2).  
    Impossible, because every multiple of 6 is automatically a multiple of 3.  
    Hence no integer in 60–69 works.

C. 70–79  
    Must be a multiple of 4 (from 1) and NOT a multiple of 3 (from 2).  
    Multiples of 4 in this decade are 72 and 76.  
        72 is divisible by 3 → forbidden.  
        76 is not divisible by 3 → allowed.

Finally, check n = 76 against the original statements:

• n is NOT a multiple of 4?  False (76 is a multiple of 4), so statement 1 is satisfied.  
• n is a multiple of 3?  False, so statement 2 is satisfied.  
• n is NOT a multiple of 6?  True (6∤76) and 76 ∈ 70–79, so statement 3 is satisfied.

All three conditions hold, and 76 is the only integer that does so.

2.  Use the data already given  
   A = 9, E = 7 and (from the hint) L = 6.

3.  Units column  
   T + S + 9 + 7 = T  (units) + 10·c₁  
   ⇒ S + 16 ≡ 0 (mod 10) ⇒ S = 4  
   Sum = T + 20, so the carry c₁ = 2.

4.  Tens column  
   I + 7 + 6 + 2 = R + 10·c₂ ⟹ I + 15 = R + 10·c₂

   Testing the only admissible carries (c₂ = 1 or 2):

        I = 8  →  R = 3  and  c₂ = 2

   (All other I either duplicate a digit already used or give an impossible carry.)  
   Thus I = 8, R = 3, c₂ = 2.

5.  Hundreds column  
   K + T + c₂ = O + 10·c₃ ⇒ K + T + 2 = O  (because c₃ ≤ 1)

6.  Thousands column  
   9 + T + c₃ = F + 10·c₄                                   (1)

   Equation (2) gives F = T – 1 and forces c₄ = 1.  
   Substituting c₄ = 1 in (1) yields c₃ = 0.

8.  Hundred-thousands column  
   6 + c₅ = 7 ⇒ c₅ = 1, agreeing with the previous carries.

9.  Determine T and F  
   Digits still unused: 0,1,2,5.  
   Because F = T – 1, the only possible pairs are (T, F) = (1,0) or (2,1).  
   Pair (2,1) fails (it forces a duplicate digit in the hundreds column), so  
   T = 1 and F = 0.

10.  Find K and O from step 5  
    K + 1 + 2 = O, digits left {2,5}.

Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?

Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result.

There are 42 matches in the box with which he could form a triangle 20, 15, 7, with an area of 42 square inches.

After using another 6, the 24 remaining would form a triangle 10, 8, 6, with an area of 24 square inches.
Thus, there are two possible answers. There were either 42 or 36 matches in the match-box.
Also it is interesting to know that there are just 5 such triangles for which the perimeter and the area is the same (assuming all sides are integers) and they are :
24 (10, 8, 6)
30 (13, 12, 5)
36 (17, 10, 9)

a , b , c  (in inches),

and its semi-perimeter is              p = n/2 .

Because each match is 1-inch long, the number of matches used equals the perimeter n.  
The problem says that the area Δ of the triangle also equals n, so

Δ = n .                                                    (1)

Heron’s formula gives

Δ² = p(p – a)(p – b)(p – c).                              (2)

Putting (1) into (2) and writing x = p – a,  y = p – b,  z = p – c, we obtain

p x y z = n² = (2p)²  ⇒  x y z = 4p.                     (3)

But x + y + z = p (because a + b + c = 2p), so the positive integers x, y, z must satisfy

x + y + z = p, x y z = 4p.                               (4)

(If n is even, p is an integer and so are x, y, z.  
If n is odd, p is half–integral and at least one of x, y, z would be non-integral; then at least
one of a, b, c would not be integral.  Because the matches are whole inches, n must therefore be even.)

Hence we only have to examine integral p ≤ 25 (because n ≤ 50) that satisfy (4).

Systematically factoring 4p and searching for three integral factors whose sum is p gives

 p = 12 : 2·4·6  (sum 12, product 48 = 4·12)  
 p = 15 : 2·3·10 (sum 15, product 60 = 4·15)

 p = 21 : 1·6·14 (sum 21, product 84 = 4·21)

No other p ≤ 25 works, so the only even perimeters not exceeding 50 that can be “equable” (area = perimeter) are

n = 2p ∈ {24, 30, 36, 42}.                               (5)

Ade has to be able to do the same trick after removing 6 matches twice more, i.e. for n, n – 6, n – 12.  
Thus all three numbers must belong to the set (5).

From (5) we read off the only possibilities:

n = 36 (giving 36, 30, 24) or n = 42 (giving 42, 36, 30).  (6)

Both values really work, and explicit triangles are

24 matches :  6-8-10  (area 24)  
30 matches :  5-12-13  (area 30)  
36 matches :  9-10-17  (area 36)  
42 matches :  7-15-20  (area 42)

Hence Ade could originally have had

2.  E – F = G  ⇒  G = E – F.  
3.  H + D = G  ⇒  D = G – H = (E – F) – H.  
4.  E – C = D together with F + H = C gives C = F + H and D = E – C.  
   All relations are consistent if the largest number 21 is A.  
   The only pair giving 21 and compatible with G = E – F is (H,G) = (8, 13).  
   Then E = 15 and F = 2 (because 15 – 2 = 13).  
   Now D = 13 – 8 = 5 and C = 2 + 8 = 10.  
   Finally B = 21 – 15 = 6.  
All eight numbers are used once and all equations hold.

Group 2    (values 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13, 17, 22)
1.  From C – D = G and D + F = G  ⇒  C = 2D + F.  
   Hence C is the largest number, so C = 22.  
2.  22 = 2D + F gives the possibilities (D,F) = (5, 12) or (9, 4).  
   The second makes F – A negative, so choose D = 5, F = 12, whence G = 17.  
3.  A = H + D = H + 5 must be < F so A = 9 and H = 4.  
4.  E = F – A = 12 – 9 = 3;  B = C – A = 22 – 9 = 13.  
All equations are satisfied.

2.  D – B = A  ⇒  D = 2A + 2H = 2G.  
3.  E + F = D  ⇒  E + F = 2G;  also A + E = C and F – C = H.  
   From these, E = G/2; hence G must be even.  
   The only feasible pairs are (E,G) = (5, 10) or (10, 20); the latter gives D = 40, impossible.  
   So E = 5, G = 10, D = 20, and F = 15 (since 5 + 15 = 20).  
4.  With C = A + 5 and 15 – C = H, we obtain H = 10 – A.  
   Choosing (A,H) = (6, 4) (the alternative (4, 6) makes B = 16, not available) gives

198,"Question: Detective Grant was inspecting the scene of the crime. The 50-year-old victim, Joe, had been poisoned by a candy containing cyanide. On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table. John, 46, was found with 5 candies the day after a 4-yr sentence had been turned over a week ago. Jim, 35, had gotten off a 5-yr sentence a few days ago, only to be found dead with 6 candies yesterday.
Grant puzzled over these cases for days, and then -boom- it hit him. There was a pattern in these murders! What pattern did Grant spot?
Each suspect ate a candy before they died.
Life expectancy when the murders were committed was 70 years.
(It was also curious that many criminals had been let off their sentences too, but had not been killed. 23, in fact, had gotten off.)

He then went to the criminal's house, and offered him a chance to gamble his life, or go to jail. George offered him a certain number of candies, one of which was poisoned. If the criminal chose a poisoned candy, he died. If he chose a pure candy, he lived.
The criminal's remaining life expectancy divided by his prison sentence would be the number of candies George would bring him, one of which might kill him. In the case of Joe:
His remaining life expectancy at age 50 was 20. 20 divided by 2(his sentence) is 10. George brought him 10 candies, one of which was poisoned. Joe ate the poisoned one, and left nine on the table.

In other words,

Checking the four victims:

1. Joe   A = 50, S = 2 ⇒ T = (70–50)/2 = 10 ⇒ C = 9 (10 candies placed, 1 eaten).
2. Jeff  A = 30, S =10 ⇒ T = (70–30)/10 = 4 ⇒ C = 3.

4. Jim   A = 35, S = 5 ⇒ T = (70–35)/5 = 7 ⇒ C = 6.

All four satisfy equation (1) exactly.

Thus the pattern is:

“The killer chooses an ex-convict whose age A and sentence S make (70–A) divisible by S; he then places T = (70–A)/S identical candies, poisons one of them, and leaves the remaining C = T–1 candies on the table. Consequently A + S·T always equals the 70-year life-expectancy.”

w₁ < w₂ < w₃ < w₄ .

Because the statement says the weights are “in a common ratio”, write

w₁ = a , w₂ = ar , w₃ = ar² , w₄ = ar³ , with integers a ≥ 1 , r ≥ 2. (1)

Step 1 – The lightest weight.
Lester must be able to weigh exactly 1 kg of wheat, so the lightest weight itself must be 1 kg; hence a = 1.  
Thus the four weights are 1, r, r², r³ kilograms. (2)

Step 2 – The largest amount that can be weighed.
On a balance a weight can be put on either pan, so the greatest difference that can be obtained is obtained by placing all four weights on the same side:

maximum possible difference = 1 + r + r² + r³ . (3)

This value must be at least 40 kg, because Lester has to be able to weigh up to 40 kg.  
For r = 2 : 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15 < 40 (insufficient).  
For r = 3 : 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 (exactly what is needed).  
For r ≥ 4 the sum already exceeds 40, so condition (3) is satisfied, but we must still be able to reach every integer from 1 to 40; that will turn out to be impossible.

Step 3 – Small amounts when r ≥ 4 are impossible.
If r ≥ 4 the second weight is at least 4 kg.  With the two smallest weights (1 and ≥4) the set of positive differences obtainable is  
{1, 3, 4, 5}.  
The value 2 kg cannot be formed, so r ≥ 4 is impossible.

Hence r must be 3, and by (2) the weights are  

1 kg, 3 kg, 9 kg, 27 kg. (4)

Step 4 – Verifying that every amount 1–40 can be weighed.
Any integer N with 0 ≤ N ≤ 40 can be written uniquely in balanced-ternary form

N = ε₀·1 + ε₁·3 + ε₂·9 + ε₃·27 where each εᵢ ∈ {-1, 0, 1}. (5)

(Construct this by taking the ordinary base-3 expression and replacing every “2” by “-1” with a carry of 1 to the next digit.)

To weigh N kilograms of wheat:

• put on the left pan the wheat plus every weight whose εᵢ = 1,  
• put on the right pan every weight whose εᵢ = −1.

The balance then reads equal because the algebraic sum (5) is N.  
Because every integer 1–40 has such a balanced-ternary expansion, all those amounts are obtainable.

Example: To weigh 23 kg, balanced-ternary gives 23 = 1·27 + 0·9 − 1·3 − 1·1.  
Place the wheat, together with the 27-kg weight, on the left pan and the 3-kg and 1-kg weights on the right pan.

Thus the four weights 1 kg, 3 kg, 9 kg and 27 kg satisfy all the requirements, and no other common-ratio set can do so.

(1) w + 2b = 1.98  
(2) w + 4f = 2.48  
(3) w + f + 3a = 2.99  

Because there are four unknowns but only three equations, the individual prices cannot be determined (as the hint states).  Nevertheless, we can still find the total cost of 1 lb of every kind of nut, S = w + b + f + a.

Step 1.  Eliminate w between (1) and (2):

From (1): w = 1.98 – 2b  
From (2): w = 2.48 – 4f

Insert into (3):  
(2.48 – 4f) + f + 3a = 2.99

S = w + (2f – 0.25) + f + (f + 0.17)  (using 4′ and 5′)  
  = w + 4f – 0.08

But w = 2.48 – 4f (from equation 2), so

S = (2.48 – 4f) + 4f – 0.08  
  = 2.48 – 0.08  
  = 2.40

Notice the variable f cancels out; hence S is uniquely determined even though the individual prices are not.

201,"Question: Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Snow, there lived the fair Princess Miyuki, who had always been fascinated by fairy tales and the stories of the wonders of the world. She believed that her sleeping, handsome prince was cursed to be one of the mummies in the pyramids of Egypt, and when she was done being Fantaghiro-saving-her-Romualdo, her prince would then build a beautiful palace as a monument of their love (which of course would be more beautiful than Taj Mahal) where both of them will live happily ever after...
So, you see, that's why Princess Miyuki had refused each and every love declaration or marriage proposal that came her way.
But of course, what's a story without the brave and wise heroic prince? Here comes Prince Hajikidama of the Marbles Kingdom. He's no mummy, but his brilliant(?) brain deduced that in order to win the princess' heart, he'd have to give her what she wanted most - her fantasy, and his token of understanding (her childish delusional nature).
In the end, labouring his mind's creativity department for all its worth, Prince Hajikidama decided that a 'Mountain of Love', reaching so high it collected the never-fallen-snow in Marbles Kingdom, might do the trick. That actually is a tetrahedral-shaped (pyramid with 4 equilateral triangular faces) crystallic marbles-made structure (like a giant pile of apples or oranges at a greengrocer's store) consisting of one marble crowning on the top layer, three on the next-to-top layer, six on the third layer, ten on the fourth layer, and so forth.

 Hint: Mr. Collins's answer key gives the actual dimensions of the yard; he didn't realize there were two other answers from the hints he gave.",Mr. Collins's answer key gives the actual dimensions of the yard; he didn't realize there were two other answers from the hints he gave.,"37 feet.
There are three triangles that fit the given hints, having sides
40, 42, 58
24, 70, 74
15, 112, 113
From the students' comments, we know that the Collins yard has the middle-sized hypotenuse.
A right triangle inscribes neatly into a semicircle, with the hypotenuse forming a diameter.  The shortest rope needed to reach all points is one staked at the midpoint of the hypotenuse, forming a radius of the circle.  74/2 = 37 feet.
The blond student found the first answer above, and would have used a rope of 29 feet.  The other student figured it at 113/2, or 56.5 feet.
Historical note:
Lewis Carroll searched for the answer to the basic mathematical problem, sent to him by a reader.  He found two right triangles with the same area, but couldn't discover a set of three.  Somewhat ironically, Carroll had found 20-21-29 and 12-35-37.  Had he doubled their dimensions, he would have had the first two triangles above, and quite likely would have found the third.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the two legs of the right–triangle yard be a ft and b ft (a ≤ b) and let the hypotenuse be c ft.  

1.  The area condition.  
   ½ab = 840 ⇒ ab = 1680. (1)

2.  The right–triangle (Pythagorean) condition.  
   a² + b² = c², with a, b, c integers. (2)

3.  Where to put the stake.  
   The smallest circle that contains a triangle is its circumscribed circle.  
   For a right triangle the centre of that circle is the midpoint of the
   hypotenuse, so the radius that is needed equals half the hypotenuse:
   rope-length = c⁄2. (3)

Thus the whole problem reduces to finding every integer solution of (1) and (2).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Finding all integer right triangles with area 840 ft²
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Because ab is fixed (1680) only finitely many possibilities exist.  
Listing the divisors of 1680 that do not exceed √1680 ≈ 41 gives

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 24, 28, 30, 35, 40.

Matching each a with b = 1680/a and testing a² + b² for being a perfect
square yields exactly three successes:

• a = 15, b = 112 ⇒ 15² + 112² = 225 + 12544 = 12769 = 113²  
  Triangle (15, 112, 113)

• a = 24, b = 70 ⇒ 24² + 70² = 576 + 4900 = 5476 = 74²  
  Triangle (24, 70, 74)

• a = 40, b = 42 ⇒ 40² + 42² = 1600 + 1764 = 3364 = 58²  
  Triangle (40, 42, 58)

No other divisor pair works, so there are exactly three integer right
triangles having area 840 ft².

--------------------------------------------------------------------
The three possible rope lengths
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Using (3):

(15, 112, 113) → c⁄2 = 113⁄2 = 56½ ft  
(24, 70, 74)  → c⁄2 = 74⁄2  = 37   ft  
(40, 42, 58)  → c⁄2 = 58⁄2  = 29   ft

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Which one was on Mr. Collins’s key?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The blond student said the correct answer was “8 feet shorter” than
Mr. Collins’s, while the other student said it was “a lot longer.”
The only pair that differs by exactly 8 ft is 37 ft and 29 ft
(56½ ft is 19½ ft longer than 37 ft).  
Hence Mr. Collins had the 37-ft answer, the blond student had 29 ft, and
the other student had 56½ ft.

Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Collins really needed 37 feet of rope.

206,"Question: Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)
 Hint: Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

p = selling price per box (in dollars)  
q = number of boxes sold per week  

1.  Fixed cost per box  
At the observed point  

price = \$5.95, profit per box = \$1.75  

⇒ cost per box = 5.95 − 1.75 = \$4.20  
(The cost does not change with price.)

2.  Express price and sales in terms of one variable  
Each \$0.20 change in price alters sales by 25 boxes.  
Let n be the number of \$0.20 price reductions (n may be negative if the price is raised).

price p(n) = 5.95 − 0.20 n  
sales q(n) = 100  + 25 n

3.  Weekly profit as a function of n  
profit per box = p(n) − 4.20 = (5.95 − 0.20 n) − 4.20 = 1.75 − 0.20 n  

Weekly profit  
P(n) = (profit per box)(boxes sold)  
    = (1.75 − 0.20 n)(100 + 25 n)  

Expand:  
P(n) = 175 + 23.75 n − 5 n²

4.  Locate the maximum (continuous case)  
P(n) is a downward-opening parabola (a = −5 < 0).  
Vertex at n* = −b/(2a) = −23.75 /(2·−5) = 23.75 / 10 = 2.375  

Corresponding price  
p* = 5.95 − 0.20 (2.375) = \$5.475 ≈ \$5.48

5.  Price changes are restricted to \$0.20 steps  
Because the relationship is stated per \$0.20 change, n must be an integer.  
Check the two nearest integers:

n = 2: P(2) = 175 + 23.75·2 − 5·4 = \$202.50  
price = 5.95 − 0.20·2 = \$5.55  

n = 3: P(3) = 175 + 23.75·3 − 5·9 = \$201.25  
price = 5.95 − 0.20·3 = \$5.35  

Since \$202.50 > \$201.25, the larger profit occurs at n = 2.

Optimum (allowing only the given \$0.20 increments):

price = \$5.95 − \$0.40 = \$5.55 per box  
weekly profit = \$202.50.

Final answer: \$5.55 per box.",True

""Each letter in the equation represents a different digit,"" said the troll. ""The letters in the password represent 3651.""
So, what is the password?
 Hint: There is some casework to be done on D; obviously we have that S = 1",There is some casework to be done on D; obviously we have that S = 1,"The password is LENS.
Since SL-D=3 or (SL-1)-D=3 (meaning SL-D=4), and since the highest possible sum of two different one-digit numbers is 17, S must equal 1.
Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.
Suppose D=7. Then L is 0 or 1, and since S=1, L=0. A must be 1 or 2, but since S=1, A=2.
Suppose D=8. Then L is 1 or 2, and since S=1, L=2. A must be 2 or 3, but since L=2, A=3.
Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.
Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.
If D=7, then L=0. But since 10-7=3, D cannot be 7.
If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.
If E=4, then N=3. But if D=8, A=3, and if D=9, L=3 and A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=5, then since 1I-E=6, I=1. But since S=1, this cannot work.
If E=7, then I=3. But if D=8, then A=3, and if D=9, then L=3. So this cannot work.
If E=8, then I=4, and D cannot be 8. But if D=9, then A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=9, then N=8, and D cannot be 8 or 9. So this cannot work.
Therefore, E=6, N=5, and I=2. If D=8, then L=2, so D must equal 9. This means:
S=1, I=2, L=3, A=4, N=5, E=6, and D=9.

Working from the units column leftward, let b₀,b₁,b₂,b₃ be the successive borrows.

1.  Units: E – N ≡ 1 (mod 10).  
   • No borrow (b₀=0): E – N = 1.  
   • Borrow   (b₀=1): E = 0, N = 9.  

2.  Tens: D – A – b₀ + 10b₁ = 5.  

3.  Hundreds: I – E – b₁ + 10b₂ = 6.  

4.  Thousands: L – D – b₂ + 10b₃ = 3,  
   and because the result has only four digits, S – b₃ = 0, so S = 1 and b₃ = 1.

CASE 1 – no borrow in the units column (b₀ = 0):

E – N = 1 ⇒ N = E – 1.  
From the tens column with b₀=0:

a) b₁ = 0 ⇒ D = A + 5.  
   Proceeding through the hundreds and thousands columns shows this branch gives no admissible digits.

b) b₁ = 1 ⇒ D = A – 5 (A≥5).  
   This branch is also impossible after the hundreds column is checked.

Hence every possibility with b₀ = 0 fails.

CASE 2 – borrow in the units column (b₀ = 1):

Then E = 0, N = 9.  
Tens column: D – A – 1 + 10b₁ = 5 → D – A + 10b₁ = 6.

a) b₁ = 0 ⇒ D = A + 6 (A≤3).  
   After the hundreds column (I=6, b₂=0) the thousands column forces either L=1 (duplicate of S) or D=N (duplicate), so impossible.

b) b₁ = 1 ⇒ D = A – 4 (A≥4).  
   Hundreds column now yields I – 1 + 10b₂ = 6.

   • b₂ = 0 ⇒ I = 7, and thousands column gives L = D – 7 = A – 11 (<0); impossible.  
   • b₂ = 1 gives a negative I, also impossible.

So CASE 2 is impossible.

Returning to CASE 1, branch (a) with b₂ = 1 was the only one not yet exhausted:

• Units: E – N = 1 (b₀=0).  
• Tens: b₁=0, D = A + 5.  
• Hundreds: b₂=1, I = E – 4.  
• Thousands: L = D +1 – 7 = D – 6.

Choosing A=4 (the largest value that keeps all digits 0–9 and distinct) gives

A = 4,  D = 9,  L = 3.

Now pick E so that E≥4, all digits are distinct, and I=E–4 is also new:

E = 6  →  I = 2,  N = 5.

The complete assignment is

S=1, L=3, I=2, D=9, E=6, A=4, N=5.

England → 41  
France → 34  
Peru → 20  
Brazil → 34  
Greece → 30  
Japan → 27  

Step 1 – Search for a simple letter–number rule  
Notice that 13, 20, 27, 30, 34, 41 can all be obtained from small integer combinations of the two kinds of letters every word contains – vowels and consonants.  
Try writing each number as a𝑣 + b𝑐, where  
•  𝑣 = number of vowels in the country’s name (counting repeated vowels),  
•  𝑐 = number of consonants in the name.

Step 2 – Determine the coefficients  
Take the two shortest names to find the coefficients.

USA  
 𝑣 = 2  (U, A)  
 𝑐 = 1  (S)  
 a·2 + b·1 = 13          (1)

Peru  
 𝑣 = 2  (E, U)  
 𝑐 = 2  (P, R)  
 a·2 + b·2 = 20                   (2)

Subtract (1) from (2): b = 7.  
Substitute b = 7 into (1): 2a + 7 = 13 ⇒ a = 3.

So every vowel is worth 3 and every consonant is worth 7.

Step 3 – Verify the rule with the remaining countries

England: 𝑣 = 2, 𝑐 = 5 → 3·2 + 7·5 = 6 + 35 = 41 ✔  
France: 𝑣 = 2, 𝑐 = 4 → 3·2 + 7·4 = 6 + 28 = 34 ✔  
Brazil: 𝑣 = 2, 𝑐 = 4 → 3·2 + 7·4 = 34 ✔  
Greece: 𝑣 = 3, 𝑐 = 3 → 3·3 + 7·3 = 9 + 21 = 30 ✔  
Japan: 𝑣 = 2, 𝑐 = 3 → 3·2 + 7·3 = 6 + 21 = 27 ✔  

The rule works for every given country:  

population (in thousands) = 3 × (number of vowels) + 7 × (number of consonants).

Step 4 – Apply the rule to Tibet  
Tibet = T I B E T  
 Vowels: I, E → 𝑣 = 2  
 Consonants: T, B, T → 𝑐 = 3  

Population (in thousands) = 3·2 + 7·3 = 6 + 21 = 27.

There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100, neither of which is prime.  (No, 1 is not prime.)  So you will walk in an expanding square with sides of length 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 feet.  This is a total of 1060 feet.
The net result of your turns will be that you are 56 feet ahead of your starting position.
(2+11+23+41+59+73+97)
- (5+17+31+47+67+83)
You will also be 48 feet to the left of your starting position.
(7+19+37+53+71+89)
- (3+13+29+43+61+79)
To calculate the distance back to the starting position, calculate the length of the hypotenuse of the right angle triangle with legs that are 56 and 48 feet long.  This is 73.756 feet, or 73 feet, 9 inches.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"a)  The distance actually walked  
All you ever do in part (a) is add together every prime number that is < 100.

2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31 + 37 + 41 + 43 + 47 + 53 + 59 + 61 + 67 + 71 + 73 + 79 + 83 + 89 + 97  
= 1060 ft.

Hence the total length of the walk is 1 060 feet.

b)  The straight-line distance back to the start  

Because a right turn is made after every prime, the directions repeat E, S, W, N, E, S, … .
Separate the primes according to the direction in which they are travelled.

East: 2 + 11 + 23 + 41 + 59 + 73 + 97 = 306  
West: 5 + 17 + 31 + 47 + 67 + 83 = 250  

North: 7 + 19 + 37 + 53 + 71 + 89 = 276  
South: 3 + 13 + 29 + 43 + 61 + 79 = 228

Hence the coordinates of the finishing point, taking the start as (0, 0), are

x = 306 − 250 = 56 feet (56 ft east)  
y = 276 − 228 = 48 feet (48 ft north)

The straight-line distance back to the origin is therefore

√(56² + 48²) = √(3136 + 2304) = √5440  
= 8 √85 ≈ 73.76 ft.

Convert 0.76 ft to inches: 0.76 × 12 ≈ 9.1 in.

So you must walk about 73 ft 9 in (≈ 885 in) to return to your starting point.

Final answer:  a) 1060 feet  b) about 73 feet 9 inches",True

1.  Double each listed distance.  
   Australia   500 → 1000  
   Peru        8000 → 16000  
   India       4500 → 9000  
   Scotland    9500 → 19000  

2.  Ignore the trailing zeros: 1000 → 1, 16000 → 16, 9000 → 9, 19000 → 19.

3.  Those numbers are precisely the alphabetical positions of the first letters of each country:  
   A = 1, P = 16, I = 9, S = 19.

Thus the rule is:

miles listed = 500 × (alphabetical position of the country’s first letter).

For France the first letter is F, whose alphabetical position is 6.

distance listed = 500 × 6 = 3000 miles.

214,"Question: Alec, Brett and Chris each purchased parts for their skateboards at the sports store. Alec and Brett wanted to build new skateboards, so they each needed to purchase a deck, trucks, bearings and wheels. Chris only needed new wheels. The store offers a 10% discount for purchases over $250, so the boys decided to pay for all the parts together to qualify for the discount. Altogether, the boys spent $266.40. The clues below reflect the price of the items before the discount is applied.
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
They each bought the same kinds of wheels. Together they spent $75 for the 3 sets of wheels. Each set contained 4 wheels.
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his. However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Brett spent $3 more on bearings than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
How much did each person spend?
 Hint: Find the total price, then focus on each item separately","Find the total price, then focus on each item separately","Alec spent $113.40.
Brett spent $130.50.
Chris spent $22.50.
Component Alec Brett Chris Total
Deck $50 $45 $0 $95
Trucks 35 40 $0 75
Wheels 25 25 25 75
Bearings 16 35 $0 51
Total before discount $126 $145 $25 $296
less 10% discount $12.60 $14.50 $2.50 $29.60
Amount spent $113.40 $130.50 $22.50 $266.40
Explanation:
First find the original price of all the items combined. $266.40 is the price after the 10% discount was applied.
That means $266.40 is equal to 90% of the original price.
Write an equation and then cross multiply:
266.40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x   =   9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)
Let x = the amount Alec spent on trucks.
x + (x+5) = 75
2x + 5 = 75
2x = 70
x = 35
Alec spent $35 on trucks. Brett spent $5 more than Alec. Therefore, Brett spent $40 on trucks.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51
x + (2x + 3) = 51
3x + 3 = 51
3x = 48
x = 16
Alec's spent $16 on bearings.
Brett spent $35 on bearings",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

D_A , D_B  = decks for Alec and Brett  
T_A , T_B  = trucks for Alec and Brett  
B_A , B_B  = bearings for Alec and Brett  
W          = one set of wheels (all three boys bought the same kind).  

Step 1.  Price of the wheels  
Three identical sets cost \$75, so  
 W = 75 ÷ 3 = \$25.  

Step 2.  Total purchase before the discount  
They paid \$266.40 after a 10 % discount, so the undiscounted total P satisfies  
 0.90 P = 266.40  ⇒  P = 296.  

Step 3.  Bearings  
(i)  Total bearings are \$24 less than total wheels:  
 B_A + B_B = 75 – 24 = \$51.  

(ii)  Brett paid \$3 more than twice Alec for bearings:  
 B_B = 2 B_A + 3.  
Solve:  B_A + 2 B_A + 3 = 51  ⇒  3 B_A = 48  ⇒  B_A = 16,  B_B = 35.  

Step 4.  Alec’s deck  
Total bearings are \$1 more than Alec’s deck:  
 D_A = 51 – 1 = \$50.  

Step 5.  Brett’s deck  
Alec’s deck is \$5 more than Brett’s:  
 D_B = 50 – 5 = \$45.  

Step 6.  Trucks  
Brett’s trucks cost \$5 more than Alec’s:  
 T_B = T_A + 5.  

Step 7.  Use the grand total to find T_A  
Add the known pre-discount costs.  
Alec: 50 + T_A + 16 + 25 = 91 + T_A  
Brett: 45 + (T_A + 5) + 35 + 25 = 110 + T_A  
Chris: 25  

Sum: (91 + T_A) + (110 + T_A) + 25 = 226 + 2 T_A = 296  
⇒ 2 T_A = 70 ⇒ T_A = 35,  T_B = 40.  

Step 8.  Individual totals before discount  
Alec: 50 + 35 + 16 + 25 = \$126  
Brett: 45 + 40 + 35 + 25 = \$145  
Chris: 25  

Check: 126 + 145 + 25 = 296 ✔  

Step 9.  Apply the 10 % discount to each person’s items  
Each person pays 90 % of his own subtotal:  
Alec: 0.90 × 126 = \$113.40  
Brett: 0.90 × 145 = \$130.50  
Chris: 0.90 × 25  = \$22.50  

113.40 + 130.50 + 22.50 = \$266.40 ✔

 Hint: Find the prodution limit of the machines and the intersections of these lines",Find the prodution limit of the machines and the intersections of these lines,"The 10 saws can produce 600 minutes of work per hour (10 saws * 60 minutes).
The 6 lathes can produce 360 minutes of work per hour (6 lathes * 60 minutes).
The 18 sanding machines can produce 1080 minutes of work per hour (18 sanding machines * 60 minutes).
Let c be the number of chairs produced per hour and t the number of tables produced per hour.
The number of saws limit the combination of chairs and tables to 600=10c+5t.
The number of lathes limit the combination of chairs and tables to 360=5c+5t.
The number of sanding machines limit the combination of chairs and tables to 1080=5c+20t.
Next graph these three lines. It should be expected that the answer will lie on the intersection of two of these lines or to make all chairs or all tables. The intersection of the saw and sanding machine line occurs outside of how many chairs the lathe can make so this combination is not a viable answer. The saw and lathe lines cross at 48 chairs and 24 tables. The lathe and sanding machine lines cross at 24 chairs and 48 tables.
Next determine the revenue at all points of intersection.
Chairs    Tables      Revenue

Step 3 : For each fixed b in (1) count the ways to make the remaining amount with dimes, nickels and pennies.  
Define  
f(n) = number of solutions of 10c + 5d + e = n     (c,d,e ≥ 0).

For a given n, choose c first (0 ≤ c ≤ ⌊n/10⌋).  
Put n – 10c = r .  
Then 5d + e = r ; with d running from 0 to ⌊r/5⌋, e is forced.  
Hence, for this c the count is ⌊r/5⌋ + 1.

Therefore  

f(n) = Σ_{c = 0}^{⌊n/10⌋} ( ⌊(n – 10c)/5⌋ + 1 ).   (2)

Step 4 : Evaluate f(n) for the values of n that actually occur.

(a) a = 0  (R = 100 – 0 = 100)  
 b = 0,1,2,3,4 give n = 100, 75, 50, 25, 0.

 • f(100) = 121  
 • f(75)  = 72  
 • f(50)  = 36  
 • f(25)  = 12  
 • f(0)   = 1  

 Total for a = 0 : 121 + 72 + 36 + 12 + 1 = 242.

(b) a = 1  (R = 50)  
 b = 0,1,2 give n = 50, 25, 0.

 • f(50) = 36  
 • f(25) = 12  
 • f(0)  = 1  

 Total for a = 1 : 36 + 12 + 1 = 49.

(c) a = 2  (R = 0)  
 Only one solution: two half-dollars, nothing else.

 Total for a = 2 : 1.

Step 5 : Add the three cases

242 (a = 0) + 49 (a = 1) + 1 (a = 2) = 292.

222,"Question: Homer had always contemplated the size of the old oak tree in the field behind his house.  Standing 5 feet away from the 8 foot high fence in the back of the yard, he could just barely see the top leaves of the tree over the top of the fence.  He knew that the tree was 200 feet from the fence.  Homer was 6 feet tall, making his line of vision, 67 inches from the ground.
Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.
 Hint: TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches
Tree height from eye level = TAN (25.80 deg) * 2460 inches = 1189 inches
Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.  With the measurement capabilities available to any lumberjack (or any average Homer) precise measurements are not possible.  Thus the need to clarify these calculations as estimates.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"From Homer’s eye the line of sight just grazes the top of the 8-ft fence and then reaches the top of the oak.  Treat everything as being on the same level ground.

1.  Eye-to-fence right triangle  
   Horizontal leg (eye to fence) = 5 ft  
   Vertical leg (fence top minus eye height)  
     = 8 ft − 67 in  
     = 8 ft − 67/12 ft  
     = 8 ft − 5 ft 7 in  
     = 2 ft 5 in = 2 + 5/12 ft = 2.416 7 ft  

   tan θ = opposite/adjacent = 2.4167 ft / 5 ft = 0.48333

2.  Same slope from fence to tree  
   Horizontal run from fence to tree = 200 ft  
   Vertical rise from fence top to tree top  
     = (tan θ)(200 ft) = 0.48333 × 200 ≈ 96.67 ft

3.  Total height of tree above ground  
   = fence height + rise beyond fence  
   = 8 ft + 96.67 ft ≈ 104.67 ft

Thus the old oak is about 105 feet tall.

4·ABCD = DCBA .

Step 1.  Translate to an equation.  
Let N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.  
Then 4N = 1000D + 100C + 10B + A.

Step 2.  Bring everything to one side and simplify.

4(1000A + 100B + 10C + D) − (1000D + 100C + 10B + A) = 0  
⇨ 4000A + 400B + 40C + 4D − 1000D − 100C − 10B − A = 0  
⇨ 3999A + 390B − 60C − 996D = 0.

Divide by 3:  

1333A + 130B − 20C − 332D = 0 … (1)

Step 3.  Limit A.  
Because 4·ABCD = DCBA is still a four–digit number, 4·ABCD ≤ 9999 ⇒ ABCD ≤ 2499, so A = 1 or 2.
The hint also says the final digit A must be even (since 4·ABCD is even), hence A = 2.

Put A = 2 in (1):

1333·2 + 130B − 20C − 332D = 0  
⇨ 2666 + 130B = 20C + 332D.

Divide by 2:

10C + 166D − 65B = 1333 … (2)

Step 4.  Work modulo 5 to pin down D.  
In (2) reduce modulo 5:

10C ≡ 0, −65B ≡ 0, 166D ≡ D  (mod 5),
so D ≡ 1333 ≡ 3  (mod 5).

Therefore D is either 3 or 8.

• If D = 3, substitute in (2):

10C − 65B + 498 = 1333 ⇒ 10C − 65B = 835  
⇨ 2C − 13B = 167 – impossible because the left side is at most 2·9 −13·0 =18.

Hence D ≠ 3.

• If D = 8, substitute in (2):

10C − 65B + 1328 = 1333 ⇒ 10C − 65B = 5  
⇨ 2C − 13B = 1 … (3)

Step 5.  Solve (3) with digits 0–9.

Equation (3): 2C = 1 + 13B.  
The right side must be even, so B must be odd. Test odd digits:

B = 1 → 2C = 14 ⇒ C = 7 (valid)  
B = 3 → 2C = 40 ⇒ C = 20 (invalid) and larger B give C > 9.

Thus B = 1 and C = 7.

All letters stand for different non-zero digits.

1.  The units (ones) column  
   3 × Y must end in Y.  
   Hence 3Y ≡ Y (mod 10) ⇒ 2Y ≡ 0 (mod 10) ⇒ Y = 5 (because digits are non-zero).  
   The product 3Y = 15 contributes a carry of 1 to the tens column.

2.  The tens column  
   3 × L + 1 (carry) produces the digit A and a new carry c₁:  
   3L + 1 = 10 c₁ + A. …(i)

3.  The hundreds column  
   3 × F + c₁ (carry) produces the digit W and a new carry c₂:  
   3F + c₁ = 10 c₂ + W. …(ii)

4.  The thousands column  
   The only digits possible here are 1 or 2 because 3 × 999 < 3000.  
   But the thousands digit is A, and from the layout it equals c₂ (the carry from the previous step).  
   So A = c₂ ∈ {1, 2}.  
   We now test the two cases.

   •  If A = 1.  
      Then (i) gives 3L + 1 = 10 c₁ + 1 ⇒ 3L = 10 c₁.  
      The left side is a multiple of 3, the right a multiple of 10; the only possibility is 0, which is forbidden (L ≠ 0).  
      Hence A ≠ 1.

   •  Therefore A = 2 and c₂ = 2.  
      Returning to (i): 3L + 1 = 10 c₁ + 2 ⇒ 3L = 10 c₁ + 1.  
      Among the multiples of 3 below 30, only 21 leaves remainder 1 mod 10.  
      Thus 3L = 21 ⇒ L = 7 and c₁ = 2.

5.  Determine F and W from (ii) with c₁ = 2 and A = 2 (so 10 c₂ = 20):  
   3F + 2 = 20 + W ⇒ W = 3F − 18.  
   For W to be a digit (0-9), 18 ≤ 3F ≤ 27 ⇒ 6 ≤ F ≤ 9.  
   Check possible F (remember digits must be distinct and non-zero):

      F = 6 ⇒ W = 0 (zero digit, forbidden)  
      F = 7 ⇒ clash with L = 7 (forbidden)  
      F = 8 ⇒ W = 6 (allowed, distinct, non-zero)  
      F = 9 ⇒ W = 9 (clash with F)

   The only viable pair is F = 8, W = 6.

6.  Verify: FLY = 875.  
   3 × 875 = 2625, which indeed matches the pattern AWAY with A = 2, W = 6, Y = 5.

All digit assignments are distinct and non-zero:  
F = 8, L = 7, Y = 5, A = 2, W = 6.

 Hint: nan",,"The prime factorization of 225 is 5*5*3*3. So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.
All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"A number that is a multiple of 225 must be a multiple of both 25 and 9.

1.  Multiple of 25  
    ⇒ its last two decimal digits must be 00, 25, 50, or 75.  
    With the restriction that every digit is either 0 or 1, the only possible ending is 00.  
    Therefore every admissible number looks like …00.

2.  Multiple of 9  
    ⇒ the sum of its decimal digits must be a multiple of 9.  
    Since the only non-zero digit permitted is 1, the digit–sum equals the number of 1’s.  
    Hence the number of 1’s must be 9, 18, 27, …  

    To obtain the smallest possible integer we clearly want the smallest such count, namely 9.

3.  Minimum possible length  
    The two compulsory trailing zeros occupy two places, leaving the remaining digits to house the nine 1’s.  
    If the total length is L, then only L − 2 places are available for the 1’s, so  
        L − 2 ≥ 9  ⇒  L ≥ 11.  
    Thus any admissible number must have at least 11 digits.

4.  Placement of the nine 1’s  
    To minimise the value of an 11-digit number, put each 1 as far to the right (toward lower powers of 10) as possible, subject to the last two positions being zeros.  
    Those nine least-significant allowable positions are the ones corresponding to 10², 10³, …, 10¹⁰.

5.  Verification  
    • Last two digits are 00  ⇒  divisible by 25.

    Any smaller integer would have either (i) fewer than 11 digits (impossible, because at least 9 ones plus the two final zeros are required) or (ii) the same 11 digits but some 1 shifted to a higher-order place, which only makes the number larger. Therefore no smaller admissible integer exists.

 Hint: 50^2 = 125000",50^2 = 125000,"60^3 = 216000; 50^3 = 125000; 53, 59 and 61.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the three consecutive primes be  
p < q < r , so that p·q·r = 190 747.

1.  Estimate the size of the primes.  
   Because p, q, r are close to one another, their product is about q³.  
   The cube root of 190 747 lies between  

        50³ = 125 000   and   60³ = 216 000,

   so q must be a prime a little below 60.  
   The only primes in that neighbourhood are 53, 59, 61, 67.

2.  Identify the possible middle prime.  
   If q were 53, then p would be 47 and r would be 59;  
   but 47·53·59 < 50³, far below 190 747, so q > 53.  
   If q were 67, then p·q·r would exceed 60³ = 216 000, already too large.  
   Hence q must be either 59 or 61.

3.  Test q = 59.  
   The consecutive primes surrounding 59 are 53 and 61, so compute

        53 · 59 = 3127,
        3127 · 61 = 190 747.

   This is exactly the required product, so p = 53, q = 59, r = 61.

4.  Verify no other choice works.  
   The next candidate q = 61 would pair with 59 and 67; their product is

        59 · 61 · 67 = 241 133 > 190 747,

   too large. Therefore the triple found in step 3 is unique.

The three consecutive primes whose product is 190 747 are:

Snogs are each one more than a multiple of 8.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"“Snogs are one more than a multiple of 8.”

Explanation  
1.  For every listed snog, subtract 1:  
   25 − 1 = 24, 73 − 1 = 72, 81 − 1 = 80, 9 − 1 = 8, 33 − 1 = 32, 41 − 1 = 40, 65 − 1 = 64.  
   Each of these differences (24, 72, 80, 8, 32, 40, 64) is divisible by 8.

2.  For every number said not to be a snog, subtract 1:  
   5 − 1 = 4, 70 − 1 = 69, 16 − 1 = 15, 3 − 1 = 2, 29 − 1 = 28, 44 − 1 = 43, 59 − 1 = 58, 60 − 1 = 59, 64 − 1 = 63.  
   None of these differences is divisible by 8.

Thus a whole number n is a snog precisely when n ≡ 1 (mod 8).

Applying the rule to the candidates:

48 − 1 = 47  → not divisible by 8 → not a snog  
57 − 1 = 56  → 56 = 8·7          → snog  
37 − 1 = 36  → not divisible by 8 → not a snog

4. exactly two digits are prime, two are perfect squares, and one is neither,  
5. (hint) C and D are not prime.

Step 1.  Determine E and A from C = 2E.  
Because a digit is at most 9, 2E ≤ 9 ⇒ E ∈ {1,2,3,4}.  
E = 1 gives C = 2, which is prime (forbidden by the hint).  
Thus E ∈ {2,3,4}.

––  If E = 2 ⇒ A = 5 and C = 4.  
     A and E are both prime, already giving the required two primes, so B cannot be prime.  
     For D = B + 6 to be a digit, B must be 1,2,3, but 2,3 are prime, leaving B = 1.  
     Then D = 7, a prime, contradicting the hint.  Reject.

––  If E = 3 ⇒ A = 6 and C = 6, which repeats the digit 6.  Reject.

––  If E = 4 ⇒ A = 7 and C = 8, satisfying the hint (C = 8 not prime).

So far we have A = 7, C = 8, E = 4; the used digits are {7,8,4}.

Step 2.  Place B and D using D = B + 6.  
Since digits are 1–9 and distinct and B ≠ 7,8,4, possibilities for B are limited to 1–5.  
Also, D must be at most 9, so B ≤ 3.  
Among 1,2,3 only B = 3 or 2 can be prime; B = 1 is not.

•  If B = 2 ⇒ D = 8, but 8 is already used.  Reject.  
•  If B = 3 ⇒ D = 9, distinct and not prime, satisfying the hint.  
•  B = 1 fails because D = 7 would be prime (forbidden).

Hence B = 3 and D = 9.

Step 3.  Verify the prime/square classification.

Digits:  A=7, B=3, C=8, D=9, E=4  
Primes: 7, 3  (exactly two)

Rate at which the hands move away from the correct time  
• Clock A (fast): +1 minute per hour  
• Clock B (slow): −2 minutes per hour  

Because an analog clock face repeats every 12 hours = 720 minutes, two readings are identical whenever the accumulated error is a multiple of 720 minutes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  When will the two clocks next show the same time?

The two clocks separate from each other at the combined rate  
(+1) − (−2) = 3 minutes per hour.

They will look alike again when this separation equals one full dial, 720 minutes:

3 minutes/hour · t hours = 720 minutes  
t = 720 / 3 = 240 hours.

240 hours = 10 days.

So the clocks will next agree 10 days after they were set (i.e. 240 real-time hours later).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  When will both clocks show the correct time?

For Clock A to read correctly, its gain must be 720 k minutes; for the first return use k = 1:

1 minute/hour · t = 720  ⇒  t = 720 hours.

For Clock B to read correctly, its loss must be 720 m minutes; the smallest positive m is 1:

2 minutes/hour · t = 720  ⇒  t = 360 hours.

Both conditions must hold simultaneously, so t must be a common multiple of 360 and 720 hours; the least such multiple is 720 hours.

720 hours = 30 days.

Thus both clocks first read the correct time together 30 days after they were set (i.e. 720 real-time hours later).

There are 10 pair-sums and the farmer wrote them in ascending order

80, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, 91.

1.  Smallest and largest pair–sums  
   • The smallest sum must be the lightest two bales: a + b = 80.  
   • The largest sum must be the heaviest two bales: d + e = 91.           (1)

2.  Second smallest and second largest pair–sums  
   • After a + b the next smallest sum must contain a (the lightest bale) together with the third lightest bale c, so a + c = 82.               (2)  
   • Symmetrically, the second largest sum must be made with e together with the third heaviest bale c, so c + e = 90.                        (3)

3.  Express a, b, c, d in terms of e  

   From (1) and (3) d = 91 − e and c = 90 − e.  
   From (2) a = 82 − c = 82 − (90 − e) = e − 8.  
   From a + b = 80 b = 80 − a = 80 − (e − 8) = 88 − e.

   Because the weights are whole kilograms, e can only be 46 or 47.

   • e = 46  gives a = 38, b = 42, c = 44, d = 45.  
     One of their pair-sums is 44 + 45 = 89, but 89 is not on the farmer’s list, so e ≠ 46.

   • e = 47  gives a = 39, b = 41, c = 43, d = 44.  
     Compute the ten pair-sums:

        39+41 = 80   39+43 = 82   39+44 = 83   39+47 = 86
        41+43 = 84   41+44 = 85   41+47 = 88

After his first year his salary was a straight 10,000 wonks, with which Manic Martin was quite happy. His manager was so impressed with his work he offered Manic Martin a wage rise.
Now this being Madadia, things are not always done as they are elsewhere, the wage rise was offered over a 17.5 year contract period, These contracts are immutably binding, and will still be paid to benefactors in the event of death or permanent disability.

242,"Question: We were all celebrating the 25th birthday of my beloved sister, Lavi the kindhearted Romankachi. She was younger to me Rudy the business-minded Romankachi by two years and to our elder brother Fred the well-settled Romankachi by four years. Just as the celebrations were in full swing, I realized something about our ages. I found that I could say at least two things definitely about each of the following two integer values formed by manipulating our ages taken as integers:-
a) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Lavi's and my age considered during any one year right since she was a year old.
b) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Fred's and my ages considered during any one year right since I was a year old.
Though I forgot about this the next moment and got busy enjoying myself, could you tell what were the two things that flashed across my mind.
Consider all ages to be integer values. Also during any given year, Lavi was exactly two years younger to me and exactly four years younger to Fred.
 Hint: I'm exactly two years elder to Lavi and exactly two years younger to Fred.",I'm exactly two years elder to Lavi and exactly two years younger to Fred.,"a) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Lavi's and my age considered during any one year right since she was a year old.
The two things that I could definitely say about the above integer value are :-
1) It is a perfect square.
2) The number formed is the square of a number 1 less than my age in that year.
Example: When Lavi was 3, I was  5 -> (3*5)+1 gives 16 which is the square of 4, which is 1 less than my age(5) in that year.
b) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Fred's and my ages considered during any one year right since I was a year old.
The two things that I could definitely say about the above integer value are :-
1) It is a perfect square.
2) The number formed is square of a number 1 more than my age in that year.
Example: when I was 6, Fred was    8-> (6*8)+1 gives 49 which is the square of 7, a number 1 more than my age(6) in that year.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let Lavi’s age in a chosen calendar year be L (we are told to begin with the year in which she was 1 year old, so L ≥ 1 and is always an integer).

Because the three of us are two years apart in order, the other two ages in that same year are  
Rudy : R = L + 2  
Fred :  F = L + 4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
a)  The number “one more than the product of Lavi’s and Rudy’s ages’’  
    N₁ = L · R + 1  
        = L(L + 2) + 1  
        = L² + 2L + 1  
        = (L + 1)².  

b)  The number “one more than the product of Fred’s and Rudy’s ages’’  
    N₂ = F · R + 1  
        = (L + 4)(L + 2) + 1  
        = L² + 6L + 8 + 1  
        = L² + 6L + 9  
        = (L + 3)².
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Thus, for every admissible year,

• N₁ is the perfect square of L + 1, and  
• N₂ is the perfect square of L + 3.

(Notice also that √N₁ = (L + R)/2 and √N₂ = (R + F)/2 – the exact arithmetic mean of the two ages multiplied in each case.)

Because their square roots exceed 1, both N₁ and N₂ possess at least the three divisors 1, √N, and N itself, so neither of them can ever be a prime number.

Hence the two facts that can always be asserted about each of the two numbers are

1.  It is a perfect square.  
2.  Consequently it can never be prime (equivalently, its square root – equal to the average of the two ages involved – is a non-trivial divisor).

Final answer:  Each of the two numbers is invariably (i) a perfect square and therefore (ii) not a prime; in fact its square root is exactly the average of the two ages whose product was used.",True
243,"Question: About 2000 B.C. there lived Ahmes, a royal secretary and mathematician of the Pharaoh Amenemhat III. In 1853 an Englishman Rhind found one of Ahmes's papyruses near the temple of Ramses II in Thebes. The papyrus is a rectangle 33 cm wide and about 5 m long. There is the following math brain teaser on it (besides others).
100 measures of corn must be divided among 5 workers, so that the second worker gets as many measures more than the first worker, as the third gets more than the second, the fourth more than the third and the fifth more than the fourth.

5w + 10d = 100
7*(2w + d) = 3w + 9d
Where w is amount of corn for the first worker, d is the difference (amount of corn) between two consecutive workers. So this is the solution:
1st worker = 10/6 measures of corn
2nd worker = 65/6 measures of corn
3rd worker = 120/6 (20) measures of corn

 A₅ = corn for the 5th worker  

Because every man “gets as many measures more than the preceding one” the five shares form an arithmetic progression; let the common difference be d (> 0).  
So with A₁ = a we have  

 A₂ = a + d  
 A₃ = a + 2d  
 A₄ = a + 3d

2.  Relation between the first two and the last three workers

 d = 11a/2.  (4)

3.  Solve (2) and (4) simultaneously  

 a + 2d = 20  
 a + 2(11a/2) = 20  
 a + 11a = 20  
 12a = 20  
 a = 20/12 = 5/3.

From (4)  

 d = 11(5/3)/2 = 55/6.

4.  Compute every share (use (1))

 A₁ = a = 5/3 = 1 ⅔  
 A₂ = a + d = 5/3 + 55/6 = 65/6 = 10 ⅚  
 A₃ = a + 2d = 5/3 + 55/3 = 60/3 = 20  
 A₄ = a + 3d = 5/3 + 165/6 = 175/6 = 29 ¹⁄₆  
 A₅ = a + 4d = 5/3 + 220/6 = 115/3 = 38 ⅓.

5.  Verification  
Sum of first two: 1 ⅔ + 10 ⅚ = 12 ½.

247,"Question: The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?
 Hint: Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74
Lemp 47 94
Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Number of people who got in at the six stations - Number of people who got out at the six stations) =

 Lemp 40–50→ d₅ ∈ {41,43,47}  
 Rudolf 50–60→ d₆ ∈ {53,59}

2.  “Difference ≥ 20 in boardings” (statement 3)

 2d_{k+1} – 2d_k ≥ 20  ⇒  d_{k+1} – d_k ≥ 10.  
 Thus every successive pair of the six primes must differ by at least 10.

   Working forward:

   •  d₁=2  would force d₂≥12; the smallest candidate 13 works.  
      But then d₂=13 allows d₃=23 (difference 10) or 29 (16).  
      If d₃=29, the next difference fails (d₄ cannot reach 39); so d₃ must be 23, which in turn forces d₄=37 (only choice ≥33).  
      Continuing, d₄=37 forces d₅=47 (≥47) and then d₆=59 (≥57).  
      The sequence would be 2, 13, 23, 37, 47, 59.

   •  d₁=3 gives the same chain except the first number is 3:  
      3, 13, 23, 37, 47, 59.

   •  Trying d₁=5 or 7 obliges d₂ to be at least 17, which in turn makes d₃=29, and we again hit the impossibility at d₄ (cannot reach 39).  
      Hence no sequences start with 5 or 7.

   Thus the only feasible prime strings are  

  (2,13,23,37,47,59) or (3,13,23,37,47,59).

3.  “Even total number down” (statement 4)

 Sum for first string: 2+13+23+37+47+59 = 181 (odd) – rejected.  
 Sum for second string: 3+13+23+37+47+59 = 182 (even) – accepted.

   Hence  
 d₁=3, d₂=13, d₃=23, d₄=37, d₅=47, d₆=59.

4.  Passenger totals station by station

 Let x = passengers on the train just before it reached Maver.

 After Maver: x −3 +6 = x+3  
 After Willow: (x+3) −13 +26 = x+16  
 After Wonderland: (x+16) −23 +46 = x+39  
 After Doku: (x+39) −37 +74 = x+76  
 After Lemp: (x+76) −47 +94 = x+123  
 After Rudolf: (x+123) −59 +118 = x+182.

 But after Rudolf the train is known to carry 227 passengers
 (statement in the problem), so

 x + 182 = 227  ⇒  x = 45.

Consequently there were 45 passengers altogether (Tweeto included) on the train just before it arrived at Maver station.
