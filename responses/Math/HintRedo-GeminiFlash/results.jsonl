{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.\nThe island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.\nOn April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.\nIf the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?\nBonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?\n Hint: To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.", "Hint": "To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.

Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:\n1) First set the starting point to one.\n2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.\n3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)\n4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.\nWhich points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.\nNote that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.\nThe routes:\nThis is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.\nRoutes to an adjacent village (A to B):\nTo determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.\nThe farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.\nThe next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.\nThe next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.\nThe next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.\nThere are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.\nRoutes to the second village along the coast (A to C):\nA = 1\nAFi = A = 1\nFi = AFi = 1\nAi = A + AFi = 2\nABi = Ai + A = 3\nM and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nM = Ai + Fi = 3\nB = A + ABi = 4\nBi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBi = B + ABi + M = 10\nDi = M = 3\nBCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBCi = B + Bi = 14\nCDi = Di = 3\nCi = BCi + CDi + M = 20\nC = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41\nThere are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.\nRoutes to the opposite village (A to D):\nSince the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.\nA = 1\nF, B = A = 1\nFAi, ABi = A + B = 2\nAi = A + ABi + FAi = 5\nFi, Bi = ABi + B = 3\nEFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4\nM, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:\nM = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11\nE, C = B + BCi = 5\nEi, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20\nDEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25\nDi = M + CDi + DEi = 61\nD = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121\nThere are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.\nBonus Question:\nThe longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:\nA-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D\nand the mirror route\nA-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D\n(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)\nIf the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.\nThe path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.\nThe paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is\n5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)\nSo the total distance traveled is\n10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": null, "Status": true}

Based on the rule of using only two '2's, numbers like 2.2 (.2 + 2) or .2 + .2 would not be allowed as they use more than two '2' digits in the expression string itself, if we follow the examples like (2^2)! which uses the digit '2' exactly twice. Let's assume \"using two, and only two, 2s\" means the digit '2' appears exactly twice in the final expression string, consistent with the (2^2)! example.\n\nSo, possible numbers involving two '2' digits could be 22, 2.2, or .22. Or we could use two separate '2's like '2' and '2' combined with operations (e.g., 2+2, 2^2). However, the hint requires a decimal point, so we must use a decimal number formed with at least one '2'. To use exactly two '2' digits in total, we could use a number like 2.2 or .22, or we could use one '2' in a decimal number and the other '2' elsewhere in the expression. The phrasing \"two, and only two, 2s\" suggests the latter case is more likely what is meant when combined with standard operations, where the two '2's are the inputs to the operations. Let's assume we have two instances of the number 2 available to manipulate. If one instance is used to create '.2', we have used one '2'. The other '2' is still available.\n\nLet's try using one '2' to make a decimal number, like .2 (which is 0.2). This uses one of our two '2's and the decimal point symbol. We have one '2' left, and we still need to use exponent, minus, brackets, and square root, and combine everything to get 5.\n\nWe have 0.2. How can we use the remaining '2' and the required operations (exponent, minus, brackets, square root) to get 5?\nLet's think about the number 5. We know that sqrt(25) = 5.

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.

The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": null, "Status": true}

The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.\nWe use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).\nThe radius of the circumscribed circle is given by R = abc/4A.", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": "Okay, let's find the formulas for the radius of the inscribed circle (inradius) and the radius of the circumscribed circle (circumradius) for a triangle, using the area of the triangle as suggested by the hint.\n\nLet the triangle be denoted by ABC, with side lengths *a*, *b*, and *c* opposite to vertices A, B, and C respectively. Let *A* (or sometimes *K*) denote the area of the triangle.\n\n**1. Finding the Radius of the Inscribed Circle (Inradius), denoted by *r***\n\nThe inscribed circle (incircle) is a circle inside the triangle that is tangent to all three sides. Its center is the incenter, which is the intersection of the angle bisectors. The radius *r* is the perpendicular distance from the incenter to each side.\n\n*   **Reasoning using Area:**\n    Let the incenter be *I*. We can divide the triangle ABC into three smaller triangles by connecting the incenter *I* to the vertices A, B, and C. These three triangles are IBC, ICA, and IAB.\n    *   Triangle IBC has base *a* (side BC). The height of this triangle from vertex *I* to the base *a* is the inradius *r*, because the incircle is tangent to side *a* at the point where the radius is perpendicular to the side.\n    *   The area of triangle IBC is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * *a* * *r*.\n    *   Similarly, Triangle ICA has base *b* (side AC) and height *r*. Its area is (1/2) * *b* * *r*.\n    *   Triangle IAB has base *c* (side AB) and height *r*. Its area is (1/2) * *c* * *r*.\n\n    The total area of triangle ABC is the sum of the areas of these three smaller triangles:\n    *A* = Area(IBC) + Area(ICA) + Area(IAB)\n    *A* = (1/2) * *a* * *r* + (1/2) * *b* * *r* + (1/2) * *c* * *r*\n\n    We can factor out (1/2) * *r* from the right side:\n    *A* = (1/2) * *r* * (*a* + *b* + *c*)\n\n    Let *s* be the semi-perimeter of the triangle, which is half of the perimeter:\n    *s* = (*a* + *b* + *c*) / 2\n    So, *a* + *b* + *c* = 2*s*.\n\n    Substitute this into the area equation:\n    *A* = (1/2) * *r* * (2*s*)\n    *A* = *r* * *s*\n\n    Now, we can solve for the inradius *r*:\n    *r* = *A* / *s*\n\n*   **Formula for Inradius:** The radius of the inscribed circle *r* is given by the formula:\n    *r* = *A* / *s*\n    where *A* is the area of the triangle and *s* is the semi-perimeter (*s* = (*a* + *b* + *c*) / 2).\n\n**2. Finding the Radius of the Circumscribed Circle (Circumradius), denoted by *R***\n\nThe circumscribed circle (circumcircle) is a circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle. Its center is the circumcenter, which is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides. The radius *R* is the distance from the circumcenter to each vertex.\n\n*   **Reasoning using Area and Sine Rule:**\n    We know the area of a triangle can be expressed using two sides and the sine of the included angle. For example:\n    *A* = (1/2) * *b* * *c* * sin(A)\n    *A* = (1/2) * *a* * *c* * sin(B)\n    *A* = (1/2) * *a* * *b* * sin(C)\n\n    The hint is to use the area. We also need to bring the circumradius *R* into the picture. The Sine Rule relates the side lengths, the sines of the opposite angles, and the circumradius:\n    *a* / sin(A) = *b* / sin(B) = *c* / sin(C) = 2*R\n\n    From the Sine Rule, we can express the sine of each angle in terms of the side opposite to it and *R*:\n    sin(A) = *a* / (2*R)\n    sin(B) = *b* / (2*R)\n    sin(C) = *c* / (2*R)\n\n    Let's take the area formula *A* = (1/2) * *b* * *c* * sin(A) and substitute the expression for sin(A) from the Sine Rule:\n    *A* = (1/2) * *b* * *c* * (*a* / (2*R))\n\n    Multiply the terms on the right side:\n    *A* = (*a* * *b* * *c*) / (4*R)\n\n    This equation relates the area *A*, the side lengths *a*, *b*, *c*, and the circumradius *R*. We can solve for *R*:\n    *R* = (*a* * *b* * *c*) / (4 * *A*)\n\n    We could have used any of the area formulas involving sine and substituted the corresponding angle from the Sine Rule, and we would get the same result. For example, using *A* = (1/2) * *a* * *c* * sin(B) and sin(B) = *b* / (2*R) yields:\n    *A* = (1/2) * *a* * *c* * (*b* / (2*R)) = (*a* * *b* * *c*) / (4*R)\n\n*   **Formula for Circumradius:** The radius of the circumscribed circle *R* is given by the formula:\n    *R* = (*a* * *b* * *c*) / (4 * *A*)\n    where *a*, *b*, *c* are the lengths of the sides of the triangle and *A* is the area of the triangle.\n\n**3. How to find the Area *A*?**\n\nTo use the formulas for *r* and *R*, you typically need to know the side lengths of the triangle. If you have the side lengths *a*, *b*, and *c*, the area *A* can be calculated using Heron's formula:\n\nFirst, calculate the semi-perimeter *s*:\n*s* = (*a* + *b* + *c*) / 2\n\nThen, the area *A* is:\n*A* = sqrt(*s* (*s* - *a*) (*s* - *b*) (*s* - *c*))\n\n**In summary:**\n\nTo find the radii of the inscribed and circumscribed circles for a triangle with side lengths *a*, *b*, and *c*:\n\n1.  Calculate the semi-perimeter: *s* = (*a* + *b* + *c*) / 2.\n2.  Calculate the area using Heron's formula: *A* = sqrt(*s* (*s* - *a*) (*s* - *b*) (*s* - *c*)).\n3.  Calculate the inradius: *r* = *A* / *s*.\n4.  Calculate the circumradius: *R* = (*a* * *b* * *c*) / (4 * *A*).\n\nFinal answer: The radius of the inscribed circle (*r*) is given by *r* = *A* / *s*, where *A* is the area of the triangle and *s* is its semi-perimeter. The radius of the circumscribed circle (*R*) is given by *R* = (*a* * *b* * *c*) / (4 * *A*), where *a*, *b*, and *c* are the side lengths and *A* is the area of the triangle. The area *A* can be calculated using Heron's formula: *A* = sqrt(*s*(*s* - *a*) (*s* - *b*) (*s* - *c*)) with *s* = (*a* + *b* + *c*) / 2.", "Status": true}
{"ID": 8, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.\n\"The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.\"\n\"OK,\" says Ralph after a moment.  \"That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?\"\n\"No, no, no,\" replies Rex.  \"I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.

In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.\"\nRalph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.\n\"The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.\"\n\"What number am I thinking of?\" asks Rex.\nRalph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, \"OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.\"\nRex frowns and says, \"One of those numbers is divisible by 13.\"\nRalph smiles and tells Rex the number.\nWhat were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?\nNote: The \"digital sum\" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.\n Hint: You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.\nThe problem is as much about logic as it is about math.", "Hint": "You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.\nThe problem is as much about logic as it is about math.", "Human Solution": "The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": null, "Status": true}

{"ID": 10, "Question": "Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.).

Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.\nOf course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.", "Hint": "The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly.

This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.\nFour of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:\nF = (N5)/5\nN5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1\nN4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1\nN3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1\nN2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1\nN1 = 4(N)/5 - 1\nF is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.\nSubstitution results in the following equation:\n(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6\nor\n1024N = 15625F + 8404\nGiven that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": null, "Status": true}

Let $L$ be the length of the train.\n\nLet's consider Al first. Al starts walking in the opposite direction of the train when the front of the train passes him. Let's set the starting point of Al (and Ben) as the origin, $x=0$, and time $t=0$ when the front of the train is at $x=0$. The train moves in the positive direction. The front of the train is at $x_f(t) = v_t t$ and the back of the train is at $x_b(t) = v_t t - L$. Al walks in the negative direction, so Al's position is $x_A(t) = -v_p t$.\n\nAl stops walking when the back of the train passes him. This happens at a time $t_A$ when Al's position is the same as the back of the train's position:\n$x_A(t_A) = x_b(t_A)$\n$-v_p t_A = v_t t_A - L$\n$L = v_t t_A + v_p t_A$\n$L = (v_t + v_p) t_A$\n\nAl walks at speed $v_p$ for time $t_A$, covering a distance of 30 feet. So, the distance Al walks is $d_A = v_p t_A$.\nWe are given $d_A = 30$ feet.\n$30 = v_p t_A$.\n\nFrom this equation, we can express $t_A$ as $t_A = 30/v_p$. Substituting this into the equation for $L$:\n$L = (v_t + v_p) \\left(\\frac{30}{v_p}\\right) = 30 \\left(\\frac{v_t + v_p}{v_p}\\right) = 30 \\left(\\frac{v_t}{v_p} + 1\\right)$.\n\nNow let's consider Ben. Ben starts walking in the same direction as the train when the front of the train passes him (at $t=0$ at $x=0$). Ben walks in the positive direction, so Ben's position is $x_B(t) = v_p t$.

So, the distance Ben walks is $d_B = v_p t_B$.\nWe are given $d_B = 45$ feet.\n$45 = v_p t_B$.\n\nFrom this equation, we can express $t_B$ as $t_B = 45/v_p$. Substituting this into the equation for $L$:\n$L = (v_t - v_p) \\left(\\frac{45}{v_p}\\right) = 45 \\left(\\frac{v_t - v_p}{v_p}\\right) = 45 \\left(\\frac{v_t}{v_p} - 1\\right)$.\n\nWe now have two expressions for the length of the train $L$:\n1) $L = 30 \\left(\\frac{v_t}{v_p} + 1\\right)$\n2) $L = 45 \\left(\\frac{v_t}{v_p} - 1\\right)$\n\nThe hint suggests getting a ratio between the train's speed and the speed of Al and Ben. Let $r = \\frac{v_t}{v_p}$.\nThe equations become:\n1) $L = 30 (r + 1)$\n2) $L = 45 (r - 1)$\n\nWe have a system of two linear equations in terms of $L$ and $r$. We can solve for $r$ by setting the expressions for $L$ equal to each other:\n$30(r + 1) = 45(r - 1)$\n$30r + 30 = 45r - 45$\nAdd 45 to both sides: $30r + 30 + 45 = 45r$\n$30r + 75 = 45r$\nSubtract $30r$ from both sides: $75 = 45r - 30r$\n$75 = 15r$\nDivide by 15: $r = \\frac{75}{15} = 5$.\n\nSo, the speed of the train is 5 times the speed of Al and Ben ($v_t = 5v_p$).\n\nNow we can find the length of the train $L$ by substituting the value of $r$ into either equation. Using equation (1):\n$L = 30 (r + 1) = 30 (5 + 1) = 30 \\times 6 = 180$.\n\nUsing equation (2) to verify:\n$L = 45 (r - 1) = 45 (5 - 1) = 45 \\times 4 = 180$.\n\nBoth equations give the same length, 180 feet. The length of the train is 180 feet.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{180 feet}$.", "Status": true}

The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.

That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.

If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.

But condition 6 is the hardest to satisfy, and should be left last.", "Human Solution": "From condition 4, we know that E equals 5.\nFrom conditions 1, 3, 5 and 7, we know that B, D, F, H are even numbers, therefore A, C, G, I are 1, 3, 7, 9 in some order.\nFurthermore, from conditions 3 and 7 we know that CD is divisible by 4 and GH is divisible by 8 (because FGH is divisible by 8 and F is even). Because C and G are odd, D and H must be 2 and 6 in some order.\nFrom conditions 2 and 5, we know that A+B+C, D+E+F, G+H+I are all divisible by 3.\nIf D=2, then F=8, H=6, B=4. A+4+C is divisible by 3, therefore A and C must be 1 and 7 in some order, G and I must be 3 and 9 in some order. G6 is divisible by 8, therefore G=9. But neither 1472589 nor 7412589 is divisible by 7.\nTherefore D=6, and F=4, H=2, B=8. G2 is divisible by 8, therefore G=3 or 7. A+8+C is divisible by 3, therefore one of A and C is chosen from 1 and 7, the other is chosen from 3 and 9.\nIf G=3, then one of A and C is 9, the other is chosen from 1 and 7. But none of 1896543, 7896543, 9816543 and 9876543 is divisible by 7.\nTherefore G=7, one of A and C is 1, the other is chosen from 3 and 9. From 1836547, 1896547, 3816547 and 9816547, only 3816547 is divisible by 7 (the quotient is 545221).\nTherefore, the number we are looking for is 381654729.", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": null, "Status": true}
