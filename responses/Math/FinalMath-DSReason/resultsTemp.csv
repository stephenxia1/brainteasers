   The first clock gains 1 minute every hour, and the second loses 2 minutes every hour. Their relative drift rate is \(1 + 2 = 3\) minutes per hour. For their displayed times to coincide, the total drift must form a 12-hour (720-minute) difference.

240,"In the legendary land of Madadia, everything is wonderful. There is no inflation, so Madadian wonks (local currency 100 winks = 1 wonk) are constant in value.
Mad Ade's cousin Manic Martin works as an accountant in one of Madadia's leading accounting firms.
After his first year his salary was a straight 10,000 wonks, with which Manic Martin was quite happy. His manager was so impressed with his work he offered Manic Martin a wage rise.
Now this being Madadia, things are not always done as they are elsewhere, the wage rise was offered over a 17.5 year contract period, These contracts are immutably binding, and will still be paid to benefactors in the event of death or permanent disability.
Manic Martin has a choice of how to receive his raise.  The first option was for an immediate 5% raise to 10,500 wonks annually, with an additional 5% raise every 6 months. The second option was for an immediate 10% raise to 11,000 wonks annually, with an additional 10% raise every year. Manic Martin's salary, based upon his current annual, was paid bi-weekly.
Which deal would benefit Manic Martin the most?",Think about the difference between the first and second half of every year,"The 5% semi-annual raise yields a higher return.
This may have been your first guess, but there is something odd about the answer. At the start of the problem, the 10% raise is earning more-  11,000 annually vs. 10,500. After the first year, the 5% option has earned 10,762 compared to 11,000.
What are the two options earning at the moment the contract closes, after 17.5 years? Surprisingly, the 5% option only realizes a little more than 55,160, compared to the 10% option which is still ahead with just under 56,000.
So where's the advantage in the 5% option? It hides in the second half of every year. Even in the first year, the 5% option makes more in the second six months than the 10% option. For the first few years, this is not enough to offset the difference. But cumulatively, over seventeen and a half years, 5% realizes a grand total of 390.27 more than the 10% option. This in spite of the fact that the 10% option starts with a higher salary- and finishes with a higher salary.",DSReason,mathPrompt,"To determine which deal benefits Manic Martin the most, we calculate the total earnings over 17.5 years for both options:

**Option 1 (5% raise every 6 months):**  
- Initial annual salary: 10,500 wonks.  
- Each 6-month period, the salary increases by 5%.  
- Total 6-month periods: \( 17.5 \times 2 = 35 \).  
- Earnings per 6-month period: \( \frac{\text{Annual Salary}}{2} \).  
- Total earnings form a geometric series:  
\[
S_1 = \sum_{k=0}^{34} \frac{10,500 \times (1.05)^k}{2} = 5,250 \times \frac{(1.05^{35} - 1)}{0.05}
\]  
- Calculation:  
  \( 1.05^{35} \approx 5.516 \), so:  
\[
S_1 \approx 5,250 \times \frac{4.516}{0.05} \approx 474,181.58 \text{ wonks}.
\]

**Option 2 (10% raise annually):**  
- Initial annual salary: 11,000 wonks.  
- Annual salary increases by 10% yearly.  
- Total earnings include 17 full years and a half-year at the 17th raise:  
\[
S_2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{16} 11,000 \times (1.10)^k \right) + \frac{11,000 \times (1.10)^{17}}{2}
\]  
- Geometric series sum for full years:  
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{16} 11,000 \times (1.10)^k = 11,000 \times \frac{(1.10^{17} - 1)}{0.10}
\]  
- Half-year calculation:  
  \( 1.10^{17} \approx 5.054 \), so:  
\[
S_2 \approx 445,991.74 + 27,799.59 \approx 473,791.33 \text{ wonks}.
\]

**Comparison:**  
- \( S_1 \approx 474,181.58 \) wonks (Option 1).  
- \( S_2 \approx 473,791.33 \) wonks (Option 2).  

Option 1 yields approximately **390.25 more wonks** than Option 2 over 17.5 years. The higher compounding frequency (semi-annual 5%) in Option 1 outweighs the initial higher salary of Option 2.

The distance can be calculated as 9 + (9)*(2/3)*(2) + (9)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(2)+..., with the 2 accounting for the upward and downward travel distance.  Adding 9 to this will result in the formation of an infinite geometric series:  18*(2/3)^0 + 18*(2/3)^1 +...  Factoring out the 18 will result in a series that is equal to (1/(1-(2/3))), which equals 3.  Multiplying by the 18 and then subtracting the nine used to create the series will result in 54 - 9 = 45.",DSReason,mathPrompt,"The ball initially drops 9 feet. Each subsequent bounce reaches two-thirds of the previous height, contributing both an upward and downward distance (except the initial drop). The total distance is the initial drop plus twice the sum of all bounce heights. 

The bounce heights form a geometric series starting at 6 feet (9 × 2/3) with a common ratio of 2/3. The sum of this infinite series is \( \frac{6}{1 - \frac{2}{3}} = 18 \). Multiplying by 2 accounts for both upward and downward movements: \( 2 \times 18 = 36 \). Adding the initial 9 feet gives \( 36 + 9 = 45 \).

The two things that I could definitely say about the above integer value are :-
1) It is a perfect square.
2) The number formed is the square of a number 1 less than my age in that year.

b) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Fred's and my ages considered during any one year right since I was a year old.
The two things that I could definitely say about the above integer value are :-
1) It is a perfect square.
2) The number formed is square of a number 1 more than my age in that year.

There is the following math brain teaser on it (besides others).
100 measures of corn must be divided among 5 workers, so that the second worker gets as many measures more than the first worker, as the third gets more than the second, the fourth more than the third and the fifth more than the fourth. The first two workers shall get seven times less measures of corn than the three others.
How many measures of corn shall each worker get?",You can set up a system of equations using the corn for the first worker and the difference in corn between worker i and worker i + 1,"2 equations give a clear answer to the given question:
5w + 10d = 100
7*(2w + d) = 3w + 9d
Where w is amount of corn for the first worker, d is the difference (amount of corn) between two consecutive workers. So this is the solution:
1st worker = 10/6 measures of corn
2nd worker = 65/6 measures of corn
3rd worker = 120/6 (20) measures of corn
4th worker = 175/6 measures of corn
5th worker = 230/6 measures of corn",DSReason,mathPrompt,"The problem involves dividing 100 measures of corn among 5 workers in an arithmetic sequence where each subsequent worker receives a constant difference more than the previous. Let the first worker receive \( x \) measures, and the common difference be \( d \). The workers' shares are \( x \), \( x + d \), \( x + 2d \), \( x + 3d \), and \( x + 4d \).

1. **Total Sum Equation**:  
   The sum of all shares is \( 100 \):  
   \[
   5x + 10d = 100 \implies x + 2d = 20 \quad \text{(1)}
   \]

2. **Condition on First Two vs. Last Three**:  
   The first two workers’ sum is \( \frac{1}{7} \) of the last three’s sum:  
   \[
   7(2x + d) = 3x + 9d \implies 14x + 7d = 3x + 9d \implies 11x = 2d \implies d = \frac{11}{2}x \quad \text{(2)}
   \]

3. **Solving the System**:  
   Substitute \( d = \frac{11}{2}x \) into equation (1):  
   \[
   x + 2\left(\frac{11}{2}x\right) = 20 \implies x + 11x = 20 \implies 12x = 20 \implies x = \frac{5}{3}
   \]  
   Then, \( d = \frac{11}{2} \cdot \frac{5}{3} = \frac{55}{6} \).

4. **Calculating Shares**:  
   - 1st worker: \( x = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.6667 \)  
   - 2nd worker: \( x + d = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{55}{6} = \frac{65}{6} \approx 10.8333 \)  
   - 3rd worker: \( x + 2d = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{110}{6} = 20 \)  
   - 4th worker: \( x + 3d = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{165}{6} = \frac{175}{6} \approx 29.1667 \)  
   - 5th worker: \( x + 4d = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{220}{6} = \frac{230}{6} \approx 38.3333 \)  

5. **Verification**:  
   - Sum of first two: \( \frac{5}{3} + \frac{65}{6} = 12.5 \), sum of last three: \( 20 + \frac{175}{6} + \frac{230}{6} = 87.5 \).  
   - \( 12.5 \times 7 = 87.5 \), confirming the ratio.  

Final answer: The workers receive \( \frac{5}{3} \), \( \frac{65}{6} \), \( 20 \), \( \frac{175}{6} \), and \( \frac{115}{3} \) measures respectively.

247,"The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?","Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74
Lemp 47 94
Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Number of people who got in at the six stations - Number of people who got out at the six stations) =
227 - (364 - 182) =
227 - 182 =
45 people
Thus, I disappointed Tweeto by giving him the answer as 45 people.",DSReason,mathPrompt,Final answer: 45,True
