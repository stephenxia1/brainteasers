0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Label the six coastal villages V₀,V₁,…,V₅ in clockwise order around the circular island.  
We shall take the father and his three sons to live in V₀; the brides live in the next three
villages met when one proceeds clockwise, i.e. in V₁ , V₂ and V₃.

Geometric facts about a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle  
(Here every straight “path through the jungle’’ is a chord of the circumscribed circle.)

 • angle between consecutive villages = 60°.  
 • For a circle of radius R, the chord lengths are  
  adjacent villages   : 2R sin 30° = R  
  two–apart villages  : 2R sin 60° = √3 R  
  opposite villages   : 2R sin 90° = 2R

Thus, for any chosen destination village D the six distances to D fall into four strictly ordered
“levels’’:

 level 0 : D itself (distance 0)  
 level 1 : two adjacent villages (distance R)  
 level √3 : the two that are two‐apart (distance √3 R)  
 level 2 : the village opposite D (distance 2R)

On a courtship trip the suitor must move along chords that always shorten his distance to the
destination, so every trip is a directed path that jumps only from a higher level to a lower
one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Counting the routes for each son
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Groom for V₁  (origin V₀, destination V₁)

V₀ is already at level 1, so the only possible step is the direct chord V₀→V₁.
Number of admissible routes: 1.

2. Groom for V₂  (origin V₀, destination V₂)

Levels with respect to V₂

 level 0 : V₂  
 level 1 : V₁ , V₃  
 level √3: V₀ , V₄  
 level 2 : V₅

V₀ starts on level √3.  It can

 • go straight to V₂, or  
 • drop to V₁ and then V₂, or  
 • drop to V₃ and then V₂.

Therefore the number of admissible routes is 3.

3. Groom for V₃  (origin V₀, destination V₃)

Levels with respect to V₃

 level 0 : V₃  
 level 1 : V₂ , V₄  
 level √3: V₁ , V₅  
 level 2 : V₀	

Starting at V₀ (level 2) the groom may

 • go directly to V₃   (1 route)  
 • go via V₁ or V₅ and then V₃  (2 routes)  
 • go via V₂ or V₄ and then V₃  (2 routes)  
 • go V₀→(V₁ or V₅)→(V₂ or V₄)→V₃ (4 routes)

Total number of admissible routes: 1+2+2+4 = 9.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Wedding dates
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The young men begin courting on 1 April.  
They must make one trip per day and the wedding is celebrated the
day after the last required trip.

 • Groom to V₁ : 1 route ⇒ last trip 1 April ⇒ wedding 2 April  
 • Groom to V₂ : 3 routes ⇒ last trip 3 April ⇒ wedding 4 April  
 • Groom to V₃ : 9 routes ⇒ last trip 9 April ⇒ wedding 10 April

Hence the three wedding days are

 2 April, 4 April and 10 April.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Bonus – the longest individual courtship route
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For the three‐route groom the longest admissible path is  
 V₀ → V₁ → V₄ → V₃ (or symmetrically V₀→V₅→V₂→V₃),  
whose lengths are R + 2R + R = 4R.

The island’s coastline is 10 mi, so the island’s radius is

 2πR = 10 ⇒ R = 5/π ≈ 1.59155 mi.

Therefore the length of that longest route is

 4R = 4·(5/π) = 20/π ≈ 6.366 mi.

Let the sons (and their father) live in village 0.  
“The first three villages encountered when travelling clockwise” are therefore villages 1, 2, 3 – these are the homes of the three brides.

For every pair of villages there is a straight jungle‐path (so we have the complete graph K₆ on the six vertices).  
When a suitor is on his way to the girl’s village he is only allowed to step to a village that is strictly nearer (in ordinary Euclidean distance) to his goal than the village he is leaving.  
Each different admissible route must be used once; the suitor brings a fish by one route each day.

Step 1 – distances from every village to each goal

Distances in a regular hexagon of circum‑radius R (the radius of the island) are

• adjacent vertices: R  
• vertices two apart: √3 R  
• opposite vertices: 2 R .

Goal 1  (village 1)

distance to 1 : 0 ( village 1 )  
             R ( village 0 )  
          > R ( all others )

From village 0 the only strictly shorter step is the direct edge 0 → 1, so there is

 N₁ = 1 route.

Goal 2  (village 2)

distances to 2 : 0 (village 2)  
             R (villages 1,3)  
          √3 R (villages 0,4)  
           2 R (village 5)

Starting at village 0 (distance √3 R) the first step may go to 1 or 3 (distance R) or directly to 2.  
From 1 or 3 one can only go on to 2.  
Hence

 routes: 0 → 2 , 0 → 1 → 2 , 0 → 3 → 2   
 N₂ = 3 routes.

Goal 3  (village 3)

distances to 3 : 0 (village 3)  
             R (villages 2,4)  
         √3 R (villages 1,5)  
           2 R (village 0)

Now construct a downward‑distance directed graph:

• from 1 or 5 one can go to 2,4,3;  
• from 2 or 4 one can only go to 3.

Counting paths upward from 3 gives  
 f(3)=1; f(2)=f(4)=1; f(1)=f(5)=1+1+1=3;  
 f(0)= 1 (0→3) +3 (via 1) +3 (via 5)+1 (via 2)+1 (via 4)=9.

Thus

 N₃ = 9 routes.

Step 2 – number of courtship days and wedding days

The sons start on 1 April and make one trip a day.

Bride in village 1 : 1 day of trips → last trip 1 April → wedding 2 April  
Bride in village 2 : 3 days of trips → last trip 3 April → wedding 4 April  
Bride in village 3 : 9 days of trips → last trip 9 April → wedding 10 April

Step 3 – bonus: length of the longest single route

The island’s circumference is 10 mi, so its radius is  
 R = (10 mi)/(2π) = 5/π ≈ 1.59155 mi.

Among all admissible routes the longest one occurs for the third suitor:

 0 → 1 (length R)  
 1 → 4 (length 2R, a diameter)  
 4 → 3 (length R)

Total length = R + 2R + R = 4R = 20/π ≈ 6.37 miles.

The weddings take place on 2 April, 4 April and 10 April, respectively.

All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.

Let the six coastal villages be V0 … V5, numbered clockwise.  
Because they lie at the vertices of a regular hexagon on a circle of radius R, the chord‑lengths are  
• between neighbouring villages : R  
• between “skip‑one’’ villages : √3 R  
• between opposite villages     : 2 R  

The father of the three sons lives in V0.  
Clockwise from V0 the first three villages are V1 , V2 , V3; those are the brides’ villages.

Custom  
For a fixed destination D, a “legal’’ step is an edge (straight path) from village x to village y with  
dist(y,D) < dist(x,D).  
A “route’’ is a finite sequence of villages beginning at the suitor’s village S and ending at D in which every consecutive pair is a legal step.  
Because the distances strictly decrease, no route ever repeats a village, hence the directed graph of legal steps is acyclic and the number of routes is finite.

Counting the routes  

1. Destination D = V1 (first bride)  
Distances to V1 :  
V1 0,  V0 1,  V2 1,  V3 √3,  V5 √3,  V4 2  
From V0 only V1 is closer, so the only route is V0 → V1.  
Number of routes : 1

2. Destination D = V2 (second bride)  
Distances to V2 :  
V2 0, V1 1, V3 1, V0 √3, V4 √3, V5 2  
Routes counted backwards from D :  
P(V2)=1  
P(V1)=P(V2)=1 ,   P(V3)=P(V2)=1  
P(V0)=P(V1)+P(V3)+P(V2)=3  
Number of routes : 3

3. Destination D = V3 (third bride)  
Distances to V3 :  
V3 0, V2 1, V4 1, V1 √3, V5 √3, V0 2  
Routes :  
P(V3)=1  
P(V2)=P(V4)=1  
P(V1)=P(V2)+P(V4)+P(V3)=3 ,   P(V5)=3  
P(V0)=P(V1)+P(V5)+P(V2)+P(V4)+P(V3)=9  
Number of routes : 9

Courtship calendars (starting 1 April)  
first suitor : 1 route → last fish 1 Apr → wedding 2 Apr  
second suitor: 3 routes → last fish 3 Apr → wedding 4 Apr  
third suitor : 9 routes → last fish 9 Apr → wedding 10 Apr

Bonus – longest route length  
The longest legal route found is V0 → V1 → V4 → V3 (or its mirror V0 → V5 → V2 → V3):
length = R + 2R + R = 4R.  
The circumference of the island equals 2πR = 10 mi, so R = 5/π miles.  
Longest route length = 4R = 20/π ≈ 6.37 miles.

Every two villages are joined by a straight path, so the paths form the complete graph K₆ drawn on the circle.

Because the villages stand on a perfect circle, one may think of the island as a regular hexagon whose vertices are A … F.  
All chord–lengths are therefore determined only by how many steps they are apart round the rim:

adjacent (1 step) → length = R  
two apart (2 steps) → length = R√3  
opposite (3 steps) → length = 2R,

where R is the radius of the island.

Courtship rule  
A suitor must, day after day, walk every possible ROUTE from his own village S to the girl’s village G, subject to

• he travels along straight village‑to‑village paths only, and  
• each leg must bring him strictly closer (Euclidean distance) to G.

A route is therefore a sequence of distinct villages
S = V₀ , V₁ , … , V_k = G
with d(V₀,G) > d(V₁,G) > … > d(V_k,G).

For each betrothal we list all such decreasing‑distance routes; the number of those routes tells us how many days the suitor will be bringing fish.

  V  = {v0 , v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 , v5 }               (the six coastal villages, listed clockwise)  
  S  = {s1 , s2 , s3 }                               (the three suitors / sons)  

Clockwise successor  
  Cw(x , y)  ≡  “y is the next village clockwise after x’’  
  ∀i ( Cw(vi , v(i+1) mod 6) )  

Distance on the island  
  δ(x , y)            = straight‑line (chord) distance between villages x and y  
  Perimeter(V)        = 10 miles  (bonus data)  
  Radius R            = 10 / (2π) miles  
  δ(vi , vj)          = 2R · sin(|i‑j|·π/6)  

Straight path predicate  
  Path(x , y)  ≡  “there is an absolutely straight jungle path joining villages x and y’’  
  ∀x≠y  Path(x , y)                                            (complete graph on V)  

Monotonically‑decreasing route  
  Route(x , y , ⟨w0 … wk⟩)  ≡  
        w0 = x  ∧  wk = y  ∧  
        ∀m<k [ Path(wm , wm+1) ∧ δ(wm+1 , y) < δ(wm , y) ]      

  R(x , y)  = { r | Route(x , y , r) }                (set of all such routes)  

Suitors’ data  
  Home : S → V        (Home(s) is the village in which suitor s lives)  
  Bride : S → V       (Bride(s) is the village of the woman s will marry)  

Given conditions  
  (1) { Bride(s1) , Bride(s2) , Bride(s3) } = { v0 , v1 , v2 }  
      (the first three villages encountered when moving clockwise)  
  (2) Bride(si) ≠ Home(si)                      (no suitor lives in the same village as his bride)  
  (3) ∀x≠y∈S [ Bride(x) ≠ Bride(y) ]            (the three brides are all in different villages)  
  (No further restrictions on the three Home(si) are stated.)  

Courtship rule  
  TravelDay(s , d)  ≡  “on calendar day d, suitor s makes exactly one trip that traverses one
                        previously unused route r ∈ R(Home(s) , Bride(s))’’  

  Completes(s , d)  ≡  “day d is the first day on which suitor s has used every route in
                        R(Home(s) , Bride(s))’’  

Wedding date  
  WeddingDate(s)  =  the unique calendar day d such that  
                     d = (April 1) + |R(Home(s) , Bride(s))|  ∧ Completes(s , d−1)  

Question to be answered  
  Find  WeddingDate(s1) , WeddingDate(s2) , WeddingDate(s3).  

Bonus question  
  LongestRoute  =  max {  Σ(δ(wm , wm+1))  |  s∈S  ∧  ⟨w0 … wk⟩ ∈ R(Home(s) , Bride(s)) }  
  (Compute this value under the additional datum that the coastline is 10 miles long.)
