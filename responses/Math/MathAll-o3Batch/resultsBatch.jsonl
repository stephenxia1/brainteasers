{"ID": 0, "Question": "There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.\nThe island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.\nOn April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.\nIf the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?\nBonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?", "Hint": "To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.", "Human Solution": "The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.\nBonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.\nAll villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:\n1) First set the starting point to one.\n2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.\n3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)\n4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.\nWhich points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.\nNote that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.\nThe routes:\nThis is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.\nRoutes to an adjacent village (A to B):\nTo determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.\nThe farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.\nThe next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.\nThe next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.\nThe next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.\nThere are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.\nRoutes to the second village along the coast (A to C):\nA = 1\nAFi = A = 1\nFi = AFi = 1\nAi = A + AFi = 2\nABi = Ai + A = 3\nM and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nM = Ai + Fi = 3\nB = A + ABi = 4\nBi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBi = B + ABi + M = 10\nDi = M = 3\nBCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBCi = B + Bi = 14\nCDi = Di = 3\nCi = BCi + CDi + M = 20\nC = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41\nThere are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.\nRoutes to the opposite village (A to D):\nSince the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.\nA = 1\nF, B = A = 1\nFAi, ABi = A + B = 2\nAi = A + ABi + FAi = 5\nFi, Bi = ABi + B = 3\nEFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4\nM, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:\nM = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11\nE, C = B + BCi = 5\nEi, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20\nDEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25\nDi = M + CDi + DEi = 61\nD = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121\nThere are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.\nBonus Question:\nThe longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:\nA-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D\nand the mirror route\nA-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D\n(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)\nIf the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.\nThe path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.\nThe paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is\n5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)\nSo the total distance traveled is\n10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Reasoning\n\n1.

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1.

When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.\nSince the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?", "Hint": "A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.

For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.", "Hint": "You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.\nThe problem is as much about logic as it is about math.", "Human Solution": "The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "1.  \u201cOne less\u201d and \u201cone more\u201d are each the product of five primes  \n   \u21d2  N \u2013 1 and N + 1 have 5 primes apiece.  \n   The three numbers together possess 13 different primes  \n   \u21d2  the 5 primes of N \u2013 1, the 5 primes of N + 1 and the primes of N are pair-wise disjoint, so N itself has 13 \u2013 5 \u2013 5 = 3 distinct prime factors.\n\n2.

{"ID": 10, "Question": "After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves.

When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem.

So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?", "Hint": "Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework", "Human Solution": "Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.\nSolution:\nx = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born\nFrom Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.\nGoing back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Let  \n\nTommy\u2019s present age = T  \nTimmy\u2019s present age = t  \nTammy\u2019s present age = m  \nTracey\u2019s present age = r  \nTony\u2019s present age = n  \nMother\u2019s present age = M  \n\nAll ages are whole numbers and the birth-order is  \n\nTommy  > Timmy  > Tammy  > Tracey  > Tony.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.  \u201cI am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.\u201d\n\nWhen Tony was born the children were n years younger, so Timmy\u2019s age then\nwas t \u2013 n.  \nHence            m = 3(t \u2013 n).

{"ID": 16, "Question": "The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.\n\"That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?\"\nBill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?", "Hint": "1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Human Solution": "Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.

If a square is a magic square, then turning the whole sheet through 180\u00b0 automatically gives another magic square: each old row becomes a new row (only written in reverse order), each old column becomes a new column, and the two long diagonals swap places.  Consequently, once we have an ordinary 4 \u00d7 4 magic square, the \u201cupside-down\u201d requirement is already satisfied.\n\n3.

They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.\nEileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.\nNow, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.

Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with \"rock\", 2 points with \"scissors\", and 1 point with \"paper\".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one \"throw\", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.\nThe players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.\nKnowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?", "Hint": "(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.\n(2) This is a \"zero-sum\" game: what one player wins, the other loses.\n(3) The game is \"symmetric\": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.\n(4) The game is \"open\": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.", "Human Solution": "Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.\nMethod:\nTo avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.\n(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.\n(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.\n(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.\n(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.\nWith these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.\nSo, we're looking to mix our \"throws\" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation\nE = 0*R -3*S +1*P\nwhere\nE = expected payoff\nR = proportion of rocks\nS = proportion of scissors\nP = proportion of paper\nAgainst an all-paper opponent:\nE = -1*R + 2*S -0*P\nAgainst someone running with scissors all the time:\nE = 3*R + 0*S -1*P\nWe know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.

A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.

Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.

{"ID": 68, "Question": "Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.\n\"Joseph, your idea worked!

What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?\"\nJoseph smiled and replied, \"Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.\"\n\"Really? But then why did the company like it?\" wondered Martin, \"What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!\"\n\"Yes, yes, and no.\" Joseph laughed, \"You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier.

First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N.

{"ID": 92, "Question": "You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.

For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.\nCan s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.\nNow we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.\nSubstituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7\nWe know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).\nIf x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.\nIf x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.\nIf x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.\nThis proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.\nSubstituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.\nNow we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.\nThe solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10.

[a is not 0.  c is not 0.]\nRule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5.

To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit.

{"ID": 126, "Question": "The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.

{"ID": 151, "Question": "In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.\nOn one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.\nFirst, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.\nSecond, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.\nThird, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.\nFourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)\nFor discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.\nAbout this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, \"Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.\"\nKnowing Junior, we asked, \"How big a headache is your math gonna give us?\"\nShe answered, \"I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.\"\nName the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.", "Hint": "Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.", "Human Solution": "Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.\nAfter labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, \"Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof.

These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.\"\nThe partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's.

{"ID": 169, "Question": "Two years ago, a problem surfaced at the Romankachi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - one of the many companies belonging to the huge Romankachi conglomerate.\nWe were devising a three digit id (nonzero first digit) for the employees such that no two employees can have id's that are identical when written in the reverse order. For example, 123 and 321 are identical and hence only one of them can exist. Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.\nAfter a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system.

The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9).

For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.\nRest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order.

{"ID": 189, "Question": "A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.\nHow fast can the man run?", "Hint": "You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.", "Human Solution": "Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.\nFeel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.

{"ID": 194, "Question": "Difficult Danny has acquired his nickname (and some other, less polite nicknames) due to the fact that, whenever he buys anything, he insists upon paying the exact amount, with precisely 100 pieces of currency. Danny wanted an xCube365 (it lasts 365 days before programmatically disabling itself, so that a new one must be purchased), the highly coveted gaming system that had just been released. It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?", "Hint": "First, see if there is a denomination that is not used. If so, figure out which denomination that is", "Human Solution": "Can at least one of each denomination be used? That totals $186 with only 6 bills, plus at least $94 with the rest of the bills. This is too high. Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.\nIf a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities. So $100 bill is the denomination that is not used. We now know that at least one of each of the other bills is used. That totals $86 with 5 bills, leaving 95 bills to make the other $144.\nThere are only 4 ways to make $144 with these denominations, which are listed in order from $1 bills to $50 bills in each of these sets: {84,10,1,0,0}, {89,1,5,0,0}, {89,3,2,1,0}, {94,0,0,0,1}.

Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.\nHe said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer.

However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.\nThis means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31.

These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.\nThe island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.\nOn April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.\nIf the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?\nBonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?", "Hint": "To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.\nSince the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?", "Hint": "A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Rex did not have to \u201chunt\u2019\u2019 for dimensions \u2013 the numbers that Ralph gave can be satisfied by one and only one regular polygon, so once that polygon is identified every other measurement is forced.\n\n1.

{"ID": 10, "Question": "After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.\nWhat is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?", "Hint": "The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.\nOf course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.", "Human Solution": "First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.\nFour of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:\nF = (N5)/5\nN5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1\nN4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1\nN3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1\nN2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1\nN1 = 4(N)/5 - 1\nF is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.\nSubstitution results in the following equation:\n(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6\nor\n1024N = 15625F + 8404\nGiven that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Let  \n\nN\u2080  = number of coconuts in the common pile when night falls,  \nN\u2081  = pile just after the 1st survivor has finished,  \nN\u2082  = pile just after the 2nd survivor has finished, \u2026 ,  \nN\u2085  = pile that remains on the beach at day-break.\n\nWhat happens each time a survivor acts is identical:\n\n\u201cdivide what you see into 5 equal piles, 1 coconut is left over, give that 1 to the monkey, hide one of the five equal piles, and heap the other four back together\u201d.\n\nThus, if S is the size of the pile a survivor sees when he arrives, the size T he leaves behind satisfies  \n\n4 \u00b7 (S \u2013 1)/5 = T,            (because he removes 1 for the monkey and keeps one fifth).\n\nRe-arranged, S and T are connected by  \n\nS = (5/4) T + 1.

{"ID": 15, "Question": "I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.\n\"How old are you Tammy?\"\n\"I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.\"\n\"How old is your Mum now?\"\n\"There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.\"\nAssuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?", "Hint": "Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework", "Human Solution": "Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.\nSolution:\nx = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born\nFrom Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.\nGoing back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.

Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.\n\"But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,\" Eileen added.\n\"That's okay,\" Robin said.  \"Does it have to be percentages?\"\n\"There's no law; just tradition.  What do you have in mind?\"\n\"We've just studied amicable numbers in algebra.\"\n\"What are those?\"\n\"You know what a perfect number is?\"\n\"Sure,\" Patty interjected, \"a number equal to the sum of its divisors.\"\n\"Great,\" Jay continued.  \"Amicable numbers are a pair where each is equal to the sum of the other one's divisors.\"\nPatty and Eileen digested that for a moment, then nodded.\n\"So, what do you have for four people?\" Patty encouraged.\n\"I don't know.  The smallest pair of amicable numbers is 220 and 284.  Maybe we could order two sets of that?\"\n\"I don't know; traditionally, it's been a dependent sequence.  What's the next pair?\"\n\"1184 and 1210.\"\n\"That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.\"\n\"Well, how about an aliquot sequence?\"\n\"Okay.  How does it taste?\" Patty asked.\n\"Can you hum a few bars?\" Eileen offered at the same time.\nRobin laughed.  \"No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.\"\nEileen and Patty understood.  \"So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?\"\n\"Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.\"\n\"Well, do you have any of those handy?\"\n\"It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?\"\n\"Sure.\"  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  \"At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.\"\nJay and Robin shared a glance.  \"Robin, is your homework still in your pack?\"\n\"It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.\"\nTen minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.

No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.\n(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.\n(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.\n(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.\nWith these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.

First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N.

{"ID": 92, "Question": "You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?\n(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)", "Hint": "ere is the profit made on each size (found using the information in the first few sentences):\nSmall: $0.75\nMedium: $1.00\nLarge: $1.75\nX-large: $2.00", "Human Solution": "(1): m=4s\n(2): m > l > x > s\n(3): 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650, divided by 25 gives...\n(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186\n(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186\nCan s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.\nCan s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.\nNow we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.\nSubstituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7\nWe know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).\nIf x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.\nIf x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.\nIf x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.\nThis proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.\nSubstituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.\nNow we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.\nThe solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10.

Therefore at least one of the two factors must be a multiple of 9.

Choose the final digit of the product  \nSince no factor may contain a 0 or a 5, the only convenient way to obtain a final digit 5 or 0 in the product is impossible, so let the product end in 6 (a very common final digit: 2\u00d73, 2\u00d78, 4\u00d74, 7\u00d78 \u2026 all give 6).\n\nIf the 2-digit factor ends in 7, multiplying by a number that ends in 8 gives the desired last-digit pattern 7 \u00d7 8 \u2261 6 (mod 10).  \nHence pick the 2-digit factor 27 and let the 3-digit factor end in 8.\n\nStep 3.  Finish the 3-digit factor  \nThe digits 2 and 7 are used, leaving 1,3,4,5,6,8,9.  To ensure the 3-digit factor is divisible by 9 (so the whole product is divisible by 81), its digit-sum must be a multiple of 9.  With the ending 8, selecting 1 and 9 gives 1+9+8 = 18, indeed a multiple of 9.  Thus choose the 3-digit factor 198.\n\nStep 4.

{"ID": 126, "Question": "The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nIn a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).

Striving for the smallest possible value  \n   The smallest admissible digit-sum is 9, so we try to realise exactly 9 ones.  \n   Together with the two obligatory trailing zeros this means the number must\n   contain at least 9 + 2 = 11 digits.\n\n   \u2022 If it had only 10 digits (or fewer) there could be at most 8 digits before the\n     final \u201c00\u201d, hence at most 8 ones \u2013 impossible.  \n   \u2022 Thus 11 digits is the minimal length.\n\n4.  Forming the unique 11-digit candidate  \n   With 11 digits, the two final ones are 0\u2019s, leaving 9 leading positions which\n   must all be 1 in order to supply the required nine 1\u2019s:\n\n        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n\n   That is the decimal number 11,111,111,100.\n\n5.  Verification  \n   \u2022 Ends in 00  \u21d2 divisible by 25 (hence by 5\u00b2).  \n   \u2022 Digit-sum = 9\u00b71 = 9  \u21d2 divisible by 9.  \n   \u2022 Since 9 and 25 are coprime, the number is divisible by 225.\n\nNo smaller positive integer composed only of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s can satisfy both\ndivisibility conditions, so this is indeed the minimal amount of gum Rob could\nhave eaten.\n\nFinal answer: 11111111100", "Status": true}

{"ID": 189, "Question": "A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.\nHow fast can the man run?", "Hint": "You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.", "Human Solution": "Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.\nFeel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.

He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?", "Hint": "Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations", "Human Solution": "The observations given are :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nFrom observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.\nLet us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.\nFrom observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.\nHence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.\nIf it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.\nThis means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.\nNow the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number.

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.\nSince the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?", "Hint": "A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Let  \n\nn = number of sides of both the lot and of the house (they are \u201cmatching\u201d regular polygons),  \nL = length of one side of the lot,  \nr = in-radius of the house (distance from the centre to a side),  \nR = circum-radius of the house (radius of the circular foundation),  \n\u03c1 = in-radius of the lot,  \nP = circum-radius of the lot.\n\n1.

{"ID": 10, "Question": "After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.\nWhat is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?", "Hint": "The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.\nOf course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.", "Human Solution": "First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.\nFour of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:\nF = (N5)/5\nN5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1\nN4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1\nN3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1\nN2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1\nN1 = 4(N)/5 - 1\nF is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts.

The following is the conversation we had.\n\"How old are you Tammy?\"\n\"I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.

By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.\n\"That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?\"\nBill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?", "Hint": "1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Human Solution": "Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Let  \n\nA , B , C , D = the girls\u2019 ages to-day, 30 June of this year,  \n(the day of Denise\u2019s wedding and of Bill\u2019s monologue).\n\nBecause the weddings were all exactly one year apart (all on 30 June),\neach girl was exactly one year younger on the same date last year,\ntwo years younger two years ago, etc.\nThus, at the four weddings we had\n\n\u2022 Denise\u2019s wedding (to-day):             D  \n\u2022 Cheryl\u2019s wedding (1 yr ago):           C \u2013 1  \n\u2022 Barbara\u2019s wedding (2 yrs ago):       B \u2013 2  \n\u2022 Alice\u2019s wedding (3 yrs ago):          A \u2013 3  \n\nand, at those instants, the other sisters\u2019 ages were obtained from\nA , B , C , D by subtracting the same number of years.\n\nFor every wedding the bride\u2019s age equalled the sum of the digits of\nthe ages of her three sisters present that day.

The block FGH must be a multiple of 8  \n   Write down every three\u2013digit multiple of 8 whose hundreds\u2013digit F is even and whose digits are all different and drawn from 1\u20139:\n\n   F = 2 : 216, 248, 264, 296  \n   F = 4 : 416, 432, 472, 496  \n   F = 6 : 624, 632, 648, 672  \n   F = 8 : 816, 824, 832, 864, 872, 896\n\n5.  Work with the pair {4, 6} first  \n   If (D, F) are some permutation of {4, 6}, the only possibilities for F in the list above are F = 4 or F = 6.\n\n   \u2022 F = 6 (so D = 4).  We would have to take one of 624, 632, 648, 672 for FGH.  \n     In 624 and 648 the digit 4 is repeated (D = 4), so they are impossible.  \n     In 632 and 672 the last digit is 2, leaving 8 for B; but then CD = C4 must be a multiple of 4.  The only such numbers are 24, 64, 84, all of which repeat a digit (2 with H, 6 with F, or 8 with B).  \n     Hence no choice with F = 6 works.\n\n   \u2022 F = 4 (so D = 6).  Candidate triples are 416, 432, 472, 496.\n\n     \u2013 416 repeats the digit 6 (D = 6).  \n     \u2013 496 repeats the digit 6 as well.  \n     \u2013 432 leaves the even digits 2 and 8 for H and B in some order; CD = C6 must be a multiple of 4, so C \u2208 {1,3,7,9}.  But C = 3 is impossible (3 already appears in 432) and each of the remaining C\u2019s fails the later divisibility-by-7 test.  \n     \u2013 472 (F = 4, G = 7, H = 2) leaves the even digits 6 and 8 unused; one of them is D (already 6) and the other must be B (so B = 8).  Now CD = C6 must be 16, 36, 56, 76, 96; only 16 and 36 keep the digits distinct.  C = 1 keeps them distinct, and then:\n\n         A + B + C = A + 8 + 1 = A + 9 \u2261 0 (mod 3) \u21d2 A \u2261 0 (mod 3).\n\n      \u2003The only unused digit that is \u2261 0 (mod 3) is 3, so A = 3.\n\n      \u2003The first seven digits are thus 3816547.  A direct check shows 3816547 \u00f7 7 = 545 221, so the hard condition (multiple of 7) is satisfied.\n\n      \u2003All eight conditions are now met except the last digit I, which must be the only digit still unused, namely 9.\n\n      \u2003Hence we have obtained the number 381654729.\n\n6.  The pair {2, 8} gives nothing new  \n   Repeating the same analysis with (D, F) being {2, 8} shows that every tentative chain breaks down (either at the CD-multiple-of-4 step or at the multiple-of-7 step).  No additional solution appears.\n\nSince every logically possible avenue except the one leading to 381 654 729 fails, that number is the unique arrangement that satisfies all eight requirements.\n\nFinal answer: 381654729", "Status": true}

The digits to be used  \n   We may take any 9 of the 10 symbols 0\u20139, each at most once.  \n   Because we want N as large as possible, it is never an advantage to keep 0 and throw away a\n   positive digit \u2013 the first place where the discarded positive digit could have stood would be\n   occupied by 0, giving a strictly smaller number.  \n   Hence the best candidate must use the nine positive digits  \n\n            1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9.

(5)\n\n   Any other admissible even\u2013set lacks the digit 8, making the 8th digit at most 7 and\n   giving a smaller number than the one obtained from (5).  Thus (5) is compulsory for a\n   maximal N.\n\n5.  Arranging the digits as large as possible  \n   Now place the digits of the odd\u2013set and even\u2013set alternately from the left, always\n   putting the currently largest available digit into the current position:\n\n        position (from left):   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1\n        place-type (O/E):       O   E   O   E   O   E   O   E   O\n        chosen digit:           9   8   7   6   5   2   4   1   3\n\n   This yields the number\n\n                   987 652 413.                                    (6)\n\n6.  Verification  \n   Sums of alternating places (from the right):\n\n          odd places : 9 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 28\n          even places: 8 + 6 + 2 + 1     = 17\n          difference : 28 \u2013 17 = 11,\n\n   so the number is indeed divisible by 11.  Every digit 1\u20139 appears exactly once, 0 does\n   not appear, and the arrangement in (6) is lexicographically the largest possible under\n   the compulsory split (5).  Any other admissible split makes the digit in position 8\n   smaller than 8, hence produces a smaller nine-digit integer.\n\nTherefore (6) is the unique largest 9-digit number that satisfies all the conditions.\n\nFinal answer: 987652413", "Status": true}

What the sought\u2010for number must be a multiple of  \nBecause it has to be divisible by every integer from 2 up to 18, it must be a multiple of the least common multiple of those integers.\n\n\u20032 = 2                    10 = 2\u00b75  \n\u20033 = 3                    12 = 2\u00b2\u00b73  \n\u20034 = 2\u00b2                   14 = 2\u00b77  \n\u20035 = 5                    15 = 3\u00b75  \n\u20036 = 2\u00b73                  16 = 2\u2074  \n\u20037 = 7                    18 = 2\u00b73\u00b2  \n\u20038 = 2\u00b3  \n\nThe highest powers occurring are 2\u2074, 3\u00b2, 5, 7, 11, 13 and 17, so  \n\nLCM(2,3,\u2026,18)=2\u2074\u00b73\u00b2\u00b75\u00b77\u00b711\u00b713\u00b717=12 252 240.  \n\nHence the ten\u2013digit pandigital we are looking for must be a multiple of 12 252 240.\n\nStep 2.  Two consequences of that multiple\n\u2022 12 252 240 is itself a multiple of 10, so every one of its multiples ends in the digit 0.  \n  Therefore the required number ends in 0, and the other nine digits must be 1\u20139 in some order.\n\n\u2022 The last two digits of 12 252 240 are 40, so the last two digits of any multiple \n  12 252 240\u00b7k are 40\u00b7k (mod 100).  The table\n\n    k\u22611 (mod 5) \u2192 40  ,    k\u22612\u219280,   k\u22613\u219220,   k\u22614\u219260,   k\u22610\u219200  \n\n  shows that the tens digit can be only 2,4,6 or 8 (00 would repeat the digit 0, which is forbidden).  \n  Consequently k itself cannot be a multiple of 5.\n\nStep 3.  Using the test for divisibility by 11  \nBecause 11 divides 12 252 240, every multiple of 12 252 240 is automatically divisible by 11.  \nNevertheless, the alternating\u2013sum test tells us how the nine remaining digits must be arranged.\n\nLet the ten\u2013digit number be d\u2081d\u2082\u2026d\u2089d\u2081\u2080 with d\u2081\u2080 = 0.  \nFor divisibility by 11 we need  \n\u2003(d\u2081+d\u2083+d\u2085+d\u2087+d\u2089) \u2212 (d\u2082+d\u2084+d\u2086+d\u2088+d\u2081\u2080) \u2261 0 (mod 11).             (1)\n\nBecause the sum of all ten different digits 0\u20139 is 45, let the two bracketed sums be S\u2081 (odd positions) and S\u2082 (even positions).  \nThen S\u2081+S\u2082 = 45 and (1) says S\u2081\u2212S\u2082 is a multiple of 11.  \nOnly the odd multiples \u00b111, \u00b133,\u2026 are possible, and the only workable choices are\n\n\u2003S\u2081=28,  S\u2082=17   or   S\u2081=17,  S\u2082=28.                                                (2)\n\nThus the five digits that stand in the odd positions must add to 28 or to 17.\n\nStep 4.  Laying out the two feasible digit sets  \nA short check of the nine digits 1\u20139 shows:\n\n\u2022 To obtain total 28 one may choose the set  {3,4,6,7,8}.  \n  The five complementary digits {1,2,5,9} plus the 0 total 17.\n\n\u2022 To obtain total 17 one may choose the complement of either of  \n  {0,4,7,8,9} or {0,5,6,8,9}; these two possibilities again leave the odd\u2013position\n  digits adding to 28.\n\nSo, without loss of generality, we adopt\n\n\u2003Odd positions (sum = 28): {3,4,6,7,8}  \n\u2003Even positions (sum = 17): {1,2,5,9,0}.                                     (3)\n\nNotice in particular that the tens digit (position 9, an odd position when counted from the left) must be one of 4, 6, 8.\n\nStep 5.  Linking the tens digit to k  \nFrom the table of Step 2:\n\n\u2003k\u22611 (mod 5) gives tens digit 4,  \n\u2003k\u22614 (mod 5) gives tens digit 6,  \n\u2003k\u22612 (mod 5) gives tens digit 8.\n\nAny of those three congruences is compatible with (3).  \nTo keep the arithmetic minimal we follow the middle one and set\n\n\u2003k \u2261 4\u2003(mod 5).                                                             (4)\n\nStep 6.  Restricting k to the correct size  \nBecause 10-digit numbers lie between 1 000 000 000 and 9 999 999 999,\n\n\u20031 000 000 000 / 12 252 240 < k < 9 999 999 999 / 12 252 240  \n\ngives\u200382 \u2264 k \u2264 816.\n\nCombine this with (4):  k must be one of  \n\n\u2003\u2026 79,  94,  109, 124, 139, 154, 169, 184, 199, 214, 229, 244, 259, 274, 289, 304, 319, 334, 349, 364, 379, 394, 409, 424, 439, 454, 469, 484, 499, 514, 529, 544, 559, 574, 589, 604, 619, 634, 649, 664, 679, 694, 709, 724, 739, 754, 769, 784, 799.  \n\nStep 7.  The first value of k that works  \nMultiplying successively by 12 252 240 and inspecting the digits (only 15 products must be checked before a success is reached) one finds that\n\n\u2003k = 309 \u2003(indeed 309\u22614 (mod 5) and 82 \u2264 309 \u2264 816)\n\nproduces\n\n\u200312 252 240 \u00d7 309 = 3 785 942 160.\n\nStep 8.  Verifying the candidate  \n3 785 942 160 contains each of the ten digits 0\u20139 exactly once.  \n\nBecause it is a multiple of 12 252 240, it is automatically divisible by every integer from 2 up to 18 (all of whose prime factors are contained in the l.c.m.).  \nThe quick checks that are usually singled out all work:\n\n\u2022 ends in 0  \u2192 divisible by 2 and 5,  \n\n\u2022 last two digits 60  \u2192 divisible by 4,  \n\n\u2022 last three digits 160  \u2192 divisible by 8,  \n\n\u2022 last four digits 2160  \u2192 divisible by 16,  \n\n\u2022 digit-sum 45  \u2192 divisible by 9 and 3,  \n\n\u2022 alternating sum (3+8+5+9+2)\u2212(7+4+1+6+0)=28\u221217=11  \u2192 divisible by 11,  \n\nand 7, 13, 17 divide it because they divide 12 252 240.\n\nEverything required is satisfied.\n\nTherefore\n\nFinal answer: 3785942160", "Status": true}

(1)\n\n   No move ever joins the sets {a , b} and {c , d} in any other way.\n\n2.  What a closed tour would have to do  \n   A closed tour is a cycle of 48 edges (one for every square).  \n   Because every square is visited exactly once, each square contributes\n   degree 2 to the tour.\n\n   \u2022 Every a\u2013square can be joined only to b\u2013squares, therefore both of the\n     edges incident with each of the 12 a\u2013squares are of type a-b.\n     Hence the tour must contain 12 \u00d7 2 = 24 edges of the form a-b.        (2)\n\n   \u2022 Symmetrically every d\u2013square can be joined only to c\u2013squares, so the\n     tour must also contain 12 \u00d7 2 = 24 edges of the form c-d.             (3)\n\n   Taken together (2) and (3) already account for all 48 edges of the\n   supposed tour.\n\n3.  The contradiction  \n   After the 24 a-b edges every b\u2013square has already degree 2, so no edge\n   of the tour can be of type b-c.\n   After the 24 c-d edges every c\u2013square has degree 2, so no edge of the\n   tour can be of type b-c either.\n\n   Thus no edge of the tour connects a or b with c or d; the 48 edges split\n   into two disjoint cycles, one running exclusively through a\u2013 and\n   b\u2013squares, the other exclusively through c\u2013 and d\u2013squares.\n\n   But a Hamiltonian tour has to be a single cycle that visits every square\n   once, not two separate cycles.  Hence a closed knight\u2019s tour on the\n   12 \u00d7 4 board cannot exist.\n\nTherefore the knight failed because on a 12 \u00d7 4 board a closed knight\u2019s\ntour (one that returns to the starting square) is impossible.\n\nFinal answer:  No closed knight\u2019s tour exists on a 12 \u00d7 4 board; the knight\u2019s moves always keep the colours {a,b} and {c,d} separate, so one single cycle visiting all 48 squares cannot be formed.", "Status": true}

{"ID": 63, "Question": "Patty O'Furniture and her lopsided friend, Eileen, were down to their last dozen Rnkfurers.  Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.\nEileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.\nNow, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of \"off\".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.\n\"I know that voice!  C'mon down.\"\n\"Who is it?\" Eileen prodded.\n\"Well, what do you call a guy making annoying noises in a tree?\"\nEileen shrugged.  \"C'mon down, Jay,\" Patty called into the leaves.\n\"Why should I?\"\n\"I'll give you each a Rnkfurer.\"\n\"Is that the new Sinatra CD?\"\n\"No, it's the world's greatest snack.\"\n\"I'm hungry, too!\" the other voice whined.\n\"Who's up there with you?\"  Patty asked.\n\"I'll bet I know!\" Eileen called.  \"It's obvious!\"\nPatty's face lit up in realization.  \"Robin!\" they laughed together.\nA pair of hard landings and two bites later, Jay and Robin were negotiating to join the next bulk order of Rnkfurers.  Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.\n\"But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,\" Eileen added.\n\"That's okay,\" Robin said.  \"Does it have to be percentages?\"\n\"There's no law; just tradition.

Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.\"\nEileen and Patty understood.  \"So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?\"\n\"Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.\"\n\"Well, do you have any of those handy?\"\n\"It depends; how many of these do we want to order?

{"ID": 64, "Question": "The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with \"rock\", 2 points with \"scissors\", and 1 point with \"paper\".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one \"throw\", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.\nThe players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.\nKnowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?", "Hint": "(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.\n(2) This is a \"zero-sum\" game: what one player wins, the other loses.\n(3) The game is \"symmetric\": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.\n(4) The game is \"open\": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.", "Human Solution": "Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.\nMethod:\nTo avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.\n(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.\n(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.\n(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.\n(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.\nWith these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.\nSo, we're looking to mix our \"throws\" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation\nE = 0*R -3*S +1*P\nwhere\nE = expected payoff\nR = proportion of rocks\nS = proportion of scissors\nP = proportion of paper\nAgainst an all-paper opponent:\nE = -1*R + 2*S -0*P\nAgainst someone running with scissors all the time:\nE = 3*R + 0*S -1*P\nWe know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.

{"ID": 65, "Question": "The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nAssume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.

{"ID": 92, "Question": "You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.  At the end of the day, the profit (not accounting for the coupons) from your sales was $46.50.  Did you make the $20 net profit goal?\n(This is strictly profit of sale over purchase, not involving paying employees, bills, etc.  Also, assume that the customers who use the coupons would not have returned if they didn't have the coupon.  Therefore, the loss from a coupon is the cost for you to make the slush, not the price you would normally receive for it.)", "Hint": "ere is the profit made on each size (found using the information in the first few sentences):\nSmall: $0.75\nMedium: $1.00\nLarge: $1.75\nX-large: $2.00", "Human Solution": "(1): m=4s\n(2): m > l > x > s\n(3): 75s + 100m + 175l + 200x = 4650, divided by 25 gives...\n(4): 3s + 4m + 7l + 8x = 186\n(1) subbed into (4) gives (5): 19s + 7l + 8x = 186\nCan s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.\nCan s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.\nNow we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.\nSubstituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7\nWe know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).\nIf x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.\nIf x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.\nIf x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.\nThis proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.\nSubstituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.\nNow we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10.

[a is not 0.  c is not 0.]\nRule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]\nRule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be \"carried\" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.\nRule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]\nRule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]\nWhen the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).

Moving on a very small circle until the tiger is diametrically opposite you,  \n2. Spiralling out to radius \u00bc while keeping that opposition, and  \n3.

Show that the leading digit of N must be 2.  \nBecause 9abcde lies between 900 000 and 999 999, so does the right\u2013hand side of (1); hence  \n        900 000 \u2264 4(10N+9) < 1 000 000  \n        \u21d2 900 000 \u2264 40N + 36 < 1 000 000  \n        \u21d2 899 964 \u2264 40N < 999 964  \n        \u21d2 22 499.1\u2026 < N < 24 999.1\u2026.  \nThus N is a five-digit number beginning with 2 (and cannot begin with 1 or anything larger).\n\nStep 3.

{"ID": 126, "Question": "The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nIn a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).

{"ID": 189, "Question": "A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.\nHow fast can the man run?", "Hint": "You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.", "Human Solution": "Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.\nFeel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.

{"ID": 247, "Question": "The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.\nHe said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?", "Hint": "Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations", "Human Solution": "The observations given are :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nFrom observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.\nLet us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.\nFrom observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.\nHence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.\nIf it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.\nThis means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.\nNow the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number.

{"ID": 5, "Question": "Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.\nSince the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13.

{"ID": 10, "Question": "After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.\nWhat is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?", "Hint": "The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.\nOf course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.", "Human Solution": "First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.\nFour of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem.

By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.\n\"That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?\"\nBill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?", "Hint": "1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Human Solution": "Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.

Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.\nEileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.\nNow, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of \"off\".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.\n\"I know that voice!

Patty explained how they'd always ordered such that one person got a number of Rnkfurers equal to the next person's percentage.\n\"But that doesn't work out very well with three people, and only with multiples of percentages for four,\" Eileen added.\n\"That's okay,\" Robin said.  \"Does it have to be percentages?\"\n\"There's no law; just tradition.

For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.\"\nEileen and Patty understood.  \"So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?\"\n\"Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.\"\n\"Well, do you have any of those handy?\"\n\"It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?\"\n\"Sure.\"  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  \"At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.\"\nJay and Robin shared a glance.  \"Robin, is your homework still in your pack?\"\n\"It sure is.

Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.

Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one \"throw\", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.\nThe players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.\nKnowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?", "Hint": "(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.\n(2) This is a \"zero-sum\" game: what one player wins, the other loses.\n(3) The game is \"symmetric\": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.\n(4) The game is \"open\": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.", "Human Solution": "Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.\nMethod:\nTo avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.\n(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.\n(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.\n(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.\n(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.\nWith these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.\nSo, we're looking to mix our \"throws\" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.

{"ID": 65, "Question": "The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nAssume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.

{"ID": 74, "Question": "Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.\nThe system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.\nSo: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.\nThe problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?", "Hint": "The title has a slight hint.\nThe number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.", "Human Solution": "The minimum number of weights is 5.\nweight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0\nweight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1\nweight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2\nweight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3\nweight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4\nAll five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.\nThe progression from one stone to one mass would be:\n1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "Reasoning  \n\n1.  What \u201cweighing with a balance\u201d really means  \n   \u2022  We may put the unknown object on either pan.  \n   \u2022  We may put each weight on either pan.  \n   \u2022  Hence a weight can act with a sign +1 (opposite the object), \u20131 (same side as the object) or 0 (not used).  \n   \u2022  So every integer weight we can measure is a signed sum of the available weights whose coefficients are \u20131, 0, 1.\n\n2.  The classical way to obtain every signed sum from 1 up to a certain limit with the fewest weights is to let the\n    weights grow by successive powers of 3.  \n    Reason: if the available weights are  \n          1, 3, 9, \u2026 , 3\u207f  \n    then the largest weight still not representable after the first k weights is  \n          1 + 3 + 9 + \u2026 + 3\u1d4f = (3\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 \u2013 1)/2.  \n    Adding the next power 3\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 extends the range exactly as far as is possible with one more weight, so the list  \n          1, 3, 9, \u2026 is optimal (this is the classical \u201cbalanced\u2013ternary\u201d argument).\n\n3.  How many powers of 3 are needed to reach one mass (121 stone)?  \n       (3\u2070 + 3\u00b9 + 3\u00b2 + 3\u00b3 + 3\u2074) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121.  \n    That already reaches the required upper limit, so no higher power of 3 is needed.\n\n4.  Therefore a minimal set of weights is  \n       1-stone, 3-stone, 9-stone, 27-stone, 81-stone,  \n    five weights in all.\n\n5.  Checking minimality  \n    With only four weights the best we could do is  \n          1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 < 121,  \n    so four weights cannot possibly suffice.  Hence five weights are not only sufficient but also necessary.\n\n6.  How to use them (example)  \n    Suppose we want to weigh 58 stone.  Write 58 in balanced ternary:  \n          58 = 81\u00b7(\u20131) + 27\u00b71 + 9\u00b71 + 3\u00b70 + 1\u00b71.  \n    Place the 81-stone weight on the same pan as the object (sign \u20131) and the 27-, 9- and 1-stone weights on the opposite pan (sign +1).  Both pans then balance:  \n          object + 81 = 27 + 9 + 1  \u21d2 object = 58.\n\nThus the chief\u2019s advisers could replace the bulky \u201c10 lumps and 11 stones\u201d by just five weights while still being able to measure any whole number of stone from 1 to 121.\n\nFinal answer: Five weights of 1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone and 81 stone are sufficient and minimal.", "Status": true}

{"ID": 92, "Question": "You have a small shack in a parking lot, out of which you sell slushes for a few hours a day.  You sell them in 4 sizes: small (12 oz), medium (20 oz), large (32 oz), and x-large (40 oz), and you charge $1.50, $2.25, $3.75, and $4.50 for each size, respectively.  The cups cost you 3 cents for small, 5 cents for medium, 8 cents for large, and 10 cents for x-large, and the slush ingredients cost you 6 cents per ounce.  Today, you are having a special: with every slush purchased, the customer receives a coupon for a free small slush.  You figure that this special will increase sales for the day, but that the losses (due to giving out free slushes in the future) will cut the profit down to a much-below-average day.  Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.  Through the day, medium was the best-selling size -- they sold exactly 4 times as many as smalls! -- followed by large, then x-large, and finally small.

For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.\nCan s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.\nNow we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.\nSubstituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7\nWe know x is at least 4, because s is 3.

Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.\nThis proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.\nSubstituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.\nNow we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10.

As mentioned in the hint, there are many methods in which to solve this. One less complex method is to imagine the axis of the cone form a right triangle. This triangle shares the dimensions of the cone, so it is 12 by 5. We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.\nNext we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x.

A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.

{"ID": 166, "Question": "Your assignment is to make a delivery from the depot to your base camp, 1600 miles away. The trip begins normally, but unfortunately, halfway to base camp, your supply truck breaks down. You have no way to call for help. Luckily, in addition to medical supplies, the truck is carrying a Desert Patrol Vehicle (DPV) and two barrels of fuel.\nThe DPV has a full 10 gallon tank, but to make room for the medical supplies, it can only carry one of the 45 gallon barrels at a time.

{"ID": 189, "Question": "A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.\nHow fast can the man run?", "Hint": "You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.", "Human Solution": "Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.\nFeel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.

Danny wanted an xCube365 (it lasts 365 days before programmatically disabling itself, so that a new one must be purchased), the highly coveted gaming system that had just been released. It cost $230, but he managed to save up enough to buy one. He paid using some quantity (possibly zero) of each the following denominations of bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence. For example, if there were 2 ones, 3 twenties, and 6 tens, 2 x 3 = 6, so this would fit the rule. How many of each denomination did Danny use to buy the xCube365?", "Hint": "First, see if there is a denomination that is not used. If so, figure out which denomination that is", "Human Solution": "Can at least one of each denomination be used? That totals $186 with only 6 bills, plus at least $94 with the rest of the bills. This is too high. Can two or more of the denominations not be used? Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.\nIf a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities.

Here comes Prince Hajikidama of the Marbles Kingdom.

It hides in the second half of every year. Even in the first year, the 5% option makes more in the second six months than the 10% option. For the first few years, this is not enough to offset the difference. But cumulatively, over seventeen and a half years, 5% realizes a grand total of 390.27 more than the 10% option.

{"ID": 247, "Question": "The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.\nHe said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?", "Hint": "Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations", "Human Solution": "The observations given are :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nFrom observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.\nLet us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.\nFrom observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.\nHence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.\nIf it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.\nThis means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.\nNow the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number.
