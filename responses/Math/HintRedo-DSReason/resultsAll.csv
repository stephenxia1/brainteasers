D. The chess marathon ran for a total of 16 hours.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To determine which two quotes do not belong, we analyze each clue by assigning a numerical value and checking their relation to time or patterns:

- **A (29 seconds)**: Correct time duration.  
- **B (25 days)**: Correct calculation (September has 30 days; subtracting 5 days off).  
- **C (289 degrees)**: Sum of angles, **not time-related**.  
- **D (16 hours)**: Correct duration (noon to 4am).  
- **E (1 hour)**: Correct show duration.  

**Clue C** is about angles, not time. **Clue B** is ambiguous due to awkward phrasing (""exception of one, five-day work week""), leading to potential misinterpretation. While the calculation (25 days) is mathematically valid, the phrasing introduces confusion about whether it refers to days off or work structure, making it questionable as a clear time-related statement.

The pyramid must adhere to the rule that each number is the absolute difference of the two numbers directly below it. After extensive trial and error, focusing on ensuring all numbers 1–15 are used uniquely and differences propagate correctly, the final arrangement is:

If A=10, then the only possibility is B=10, C=10, 57 possibilities accumulated.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To solve the problem, we start by noting that since \( A \) is a factor of both \( B \) and \( C \), we can express \( B = A \cdot k \) and \( C = A \cdot m \) where \( k \) and \( m \) are positive integers. Substituting these into the equation \( A + B + C = 30 \) gives:

\[
A(1 + k + m) = 30 \implies 1 + k + m = \frac{30}{A}
\]

This implies \( \frac{30}{A} \) must be an integer, so \( A \) must be a divisor of 30. The divisors of 30 are \( 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30 \). However, \( A \) must also satisfy \( 1 + k + m \geq 3 \) (since \( k, m \geq 1 \)), which restricts \( A \) to \( 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10 \).

For each valid \( A \), we solve \( k + m = \frac{30}{A} - 1 \). The number of ordered pairs \((k, m)\) of positive integers summing to \( S \) is \( S - 1 \). Thus, for each \( A \), the number of solutions is:

\[
\left(\frac{30}{A} - 1\right) - 1 = \frac{30}{A} - 2
\]

Calculating for each valid \( A \):

- \( A = 1 \): \( \frac{30}{1} - 2 = 28 \)
- \( A = 2 \): \( \frac{30}{2} - 2 = 13 \)
- \( A = 3 \): \( \frac{30}{3} - 2 = 8 \)
- \( A = 5 \): \( \frac{30}{5} - 2 = 4 \)
- \( A = 6 \): \( \frac{30}{6} - 2 = 3 \)
- \( A = 10 \): \( \frac{30}{10} - 2 = 1 \)

Summing these values gives the total number of ordered triples:

\[
28 + 13 + 8 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 57

He phones two of the residents, tells them the news, asks them to do the same and phone just two more people, and then get out of the building.
Assume that each of the residents is in, and answers the phone immediately.
If each phone call takes 30 seconds, and it takes each person 90 seconds to get out of the building, how long will it take to empty all 375 apartments?
 Hint: Fibonacci might have the answer!",Fibonacci might have the answer!,"7 minutes.
In the first 30 seconds, Dave rings one other person, call him A.

Thus 375 people were informed after 11 periods of phone calls.
11 calls at 30 seconds each = 5.5 minutes, plus 90 seconds for the last people to exit the building gives 7 minutes.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To determine how long it will take to empty all 375 apartments, we analyze the notification chain and evacuation process:

1. **Notification Process**:
   - Each phone call takes 30 seconds, and each person notified must call two others before evacuating.
   - The number of new people notified at each 30-second interval follows a Fibonacci-like sequence because each person notifies two others sequentially, creating overlapping contributions from prior intervals:
     - At \( t = 30 \)s: 2 people notified.
     - At \( t = 60 \)s: 2 people notified.
     - At \( t = 90 \)s: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) people notified.
     - This pattern continues, with each step’s notifications being the sum of the previous two steps.

2. **Cumulative Notifications**:
   - Summing the Fibonacci sequence, the cumulative number of people notified reaches 464 by \( t = 330 \) seconds (11th step), exceeding 375. Thus, all apartments are notified by \( t = 330 \)s.

3. **Evacuation Time**:
   - After being notified, a person spends 60 seconds making two calls (30s each) and then 90 seconds evacuating. Thus, their total evacuation time is \( T_{\text{notify}} + 150 \) seconds.
   - The last person is notified at \( t = 330 \)s. They finish evacuating at \( 330 + 150 = 480 \) seconds.

D must satisfy 4D ending with 2, so D=3 or 8. Testing D=8 (since D=3 would make DCBA start with 3, impossible for ABCD starting with 2), we set up the equation:

 Hint: nan",,"The prime factorization of 225 is 5*5*3*3. So the answer will be both a factor of 25 and of 9.
All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.
The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To determine the smallest integer greater than 0 composed solely of zeros and ones and divisible by 225, we note that 225 factors into \(25 \times 9\).

240,"Question: In the legendary land of Madadia, everything is wonderful. There is no inflation, so Madadian wonks (local currency 100 winks = 1 wonk) are constant in value.
Mad Ade's cousin Manic Martin works as an accountant in one of Madadia's leading accounting firms.
After his first year his salary was a straight 10,000 wonks, with which Manic Martin was quite happy. His manager was so impressed with his work he offered Manic Martin a wage rise.
Now this being Madadia, things are not always done as they are elsewhere, the wage rise was offered over a 17.5 year contract period, These contracts are immutably binding, and will still be paid to benefactors in the event of death or permanent disability.
Manic Martin has a choice of how to receive his raise.  The first option was for an immediate 5% raise to 10,500 wonks annually, with an additional 5% raise every 6 months. The second option was for an immediate 10% raise to 11,000 wonks annually, with an additional 10% raise every year. Manic Martin's salary, based upon his current annual, was paid bi-weekly.
Which deal would benefit Manic Martin the most?
 Hint: Think about the difference between the first and second half of every year",Think about the difference between the first and second half of every year,"The 5% semi-annual raise yields a higher return.
This may have been your first guess, but there is something odd about the answer. At the start of the problem, the 10% raise is earning more-  11,000 annually vs. 10,500. After the first year, the 5% option has earned 10,762 compared to 11,000.
What are the two options earning at the moment the contract closes, after 17.5 years? Surprisingly, the 5% option only realizes a little more than 55,160, compared to the 10% option which is still ahead with just under 56,000.
So where's the advantage in the 5% option? It hides in the second half of every year. Even in the first year, the 5% option makes more in the second six months than the 10% option. For the first few years, this is not enough to offset the difference. But cumulatively, over seventeen and a half years, 5% realizes a grand total of 390.27 more than the 10% option. This in spite of the fact that the 10% option starts with a higher salary- and finishes with a higher salary.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"Manic Martin has two options for his wage raise over a 17.5-year contract.

**Option 1**: A 5% raise every 6 months, starting at 10,500 wonks annually.  
**Option 2**: A 10% raise annually, starting at 11,000 wonks annually.

### **Analysis of Option 1**  
- **Structure**: Salary increases by 5% every 6 months. Over 17.5 years (35 half-year periods), the salary compounds semi-annually.  
- **Total Earnings**: Sum of a geometric series with:  
  - First term \( a = 10,500 / 2 = 5,250 \) (half-year salary at the start),  
  - Common ratio \( r = 1.05 \),  
  - Number of terms \( n = 35 \).  
  - Formula:  
    \[
    S_1 = 5,250 \times \frac{(1.05)^{35} - 1}{0.05}
    \]  
  - Calculation:  
    - \( (1.05)^{35} \approx 5.516 \),  
    - \( S_1 \approx 5,250 \times \frac{5.516 - 1}{0.05} \approx 474,180 \) wonks.

### **Analysis of Option 2**  
- **Structure**: Salary increases by 10% annually. Over 17.5 years, this includes 17 full years and 6 months of the 18th year.  
- **Total Earnings**:  
  - Sum of 17 years of compounded salaries plus half of the 18th year’s salary:  
    \[
    S_2 = \left(11,000 \times \frac{(1.10)^{17} - 1}{0.10}\right) + \left(\frac{11,000 \times (1.10)^{17}}{2}\right)
    \]  
  - Calculation:  
    - \( (1.10)^{17} \approx 5.054 \),  
    - Sum of 17 years: \( 11,000 \times \frac{5.054 - 1}{0.10} \approx 445,992 \) wonks,  
    - Half of 18th year: \( \frac{11,000 \times 5.054}{2} \approx 27,800 \) wonks,  
    - Total \( S_2 \approx 445,992 + 27,800 \approx 473,792 \) wonks.

### **Comparison**  
- **Option 1 Total**: \( \approx 474,180 \) wonks,  
- **Option 2 Total**: \( \approx 473,792 \) wonks.  

Option 1 yields **388 wonks more** over 17.5 years. While Option 2 starts with higher initial salaries, the more frequent compounding in Option 1 (10.25% effective annual rate vs. 10%) allows it to overtake Option 2 in later years. The hint highlights that Option 1’s semi-annual raises create increasing salaries in the second half of each year, accelerating growth.

5w + 10d = 100
7*(2w + d) = 3w + 9d
Where w is amount of corn for the first worker, d is the difference (amount of corn) between two consecutive workers. So this is the solution:
1st worker = 10/6 measures of corn
2nd worker = 65/6 measures of corn
3rd worker = 120/6 (20) measures of corn
4th worker = 175/6 measures of corn

\( A = x \),  
\( B = x + d \),  
\( C = x + 2d \),  
\( D = x + 3d \),  
\( E = x + 4d \).  

**Total Corn Equation**:  
\[
x + (x + d) + (x + 2d) + (x + 3d) + (x + 4d) = 100

Simplifying:  
\[

**Condition on First Two vs. Last Three**:  
The first two workers get seven times less than the last three, meaning:

The key is to use asymmetric placements to maximize unique distance combinations. 

1. **Start with endpoints**: Include 0 and 36 cm as the endpoints.
2. **Add critical intermediate marks**: Place marks at positions that generate a wide range of differences. For example:
   - **1 cm** covers 1 and 35 (36-1).
   - **3 cm** introduces differences like 2 (3-1) and 33 (36-3).
   - **7 cm** adds differences 4 (7-3), 29 (36-7).
   - **12 cm** yields 5 (12-7), 24 (36-12).
   - **20 cm** contributes 8 (20-12), 16 (36-20).
   - **30 cm** provides 10 (30-20), 6 (36-30).
   - Additional marks fill remaining gaps through combinations of existing differences.

After careful consideration and testing various configurations, the optimal asymmetric placement of marks ensures all differences from 1 to 36 are covered. The correct marks are:

247,"Question: The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?
 Hint: Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74
Lemp 47 94
Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Number of people who got in at the six stations - Number of people who got out at the six stations) =
227 - (364 - 182) =
227 - 182 =
45 people
Thus, I disappointed Tweeto by giving him the answer as 45 people.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of passengers on the train before it reached Maver station, given the conditions about boarding and alighting passengers at each station. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Key Observations:
1. **Passenger Dynamics**: At each station, twice as many people board as those who alight. If \( d \) people alight, \( 2d \) board.
2. **Prime Constraints**: The number of alighting passengers at each station is a prime number in specific ranges:
   - **Maver (0-10)**: 2, 3, 5, 7  
   - **Willow (10-20)**: 11, 13, 17, 19  
   - **Wonderland (20-30)**: 23, 29  
   - **Doku (30-40)**: 31, 37  
   - **Lemp (40-50)**: 41, 43, 47  
   - **Rudolf (50-60)**: 53, 59  
3. **Difference Requirement**: The difference between consecutive boarding counts (2d) must be at least 20, implying consecutive alighting primes must differ by at least 10.
4. **Total Even Requirement**: The sum of all alighting passengers must be even.

### Valid Sequence Identification:
We need a sequence of primes \( (d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6) \) from the respective ranges such that:
- \( d_{i+1} - d_i \geq 10 \) for \( i = 1 \text{ to } 5 \),
- Total \( \sum d_i \) is even.

#### Trial Sequence:
- **Maver (\( d_1 = 3 \))**: Smallest prime in 0-10 range.
- **Willow (\( d_2 = 13 \))**: Next valid prime ≥ \( 3 + 10 \).
- **Wonderland (\( d_3 = 23 \))**: Next valid prime ≥ \( 13 + 10 \).
- **Doku (\( d_4 = 37 \))**: Next valid prime ≥ \( 23 + 10 \).
- **Lemp (\( d_5 = 47 \))**: Next valid prime ≥ \( 37 + 10 \).
- **Rudolf (\( d_6 = 59 \))**: Next valid prime ≥ \( 47 + 10 \).

**Sum Check**:
\[
3 + 13 + 23 + 37 + 47 + 59 = 182 \quad (\text{Even})
\]
This satisfies the total even requirement.

### Passenger Count Calculation:
Starting with \( P \) passengers before Maver, the passenger count evolves as follows:
1. **Maver**: \( P - 3 + 6 = P + 3 \)
2. **Willow**: \( (P + 3) - 13 + 26 = P + 16 \)
3. **Wonderland**: \( (P + 16) - 23 + 46 = P + 39 \)
4. **Doku**: \( (P + 39) - 37 + 74 = P + 76 \)
5. **Lemp**: \( (P + 76) - 47 + 94 = P + 123 \)
6. **Rudolf**: \( (P + 123) - 59 + 118 = P + 182 \)

Given that the final count at Rudolf is 227:
\[
P + 182 = 227 \implies P = 45

248,"Question: Some time after 2 O' Clock, the angle made between the minute hand and the vertical (12) on a clock is double the angle made between the hour hand and the vertical (12). What time is it?
 Hint: What is the rate of travel of each hand on a clock?",What is the rate of travel of each hand on a clock?,"2:24 The hour hand makes an angle of 72 degrees while the minute hand makes an angle of 144 degrees.
At exactly 2:00, the angle made by the hour hand is 60 degrees from vertical.  If you let x = the number of minutes past 2:00 that we are looking for, then the hour hand will be at:
60 degrees + x / 60 min* 30 degrees
where x/60 min is the fraction of a full hour that has past, and is therefore the fractional distance that the hour hand has moved closer to the 3.  The 30 degrees is the total angle between the 2 and the 3.
The final position of the minute hand will be:
x/30 min * 180 degrees
for the same reasoning as with the hour hand.
Since the minute hand will make twice the angle with vertical, you can set up the equation:
2*(60 + x / 60 * 30) = x / 30 * 180
Solving for x will give you 24 minutes.  The time will be 2:24.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To solve the problem, we first determine the rates at which the hour and minute hands move. The minute hand moves at 6 degrees per minute, and the hour hand at 0.5 degrees per minute. Let \( t \) be the number of minutes after 2:00. 

The hour hand's angle from 12 at time \( t \) is \( 60 + 0.5t \) degrees (starting at 60 degrees for 2:00). The minute hand's angle is \( 6t \) degrees. The problem states that the **smallest angle** between the minute hand and 12 is **twice** that of the hour hand. 

### Case 1: Minute hand angle \( 6t \) (valid when \( t < 30 \))
\[
6t = 2(60 + 0.5t) \implies 6t = 120 + t \implies 5t = 120 \implies t = 24 \text{ minutes.}
\]
This gives **2:24**. At this time:
- Hour hand: \( 60 + 0.5(24) = 72^\circ \)
- Minute hand: \( 6(24) = 144^\circ \)
- \( 144^\circ = 2 \times 72^\circ \), valid.

### Case 2: Minute hand angle \( 360 - 6t \) (valid when \( t \geq 30 \))
\[
360 - 6t = 2(60 + 0.5t) \implies 360 - 6t = 120 + t \implies 240 = 7t \implies t = \frac{240}{7} \approx 34.2857 \text{ minutes.}
\]
This is approximately **2:34:17**. At this time:
- Hour hand: \( 60 + 0.5\left(\frac{240}{7}\right) \approx 77.14^\circ \)
- Minute hand (smallest angle): \( 360 - 6\left(\frac{240}{7}\right) \approx 154.29^\circ \)
- \( 154.29^\circ \approx 2 \times 77.14^\circ \), valid.

Both solutions satisfy the condition. However, the problem asks ""What time is it?"" in singular, which may imply the first valid occurrence.
