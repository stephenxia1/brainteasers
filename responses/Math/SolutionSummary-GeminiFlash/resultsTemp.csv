0,"Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?
 Solution: The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GeminiFlash,solutionSummary,"Okay, here is a summary of the solution, broken down into simple steps:

**Problem:** Determine the wedding dates for three sons courting brides in different villages (adjacent, second village, opposite village) and find the longest path length for any son, given specific rules about travel and a perfectly round island with villages and crossings.

**Solution Summary:**

The solution calculates the number of valid travel routes for each son based on the rule of always getting closer to the destination. The wedding date is determined by the day the last unique route is traveled. The longest route length is calculated using the geometry of the island and a specific identified path.

Here are the steps:

**Part 1: Wedding Dates**

1.  **Identify the travel destinations:** The three sons travel from their village (let's call it A) to the first three villages clockwise (B, C, and D), which are an adjacent village (B), the second village along the coast (C), and the opposite village (D).
2.  **Determine the valid travel paths:** The sons can only travel along straight paths connecting villages or visiting intermediate crossings, with the constraint that they must *always* be getting closer to their final destination village.
3.  **Count the number of valid routes for each destination:** Using a method that involves identifying all possible nodes (villages and crossings) and counting paths by moving step-by-step from the start village to the destination village, ensuring each step moves closer to the destination and summing the counts of paths leading to intermediate nodes. The solution calculates the number of valid routes:
    *   From A to B (adjacent village): 5 routes.
    *   From A to C (second village): 41 routes.
    *   From A to D (opposite village): 121 routes.
4.  **Determine the last travel day:** Each route corresponds to a day of travel, starting on April 1st. The total number of valid routes equals the total number of trips the son must make. The last trip occurs on the day number corresponding to the total number of routes.
    *   For 5 routes, the last trip is on the 5th day (April 1st + 4 days = April 5th).
    *   For 41 routes, the last trip is on the 41st day (April 1st + 40 days = May 11th, as April has 30 days).
    *   For 121 routes, the last trip is on the 121st day (April 1st + 120 days = July 30th, counting 30 days in April, 31 in May, 30 in June, and 29 into July).
5.  **Determine the wedding dates:** The wedding takes place on the day *following* the last trip.
    *   After the last trip on April 5th, the wedding is on April 6th.
    *   After the last trip on May 11th, the wedding is on May 12th.
    *   After the last trip on July 30th, the wedding is on July 31st. (Note: The provided solution states August 1st for the last wedding date, which suggests a potential one-day discrepancy in the problem's date counting or the solution's calculation). Based on the calculation above, the dates are April 6th, May 12th, and July 31st. *Following the provided solution's dates*, the weddings are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.

**Part 2: Bonus Question (Longest Route Length)**

1.  **Identify the geometry:** The island is a circle with a 10-mile circumference and 6 evenly spaced villages forming a regular hexagon inscribed within the circle. The radius (r) of the circle (and the length of a hexagon side between adjacent villages) is Circumference / (2 * Pi) = 10 / (2 * Pi) = 5/Pi miles.
2.  **Identify the longest route:** The solution identifies a specific path from village A to village D (the opposite village) as one of the longest valid routes, for example, the path A to B to ABi to C to Ci to CDi to Di to D (where ABi, Ci, CDi, Di are intermediate crossings).
3.  **Break down the longest route into segments:** This specific path is broken down into segments: A-B, B-ABi, ABi-C, C-Ci, Ci-CDi, CDi-Di, and Di-D.
4.  **Determine the length of each segment:** Using the geometry of the hexagon and the implied structure of the interior crossings, the segments are assigned lengths relative to the radius:
    *   A-B is a hexagon side: length = r = 5/Pi.
    *   C-Ci and Di-D are segments on paths towards the center or opposite village: length = r/2 = (5/Pi)/2.
    *   The remaining four segments (B-ABi, ABi-C, Ci-CDi, CDi-Di) are determined to have lengths equal to the side of smaller internal equilateral triangles, which is r/sqrt(3) = (5/Pi)/sqrt(3).
5.  **Calculate the total length:** Sum the lengths of the segments: (A-B) + (B-ABi) + (ABi-C) + (C-Ci) + (Ci-CDi) + (CDi-Di) + (Di-D) = r + r/sqrt(3) + r/sqrt(3) + r/2 + r/sqrt(3) + r/sqrt(3) + r/2 = r + r + 4*(r/sqrt(3)) = 2r + 4r/sqrt(3).
6.  **Substitute the value of r and calculate:** Plug in r = 5/Pi: 2*(5/Pi) + 4*(5/Pi)/sqrt(3) = 10/Pi + 20/(Pi*sqrt(3)).
7.  **Compute the numerical value:** Calculate 10/Pi + 20/(Pi*sqrt(3)) which is approximately 3.183 + 3.676 = 6.859 miles.
8.  **State the longest route length:** The longest route length is approximately 6.86 miles.",True
1,"Question: What is the smallest integer such that if you rotate the number to the left you get a number that is exactly one and a half times the original number?
(To rotate the number left, take the first digit off the front and append it to the end of the number.  2591 rotated to the left is 5912.)
 Solution: 1,176,470,588,235,294
x 1.5 =
1,764,705,882,352,941
Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)

70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)

1.  **Represent the Number Algebraically:** Let the integer be N. Let it have k digits. Let the first digit be d (where d is an integer from 1 to 9). The number can be written as N = d * 10^(k-1) + R, where R is the number formed by the remaining k-1 digits.

2.  **Represent the Rotated Number:** Rotating N to the left means taking the first digit 'd' and moving it to the end. The resulting number, N_rotated, is formed by taking R and appending 'd' as the last digit. This can be written as N_rotated = R * 10 + d.

3.  **Set up the Equation:** The problem states that the rotated number is exactly 1.5 times the original number: N_rotated = 1.5 * N. Substitute the expressions from steps 1 and 2 into this equation: R * 10 + d = 1.5 * (d * 10^(k-1) + R).

4.  **Solve the Equation for R:** Expand and rearrange the equation to express R in terms of d and k:
    *   10R + d = 1.5 * d * 10^(k-1) + 1.5R
    *   10R - 1.5R = 1.5 * d * 10^(k-1) - d
    *   8.5R = d * (1.5 * 10^(k-1) - 1)
    *   Multiply by 2 to get integer coefficients: 17R = d * (3 * 10^(k-1) - 2)
    *   R = d * (3 * 10^(k-1) - 2) / 17

5.  **Relate N back to d and k:** Substitute the expression for R back into the original equation for N (N = d * 10^(k-1) + R):
    *   N = d * 10^(k-1) + d * (3 * 10^(k-1) - 2) / 17
    *   Combine the terms by finding a common denominator: N = d * [17 * 10^(k-1) + (3 * 10^(k-1) - 2)] / 17
    *   Simplify: N = d * [20 * 10^(k-1) - 2] / 17
    *   Factor out 2: N = 2 * d * [10 * 10^(k-1) - 1] / 17
    *   N = 2 * d * (10^k - 1) / 17

6.  **Identify the Condition for N to be an Integer:** For N to be an integer, since 17 is a prime number and does not divide 2 or any single digit d (from 1 to 9), the number 17 must divide the term (10^k - 1). This is equivalent to the modular arithmetic condition 10^k ≡ 1 (mod 17).

7.  **Find the Smallest Number of Digits (k):** Determine the smallest positive integer k for which 10^k ≡ 1 (mod 17). This is the order of 10 modulo 17. By calculating powers of 10 mod 17, we find that 10^1 ≡ 10, 10^2 ≡ 15, 10^3 ≡ 12, 10^4 ≡ 1, 10^5 ≡ 10, ..., 10^8 ≡ 16 ≡ -1, and finally 10^16 ≡ (-1)^2 ≡ 1 (mod 17). The smallest such k is 16.

8.  **Substitute k back into the Equation for N:** Using k=16, the equation for N becomes: N = 2 * d * (10^16 - 1) / 17. The term (10^16 - 1) / 17 is the 16-digit number formed by the repeating part of 1/17, which is 0588235294117647.
    *   N = 2 * d * 0588235294117647

9.  **Determine the Smallest First Digit (d):** To find the *smallest* integer N, we must choose the smallest possible non-zero value for the first digit d. The smallest non-zero digit is d=1.

10. **Calculate the Smallest Integer N:** Substitute d=1 and k=16 into the equation for N:
    *   N = 2 * 1 * 0588235294117647
    *   N = 1176470588235294.

This number has 16 digits, and its first digit is 1, matching our assumptions. Thus, 1,176,470,588,235,294 is the smallest integer satisfying the given condition.",True

The problem asks for a mathematical expression using exactly two '2's and standard operations to equal 5. The provided solution is `sqrt( (.2)^(-2) )`.

Here is the reasoning broken down into simple steps:

1.  **Identify the expression:** The proposed solution is `sqrt( (.2)^(-2) )`.
2.  **Understand the inner part:** The expression inside the square root is `(.2)^(-2)`. The notation `.2` represents the decimal number 0.2.
3.  **Understand the exponent:** The exponent `^(-2)` means raising the base (0.2) to the power of -2. A negative exponent indicates the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive exponent, so `(0.2)^(-2)` is equivalent to `1 / (0.2)^2`.
4.  **Calculate the square of 0.2:** `(0.2)^2` means 0.2 multiplied by 0.2, which equals 0.04.
5.  **Calculate the reciprocal:** Now we need to calculate `1 / 0.04`. This division is equivalent to `1 / (4/100)`, which simplifies to `1 * (100/4)`, resulting in 25. So, `(.2)^(-2)` evaluates to 25.
6.  **Understand the outer operation:** The expression has `sqrt()` applied to the result of step 5. The square root operation finds the number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the number inside the radical.
7.  **Calculate the square root:** We need to calculate the square root of 25. The principal (positive) square root of 25 is 5, because 5 * 5 = 25.
8.  **Verify the result:** The evaluation of the expression `sqrt( (.2)^(-2) )` results in 5, which is the target number. The expression uses exactly two '2's and standard mathematical symbols.",True

Rex then tells Ralph his number.
What did Rex say?
(See the hint for an explanation of the terminology.)
 Solution: 416723
Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:

Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.","The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number. The digital sum of 247 is 2+4+7 = 13.

Rotating 123456 one to the left gives 234561;

1.  Analyze the sum of the six numbers formed by rotating and swapping the digits of the original 6-digit number. Observe that each column in the summation contains all six distinct digits of the number. This means the sum of the digits in each column is equal to the digital sum of the original number.
2.  Recognize that if the digital sum is represented as a two-digit number `XY`, the sum of the six configurations will have a structure related to summing `XXXXXX` and `YYYYYY`. The condition that the first and last digits of this total sum match the digits X and Y (in some order) implies that the sum of X and Y must be less than 10 (i.e., X + Y < 10), preventing a carry-over to the leftmost column from the second column.
3.  Determine the possible values for the digital sum (`XY`). It must be between the minimum (0+1+2+3+4+5=15) and maximum (9+8+7+6+5+4=39) possible digital sums for a 6-digit number with distinct digits. Furthermore, the digital sum `XY` must be a prime number in this range and its digits X and Y must satisfy the condition X + Y < 10 (from Step 2). Identify the prime numbers between 15 and 39 (17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37) and filter them based on X + Y < 10 (eliminating 19, 29, 37). This leaves 17, 23, and 31 as possible digital sums.
4.  Use the clue that the digital sum (`XY`) matches the number formed by the last two digits of the number. So the last two digits must be 17, 23, or 31. Also use the clue that the sum of the first two digits equals the sum of the last two digits (which is X + Y from the digital sum `XY`). Test the possible last two digits (17, 23, 31) against the remaining conditions:
    *   If the last two digits are 31 (digital sum 31, X+Y=4), the first two digits must sum to 4. The only remaining digits that sum to 4 are 0 and 4. Neither 04 nor 40 is a two-digit prime, eliminating 31.
    *   If the last two digits are 17 (digital sum 17, X+Y=8), the first two digits must sum to 8. Possible remaining digit pairs summing to 8 are (0,8), (2,6), (3,5). Only 53 is a prime number formed by these pairs. If the first two digits are 53 and last two are 17, the sum of these four digits is 5+3+1+7=16. Since the total digital sum must be 17, the middle two digits must sum to 1. The only pair of distinct digits summing to 1 is 0 and 1, but 1 is already used. This eliminates 17.
    *   If the last two digits are 23 (digital sum 23, X+Y=5), the first two digits must sum to 5. Possible remaining digit pairs summing to 5 are (0,5), (1,4). Only 41 is a prime number formed by these pairs (05 is not a 6-digit number start). This confirms the digital sum is 23, the last two digits are 23, and the first two digits are 41.
5.  Determine the middle two digits. The total digital sum is 23. The sum of the first two digits (4+1=5) and the last two digits (2+3=5) is 10. Therefore, the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - 10 = 13. Identify the remaining available digits and the pairs that sum to 13: (5,8) and (6,7).
6.  Apply the condition that the numbers formed by the digit pairs must be prime. The pairs (5,8) form 58 or 85 (neither prime). The pair (6,7) forms 67 (prime) or 76 (not prime). This confirms the middle two digits are 67.
7.  Assemble the number using the identified digit pairs: first two are 41, middle two are 67, last two are 23. The number is 416723. Verify that all conditions in the problem statement (distinct digits, digital sum matches last two digits, sum of first two matches sum of last two, digit pairs are prime, first and last digits of the specific sum match last two digits of the number) are met by 416723.",True
6,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?
 Solution: 2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GeminiFlash,solutionSummary,"Okay, here is a summary of the solution to the problem, broken down into simple, logical steps:

**Problem:** Determine the square footage of a two-story regular polygon house on a circular foundation within a larger regular polygon property, given specific geometric relationships and the total fence length.

**Solution Summary:**

1.  **Identify Key Relationships:** The house is a regular polygon inscribed in a circular foundation. The property is a similar regular polygon circumscribed around a larger circle. The distance from the foundation edge to the property edge is equal to the foundation diameter, meaning the radius of the circle circumscribing the property is three times the radius of the circle inscribing the house (the foundation). The pipe length, which bisects the area of the house polygon from edge to edge, is equal to the length of one side of the property polygon.
2.  **Recognize the Constraint on the Number of Sides:** The core challenge is finding the number of sides ('n') of the regular polygons. The fact that a line segment (the pipe) equal to the property's side length *also* bisects the area of the house polygon provides a crucial constraint. For a given number of sides 'n', there is a range of possible lengths for area-bisecting chords within the inscribed house polygon. The property side length must fall within this range when scaled correctly based on the radius relationship (property radius = 3 * house radius).
3.  **Find the Number of Sides (n):** By setting up an inequality using the geometric relationships from steps 1 and 2, expressing the property's side length and the house polygon's bisector lengths in terms of 'n' and the radii, it is determined that only one integer value for 'n' satisfies the condition. The calculation shows that n must be 10. Rex knew this information was sufficient because 'n' could be uniquely determined.
4.  **Calculate the Actual Side Length:** Ralph fenced 400 feet. Since the property is a 10-sided polygon (decagon) and one side is the gate (made of the pipe), the fence covers the remaining 9 sides. Therefore, the length of one side of the property (and the pipe) is 400 feet / 9 sides.
5.  **Determine House Dimensions:** Using the actual side length of the property (from step 4) and the fact that it's a decagon (n=10) circumscribed around a circle, the radius of that circle can be calculated. The radius of the house foundation (the circle inscribing the house decagon) is one-third of this value (from step 1). With the house's radius and n=10, the apothem and side length of the house decagon can be calculated using standard regular polygon formulas.
6.  **Calculate the House Polygon Area:** The area of the 10-sided house polygon (decagon) is calculated using its apothem and side length (or radius), for instance, by summing the areas of the 10 triangles formed by connecting vertices to the center.
7.  **Calculate the Atrium Area:** The atrium's diameter is one-tenth of the property's longest measurement. The property's longest measurement is the diameter of the circle it is circumscribed around. Calculate this diameter (twice the property's circumscribing circle's radius). The atrium radius is one-tenth of this value divided by 2. Calculate the area of the circular atrium using its radius.
8.  **Calculate Total Square Footage:** The usable area on each floor is the area of the house polygon (step 6) minus the area of the atrium (step 7). Since the house has two stories, the total square footage is this usable area per floor multiplied by 2. This final calculation results in 2730 square feet.",True
7,"Question: Find the radius of the inscribed and circumscribed circles for a triangle.
 Solution: Let a, b, and c be the sides of the triangle. Let s be the semiperimeter, i.e. s = (a + b + c) / 2. Let A be the area of the triangle, and let x be the radius of the incircle.
Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.
We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).

1.  Define the necessary parameters of the triangle: its sides (a, b, c), its semiperimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2), and its area (A).
2.  Relate the area of the triangle (A) to the radius of the inscribed circle (x) and the semiperimeter (s) using the formula A = sx. This formula is derived by considering the triangle as composed of three smaller triangles with height equal to the inradius (x) and bases equal to the triangle's sides (a, b, c).
3.  Use Heron's formula to express the area (A) in terms of the sides and semiperimeter: A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)).
4.  Combine the formulas from step 2 and step 3 to find the radius of the inscribed circle (x) by solving for x: x = A/s, substituting the expression for A from Heron's formula to get x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).

8,"Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""
""The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.""
Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.
 Solution: The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.

Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GeminiFlash,solutionSummary,,True
9,"Question: There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?
 Solution: The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Here, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is 52.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",,"The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",GeminiFlash,solutionSummary,"SUMMARY:

The problem involves four mathematicians and two secret integers greater than 1. Brahma whispers the sum (S) to Sachin and the product (P) to Prashant. The numbers are deduced through a sequence of logical steps based on their conversation.

Here is the breakdown of the solution process:

1.  **Initial Information:** Brahma chooses two integers (X and Y), both greater than 1. Sachin knows S = X + Y, and Prashant knows P = X * Y. Nakul knows neither but hears the conversation.

2.  **Sachin's First Deduction:** Sachin states that he is sure that neither he nor Prashant knows the numbers *at this point*. Knowing the sum S, Sachin considers all possible pairs of integers (a, b) > 1 such that a + b = S. For each such pair, the product would be a*b. If *any* of these products a*b were such that only one pair (a,b) yields that product (e.g., if a and b were prime), then Prashant would know the numbers immediately from the product. Sachin's statement implies that for *every* pair (a, b) summing to S, the product a*b must have *multiple* factor pairs (c, d > 1) whose sums (c+d) are *also* plausible initial sums (sums for which Sachin could make his first statement). The provided solution simplifies this: Sachin's confidence implies that the sum S *cannot* be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Let's call this property ""Property S1"".

3.  **Prashant's Deduction:** Prashant, knowing P and having heard Sachin's statement (thus knowing the true sum S must have Property S1), states that he *now* knows the numbers. This means that among all pairs of integers (c, d) > 1 whose product is P, exactly *one* pair (x, y) has a sum (x+y) that satisfies Property S1 (i.e., is on the ""Possible Sum List"" derived from Step 2). This uniqueness allows Prashant to identify the correct pair (x, y) from the product P. Let's call this property ""Property P1"" for the product P.

4.  **Sachin's Second Deduction:** Sachin, knowing S and having heard Prashant's statement (thus knowing the true product P must have Property P1), states that he *now* also knows the numbers. This means that among all the pairs of integers (a, b) > 1 that sum to S, exactly *one* pair (x, y) has a product (x*y) that satisfies Property P1 (the product property from Step 3). Sachin can find this unique pair (x, y) by checking which of the products resulting from pairs summing to S is the one that would have allowed Prashant to deduce the numbers.

5.  **Nakul's Deduction:** Nakul hears the entire conversation and understands the logical sequence of deductions made by Sachin and Prashant based on Properties S1 and P1. By following the same logic, he can also uniquely identify the pair of numbers.

6.  **Finding the Numbers:** The solution demonstrates that the unique pair of integers greater than 1 that satisfies all these conditions is (4, 13).
    *   Their sum is 17, which satisfies Property S1 (17 is not the sum of two primes, allowing Sachin's first statement).
    *   Their product is 52. The pairs >1 multiplying to 52 are (2, 26) and (4, 13). 2+26=28, and 28 can be written as 5+23 (sum of two primes), so 28 does *not* satisfy Property S1. 4+13=17, which *does* satisfy Property S1. Since only (4,13) among the factor pairs of 52 has a sum satisfying Property S1, the product 52 satisfies Property P1, allowing Prashant to deduce the numbers.
    *   Sachin, knowing S=17, considers pairs (a,b) summing to 17: (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10), (8,9). Their products are 30, 42, 52, 60, 66, 70, 72. By checking which of these products satisfies Property P1 (Prashant's unique identification), Sachin finds that only the product 52 does (as shown above). Since S=17 leads to P=52 uniquely satisfying Property P1, Sachin knows the numbers must be the pair summing to 17 that yields a product of 52, which is (4, 13).

Thus, the numbers are 4 and 13, deduced through the specific logical properties implied by each step of the conversation.",True
10,"Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?
 Solution: First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts.

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The problem asks for a specific integer that meets three conditions: it must be an integer, it must *not* be a palindrome (read the same forwards and backward), and its cube (the number multiplied by itself three times) *must* be a palindrome. The problem states there is only *one* such non-palindromic integer.
2.  **Method of Finding:** Since the problem guarantees a unique answer with specific properties, the most direct way to find it is to test integers. This involves checking if an integer is non-palindromic and then calculating its cube to see if the cube is a palindrome. This process would continue until the number satisfying all conditions is found.
3.  **Identify the Solution:** The provided solution states that the number is 2201.
4.  **Verify the Solution's Properties:** Check if 2201 satisfies all the required conditions:
    *   Is 2201 an integer? Yes.
    *   Is 2201 non-palindromic? Yes, 2201 reads 1022 backward, so it's not a palindrome.
    *   Is the cube of 2201 a palindrome? Calculate 2201^3. As shown in the solution, 2201^3 = 10662526601. Check if 10662526601 is a palindrome. It reads the same forwards and backward, so it *is* a palindrome.
5.  **Confirm Uniqueness:** Since 2201 meets all the criteria, and the problem states that there is only *one* such non-palindromic integer, 2201 is confirmed as the unique solution. The process of finding it is implicitly a search that terminates at this number.",True
12,"Question: In ""4+4+4+4=1!"" it was shown that just using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can form all the numbers from 0 to 9 using exactly four 4's.

Now if you add the operations square root, factorial, and exponent, what is the first number counting up from zero that can't be formed? How can each number be formed?
You may use parentheses, but you may not combine fours to make 44 or 444.

13,"Question: Al and Ben are standing back to back next to a railroad track. When the front of a train passes them, Al starts to walk in the opposite direction of the train, while Ben starts to walk in the same direction as the train. Each stops walking when the back of the train passes him. If the two of them walk at the same speed, and Al walks exactly 30 feet, and Ben walks exactly 45 feet, how long is the train?
 Solution: The train is 180 feet long.
When the back of the train passes Al, he and Ben have both walked 30 feet, meaning Ben will walk 15 feet more when the train passes him. 30 feet that Al walks plus 45 feet that Ben walks makes 75 feet that the back of the train travels in the same time that Ben walks 15 feet, meaning the train is 5 times as fast as Al and Ben.
In the time it takes Al to walk 30 feet, the front of the train moves 150 feet. This distance plus the 30 feet that Al has walked equals 180 feet.",,"The train is 180 feet long.

In the time it takes Al to walk 30 feet, the front of the train moves 150 feet. This distance plus the 30 feet that Al has walked equals 180 feet.",GeminiFlash,solutionSummary,"Here is a summary of the solution with the reasoning separated into simple steps:

1.  Define the variables: Let L be the length of the train, V be the speed of the train, and v be the walking speed of Al and Ben.
2.  Recognize that Al walks 30 feet *away* from the train's direction in the time it takes the train's back to pass him. Ben walks 45 feet *in the same direction* as the train in the time it takes the train's back to pass him.
3.  Formulate equations based on relative speed and time. When Al walks away, the relative speed of the train's back approaching him is V + v. The time Al walks is 30/v. The distance the train's back covers relative to Al is L. So, L = (V + v) * (30/v). When Ben walks in the same direction, the relative speed of the train's back approaching him is V - v. The time Ben walks is 45/v. The distance the train's back covers relative to Ben is L. So, L = (V - v) * (45/v).
4.  Equate the two expressions for L: (V + v) * (30/v) = (V - v) * (45/v). Simplify this equation by multiplying by v and dividing by 15: 2(V + v) = 3(V - v).
5.  Solve the simplified equation for the relationship between V and v: 2V + 2v = 3V - 3v. This gives V = 5v, meaning the train is 5 times faster than Al and Ben. This matches the conclusion in the provided solution.
6.  Consider Al's motion again. Al walks 30 feet. The time he walks is t = 30/v. In this same time t, the front of the train (which started at the same point as Al) travels a distance D = V * t.
7.  Substitute the relationship V = 5v and the time t = 30/v into the distance formula for the train: D = (5v) * (30/v) = 5 * 30 = 150 feet. This means the front of the train has moved 150 feet from the starting point by the time Al stops.
8.  Visualize the situation when Al stops: Al is 30 feet from the starting point (walking away from the train's initial direction), and the back of the train is exactly where Al is. The front of the train is 150 feet from the starting point. The length of the train (L) is the distance between its front and its back.
9.  Since the front of the train is 150 feet from the start, and the back of the train is at Al's position (-30 feet from the start in the opposite direction, or 30 feet from the start in Al's walking direction), the length of the train is the distance the front moved plus the distance Al moved: L = 150 feet + 30 feet.
10. Calculate the train's length: L = 150 + 30 = 180 feet. This matches the final calculation in the provided solution.",True
14,"Question: This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?
 Solution: A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11

15,"Question: I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?
 Solution: Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",,"Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.

If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GeminiFlash,solutionSummary,"Okay, here is a summary of the solution to the problem, broken down into simple steps:

1.  **Define Variables and Initial Relationships:**
    *   Let `x` be Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy (the age difference between Mum and Tommy).
    *   Let `y` be Tommy's age when Tony was born (the age difference between Tommy and Tony).
    *   Let `z` be Mum's age when Tony was born (the age difference between Mum and Tony).
    *   From the age differences, since Tommy is older than Tony, the difference between Mum and Tony's ages must be the sum of the difference between Mum and Tommy's ages and the difference between Tommy and Tony's ages. This gives the relationship: `z = x + y`.

2.  **Derive Equations from Clues:**
    *   The clue about Mum turning 50 states that when Mum is 50, Tony's age will be `x`.
    *   The number of years until Mum turns 50 is `50 - Mum_now`.
    *   Tony's age then will be `Tony_now + (50 - Mum_now)`.
    *   We know `Tony_now = Mum_now - z`. Substituting this gives Tony's future age as `(Mum_now - z) + (50 - Mum_now) = 50 - z`.
    *   Setting this equal to `x` (from the clue) gives the equation: `50 - z = x`, or `x + z = 50`.
    *   Combine this with the relationship `z = x + y` (or `x = z - y`) from Step 1. Substituting `x = z - y` into `x + z = 50` gives `(z - y) + z = 50`, which simplifies to `2z - y = 50`, or `2z = 50 + y`.

3.  **Find Possible Ages when Tony was Born:**
    *   From the clue about when Tony was born, Mum's age was `z`, and Tommy's age was `y`.
    *   Also, `y` must be a factor of `z` (since Tommy's age was a factor of Mum's age).
    *   We use the equation `2z = 50 + y` and the condition that `y` is a factor of `z` to find possible pairs of `(z, y)`. Testing possible values, the only integer solutions where `y` is a positive factor of `z` are `(z=26, y=2)` and `(z=30, y=10)`.

4.  **Use the ""Factors of Mum's Age"" Clue to Select the Correct Pair:**
    *   The clue states that when Tony was born, the ages of Timmy, Tracey, Tommy, and Tammy were *all* factors of Mum's age (`z`). This was one of only two times when *more than two* children's ages were factors of Mum's age.
    *   In case 1: `z=26` (Mum was 26), `y=2` (Tommy was 2). The factors of 26 less than 2 are just 1. The ages of Timmy, Tammy, and Tracey must be distinct factors of 26 less than Tommy's age (2), which is impossible as only age 1 fits, and they need three distinct ages.
    *   In case 2: `z=30` (Mum was 30), `y=10` (Tommy was 10). The factors of 30 less than 10 are {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}. We need three distinct ages for Timmy, Tammy, and Tracey from this set such that Timmy > Tammy > Tracey, which is possible (e.g., 6, 5, 3). This case fits the criteria of having four children's ages (10, plus three from {1,2,3,5,6}) being factors of Mum's age (30).
    *   Therefore, Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born (`z=30`, `y=10`). The ages of Timmy, Tammy, and Tracey when Tony was born must be three distinct numbers from {1, 2, 3, 5, 6} in decreasing order.

5.  **Use Tammy's Current Age Clue to Determine Timmy's Age When Tony was Born:**
    *   Tammy's current age is three times Timmy's age when Tony was born.
    *   The possible ages for Timmy when Tony was born are the largest of the possible sets of three distinct ages from {1, 2, 3, 5, 6} ordered decreasingly. Possible Timmy ages are 6, 5, or 3.
    *   This means Tammy's current age must be 3 * 6 = 18, 3 * 5 = 15, or 3 * 3 = 9.

6.  **Use the ""Second Special Year"" Clue to Find Tammy's Current Age:**
    *   The other year where more than two children's ages were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as Tammy is *now*.
    *   Test the possible current ages for Tammy from Step 5:
        *   If Tammy is 15 or 9, Tracey's age in the second year would be 7.5 or 4.5 respectively, which are not whole years. This is impossible.
        *   If Tammy is 18, Tracey's age in the second year was 18 / 2 = 9. This is a whole year, so this is the correct age.
    *   Therefore, Tammy's current age is 18.

7.  **Determine All Ages When Tony was Born:**
    *   Since Tammy's current age is 18, and her age is 3 * (Timmy's age when Tony was born), Timmy's age when Tony was born must have been 18 / 3 = 6.
    *   We know Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born. Timmy was 6.
    *   The ages of Timmy, Tammy, and Tracey when Tony was born were distinct factors of 30 from {1, 2, 3, 5, 6} in decreasing order (Timmy > Tammy > Tracey). Since Timmy was 6, the only remaining factors are {1, 2, 3, 5}. The only distinct pair from this set less than 6, in decreasing order for Tammy and Tracey (Tammy > Tracey), is 5 and 3.
    *   So, when Tony was born: Mum=30, Tommy=10, Timmy=6, Tammy=5, Tracey=3, Tony=0. (Verify order: 10 > 6 > 5 > 3 > 0. Correct for Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony).

8.  **Calculate Current Ages:**
    *   Tammy was 5 when Tony was born and is 18 now. The time elapsed since Tony was born is 18 - 5 = 13 years.
    *   Add 13 years to everyone's age when Tony was born to find their current ages:
        *   Tony: 0 + 13 = 13
        *   Tracey: 3 + 13 = 16
        *   Tammy: 5 + 13 = 18
        *   Timmy: 6 + 13 = 19
        *   Tommy: 10 + 13 = 23
        *   Mum: 30 + 13 = 43

9.  **Verify with the ""Second Special Year"" Clue:**
    *   The second special year is when Tracey was 9. Since Tracey was 3 when Tony was born, this was 9 - 3 = 6 years after Tony was born.
    *   In that year (6 years after Tony was born): Mum was 30+6=36. The children's ages were Tony=0+6=6, Tracey=3+6=9, Tammy=5+6=11, Timmy=6+6=12, Tommy=10+6=16.
    *   Mum's age was 36. The children's ages were {6, 9, 11, 12, 16}. The factors of 36 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36}.
    *   Children's ages that are factors of 36: 6 (Tony), 9 (Tracey), 12 (Timmy). This is 3 ages, which is ""more than two"". This confirms the ages and the timing of the second special year fit the clue.

10. **State the Final Ages:** The calculated current ages are: Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13, and Mum is 43.",True
16,"Question: The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?
 Solution: Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.

1.  **Understand the core rule:** The problem states that at the time of each daughter's wedding, her age was equal to the sum of the digits of her three sisters' ages at that exact time. This rule must hold for four different weddings occurring in consecutive years.
2.  **Utilize the modulo 9 property:** A key mathematical property is that any positive integer is congruent to the sum of its digits modulo 9 (i.e., `n ≡ sum_of_digits(n) (mod 9)`). This means the wedding condition `Bride's Age = Sum of Sisters' Digit Sums` implies `Bride's Age ≡ Sum of Sisters' Ages (mod 9)`.
3.  **Formulate a system of congruences:** Let the current ages of the four sisters be a, b, c, and d. Based on the wedding timeline (Alice 3 years ago, Barbara 2 years ago, Cheryl 1 year ago, Denise now) and the modulo 9 property from Step 2, set up a system of four linear congruences. For example, for Denise's wedding now: `d ≡ a + b + c (mod 9)`. For Alice's wedding 3 years ago (ages a-3, b-3, c-3, d-3): `a-3 ≡ (b-3) + (c-3) + (d-3) (mod 9)`.
4.  **Solve the modular system:** Solve the system of linear congruences derived in Step 3. This yields the value of each sister's age modulo 9: a ≡ 0, b ≡ 1, c ≡ 2, d ≡ 3 (all modulo 9). This significantly narrows down the possible integer values for their ages.
5.  **Determine the specific ages:** Use the modular constraints from Step 4, the original digit sum rule, and the fact that the weddings occurred in consecutive years (which gives the relative ages of the sisters at each wedding) to find the specific integer ages. By checking possible ages that fit the modular results and satisfy the digit-sum condition for each of the four wedding years, the unique set of ages is found through logical deduction and checking consistency across the years.
6.  **State the final ages:** The ages that satisfy all the given conditions are Alice 27, Barbara 28, Cheryl 20, and Denise 21.",True
